12505,in this study electro oxidation of representative antibiotics of five different classes viz sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole penicillin ampicillin tetracycline tetracycline aminoglycoside streptomycin macrolide erythromycin and the mixture of representative antibiotics by ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode were studied ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode was synthesized and characterized by sem edax xrd cv and lsv analysis the physical characterization revealed the compact nature of the pbo2 crystals composition and crystal arrangement in β planes further cv and lsv confirmed the electrode stability under the operating condition with high oxygen evolution potential the in situ generated reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide and sulfate radicals were quantified sulfamethoxazole was used as a model antibiotic to study the effect of current density 10 40 ma cm 2 initial concentration 100 1000 μg l 1 and water matrix 25 mm sodium sulfate and secondary effluent the kinetic constants were determined by adopting a non linear regression model and curve fitting the optimum current density was 30 ma cm 2 with k 1 0 4162 min 1 under the optimum conditions degradation of antibiotics was 99 irrespective of the antibiotic class the intermediates were identified by lc ms ms analysis and a complete electro oxidation pathway was proposed for five antibiotics of different classes the toxicity of the representative antibiotics and mixture was evaluated by v fischeri bioluminescence inhibition overall the toxicity was found to decrease and extending the treatment time ensures effective eco toxicity reduction by allowing safe discharge of the treated water the observed results confirm that the electro oxidation with ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode is an effective and a low cost alternative for bdd graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electro oxidation antibiotics reactive oxygen species degradation eco toxicity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in humans and animals to treat prevent various bacterial infections antibiotics are considered as one of the emerging contaminants anywhere between 5 and 90 of consumed antibiotics are excreted via feces and urine in either unmetabolized or partially metabolized forms the excreted antibiotics reach the wastewater treatment plant wwtp which bridges the wastewater generated and environment matrices 1 low concentration and recalcitrant nature make it difficult for conventional wastewater processes to eliminate antibiotics 2 the majority of wwtp discharge the treated effluent into water bodies which carry antibiotics in low concentrations 3 5 in addition pharmaceutical companies that manufacture antibiotics also pollute the environment with antibiotics and their derivatives at high concentrations 1 incidentally both treated wastewater and untreated wastewater introduce low concentration antibiotics into the environment 2 6 7 antibiotics released pose both health and environmental risks low concentration antibiotics and antibiotics at sub inhibitory levels induce resistance in the environmental microbial community infections by drug resistant microorganisms are difficult to treat and often lead to death due to treatment failure 1 at high concentrations antibiotics have also been reported to exhibit eco toxic effects 8 the primary producers algae and cyanobacteria fish duckweeds and crustaceans are reported to be antibiotic sensitive 9 therefore it becomes important to eliminate the antibiotics from treated effluents before discharging them into surface water and other environmental matrix advanced oxidation processes aop are effective for the removal of emerging contaminants such as antibiotics which is promising for effective wastewater treatment 10 in an aop process the organic pollutants are oxidized into carbon dioxide water and mineral acid electro oxidation process eop is one such efficient process for effective antibiotics removal in eop the anode plays a very important role and reactive oxygen species ros generated on the anode participate in the mineralization of pollutants anode can be briefly classified into active and non active anode the non active anodes aid in complete mineralization whereas active anodes participate in the selective conversion of pollutants 10 non active anodes such as lead oxide pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are good conductors and promote ros generation as these electrodes are poor catalysts for oxygen evolution 11 the anode plays a major role in the electro oxidation process and the most widely studied anode is the bdd bdd has a wide potential window high oxygen over potential high mineralization potential corrosion stability and surface inertness 12 14 however the substrate material used for the synthesis of bdd films such as niobium tantalum and tungsten and the process of bdd film synthesis namely the chemical vapor deposition makes it an expensive process 10 the high cost of bdd electrodes restricts large scale wastewater treatment application despite the advantages 15 on the other hand non active lead oxide pbo2 electrodes are quite inexpensive highly effective inert has a wide potential window and exhibit high oxygen evolution overpotential 16 18 the pbo2 anode synthesized on titanium substrate is corrosive resistant and cost effective which makes it a good alternative for bdd and large scale application 18 to overcome the internal stress and avoid passivation the ti substrate is coated with an intermediate layer the most common being the sb sno2 layer sno2 is a semiconductor and has low conductivity at room temperature with a band gap energy of 3 5 ev doping of sno2 with dopants such as ar b bi f cl p and sb increases the conductivity doping with sb is reported to increase the oep to 1 9 v making this a good candidate for the anodic oxidation of pollutants 19 sb sno2 decreases the internal stress prevents deformation of the pbo2 coating and improves the current efficiency and electrode stability 20 moreover the oep of sb sno2 1 9 v is the same as the pbo2 electrode 19 therefore the intermediate layer will not modify the oep or the efficiency of the pbo2 anode to further improve the stability oxidation potential electrocatalytic performance and current efficiency of the pbo2 active layer pbo2 is often modified by adding dopants such as transition metals rare earth metals or non metals 19 21 for instance ti sno2 sb pbo2 go ce prepared by fu et al exhibited enhanced electrode stability and electrocatalytic performance for phenol removal 22 the most commonly investigated antibiotics for electro oxidation removal are sulfamethoxazole 13 23 30 and ciprofloxacin 26 27 31 33 belonging to sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone group respectively however each class of antibiotics varies structurally which affects not only their prevalence and persistence but kinetics degradation transformation products and toxicity therefore for this study representative antibiotics belonging to five different classes viz sulfonamide penicillin tetracycline aminoglycoside and macrolide are chosen table 1 sulfamethoxazole is used as the model antibiotic for current density optimization while degradation of the rest of the antibiotics is performed at optimized conditions the majority of antibiotics unlike other organic pollutants are reported in low concentrations parts per billion and parts per trillion in wastewater effluents 34 35 more often a mixture of antibiotics rather than a single antibiotic is reported in wastewater 1 therefore it is important that the lab scale studies investigate the removal of individual antibiotics and antibiotics mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations in addition a study on the electro oxidation of five antibiotics of different classes using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode and eco toxicity evaluation is not reported in the literature in this context the objectives of this study are i to synthesize characterize and optimize the ti sb sno2 pbo2 for antibiotics removal at low initial concentrations ppb using sulfamethoxazole as a model antibiotic ii to study the effect of initial antibiotic concentration the effect of current density and water matrices on antibiotics degradation iii to study the degradation kinetics of the representative antibiotics and antibiotics mixture at optimized conditions iv to identify the intermediates and propose degradation pathway v to evaluate the toxicity of the electrolysed samples 2 materials and methodology 2 1 chemicals sodium sulfate tin iv chloride pentahydrate antimony iii chloride isopropanol lead nitrate sodium fluoride and nitric acid were purchased from merck india cerium iii sulfate octahydrate and disodium salt of terephthalic acid were purchased from alfa aesar india ceric sulfate was purchased

were of lc ms ms grade purchased from fischer chemicals 2 2 electrode preparation characterization and ros quantification methods of electrode preparation characterization and ros quantification are presented in the supplementary sections s1 s2 and s3 respectively 2 3 degradation experiment the degradation experiment was carried out in a single compartment cell ti sb sno2 pbo2 and a stainless electrode connected to an external power supply scientific psd3005 india with an active surface area of 3 2 cm2 on each side were used as anode and cathode respectively fig s1 the reaction volume was 150 ml of 25 mm of na2so4 electrolyte and magnetically stirred at rpm 150 20 the effects of operating parameters such as smx concentration 50 100 250 500 750 1000 μg l 1 applied current density 10 20 30 40 ma cm 2 and water matrices on smx degradation were studied all the experiments were conducted in triplicates and data points are expressed as average values standard deviation 2 4 antibiotic analysis samples were collected at specific time intervals and filtered using a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter nupore india the residual antibiotic concentration in the treated samples after filtration was analyzed in a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry system shimadzu lcms 8040 the system was equipped with a c18 column shim pack giss with particles of 5 μm size and dimensions 250 4 6 mm internal diameter for separation the injection volume was 20 μl the flow rate was fixed at 0 5 ml min 1 ms ms was operated in esi positive ionization mode the parameters for lc ms ms analysis of each antibiotic are presented in table s1 validation of the analytical method was done by determining linearity accuracy limit of quantification loq and limit of detection lod all the calibration graphs were linear with r2 0 99 mass spectra of the intermediates were obtained by scanning from m z 50 to 1000 the m z were either compared with the existing literature or new structures were predicted based on the m z values of the precursor ion scan chemdraw version 8 0 was used to draw the predicted structures 2 5 determination of kinetic constants a non linear regression model was adopted to fit the degradation curves the solver function excel 2011 mso was used to fit the removal of all antibiotics with time in the logistic equation eq 1 to calculate the kinetics constants for antibiotic removal 79 to fit the removal kinetics the least square method was employed the sum of the difference between the observed and predicted value squares was the objective function and k obs was the variable the obtained kinetic constant values were used to compare the removal of smx and other antibiotics at various operating conditions 1 c t c 0 2 1 e k obs t where c 0 and c t are the initial antibiotic concentration μg l 1 and antibiotic concentration μg l 1 at time t respectively k x is the fitted rate constant for antibiotic removal and t is time min 2 6 toxicity analysis synthetic water samples collected at specific time intervals and treated wastewater samples were subjected to acute toxicity assay in a micro toxicity analyzer microtox m500 usa the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri are highly sensitive to toxic compounds bacteria when exposed to toxic compounds die resulting in the reduction of luminescence intensity a basic screening test 45 was performed at 15 c for treated samples collected at specific time intervals and a change in luminescence intensity of the sample isample was measured after incubating for 5 15 and 30 min eq 2 was used to calculate the percentage inhibition i of v fischeri while the luminescence intensity of 25 mm na2so4 was used as the blank iblank 2 percentage inhibition 1 i sample i blank 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized pbo2 electrode 3 1 1 morphology and composition figs s2a and b show the scanning electron micrographs sem of the ti substrate before and after sandblasting it can be seen that sandblasting has created roughness on the ti substrate the rough surface enables effective adhesion and deposition of the oxide layers and increases the service life of the electrode as a whole 36 fig s2c shows the sem of the freshly synthesized pbo2 electrode the freshly coated pbo2 surface is compact uniform and non porous with a typical pyramidal shape crystal as previously reported 11 37 small size crystals provide a more active surface area for ros generation and electro oxidation of pollutants 36 edax was carried out to confirm the composition of the synthesized electrode fig s2d shows the edax of the freshly prepared pbo2 electrode it could be seen that the electrode is primarily composed of lead oxygen and fluorine which is in agreement with the synthesis method fluorine is the dopant used to increase the stability and electrocatalytic performance of the anode 3 1 2 xrd analysis fig s2e shows the xrd pattern of the pbo2 layer of the ti sb sno2 pbo2 electrode major diffraction peaks at 2θ 25 28 31 93 36 07 48 85 and 52 assigned to the 110 011 020 221 and 220 of β pbo2 planes respectively were observed apart from the major diffraction peaks corresponding to β pbo2 planes peaks at 2θ 53 83 58 71 60 43 62 29 66 7 74 24 76 78 and 78 37 were also observed these peaks correspond to 002 130 112 031 022 231 040 and 222 planes of β pbo2 respectively the peaks corresponding to β pbo2 planes reported are consistent with the previous reports 11 37 39 β pbo2 is majorly formed when pbo2 is electrochemically deposited in acid solutions 40 which is consistent with the electrode synthesis method 3 1 3 lsv and cv analysis fig s2f and g represents the lsv and cv of ti sb sno2 pbo2 in 25 mm na2so4 at scan rates of 20 50 and 100 mv s 1 the oep of β pbo2 was observed at 1 6 1 9 v vs ag agcl while the standard oxygen reduction potential is e 1 23 v fig s2f electrode with high oep than the standard oxygen reduction potential has increased pollutant degradation efficiency due to suppression of side reactions which is o2 evolution with respect to the electro oxidation process 41 electrodes with high oep value favor more ros generation 36 oxidation peaks can be seen at potential 1 23 in both lsv and cv plots which corresponds to the conversion of pb ii to pb iv for oxidation peaks in the cv plots fig s2g corresponding reduction peaks were also observed which indicates the reversible splitting of the molecule and stability of the ti sb sno2 pbo2 electrode under operating conditions 42 in addition to oxidation reduction peaks in cv plots an increase in the curve area with an increase in applied potential was also observed this indicates that the electrochemical reaction in a na2so4 system with ti sb sno2 pbo2 is applied current or potential controlled a high current response between 1 23 and 1 9 v promotes water splitting and generation of oh radicals which in turn promotes effective electro oxidation of pollutants 43 3 2 ros quantification in a chlorine free media the most common ros responsible for pollutant oxidation is oh radical apart from o3 and h2o2 in situ generated oh radicals are non selective oxidants and react with any substrate at the rate of 109 m s 1 44 45 oh radicals have a high oxidation potential 1 8 v in neutral solutions 46 oh radicals are clean oxidants with a half life of 10 9 s 44 and are considered environment friendly 47 therefore oh radicals were quantified fig s2h shows a linear increase in oh radical concentration at different applied current densities with time the higher the applied current density the more is the oh radical generation however both h2o2 and so4 radicals were not generated in the ti sb sno2 pbo2 na2so4 system a detailed explanation for the same is available in 48 when the rate of oh radical generation is compared between 30 ma cm 2 k 0 0603 mm min 1 and 40 ma cm 2 k 0 0606 mm min 1 the rate is fairly equal whereas the rate of generation between 10 ma cm 2 k 0 046 mm min 1 20 ma cm 2 k 0 0493 mm min 1 and 30 ma cm 2 k 0 0603 mm min 1 the difference is significant this could be due to competing side reactions resulting in rapid oxidation of oh radical to oxygen at the anode at a higher applied current density therefore it is important to optimize current density for effective removal of pollutants in a chlorine free media 3 3 effect of applied current density initial antibiotics concentration and water matrix on antibiotics degradation 3 3 1 effect of applied current density fig 1 a presents the effect of applied current density on sulfamethoxazole smx removal with time smx removal of initial concentration 1000 μg l 1 after 10 min of electrolysis was 99 55 99 12 96 71 and 50 66 at applied current densities 40 30 20 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively for 1000 μg l 1 smx initial concentration the degradation was complete in 12 min for applied current densities 30 and 40 ma cm 2 while it took 24 min at applied current density 10 ma cm 2 for complete smx removal it is evident that the degree of antibiotics mineralization increased with applied current density 14 therefore it is safe to assume that the eop with ti sb sno2 pbo2 enables complete removal of sxm after 12 min electrolysis at applied current density 30 and 40 ma cm 2 on the contrary de amorim et al observed complete smx removal in 3 h in a bdd na2so4 100 mm system at optimized conditions viz 36 ma cm 2 and ph 5 23 it is worth noting that the electrode used in this study showed better performance at low electrolyte concentration 25 mm na2so4 neutral ph and low applied current density 30 ma cm 2 compared to the reported study the smx removal rate constants k 1 increased from 0 1219 min 1 to 0 4131 min 1 when the applied current density was increased from 10 to 40 ma cm 2 for initial smx concentration 1000 μg l 1 fig 1b this tendency of variation in reaction rate constants and degradation rate could be attributed to oh radical generation fig s2h degradation of smx could be directly correlated to oh radical concentration 49 applied current density plays an important role in electron transfer oh radical generation oxygen generation and mineralization of smx therefore the applied current density should be optimum for the effective degradation of antibiotics and to eliminate side reactions 36 50 it is worth noting that the kinetic rate constants and removal rate of applied current densities 30 ma cm 2 0 4162 min 1 and 40 ma cm 2 0 4131 min 1 are not significantly different therefore 30 ma cm 2 was considered as optimum current density and employed in subsequent experiments 3 3 2 effect of initial smx concentration the percentage removal of smx at applied current density 30 ma cm 2 was 92 64 85 39 28 38 53 33 47 68 and 30 85 for initial concentrations 50 100 250 500 750 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively after 2 min of electrolysis fig 1c the rate constant k 2 value for smx degradation increased from 0 3324 min 1 to 1 6326 min 1 with smx concentration decreasing from 1000 to 50 μg l 1 fig 1d clearly percentage removal is high for low initial smx concentration and high applied current density at high applied current density the oh radical generated is more fig s2h therefore for low smx concentration sufficient oh radicals are available for effective smx oxidation at high applied current density as for high initial smx concentration more intermediates could be generated during the degradation of smx loos et al also observed removal of only 72 9 of smx at high concentration in 180 min of electrolysis using bdd anode 29 the intermediates generated during electrolysis compete for oh radicals reducing the mineralization efficiency of the parent compound smx 51 52 one can predict the degradation rate and rate constants k 2 from the equation k 2 1 623 e 0 002x provided the initial concentration smx x lies between 50 and 1000 μg l 1 3 3 3 effect of water matrix to understand the effect of the water matrix on smx degradation the electrolyte 25 mm na2so4 was replaced with secondary effluent the secondary effluent was collected from the iit madras sewage treatment plant in chennai tn india the secondary effluent was free of background smx therefore it was spiked with 1000 ppb of smx table 2 presents the wastewater characteristics before and after electrolysis smx degradation experiment was carried out at an applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 for 12 min fig 1e represents the degradation of smx in synthetic wastewater sww and real wastewater rww rww unlike sww contains organic and inorganic compounds in addition to smx therefore extended time for smx removal in rww can be expected since other organic compounds could compete with smx for the generated ros however smx removal was achieved in 12 min in rww with a rate constant k rww 0 7937 min 1 while smx removal in sww was observed with a rate constant k sww 0 3324 min 1 lin et al also observed enhanced smx removal in lake water compared to removal in synthetic wastewater in ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 naclo4 system 28 enhanced smx removal rate in rww when compared to sww could be due to the presence of co ions such as so4 cl and no3 in wastewater 49 lan et al also observed enhanced smx removal while using bdd in hospital wastewater due to the presence of co ions such as sulfate and chlorides 26 27 the presence of co ions could contribute to additional ros such as chlorate chlorite hypochlorite perchlorate and sulfate radicals generation in addition to oh radical during electrolysis 19 interestingly the treated wastewater showed no luminosity inhibition of v fischeri despite the presence of chloride ions indicating no visible or quantifiable toxicity in the electrolysed rww 3 3 4 degradation of individual and mixture of antibiotics 3 3 4 1 degradation of ampicillin tetracycline streptomycin and erythromycin fig 1f i represents the removal of different classes of antibiotics evaluated at different initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 ppb and applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 removal of ampicillin amp at 8 min was 97 57 94 32 and 91 85 for initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively fig 1f the corresponding rate constants are 0 7470 0 3999 and 0 3796 min 1 respectively it could be seen that k amp doubled 0 7470 min 1 when the initial concentration was decreased from 1000 to 100 ppb in the case of streptomycin str the removal in 2 min of electrolysis was 90 05 90 01 and 86 54 for 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively fig 1g the rate constant values k str were 1 4995 min 1 for 100 ppb 1 4727 min 1 for 500 ppb and 1 2783 min 1 for 1000 ppb it was observed that the removal rate increased from 1 2783 min 1 to 1 4727 min 1 while removal of erythromycin ery was observed to be 96 19 88 98 and 87 86 in 2 min of electrolysis with rates k ery at 1 9709 1 4149 and 1 3710 min 1 for 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively fig 1h low removal rate of amp str and ery at high concentration like smx can be attributed to one of the two reasons likely generation of more intermediates is a common phenomenon when a high initial antibiotic concentration is electrolysed the intermediates could competitively compete with the parent antibiotic compound for ros resulting in a slow degradation rate of the latter small k at high concentration could also be attributed to the concentration gradient resulting in overcrowding of the active sites on the anode by the intermediates and pollutants which reduces the degradation rate 53 the high removal rate at low initial antibiotic concentration could be attributed to the abundance of oh radical available for interaction with the parent and intermediate compound under the same operating conditions 36 tetracycline tc removal percentage did not follow a similar trend as smx amp str and ery but the rate of tc removal was observed to follow the same trend as the other antibiotics and observed to be 97 19 99 31 and 99 80 for initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively in 6 min of electrolysis fig 1i interestingly the k tc values were 1 7935 1 6167 and 0 8965 min 1 for 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively the observed difference in tc removal compared to the other antibiotic groups could be attributed to the structure of tc unlike amp tc encompasses four benzene rings in its structure ros such as oh radical prefer electron rich regions and double bonds in benzene for interaction at high concentrations the chances of an unmodified parent tc molecule interacting with oh radical is high resulting in high removal percentage whereas at low initial concentration the interaction of unmodified tc with ros is relatively low in other words ros modified tc could compete with unmodified tc molecules for oh radicals resulting in low removal percentage 3 3 4 2 degradation of antibiotics mixture combined removal of antibiotics mixture viz smx amp tc str and ery each at a concentration 1000 ppb were electrolysed at 30 ma cm 2 and the rate constants were determined the individual removal of each antibiotic in the mixture was observed to be 76 38 77 45 98 21 99 35 and 99 68 for smx amp tc str and ery respectively fig 1j whereas the overall removal of the mixture was 99 84 in 12 min of electrolysis the corresponding rate constants are k smx 0 5547 min 1 k amp 0 4957 min 1 k tc 1 1147 min 1 k str 1 5212 min 1 and k ery 1 4812 min 1 respectively the observed removal rates for individual antibiotic in the mixture was significantly higher and much faster than the removal rate when the antibiotics were hydrolysed individually under the same operating conditions this could be attributed to the effective use of the ros generated during electro oxidation uniform concentration of the antibiotic mixture low mass transfer limitations the current efficiency of ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode structure and composition of the representative antibiotics 3 4 identification of intermediate products and elucidation of degradation mechanism lc ms ms mass spectrums were used to identify the transformation products tps generated during the electrochemical degradation of all the antibiotics carried out at an initial concentration of 1000 ppb and applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 complete mineralization of the antibiotics viz amp eq 3 tc eq 4 smx eq 5 str eq 6 and ery eq 7 will yield carbon dioxide co2 and inorganic sulfate so4 2 ammonia nh3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 ions 3 c 16 h 18 n 3 nao 4 s 41 h 2 o 16 co 2 3no 3 so 4 2 na 10 0h 10 0e 4 c 22 h 24 n 2 o 8 42 h 2 o 22 co 2 2no 3 10

were not detected in ion chromatography due to their low initial concentrations in a chlorine free media the major ros is oh radical the tps are produced due to random and non selective interactions of oh radicals with the antibiotics the tps are resulted due to hydroxylation oxidation deamination cleavage and desulfonation brought about by oh radicals fig 2 shows the proposed sulfamethoxazole degradation pathway 14 intermediates were identified which are presented in table s2 electro oxidation of smx can initiate any of the two degradation pathways viz pathway 1 smx and pathway 2 smx pathway 1 smx degradation of smx is initiated by hydroxylation which results in the formation of smx1 and smx21 smx22 of m z 283 and 269 respectively buxton et al suggested high reactivity of oh radicals with aniline 36 of the time oh radicals directly interact with nh2 group in the aniline structure in aqueous media which is consistent with smx1 formation 46 54 similarly reports suggest that oh radicals predominantly interact with the benzene ring 55 solar et al also suggested that about 54 of the time oh radicals interact at the ortho position to the nh2 group due to the electron donating nature of the nh2 group 54 therefore hydroxylation of smx would favor the production of more smx22 compared to smx21 h y kim et al suggested that smx21 is a minor product of hydroxylation while vidales et al suggested that smx22 is a significant intermediate at low current density 56 57 smx21 and smx22 undergo further oxidation to produce one of the three intermediates viz smx6 smx7 or smx9 smx6 undergoes further oxidation to produce smx4 whereas smx7 undergoes deamination to yield smx8 pathway 2 smx this pathway is initiated when oh radicals possibly interact with any of the four cleavage sites namely β γ δ and ε in the smx molecule 23 smx3 corresponding to m z 238 8 is consistent with β cleavage resulting in deamination of smx further γ cleavage of smx3 would result in smx11 smx13 and smx5 with m z 81 78 9 and 178 9 respectively while γ cleavage of the smx by oh radicals could produce aniline and smx5 however aniline was not observed in this study desulfonation of smx5 could also produce smx9 of m z value 98 9 δ cleavage of smx results in smx6 and smx7 with m z values 174 9 and 157 respectively in order for the smx6 to form an intermediate sulfanilamide must be formed which further undergoes deamination followed by oxidation or hydroxylation deamination of sulfanilamide would result in a 4 aminophenylsulfonyl structure 56 oxidation or hydroxylation of the 4 aminophenylsulfonyl structures yields smx6 further hydroxylation of smx6 will result in smx4 with m z 186 8 deamination of aniline arising from γ cleavage could also result in smx11 and smx13 similarly the deamination of smx7 could result in smx8 with m z 141 further the desulfonation of smx8 could also result in smx11 and smx13 oh radicals exhibit a high affinity for unsaturated double bonds in the benzene and isoxazole ring 46 therefore further oxidation of the intermediates results in the formation of acetic acid maleic acid malic acid oxalic acid oxamic acid glyoxilic acid and pyruvic acid 23 58 however oxamic acid smx10 glyoxilic acid smx12 and acetic acid smx14 were only observed in this study complete mineralization oxidation of these organic acids will produce co2 similarly oxidation or hydroxylation of nh2 and so2 groups followed by deamination and desulfonation will yield ammonia nh3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 ions the intermediates observed were consistent with the reported smx electrochemical degradation studies 23 57 58 fig 3 is the proposed ampicillin degradation pathways oxidative cleavage and hydroxylation of amp can lead to any of the four degradation pathways viz pathway 1 amp pathway 2 amp pathway 3 amp and pathway 4 amp with 17 intermediates molecular formula proposed structure and name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s3 pathway 1 amp oh radicals prefer electron rich regions interaction of oh radicals with amp results in the opening of β lactam ring resulting in the formation of 5r ampicillin penicilloic acid amp1 further oxidation of amp1 can either produce the intermediate pair amp2 amp8 due to disengagement of the benzene structure or opening of the β lactam ring resulting in amp9 ampicillin penicillenic acid decarboxylation of amp2 results in amp5 phenylmethanamine which on deamination results in amp7 phenol amp8 on the other hand undergoes oxidative cleavage resulting in the disengagement of the β lactam ring which yields amp15 amp15 on further oxidation yields amp17 which undergoes further mineralization the intermediate amp9 undergoes further oxidation to produce amp11 or amp12 amp11 5 r s ampicillin penicilloic acid and amp12 undergo further hydroxylation and oxidative cleavage results in amp2 and amp16 amp16 on deamination yields amp17 which is eventually mineralized pathway 2 amp hydroxylation at the β lactam ring results in oxidative cleavage of parent amp resulting in the generation of intermediates amp2 and amp3 amp2 further undergoes decarboxylation due to oxidative cleavage to produce amp5 amp5 on deamination results in amp7 which undergoes complete mineralization whereas amp3 undergoes hydroxylation and oxidation at the β lactam ring to generate amp10 subsequent oxidation of amp10 results in amp14 followed by amp17 which undergoes mineralization pathway 3 amp this pathway is initiated when hydroxylation resulting in oxidative cleavage occurs at the methylamine bond connecting the phenyl group and β lactam ring yielding the intermediates amp4 and amp5 amp4 on decarboxylation and hydroxylation yields amp13 amp13 on further oxidation and oxidative cleavage at the β lactam ring results in either amp15 or amp16 amp15 undergoes oxidation and cleavage to yield amp17 whereas amp16 undergoes deamination to yield amp17 on the other hand amp5 could undergo deamination followed by hydroxylation to amp7 further interaction of oh radicals with amp17 and amp5 result in ring opening and complete mineralization pathway 4 amp hydroxylation resulting in cleavage and disengagement of benzene ring and rest of the β lactam structure yielding amp6 and amp7 further interaction of oh radicals with amp7 results in ring opening and mineralization on the other hand amp6 undergoes deamination to yield amp4 which on further hydroxylation at the β lactam ring yields amp13 amp13 on further oxidation could yield either amp15 or amp16 which further undergoes mineralization as described in pathway 3 amp this is the first reported study on ampicillin degradation by eop using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode amp1 and amp11 have been previously observed during plasma treatment of ampicillin 59 60 whereas amp1 amp9 and amp11 were observed during the catalytic degradation process 61 intermediates such as amp2 amp3 amp6 amp7 and amp15 were observed during electro oxidation with hydrogen peroxide electro fenton and photo electro fenton process 62 fig 4 is the proposed degradation pathway for tetracycline tc when electrolysed could follow any of the three degradation pathways viz pathway 1 tc pathway 2 tc and pathway 3 tc while yielding 17 intermediates before complete mineralization molecular formula proposed structure and name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s4 pathway 1 tc hydroxylation of the first benzene ring in the tc structure initiates this pathway since oh radicals exhibit a high affinity for unsaturated bonds in the benzene structure in the tc yields tc1 63 tc1 undergoes further oxidation to produce a series of intermediates as a result of ring opening tc1 yields tc7 which on further oxidation could yield tc11 in two different pathways tc7 on decarboxylation yields tc8 which loses one of the benzene rings in its structure to produce tc11 otherwise tc7 can undergo simple hydroxylation to produce tc9 which undergoes decarboxylation to yield tc10 tc10 further loses one of the benzene rings as a result of ring opening and oxidation to yield tc11 or undergoes oxidative cleavage to yield tc13 2 methylbenzoic acid which undergoes further oxidation to yield tc17 oxalic acid on the other hand tc11 undergoes a series of oxidation reactions resulting in ring opening to yield tc12 tc12 either undergoes a series of oxidation to yield tc14 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 2 2 tetracarboxylic acid followed by tc17 tc12 can also undergo oxidative cleavage yielding tc15 2 3 dioxosuccinic acid followed by tc16 2 oxomalonic acid and tc17 which undergoes mineralization pathway 2 tc deamination of the side chain dimethylamine group of the tc1 compound initiates this pathway yielding tc2 and tc3 n n dimethylhydroxylamine tc2 undergoes a series of hydroxylation due to the interaction of oh radicals with the double bonds and amine group to yield tc6 63 which undergoes further deamination to yield tc8 tc8 loses a benzene ring due to ring opening and oxidation to yield tc11 tc11 undergoes further oxidation and follows the degradation pathway as described in pathway 1 tc pathway 3 tc simultaneous deamination and hydroxylation of the tc molecule yield tc4 and tc5 carbamic acid initiating this pathway tc4 on further deamination hydroxylation and oxidation yields tc7 tc7 follows one of the two degradation pathways as described in pathway 1 tc and undergoes complete mineralization on extending the electrolysis time this is the first reported study to identify intermediates and propose a tetracycline degradation pathway by eop using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode tc1 and tc6 have been previously observed during heterogeneous electro fenton treatment of tetracycline using cu doped fe fe2o3 63 whereas tc2 and tc13 were observed during electrochemical degradation using ti ta2o5 iro2 anode and photocatalytic degradation using ag modified g c3n4 64 65 tc4 was reportedly observed during the photodegradation of tetracycline using 3d io tio2 cds nanocomposite under visible light 66 tc3 tc6 tc7 tc11 tc12 tc14 t16 and tc17 are consistent with the previously reported electro oxidation using ti ti4o7 anode 67 fig 5 shows the proposed pathways of streptomycin degradation by the electro oxidation process interaction of oh radicals with str can initiate any of the two degradation pathways viz pathway 1 str and pathway 2 str while yielding 13 intermediates before complete mineralization the molecular formula proposed structure name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s5 pathway 1 str hydroxylation of the bond connecting sugar moiety to the 5 carbon ring results in oxidative cleavage of str yielding str1 and str2 n methyl l glucosamine str1 on further oxidation at the co yields str4 and str5 streptose str4 streptidine on hydroxylation yields str7 str7 undergoes further oxidation and deamination to yield str9 tetrahydro 2h pyran and str10 1 hydroxyguanidine str9 on further hydroxylation and cleavage yields str11 and str12 str10 undergoes further deamination to produce str13 n hydroxyformimidamide whereas str2 undergoes hydroxylation at the nc bond to yield str6 which on deamination and decarboxylation yields str8 str8 on further hydroxylation yields str9 which on further oxidation yields str11 pentane 1 5 diol and str12 hexane 1 6 diol str11 and str12 are further mineralized pathway 2 str hydroxylation of str1 could also initiate the second pathway yielding str3 and str4 streptidine str4 follows the same pathway as described in pathway 1 str str3 on the other hand undergoes oxidation to yield str2 n methyl l glucosamine and str5 streptose str2 follows the same pathway as described in pathway 1 str whereas further oxidation of str5 results in ring opening and mineralization this is the first reported study to identify intermediates and propose a streptomycin degradation pathway by eop removal using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode intermediate str4 has been previously observed during catalytic hydrolysis of str by ca mgo solid base 68 whereas str1 str2 str4 and str5 were previously reported during photolysis of streptomycin in aquatic environments 69 fig 6 represents the proposed degradation pathway for erythromycin degradation ery yields 13 intermediates during electrolysis and undergoes complete mineralization in any of the two proposed degradation pathways viz pathway 1 ery and pathway 2 ery molecular formula proposed structure and name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s6 pathway 1 ery oh radicals on interaction with ery could result in cleavage of either amino sugar at the c5 or cleavage of sugar at the c3 yielding lactone of the ery oxidative cleavage of the ery results in two intermediate pairs viz ery1 and ery2 desosamine or ery3 and ery4 cladinose further oxidation of ery1 and ery3 yields ery8 lactone structure ery8 undergoes a series of oxidation and decarboxylation reactions to yield the intermediates ery9 followed by ery10 ery10 on further oxidation results in cleavage of the lactone ring yielding ery11 diethyl 2 methylmalonate which undergoes oxidation to yield ery12 2 methylmalonic acid followed by ery13 acetic acid whereas both ery2 and ery4 could undergo oxidation losing the side chains to yield ery14 6 methyltetrahydro 2h pyran 2 3 4 triol which undergoes further mineralization due to ring opening pathway 2 ery decarboxylation of the inner side chain in the lactone ring initiates this pathway yielding ery5 ery5 undergoes oxidative cleavage either at c3 or c5 yielding ery4 and ery6 or ery2 and ery7 pair of intermediates respectively ery6 and ery7 undergo further oxidation to yield ery9 ery9 undergoes a series of oxidation reactions as described in pathway 1 ery and is completely mineralized this is the first reported study to identify intermediates and propose an erythromycin degradation pathway by eop using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode intermediates ery2 ery4 and ery5 have been previously observed during the uv chlorination process 70 whereas ery3 was previously reported during the oxidation of erythromycin in persulfate activated iron powder h2o2 system 71 3 5 toxicity analysis electrolysis of emerging organic contaminants could produce toxic intermediate products as a result of oxidation 58 moreover treated wastewater is commonly discharged into water reservoirs the presence of toxic by products could pose a potential ecological risk therefore it is important to evaluate the acute toxicity of the electrolysed wastewater moreover the toxicity of the electrolysed smx amp tc str ery and antibiotic mixture is not reported fig 7 shows the luminosity inhibition of v fischeri bacteria observed during the mineralization of representative antibiotics and antibiotic mixture collected at different time intervals the toxicity of the treated smx samples decreased with treatment time fig 7a after 30 min of incubation samples collected at 0 min and 20 min inhibited 40 83 4 51 and 0 62 0 31 luminosity respectively this decreasing toxicity trend with electrolysis time is consistent with the trend observed during electrochemical oxidation of smx in na2so4 electrolyte bdd anode system 13 the concentrations corresponding to the samples suggest that smx at high concentrations is toxic and the toxicity decreases as the smx is mineralized during the electrochemical oxidation however the sample corresponding to 24 min showed no luminosity inhibition data not presented in the graph on the contrary smx degraded in a microwave activated persulfate process showed 100 inhibition at 4 min even after complete degradation of the parent smx compound 72 similarly smx in solution degraded by photolysis ozonation and photo ozonation were also reported to be toxic even after 3 h of treatment 73 fig 7b presents the luminosity inhibition by electrolysed amp samples a decrease in luminosity inhibition with a decrease in amp concentration was observed after 30 min of incubation the observed inhibition percentage was 79 69 0 32 and 32 06 0 05 for 0 min and 20 min samples respectively 32 06 indicates low acute toxicity of the electrolysed samples this could be due to the presence of a high amount of small chain carbamic acid derivatives carboxylic acid derivates phenol and phenylmethamine at the end of the electro oxidation process the toxicity of the electrolysed amp solution is very much low when compared to the amp degradation by the ozonation process it was reported that 33 8 inhibition was observed in 15 min of incubation and the toxicity remained up to 100 min of ozonation 74 fig 7c presents the percentage inhibition of luminescence in v fischeri by electrolysed tc samples percentage inhibition was observed to decrease from 43 47 0 33 for 0 min sample to 0 05 for the tc sample collected at 12 min the delay in toxicity reduction was observed which is consistent with the results reported during electrochemical oxidation using ti ti4o7 anode 67 this delay could be due to the generation of intermediates with three or four membered rings in their structure in an earlier reported study an increase in toxicity with treatment time was reported in tc degradation by ozonation which was attributed to the toxic intermediates generated during removal 75 76 fig 7d presents the luminosity inhibition percentage of samples collected during str electro oxidation the percentage luminosity inhibition of the treated samples was observed to increase from 76 26 3 62 for the 0th min sample to 81 26 1 06 for the 6th sample an increase in the toxicity could be due to the generation of intermediates that are more toxic than the parent str intermediate streptidin was observed in the samples after hydrolysis of the parent str fig 5 streptidin is a derivative of streptomycin and is also reported to be toxic 77 however the percentage inhibition dropped to 35 27 0 28 for the 12th min sample indicating degradation of the toxic intermediate and generation of relatively low toxic compounds due to oxidation fig 7e presents the luminosity inhibition percentage in v fischeri of the electrolysed erythromycin samples the inhibition fluctuated in samples collected from time to time the initial toxicity of the sample was 92 1 1 41 at 0 min which is very much high than the other class of antibiotics examined in this study delayed increase and decrease in inhibition was observed up to 8 min 91 85 1 37 and gradually decreased to 85 76 1 49 in the 12th min sample the observed trend was in contrast to the toxicity inhibition trends of other antibiotic classes investigated in this study this could be attributed to the complex structure functional groups action mechanism and nature of the intermediates generated 78 overall a decrease in luminosity inhibition trend corresponding to decreasing antibiotic concentration with time demonstrates gradual degradation and complete mineralization of antibiotics reduction in toxicity with time could also be attributed to non toxic intermediates generated during electrolysis in a chlorine free media and mineralization of the intermediates during electrolysis in a na2so4 medium 13 15 yang et al suggested that oxidation of antibiotics by so4 or co3 generated more toxic products due to incomplete and selective oxidation compared to oxidation by oh radicals 45 this is in agreement with the nature and observed toxicity of this study as oh radicals are non selective and promote mineralization fig 7f represents the toxicity of the antibiotics mixture in 30 min of incubation v fischeri inhibition percentage of the mixture was observed to increase from 2 7 0 74 at 0 min to 60 56 0 08 at 24 min even though complete removal of all the antibiotics in the mixture was observed within 14 min of electrolysis this increase in inhibition could be attributed to the increase in the concentration of oxidation intermediate mixtures and their additive toxicity effect it took about 60 min treatment time to reduce the toxic effects of electrolysed antibiotic mixture to 0 36 0 09 which could be attributed to the effective mineralization of transformation products 3 6 electrode reusability and performance the performance of ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode and reusability was evaluated for potential large scale applications the efficiency of the anode for the removal of different antibiotics remained consistent 99 across several cycles for 16 repeatable cycles the removal of smx was 99 with an average rate constant of 1 524 min 1 fig s3 further at the end of every cycle the samples were subjected to icp oes analysis however lead ions were below the detection limit from the observed removal efficiencies and icp oes analysis it is clear that the anode is highly stable under the operating conditions and can be reused several times with high antibiotic removal efficiency 4 conclusion in this study ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode was successfully prepared by the electrodeposition method characterized and evaluated for removal of antibiotics of five different classes further the degradation results suggest that the ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode can effectively degrade the antibiotics irrespective of the class this can be attributed to the high oep and oh generation confirmed by cv lsv studies and quantification results this suggests that the presence of dopants such as fluorine in the pbo2 surface significantly enhances the performance of the pbo2 anode further sem edax and xrd analysis confirmed the structural stability and composition of the synthesized anode high applied current density favors effective removal and improves the current efficiency of the process the removal rate was high for low initial concentrations irrespective of the antibiotic class and antibiotic mixture when compared to the rate of removal of individual antibiotics for the first time the removal of representative antibiotics from five different classes were investigated using ti sb sno2 pbo2 several novel intermediate compounds were identified and complete degradation pathways were proposed the toxicity of all the electrolysed samples decreased with treatment though the toxicity of the electrolysed wastewater fluctuated with time and between different classes of antibiotics therefore extending the electrolysis time can mineralize the toxic intermediates and reduce the toxicity allowing safe discharge or reuse of the treated wastewater on the contrary no toxicity was observed in the electrolysed secondary effluent spiked with antibiotic suggesting a possible application of low cost anode such as ti sb sno2 pbo2 for field applications nevertheless the electro oxidation process is a one step process that can address all emerging contaminants overall investigation of ti sb sno2 pbo2 for removal of antibiotics of different classes demonstrates the application potential of a low cost electrode to mitigate environmental antimicrobial resistance and eco toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors

12505,in this study electro oxidation of representative antibiotics of five different classes viz sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole penicillin ampicillin tetracycline tetracycline aminoglycoside streptomycin macrolide erythromycin and the mixture of representative antibiotics by ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode were studied ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode was synthesized and characterized by sem edax xrd cv and lsv analysis the physical characterization revealed the compact nature of the pbo2 crystals composition and crystal arrangement in β planes further cv and lsv confirmed the electrode stability under the operating condition with high oxygen evolution potential the in situ generated reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide and sulfate radicals were quantified sulfamethoxazole was used as a model antibiotic to study the effect of current density 10 40 ma cm 2 initial concentration 100 1000 μg l 1 and water matrix 25 mm sodium sulfate and secondary effluent the kinetic constants were determined by adopting a non linear regression model and curve fitting the optimum current density was 30 ma cm 2 with k 1 0 4162 min 1 under the optimum conditions degradation of antibiotics was 99 irrespective of the antibiotic class the intermediates were identified by lc ms ms analysis and a complete electro oxidation pathway was proposed for five antibiotics of different classes the toxicity of the representative antibiotics and mixture was evaluated by v fischeri bioluminescence inhibition overall the toxicity was found to decrease and extending the treatment time ensures effective eco toxicity reduction by allowing safe discharge of the treated water the observed results confirm that the electro oxidation with ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode is an effective and a low cost alternative for bdd graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electro oxidation antibiotics reactive oxygen species degradation eco toxicity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in humans and animals to treat prevent various bacterial infections antibiotics are considered as one of the emerging contaminants anywhere between 5 and 90 of consumed antibiotics are excreted via feces and urine in either unmetabolized or partially metabolized forms the excreted antibiotics reach the wastewater treatment plant wwtp which bridges the wastewater generated and environment matrices 1 low concentration and recalcitrant nature make it difficult for conventional wastewater processes to eliminate antibiotics 2 the majority of wwtp discharge the treated effluent into water bodies which carry antibiotics in low concentrations 3 5 in addition pharmaceutical companies that manufacture antibiotics also pollute the environment with antibiotics and their derivatives at high concentrations 1 incidentally both treated wastewater and untreated wastewater introduce low concentration antibiotics into the environment 2 6 7 antibiotics released pose both health and environmental risks low concentration antibiotics and antibiotics at sub inhibitory levels induce resistance in the environmental microbial community infections by drug resistant microorganisms are difficult to treat and often lead to death due to treatment failure 1 at high concentrations antibiotics have also been reported to exhibit eco toxic effects 8 the primary producers algae and cyanobacteria fish duckweeds and crustaceans are reported to be antibiotic sensitive 9 therefore it becomes important to eliminate the antibiotics from treated effluents before discharging them into surface water and other environmental matrix advanced oxidation processes aop are effective for the removal of emerging contaminants such as antibiotics which is promising for effective wastewater treatment 10 in an aop process the organic pollutants are oxidized into carbon dioxide water and mineral acid electro oxidation process eop is one such efficient process for effective antibiotics removal in eop the anode plays a very important role and reactive oxygen species ros generated on the anode participate in the mineralization of pollutants anode can be briefly classified into active and non active anode the non active anodes aid in complete mineralization whereas active anodes participate in the selective conversion of pollutants 10 non active anodes such as lead oxide pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are good conductors and promote ros generation as these electrodes are poor catalysts for oxygen evolution 11 the anode plays a major role in the electro oxidation process and the most widely studied anode is the bdd bdd has a wide potential window high oxygen over potential high mineralization potential corrosion stability and surface inertness 12 14 however the substrate material used for the synthesis of bdd films such as niobium tantalum and tungsten and the process of bdd film synthesis namely the chemical vapor deposition makes it an expensive process 10 the high cost of bdd electrodes restricts large scale wastewater treatment application despite the advantages 15 on the other hand non active lead oxide pbo2 electrodes are quite inexpensive highly effective inert has a wide potential window and exhibit high oxygen evolution overpotential 16 18 the pbo2 anode synthesized on titanium substrate is corrosive resistant and cost effective which makes it a good alternative for bdd and large scale application 18 to overcome the internal stress and avoid passivation the ti substrate is coated with an intermediate layer the most common being the sb sno2 layer sno2 is a semiconductor and has low conductivity at room temperature with a band gap energy of 3 5 ev doping of sno2 with dopants such as ar b bi f cl p and sb increases the conductivity doping with sb is reported to increase the oep to 1 9 v making this a good candidate for the anodic oxidation of pollutants 19 sb sno2 decreases the internal stress prevents deformation of the pbo2 coating and improves the current efficiency and electrode stability 20 moreover the oep of sb sno2 1 9 v is the same as the pbo2 electrode 19 therefore the intermediate layer will not modify the oep or the efficiency of the pbo2 anode to further improve the stability oxidation potential electrocatalytic performance and current efficiency of the pbo2 active layer pbo2 is often modified by adding dopants such as transition metals rare earth metals or non metals 19 21 for instance ti sno2 sb pbo2 go ce prepared by fu et al exhibited enhanced electrode stability and electrocatalytic performance for phenol removal 22 the most commonly investigated antibiotics for electro oxidation removal are sulfamethoxazole 13 23 30 and ciprofloxacin 26 27 31 33 belonging to sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone group respectively however each class of antibiotics varies structurally which affects not only their prevalence and persistence but kinetics degradation transformation products and toxicity therefore for this study representative antibiotics belonging to five different classes viz sulfonamide penicillin tetracycline aminoglycoside and macrolide are chosen table 1 sulfamethoxazole is used as the model antibiotic for current density optimization while degradation of the rest of the antibiotics is performed at optimized conditions the majority of antibiotics unlike other organic pollutants are reported in low concentrations parts per billion and parts per trillion in wastewater effluents 34 35 more often a mixture of antibiotics rather than a single antibiotic is reported in wastewater 1 therefore it is important that the lab scale studies investigate the removal of individual antibiotics and antibiotics mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations in addition a study on the electro oxidation of five antibiotics of different classes using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode and eco toxicity evaluation is not reported in the literature in this context the objectives of this study are i to synthesize characterize and optimize the ti sb sno2 pbo2 for antibiotics removal at low initial concentrations ppb using sulfamethoxazole as a model antibiotic ii to study the effect of initial antibiotic concentration the effect of current density and water matrices on antibiotics degradation iii to study the degradation kinetics of the representative antibiotics and antibiotics mixture at optimized conditions iv to identify the intermediates and propose degradation pathway v to evaluate the toxicity of the electrolysed samples 2 materials and methodology 2 1 chemicals sodium sulfate tin iv chloride pentahydrate antimony iii chloride isopropanol lead nitrate

presented in the supplementary sections s1 s2 and s3 respectively 2 3 degradation experiment the degradation experiment was carried out in a single compartment cell ti sb sno2 pbo2 and a stainless electrode connected to an external power supply scientific psd3005 india with an active surface area of 3 2 cm2 on each side were used as anode and cathode respectively fig s1 the reaction volume was 150 ml of 25 mm of na2so4 electrolyte and magnetically stirred at rpm 150 20 the effects of operating parameters such as smx concentration 50 100 250 500 750 1000 μg l 1 applied current density 10 20 30 40 ma cm 2 and water matrices on smx degradation were studied all the experiments were conducted in triplicates and data points are expressed as average values standard deviation 2 4 antibiotic analysis samples were collected at specific time intervals and filtered using a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter nupore india the residual antibiotic concentration in the treated samples after filtration was analyzed in a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry system shimadzu lcms 8040 the system was equipped with a c18 column shim pack giss with particles of 5 μm size and dimensions 250 4 6 mm internal diameter for separation the injection volume was 20 μl the flow rate was fixed at 0 5 ml min 1 ms ms was operated in esi positive ionization mode the parameters for lc ms ms analysis of each antibiotic are presented in table s1 validation of the analytical method was done by determining linearity accuracy limit of quantification loq and limit of detection lod all the calibration graphs were linear with r2 0 99 mass spectra of the intermediates were obtained by scanning from m z 50 to 1000 the m z were either compared with the existing literature or new structures were predicted based on the m z values of the precursor ion scan chemdraw version 8 0 was used to draw the predicted structures 2 5 determination of kinetic constants a non linear regression model was adopted to fit the degradation curves the solver function excel 2011 mso was used to fit the removal of all antibiotics with time in the logistic equation eq 1 to calculate the kinetics constants for antibiotic removal 79 to fit the removal kinetics the least square method was employed the sum of the difference between the observed and predicted value squares was the objective function and k obs was the variable the obtained kinetic constant values were used to compare the removal of smx and other antibiotics at various operating conditions 1 c t c 0 2 1 e k obs t where c 0 and c t are the initial antibiotic concentration μg l 1 and antibiotic concentration μg l 1 at time t respectively k x is the fitted rate constant for antibiotic removal and t is time min 2 6 toxicity analysis synthetic water samples collected at specific time intervals and treated wastewater samples were subjected to acute toxicity assay in a micro toxicity analyzer microtox m500 usa the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri are highly sensitive to toxic compounds bacteria when exposed to toxic compounds die resulting in the reduction of luminescence intensity a basic screening test 45 was performed at 15 c for treated samples collected at specific time intervals and a change in luminescence intensity of the sample isample was measured after incubating for 5 15 and 30 min eq 2 was used to calculate the percentage inhibition i of v fischeri while the luminescence intensity of 25 mm na2so4 was used as the blank iblank 2 percentage inhibition 1 i sample i blank 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized pbo2 electrode 3 1 1 morphology and composition figs s2a and b show the scanning electron micrographs sem of the ti substrate before and after sandblasting it can be seen that sandblasting has created roughness on the ti substrate the rough surface enables effective adhesion and deposition of the oxide layers and increases the service life of the electrode as a whole 36 fig s2c shows the sem of the freshly synthesized pbo2 electrode the freshly coated pbo2 surface is compact uniform and non porous with a typical pyramidal shape crystal as previously reported 11 37 small size crystals provide a more active surface area for ros generation and electro oxidation of pollutants 36 edax was carried out to confirm the composition of the synthesized electrode fig s2d shows the edax of the freshly prepared pbo2 electrode it could be seen that the electrode is primarily composed of lead oxygen and fluorine which is in agreement with the synthesis method fluorine is the dopant used to increase the stability and electrocatalytic performance of the anode 3 1 2 xrd analysis fig s2e shows the xrd pattern of the pbo2 layer of the ti sb sno2 pbo2 electrode major diffraction peaks at 2θ 25 28 31 93 36 07 48 85 and 52 assigned to the 110 011 020 221 and 220 of β pbo2 planes respectively were observed apart from the major diffraction peaks corresponding to β pbo2 planes peaks at 2θ 53 83 58 71 60 43 62 29 66 7 74 24 76 78 and 78 37 were also observed these peaks correspond to 002 130 112 031 022 231 040 and 222 planes of β pbo2 respectively the peaks corresponding to β pbo2 planes reported are consistent with the previous reports 11 37 39 β pbo2 is majorly formed when pbo2 is electrochemically deposited in acid solutions 40 which is consistent with the electrode synthesis method 3 1 3 lsv and cv analysis fig s2f and g represents the lsv and cv of ti sb sno2 pbo2 in 25 mm na2so4 at scan rates of 20 50 and 100 mv s 1 the oep of β pbo2 was observed at 1 6 1 9 v vs ag agcl while the standard oxygen reduction potential is e 1 23 v fig s2f electrode with high oep than the standard oxygen reduction potential has increased pollutant degradation efficiency due to suppression of side reactions which is o2 evolution with respect to the electro oxidation process 41 electrodes with high oep value favor more ros generation 36 oxidation peaks can be seen at potential 1 23 in both lsv and cv plots which corresponds to the conversion of pb ii to pb iv for oxidation peaks in the cv plots fig s2g corresponding reduction peaks were also observed which indicates the reversible splitting of the molecule and stability of the ti sb sno2 pbo2 electrode under operating conditions 42 in addition to oxidation reduction peaks in cv plots an increase in the curve area with an increase in applied potential was also observed this indicates that the electrochemical reaction in a na2so4 system with ti sb sno2 pbo2 is applied current or potential controlled a high current response between 1 23 and 1 9 v promotes water splitting and generation of oh radicals which in turn promotes effective electro oxidation of pollutants 43 3 2 ros quantification in a chlorine free media the most common ros responsible for pollutant oxidation is oh radical apart from o3 and h2o2 in situ generated oh radicals are non selective oxidants and react with any substrate at the rate of 109 m s 1 44 45 oh radicals have a high oxidation potential 1 8 v in neutral solutions 46 oh radicals are clean oxidants with a half life of 10 9 s 44 and are considered environment friendly 47 therefore oh radicals were quantified fig s2h shows a linear increase in oh radical concentration at different applied current densities with time the higher the applied current density the more is the oh radical generation however both h2o2 and so4 radicals were not generated in the ti sb sno2 pbo2 na2so4 system a detailed explanation for the same is available in 48 when the rate of oh radical generation is compared between 30 ma cm 2 k 0 0603 mm min 1 and 40 ma cm 2 k 0 0606 mm min 1 the rate is fairly equal whereas the rate of generation between 10 ma cm 2 k 0 046 mm min 1 20 ma cm 2 k 0 0493 mm min 1 and 30 ma cm 2 k 0 0603 mm min 1 the difference is significant this could be due to competing side reactions resulting in rapid oxidation of oh radical to oxygen at the anode at a higher applied current density therefore it is important to optimize current density for effective removal of pollutants in a chlorine free media 3 3 effect of applied current density initial antibiotics concentration and water matrix on antibiotics degradation 3 3 1 effect of applied current density fig 1 a presents the effect of applied current density on sulfamethoxazole smx removal with time smx removal of initial concentration 1000 μg l 1 after 10 min of electrolysis was 99 55 99 12 96 71 and 50 66 at applied current densities 40 30 20 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively for 1000 μg l 1 smx initial concentration the degradation was complete in 12 min for applied current densities 30 and 40 ma cm 2 while it took 24 min at applied current density 10 ma cm 2 for complete smx removal it is evident that the degree of antibiotics mineralization increased with applied current density 14 therefore it is safe to assume that the eop with ti sb sno2 pbo2 enables complete removal of sxm after 12 min electrolysis at applied current density 30 and 40 ma cm 2 on the contrary de amorim et al observed complete smx removal in 3 h in a bdd na2so4 100 mm system at optimized conditions viz 36 ma cm 2 and ph 5 23 it is worth noting that the electrode used in this study showed better performance at low electrolyte concentration 25 mm na2so4 neutral ph and low applied current density 30 ma cm 2 compared to the reported study the smx removal rate constants k 1 increased from 0 1219 min 1 to 0 4131 min 1 when the applied current density was increased from 10 to 40 ma cm 2 for initial smx concentration 1000 μg l 1 fig 1b this tendency of variation in reaction rate constants and degradation rate could be attributed to oh radical generation fig s2h degradation of smx could be directly correlated to oh radical concentration 49 applied current density plays an important role in electron transfer oh radical generation oxygen generation and mineralization of smx therefore the applied current density should be optimum for the effective degradation of antibiotics and to eliminate side reactions 36 50 it is worth noting that the kinetic rate constants and removal rate of applied current densities 30 ma cm 2 0 4162 min 1 and 40 ma cm 2 0 4131 min 1 are not significantly different therefore 30 ma cm 2 was considered as optimum current density and employed in subsequent experiments 3 3 2 effect of initial smx concentration the percentage removal of smx at applied current density 30 ma cm 2 was 92 64 85 39 28 38 53 33 47 68 and 30 85 for initial concentrations 50 100 250 500 750 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively after 2 min of electrolysis fig 1c the rate constant k 2 value for smx degradation increased from 0 3324 min 1 to 1 6326 min 1 with smx concentration decreasing from 1000 to 50 μg l 1 fig 1d clearly percentage removal is high for low initial smx concentration and high applied current density at high applied current density the oh radical generated is more fig s2h therefore for low smx concentration sufficient oh radicals are available for effective smx oxidation at high applied current density as for high initial smx concentration more intermediates could be generated during the degradation of smx loos et al also observed removal of only 72 9 of smx at high concentration in 180 min of electrolysis using bdd anode 29 the intermediates generated during electrolysis compete for oh radicals reducing the mineralization efficiency of the parent compound smx 51 52 one can predict the degradation rate and rate constants k 2 from the equation k 2 1 623 e 0 002x provided the initial concentration smx x lies between 50 and 1000 μg l 1 3 3 3 effect of water matrix to understand the effect of the water matrix on smx degradation the electrolyte 25 mm na2so4 was replaced with secondary effluent the secondary effluent was collected from the iit madras sewage treatment plant in chennai tn india the secondary effluent was free of background smx therefore it was spiked with 1000 ppb of smx table 2 presents the wastewater characteristics before and after electrolysis smx degradation experiment was carried out at an applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 for 12 min fig 1e represents the degradation of smx in synthetic wastewater sww and real wastewater rww rww unlike sww contains organic and inorganic compounds in addition to smx therefore extended time for smx removal in rww can be expected since other organic compounds could compete with smx for the generated ros however smx removal was achieved in 12 min in rww with a rate constant k rww 0 7937 min 1 while smx removal in sww was observed with a rate constant k sww 0 3324 min 1 lin et al also observed enhanced smx removal in lake water compared to removal in synthetic wastewater in ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 naclo4 system 28 enhanced smx removal rate in rww when compared to sww could be due to the presence of co ions such as so4 cl and no3 in wastewater 49 lan et al also observed enhanced smx removal while using bdd in hospital wastewater due to the presence of co ions such as sulfate and chlorides 26 27 the presence of co ions could contribute to additional ros such as chlorate chlorite hypochlorite perchlorate and sulfate radicals generation in addition to oh radical during electrolysis 19 interestingly the treated wastewater showed no luminosity inhibition of v fischeri despite the presence of chloride ions indicating no visible or quantifiable toxicity in the electrolysed rww 3 3 4 degradation of individual and mixture of antibiotics 3 3 4 1 degradation of ampicillin tetracycline streptomycin and erythromycin fig 1f i represents the removal of different classes of antibiotics evaluated at different initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 ppb and applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 removal of ampicillin amp at 8 min was 97 57 94 32 and 91 85 for initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively fig 1f the corresponding rate constants are 0 7470 0 3999 and 0 3796 min 1 respectively it could be seen that k amp doubled 0 7470 min 1 when the initial concentration was decreased from 1000 to 100 ppb in the case of streptomycin str the removal in 2 min of electrolysis was 90 05 90 01 and 86 54 for 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively fig 1g the rate constant values k str were 1 4995 min 1 for 100 ppb 1 4727 min 1 for 500 ppb and 1 2783 min 1 for 1000 ppb it was observed that the removal rate increased from 1 2783 min 1 to 1 4727 min 1 while removal of erythromycin ery was observed to be 96 19 88 98 and 87 86 in 2 min of electrolysis with rates k ery at 1 9709 1 4149 and 1 3710 min 1 for 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively fig 1h low removal rate of amp str and ery at high concentration like smx can be attributed to one of the two reasons likely generation of more intermediates is a common phenomenon when a high initial antibiotic concentration is electrolysed the intermediates could competitively compete with the parent antibiotic compound for ros resulting in a slow degradation rate of the latter small k at high concentration could also be attributed to the concentration gradient resulting in overcrowding of the active sites on the anode by the intermediates and pollutants which reduces the degradation rate 53 the high removal rate at low initial antibiotic concentration could be attributed to the abundance of oh radical available for interaction with the parent and intermediate compound under the same operating conditions 36 tetracycline tc removal percentage did not follow a similar trend as smx amp str and ery but the rate of tc removal was observed to follow the same trend as the other antibiotics and observed to be 97 19 99 31 and 99 80 for initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively in 6 min of electrolysis fig 1i interestingly the k tc values were 1 7935 1 6167 and 0 8965 min 1 for 100 500 and 1000 ppb respectively the observed difference in tc removal compared to the other antibiotic groups could be attributed to the structure of tc unlike amp tc encompasses four benzene rings in its structure ros such as oh radical prefer electron rich regions and double bonds in benzene for interaction at high concentrations the chances of an unmodified parent tc molecule interacting with oh radical is high resulting in high removal percentage whereas at low initial concentration the interaction of unmodified tc with ros is relatively low in other words ros modified tc could compete with unmodified tc molecules for oh radicals resulting in low removal percentage 3 3 4 2 degradation of antibiotics mixture combined removal of antibiotics mixture viz smx amp tc str and ery each at a concentration 1000 ppb were electrolysed at 30 ma cm 2 and the rate constants were determined the individual removal of each antibiotic in the mixture was observed to be 76 38 77 45 98 21 99 35 and 99 68 for smx amp tc str and ery respectively fig 1j whereas the overall removal of the mixture was 99 84 in 12 min of electrolysis the corresponding rate constants are k smx 0 5547 min 1 k amp 0 4957 min 1 k tc 1 1147 min 1 k str 1 5212 min 1 and k ery 1 4812 min 1 respectively the observed removal rates for individual antibiotic in the mixture was significantly higher and much faster than the removal rate when the antibiotics were hydrolysed individually under the same operating conditions this could be attributed to the effective use of the ros generated during electro oxidation uniform concentration of the antibiotic mixture low mass transfer limitations the current efficiency of ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode structure and composition of the representative antibiotics 3 4 identification of intermediate products and elucidation of degradation mechanism lc ms ms mass spectrums were used to identify the transformation products tps generated during the electrochemical degradation of all the antibiotics carried out at an initial concentration of 1000 ppb and applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 complete mineralization of the antibiotics viz amp eq 3 tc eq 4 smx eq 5 str eq 6 and ery eq 7 will yield carbon dioxide co2 and inorganic sulfate so4 2 ammonia nh3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 ions 3 c 16 h 18 n 3 nao 4 s 41 h 2 o 16 co 2 3no 3 so 4 2 na 10 0h 10 0e 4 c 22 h 24 n 2 o 8 42 h 2 o 22 co 2 2no 3 10

were not detected in ion chromatography due to their low initial concentrations in a chlorine free media the major ros is oh radical the tps are produced due to random and non selective interactions of oh radicals with the antibiotics the tps are resulted due to hydroxylation oxidation deamination cleavage and desulfonation brought about by oh radicals fig 2 shows the proposed sulfamethoxazole degradation pathway 14 intermediates were identified which are presented in table s2 electro oxidation of smx can initiate any of the two degradation pathways viz pathway 1 smx and pathway 2 smx pathway 1 smx degradation of smx is initiated by hydroxylation which results in the formation of smx1 and smx21 smx22 of m z 283 and 269 respectively buxton et al suggested high reactivity of oh radicals with aniline 36 of the time oh radicals directly interact with nh2 group in the aniline structure in aqueous media which is consistent with smx1 formation 46 54 similarly reports suggest that oh radicals predominantly interact with the benzene ring 55 solar et al also suggested that about 54 of the time oh radicals interact at the ortho position to the nh2 group due to the electron donating nature of the nh2 group 54 therefore hydroxylation of smx would favor the production of more smx22 compared to smx21 h y kim et al suggested that smx21 is a minor product of hydroxylation while vidales et al suggested that smx22 is a significant intermediate at low current density 56 57 smx21 and smx22 undergo further oxidation to produce one of the three intermediates viz smx6 smx7 or smx9 smx6 undergoes further oxidation to produce smx4 whereas smx7 undergoes deamination to yield smx8 pathway 2 smx this pathway is initiated when oh radicals possibly interact with any of the four cleavage sites namely β γ δ and ε in the smx molecule 23 smx3 corresponding to m z 238 8 is consistent with β cleavage resulting in deamination of smx further γ cleavage of smx3 would result in smx11 smx13 and smx5 with m z 81 78 9 and 178 9 respectively while γ cleavage of the smx by oh radicals could produce aniline and smx5 however aniline was not observed in this study desulfonation of smx5 could also produce smx9 of m z value 98 9 δ cleavage of smx results in smx6 and smx7 with m z values 174 9 and 157 respectively in order for the smx6 to form an intermediate sulfanilamide must be formed which further undergoes deamination followed by oxidation or hydroxylation deamination of sulfanilamide would result in a 4 aminophenylsulfonyl structure 56 oxidation or hydroxylation of the 4 aminophenylsulfonyl structures yields smx6 further hydroxylation of smx6 will result in smx4 with m z 186 8 deamination of aniline arising from γ cleavage could also result in smx11 and smx13 similarly the deamination of smx7 could result in smx8 with m z 141 further the desulfonation of smx8 could also result in smx11 and smx13 oh radicals exhibit a high affinity for unsaturated double bonds in the benzene and isoxazole ring 46 therefore further oxidation of the intermediates results in the formation of acetic acid maleic acid malic acid oxalic acid oxamic acid glyoxilic acid and pyruvic acid 23 58 however oxamic acid smx10 glyoxilic acid smx12 and acetic acid smx14 were only observed in this study complete mineralization oxidation of these organic acids will produce co2 similarly oxidation or hydroxylation of nh2 and so2 groups followed by deamination and desulfonation will yield ammonia nh3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 ions the intermediates observed were consistent with the reported smx electrochemical degradation studies 23 57 58 fig 3 is the proposed ampicillin degradation pathways oxidative cleavage and hydroxylation of amp can lead to any of the four degradation pathways viz pathway 1 amp pathway 2 amp pathway 3 amp and pathway 4 amp with 17 intermediates molecular formula proposed structure and name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s3 pathway 1 amp oh radicals prefer electron rich regions interaction of oh radicals with amp results in the opening of β lactam ring resulting in the formation of 5r ampicillin penicilloic acid amp1 further oxidation of amp1 can either produce the intermediate pair amp2 amp8 due to disengagement of the benzene structure or opening of the β lactam ring resulting in amp9 ampicillin penicillenic acid decarboxylation of amp2 results in amp5 phenylmethanamine which on deamination results in amp7 phenol amp8 on the other hand undergoes oxidative cleavage resulting in the disengagement of the β lactam ring which yields amp15 amp15 on further oxidation yields amp17 which undergoes further mineralization the intermediate amp9 undergoes further oxidation to produce amp11 or amp12 amp11 5 r s ampicillin penicilloic acid and amp12 undergo further hydroxylation and oxidative cleavage results in amp2 and amp16 amp16 on deamination yields amp17 which is eventually mineralized pathway 2 amp hydroxylation at the β lactam ring results in oxidative cleavage of parent amp resulting in the generation of intermediates amp2 and amp3 amp2 further undergoes decarboxylation due to oxidative cleavage to produce amp5 amp5 on deamination results in amp7 which undergoes complete mineralization whereas amp3 undergoes hydroxylation and oxidation at the β lactam ring to generate amp10 subsequent oxidation of amp10 results in amp14 followed by amp17 which undergoes mineralization pathway 3 amp this pathway is initiated when hydroxylation resulting in oxidative cleavage occurs at the methylamine bond connecting the phenyl group and β lactam ring yielding the intermediates amp4 and amp5 amp4 on decarboxylation and hydroxylation yields amp13 amp13 on further oxidation and oxidative cleavage at the β lactam ring results in either amp15 or amp16 amp15 undergoes oxidation and cleavage to yield amp17 whereas amp16 undergoes deamination to yield amp17 on the other hand amp5 could undergo deamination followed by hydroxylation to amp7 further interaction of oh radicals with amp17 and amp5 result in ring opening and complete mineralization pathway 4 amp hydroxylation resulting in cleavage and disengagement of benzene ring and rest of the β lactam structure yielding amp6 and amp7 further interaction of oh radicals with amp7 results in ring opening and mineralization on the other hand amp6 undergoes deamination to yield amp4 which on further hydroxylation at the β lactam ring yields amp13 amp13 on further oxidation could yield either amp15 or amp16 which further undergoes mineralization as described in pathway 3 amp this is the first reported study on ampicillin degradation by eop using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode amp1 and amp11 have been previously observed during plasma treatment of ampicillin 59 60 whereas amp1 amp9 and amp11 were observed during the catalytic degradation process 61 intermediates such as amp2 amp3 amp6 amp7 and amp15 were observed during electro oxidation with hydrogen peroxide electro fenton and photo electro fenton process 62 fig 4 is the proposed degradation pathway for tetracycline tc when electrolysed could follow any of the three degradation pathways viz pathway 1 tc pathway 2 tc and pathway 3 tc while yielding 17 intermediates before complete mineralization molecular formula proposed structure and name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s4 pathway 1 tc hydroxylation of the first benzene ring in the tc structure initiates this pathway since oh radicals exhibit a high affinity for unsaturated bonds in the benzene structure in the tc yields tc1 63 tc1 undergoes further oxidation to produce a series of intermediates as a result of ring opening tc1 yields tc7 which on further oxidation could yield tc11 in two different pathways tc7 on decarboxylation yields tc8 which loses one of the benzene rings in its structure to produce tc11 otherwise tc7 can undergo simple hydroxylation to produce tc9 which undergoes decarboxylation to yield tc10 tc10 further loses one of the benzene rings as a result of ring opening and oxidation to yield tc11 or undergoes oxidative cleavage to yield tc13 2 methylbenzoic acid which undergoes further oxidation to yield tc17 oxalic acid on the other hand tc11 undergoes a series of oxidation reactions resulting in ring opening to yield tc12 tc12 either undergoes a series of oxidation to yield tc14 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 2 2 tetracarboxylic acid followed by tc17 tc12 can also undergo oxidative cleavage yielding tc15 2 3 dioxosuccinic acid followed by tc16 2 oxomalonic acid and tc17 which undergoes mineralization pathway 2 tc deamination of the side chain dimethylamine group of the tc1 compound initiates this pathway yielding tc2 and tc3 n n dimethylhydroxylamine tc2 undergoes a series of hydroxylation due to the interaction of oh radicals with the double bonds and amine group to yield tc6 63 which undergoes further deamination to yield tc8 tc8 loses a benzene ring due to ring opening and oxidation to yield tc11 tc11 undergoes further oxidation and follows the degradation pathway as described in pathway 1 tc pathway 3 tc simultaneous deamination and hydroxylation of the tc molecule yield tc4 and tc5 carbamic acid initiating this pathway tc4 on further deamination hydroxylation and oxidation yields tc7 tc7 follows one of the two degradation pathways as described in pathway 1 tc and undergoes complete mineralization on extending the electrolysis time this is the first reported study to identify intermediates and propose a tetracycline degradation pathway by eop using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode tc1 and tc6 have been previously observed during heterogeneous electro fenton treatment of tetracycline using cu doped fe fe2o3 63 whereas tc2 and tc13 were observed during electrochemical degradation using ti ta2o5 iro2 anode and photocatalytic degradation using ag modified g c3n4 64 65 tc4 was reportedly observed during the photodegradation of tetracycline using 3d io tio2 cds nanocomposite under visible light 66 tc3 tc6 tc7 tc11 tc12 tc14 t16 and tc17 are consistent with the previously reported electro oxidation using ti ti4o7 anode 67 fig 5 shows the proposed pathways of streptomycin degradation by the electro oxidation process interaction of oh radicals with str can initiate any of the two degradation pathways viz pathway 1 str and pathway 2 str while yielding 13 intermediates before complete mineralization the molecular formula proposed structure name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s5 pathway 1 str hydroxylation of the bond connecting sugar moiety to the 5 carbon ring results in oxidative cleavage of str yielding str1 and str2 n methyl l glucosamine str1 on further oxidation at the co yields str4 and str5 streptose str4 streptidine on hydroxylation yields str7 str7 undergoes further oxidation and deamination to yield str9 tetrahydro 2h pyran and str10 1 hydroxyguanidine str9 on further hydroxylation and cleavage yields str11 and str12 str10 undergoes further deamination to produce str13 n hydroxyformimidamide whereas str2 undergoes hydroxylation at the nc bond to yield str6 which on deamination and decarboxylation yields str8 str8 on further hydroxylation yields str9 which on further oxidation yields str11 pentane 1 5 diol and str12 hexane 1 6 diol str11 and str12 are further mineralized pathway 2 str hydroxylation of str1 could also initiate the second pathway yielding str3 and str4 streptidine str4 follows the same pathway as described in pathway 1 str str3 on the other hand undergoes oxidation to yield str2 n methyl l glucosamine and str5 streptose str2 follows the same pathway as described in pathway 1 str whereas further oxidation of str5 results in ring opening and mineralization this is the first reported study to identify intermediates and propose a streptomycin degradation pathway by eop removal using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode intermediate str4 has been previously observed during catalytic hydrolysis of str by ca mgo solid base 68 whereas str1 str2 str4 and str5 were previously reported during photolysis of streptomycin in aquatic environments 69 fig 6 represents the proposed degradation pathway for erythromycin degradation ery yields 13 intermediates during electrolysis and undergoes complete mineralization in any of the two proposed degradation pathways viz pathway 1 ery and pathway 2 ery molecular formula proposed structure and name molar mass and observed m z of the identified intermediates are listed in table s6 pathway 1 ery oh radicals on interaction with ery could result in cleavage of either amino sugar at the c5 or cleavage of sugar at the c3 yielding lactone of the ery oxidative cleavage of the ery results in two intermediate pairs viz ery1 and ery2 desosamine or ery3 and ery4 cladinose further oxidation of ery1 and ery3 yields ery8 lactone structure ery8 undergoes a series of oxidation and decarboxylation reactions to yield the intermediates ery9 followed by ery10 ery10 on further oxidation results in cleavage of the lactone ring yielding ery11 diethyl 2 methylmalonate which undergoes oxidation to yield ery12 2 methylmalonic acid followed by ery13 acetic acid whereas both ery2 and ery4 could undergo oxidation losing the side chains to yield ery14 6 methyltetrahydro 2h pyran 2 3 4 triol which undergoes further mineralization due to ring opening pathway 2 ery decarboxylation of the inner side chain in the lactone ring initiates this pathway yielding ery5 ery5 undergoes oxidative cleavage either at c3 or c5 yielding ery4 and ery6 or ery2 and ery7 pair of intermediates respectively ery6 and ery7 undergo further oxidation to yield ery9 ery9 undergoes a series of oxidation reactions as described in pathway 1 ery and is completely mineralized this is the first reported study to identify intermediates and propose an erythromycin degradation pathway by eop using ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode intermediates ery2 ery4 and ery5 have been previously observed during the uv chlorination process 70 whereas ery3 was previously reported during the oxidation of erythromycin in persulfate activated iron powder h2o2 system 71 3 5 toxicity analysis electrolysis of emerging organic contaminants could produce toxic intermediate products as a result of oxidation 58 moreover treated wastewater is commonly discharged into water reservoirs the presence of toxic by products could pose a potential ecological risk therefore it is important to evaluate the acute toxicity of the electrolysed wastewater moreover the toxicity of the electrolysed smx amp tc str ery and antibiotic mixture is not reported fig 7 shows the luminosity inhibition of v fischeri bacteria observed during the mineralization of representative antibiotics and antibiotic mixture collected at different time intervals the toxicity of the treated smx samples decreased with treatment time fig 7a after 30 min of incubation samples collected at 0 min and 20 min inhibited 40 83 4 51 and 0 62 0 31 luminosity respectively this decreasing toxicity trend with electrolysis time is consistent with the trend observed during electrochemical oxidation of smx in na2so4 electrolyte bdd anode system 13 the concentrations corresponding to the samples suggest that smx at high concentrations is toxic and the toxicity decreases as the smx is mineralized during the electrochemical oxidation however the sample corresponding to 24 min showed no luminosity inhibition data not presented in the graph on the contrary smx degraded in a microwave activated persulfate process showed 100 inhibition at 4 min even after complete degradation of the parent smx compound 72 similarly smx in solution degraded by photolysis ozonation and photo ozonation were also reported to be toxic even after 3 h of treatment 73 fig 7b presents the luminosity inhibition by electrolysed amp samples a decrease in luminosity inhibition with a decrease in amp concentration was observed after 30 min of incubation the observed inhibition percentage was 79 69 0 32 and 32 06 0 05 for 0 min and 20 min samples respectively 32 06 indicates low acute toxicity of the electrolysed samples this could be due to the presence of a high amount of small chain carbamic acid derivatives carboxylic acid derivates phenol and phenylmethamine at the end of the electro oxidation process the toxicity of the electrolysed amp solution is very much low when compared to the amp degradation by the ozonation process it was reported that 33 8 inhibition was observed in 15 min of incubation and the toxicity remained up to 100 min of ozonation 74 fig 7c presents the percentage inhibition of luminescence in v fischeri by electrolysed tc samples percentage inhibition was observed to decrease from 43 47 0 33 for 0 min sample to 0 05 for the tc sample collected at 12 min the delay in toxicity reduction was observed which is consistent with the results reported during electrochemical oxidation using ti ti4o7 anode 67 this delay could be due to the generation of intermediates with three or four membered rings in their structure in an earlier reported study an increase in toxicity with treatment time was reported in tc degradation by ozonation which was attributed to the toxic intermediates generated during removal 75 76 fig 7d presents the luminosity inhibition percentage of samples collected during str electro oxidation the percentage luminosity inhibition of the treated samples was observed to increase from 76 26 3 62 for the 0th min sample to 81 26 1 06 for the 6th sample an increase in the toxicity could be due to the generation of intermediates that are more toxic than the parent str intermediate streptidin was observed in the samples after hydrolysis of the parent str fig 5 streptidin is a derivative of streptomycin and is also reported to be toxic 77 however the percentage inhibition dropped to 35 27 0 28 for the 12th min sample indicating degradation of the toxic intermediate and generation of relatively low toxic compounds due to oxidation fig 7e presents the luminosity inhibition percentage in v fischeri of the electrolysed erythromycin samples the inhibition fluctuated in samples collected from time to time the initial toxicity of the sample was 92 1 1 41 at 0 min which is very much high than the other class of antibiotics examined in this study delayed increase and decrease in inhibition was observed up to 8 min 91 85 1 37 and gradually decreased to 85 76 1 49 in the 12th min sample the observed trend was in contrast to the toxicity inhibition trends of other antibiotic classes investigated in this study this could be attributed to the complex structure functional groups action mechanism and nature of the intermediates generated 78 overall a decrease in luminosity inhibition trend corresponding to decreasing antibiotic concentration with time demonstrates gradual degradation and complete mineralization of antibiotics reduction in toxicity with time could also be attributed to non toxic intermediates generated during electrolysis in a chlorine free media and mineralization of the intermediates during electrolysis in a na2so4 medium 13 15 yang et al suggested that oxidation of antibiotics by so4 or co3 generated more toxic products due to incomplete and selective oxidation compared to oxidation by oh radicals 45 this is in agreement with the nature and observed toxicity of this study as oh radicals are non selective and promote mineralization fig 7f represents the toxicity of the antibiotics mixture in 30 min of incubation v fischeri inhibition percentage of the mixture was observed to increase from 2 7 0 74 at 0 min to 60 56 0 08 at 24 min even though complete removal of all the antibiotics in the mixture was observed within 14 min of electrolysis this increase in inhibition could be attributed to the increase in the concentration of oxidation intermediate mixtures and their additive toxicity effect it took about 60 min treatment time to reduce the toxic effects of electrolysed antibiotic mixture to 0 36 0 09 which could be attributed to the effective mineralization of transformation products 3 6 electrode reusability and performance the performance of ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode and reusability was evaluated for potential large scale applications the efficiency of the anode for the removal of different antibiotics remained consistent 99 across several cycles for 16 repeatable cycles the removal of smx was 99 with an average rate constant of 1 524 min 1 fig s3 further at the end of every cycle the samples were subjected to icp oes analysis however lead ions were below the detection limit from the observed removal efficiencies and icp oes analysis it is clear that the anode is highly stable under the operating conditions and can be reused several times with high antibiotic removal efficiency 4 conclusion in this study ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode was successfully prepared by the electrodeposition method characterized and evaluated for removal of antibiotics of five different classes further the degradation results suggest that the ti sb sno2 pbo2 anode can effectively degrade the antibiotics irrespective of the class this can be attributed to the high oep and oh generation confirmed by cv lsv studies and quantification results this suggests that the presence of dopants such as fluorine in the pbo2 surface significantly enhances the performance of the pbo2 anode further sem edax and xrd analysis confirmed the structural stability and composition of the synthesized anode high applied current density favors effective removal and improves the current efficiency of the process the removal rate was high for low initial concentrations irrespective of the antibiotic class and antibiotic mixture when compared to the rate of removal of individual antibiotics for the first time the removal of representative antibiotics from five different classes were investigated using ti sb sno2 pbo2 several novel intermediate compounds were identified and complete degradation pathways were proposed the toxicity of all the electrolysed samples decreased with treatment though the toxicity of the electrolysed wastewater fluctuated with time and between different classes of antibiotics therefore extending the electrolysis time can mineralize the toxic intermediates and reduce the toxicity allowing safe discharge or reuse of the treated wastewater on the contrary no toxicity was observed in the electrolysed secondary effluent spiked with antibiotic suggesting a possible application of low cost anode such as ti sb sno2 pbo2 for field applications nevertheless the electro oxidation process is a one step process that can address all emerging contaminants overall investigation of ti sb sno2 pbo2 for removal of antibiotics of different classes demonstrates the application potential of a low cost electrode to mitigate environmental antimicrobial resistance and eco toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors

12506,widespread application of membrane bioreactors mbrs is still difficult because of the problem of membrane fouling which increases operational and maintenance costs a novel approach to mitigate fouling in mbrs nanobubble assisted backwashing nbb is presented in this paper nanobubbles generated in this study had an average diameter of about 150 nm and some of the nanobubbles could pass through the pores of microfiltration mf membranes used for mbrs therefore nanobubbles introduced from the permeate side during backwashing might exhibit cleaning effects for membranes since applications of nanobubbles for cleaning of various materials such as protein coated gold electrodes and stainless steel have been reported the effectiveness of nbb was compared with that of tap water backwashing twb and chemically enhanced backwashing ceb using 50 ppm naclo experiments were carried out by using three bench scale mbrs installed at a local wastewater treatment plant the three mbrs were operated in parallel with identical operating conditions except for backwashing conditions polyethylene glycol peg granular materials were inserted in each membrane tank to scour the membrane surface regardless of the variation of the feed nbb always exhibited better cleaning performance than twb and the cleaning efficiency of nbb was sometimes comparable to that of ceb the degree of reversible fouling observed with twb was 424 higher than that with nbb indicating that nbb is much more effective than twb for the control of reversible fouling it was also found that nbb could mitigate irreversible fouling even in the absence of a thick protective layer on the surface of the membrane it was attempted to reveal the mechanism by which nbb enhances the cleaning effect by carrying out comprehensive analysis of the distribution of filtration resistance mixed liquor suspension and the fouling layer significant changes in microbial activity of the mixed liquor suspension and sludge properties in the mbrs were not observed when nbb was carried out the results of the analysis suggested that nbb made the structure of the fouling layer more porous possibly facilitating the removal of the fouling layer from the membrane graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane cleaning nanobubble backwashing chemically enhanced backwashing ceramic membranes fouling layer

granular material scouring antifouling membranes optimization of operating conditions coagulation and diverse cleaning protocols have been presented 4 7 the application of ceramic membranes is also increasing ceramic membranes are compact can withstand heat and high pressures have a long life and are resistant to chemical physical damage therefore ceramic membranes can be used with intensive cleaning without collapsing 8 9 kimura et al 10 showed that granular scouring was effective for controlling membrane fouling intensive physical cleaning with granular materials was possible due to the high resistance of ceramic membranes although these countermeasures are effective to some extent further improvements in cleaning efficiency are still necessary to promote the widespread installation of mbrs and bring impactful changes to wastewater treatment systems nanobubbles nbs also called ultrafine bubbles are defined as fine bubbles with a volume equivalent diameter smaller than 1 μm 10 nbs have unique characteristics including high stability durability large surface area per unit volume and a negative surface charge 11 12 recently the use of nbs for various cleaning applications has been investigated and their cleaning efficiencies have been reported as summarized in table s1 the mechanisms for their high cleaning efficiencies are still being investigated also applications of nbs for cleaning membranes used for water and wastewater treatment have recently been investigated ghadimkhani et al 13 investigated the cleaning of flat sheet ceramic membranes that were completely clogged with humic acid by air nbs in their study membrane cleaning was performed by flushing the surface of the fouled membranes with water containing nbs after continuously flushing for 6 h the permeate flux was almost completely recovered they suggested that the cleaning effect was attributed to reactive oxygen species ros generated during the collapse of nbs dayarathne et al applied micro nano bubbles mnb size range of 150 nm to 250 nm for cleaning reverse osmosis ro membranes mnbs were added to saline water nacl 35 g l and were circulated in the feed water channel to clean the surfaces of fouled ro membranes they observed that mnbs could completely restore the water permeability of the membranes by disrupting the concentration polarization layer formed on the membrane surface 14 the same research group conducted another study using mnbs for chemical free scale inhibition and compared them with commercially available antiscalants they concluded that introducing mnbs in the feed solutions of ro systems was more effective for maintaining permeability than using commercially available antiscalants the mechanism of the high anti scaling effect of mnbs was explained by their stimulation of a turbulent flow and their physicochemical properties including adsorption capacity and negative zeta potential 15 farid et al 16 used water containing nbs to clean membranes used in a forward osmosis fo system treating aquaculture wastewater adding nbs into the feed water reduced the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface they hypothesized that reactive radicals and shock pressure waves were produced when introduced nbs collapsed and subsequentially hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed stream could be improved in a later study 17 they investigated the effects of introducing nbs into the feed of membrane distillation md systems treating high salinity brine severe membrane scaling occurred on the surface of the membrane tested without nbs while little salt deposition was observed on the surface of the membrane in the presence of nbs they attributed it to two mechanisms high surface shear forces caused by flow turbulence generated by nbs and adsorption of ions onto the nb surface by the negative zeta potential of nbs the results of those studies in which nbs were used for cleaning membranes and the difficulties in cleaning them as mentioned before motivated the use of nbs for cleaning membranes used in mbrs to the best of our knowledge the application of nbs for fouling mitigation in mbrs has not been reported in the literature in addition the lack of studies on the use of nbs for membrane backwashing brings novelty to our study in our preliminary study 18 in which surface flushing with nb water of membranes fouled in mbrs had limiting cleaning effect it was also observed that nbs could pass through the pores of microfiltration mf membranes it was therefore thought that backwashing using water containing nbs nanobubble backwashing nbb could effectively clean mf membranes used for mbrs in this study the effectiveness of nbb was compared with that of twb and ceb with naclo on the basis of multiple experiments in which three bench scale mbrs installed at a local wastewater treatment plant were operated in parallel with different backwashing solutions as shown later nbb could be as effective as ceb and be regarded as an environmentally friendly membrane cleaning it was also attempted to reveal the mechanism by which nbb enhances cleaning in this study 2 methods 2 1 parallel operation of bench scale mbrs flat sheet ceramic membranes material alumina al2o3 with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and an available area of 0 04 m2 meidensha tokyo japan were inserted in each of the three identical bench scale mbrs pure water permeability and porosity of the membrane used in this study were 7 7 0 4 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 and 44 1 1 0 19 respectively the three mbrs were repeatedly operated side by side at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant in sapporo japan average values of the ph and electrical conductivity of the influent wastewater were 7 3 and 400 μs cm 1 respectively in japan any industrial wastewater that may have harmful effects on treatment needs to be adequately treated before it is discharged to the public sewer system therefore it is thought that the impact of industrial wastewater was minor in this study a schematic figure of each mbr system is presented in fig 1 the seed biomass used in all experiments was sourced from a pilot scale mbr installed at the same facility a volume of 7 5 l of aerated sludge was manually transferred from the pilot scale mbr to each bench scale mbr before starting the operation all three bench scale mbrs shared the same influent wastewater effluents from the primary sedimentation tank and were operated under the same conditions except for the backwash solutions as described in the next section the operation of the bench scale mbrs was conducted at a sludge retention time srt of 30 days which was the same as that for the pilot scale mbr it was therefore assumed that acclimatization for the bench scale mbrs was not necessary and the operation of the reactors was initiated immediately after the seeding of the biomass aeration was continuously conducted in the tanks during the operation at a fixed rate of 0 012 nm3 min 1 four runs of the experiments runs 1 4 were conducted in different seasons and at different permeate fluxes to investigate the efficiency of nbb the operational conditions in runs 1 4 are shown in table 1 the permeate fluxes of the bench scale mbrs in runs 1 4 were set at high values of 50 and 60 and l m 2 h 1 lmh which is considerably high compared to the standard practice in a full scale mbr operation in which the flux is generally set in the range of 15 25 lmh 20 such high fluxes were applied in this study to accelerate membrane fouling and facilitate distinguishing the differences in fouling in the three mbrs backwashed with different solutions the cleaning intensity applied in this study was high and it was expected that it would take a long time to observe fouling when the flux was set at a normal value such as 20 lmh the concentrations of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in the bench scale mbrs were different in each run of experiments reflecting fluctuations in the quality of wastewater entering the wwtp and the conditions in the pilot scale mbr from which the seeding biomass was obtained to investigate the mechanisms by which nbb can mitigate fouling another experiment run 5 was carried out to perform various analyses for the fouled membranes and the characteristics of sludge the operational conditions in run 5 are also shown in table 1 in run 5 a further higher flux of 80 lmh was set in order to accelerate fouling and clarify the differences caused by different backwashing solutions 2 2 membrane cleaning measures intermittent filtration was carried out in all runs a 1 min pause was provided for every 11 min of filtration time cylindrical polyethylene glycol peg granular materials size 4 mm specific density 1 01 g cm 3 were placed in each membrane tank 5 volume of the membrane tank to scour the membrane surface the granules were kept suspended by coarse bubble aeration provided from the bottom of the reactor high efficiency of granular scouring for cleaning membranes in mbrs particularly when combined with ceb 9 has already been confirmed 5 the use of robust membranes enables the application of such intensive cleanings and that is why ceramic membranes were used in this study periodical backwashing cleaning was automatically carried out in this study different solutions were used for backwashing in the three mbrs whereas the frequency duration and backwashing flux were the same mbr 1 was operated with hydraulic backwashing using tap water twb tap water was also used for the preparation of nb water and the 50 ppm naclo solution used for nbb mbr 2 and ceb mbr 3 respectively in this study 50 ppm naclo was chosen as a reagent for ceb because it could effectively control the fouling in mbrs operated at the same wastewater treatment plant 9 backwashing was conducted periodically for every 5 h of filtration at a constant flux of 8 lmh backwashing lasted for 60 min with aeration and granular scouring in each event these backwashing conditions were chosen on the basis of our previous study 9 in which the combination of granular scouring and ceb using 50 ppm naclo exhibited a high cleaning efficiency 2 3 generation of nanobubbles nbs nanobubbles source air were generated using a commercially available nb generator manufactured by idec corporation fz1n 7h osaka japan this device applies the pressurized dissolution method pressure 290 310 kpa to generate bubbles in the nanometer scale nb water was generated in the laboratory with tap water and used for nbb at the experimental site within 15 h after generation it has been reported that nbs stably exist in water over a long period e g several weeks 21 22 the long term stability of nbs was also verified in our previous study fig s1 particle numbers before and after generating nbs were measured fig s2 as shown in fig s2 the particle number significantly increased after the generation of nbs and it was confirmed that nbs quantified in this study were not other particles it was therefore assumed that nbs were present in bulk and mostly maintained when they were used for nbb at the experimental site nanoparticle tracking analysis nanosight 500 uk was used to measure the size distribution and concentration of nbs 2 4 measurement of filtration resistances of membranes the distribution of filtration resistances of the membranes was assessed prior to and at the termination of each run the fouled membranes were taken out of the tanks immersed in tap water and subjected to the measurement of water filterability the following equations were used to calculate the filtration resistances 1 r t δp j μ 2 r t r mb r rv r ir 3 r rv r t r f 4 r ir r f r mb where δp is the trans membrane pressure tmp pa j is the permeate flux m 3 m 2 s 1 μ is the viscosity of the permeate pa s r t is the total membrane filtration resistance m 1 r mb is the membrane s intrinsic filtration resistance m 1 r rv is the reversible fouling resistance surface fouling and r ir is the irreversible fouling resistance internal fouling r t r mb and r f are determined empirically r t is defined as the fouled membrane resistance recorded immediately after the termination of the experiment and r f r mb r ir is the filtration resistance measured after removing the deposited gel cake layer from the membrane surface with sponge cleaning 5 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc in the feed and permeate samples were measured by a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu kyoto japan concentrations of inorganic nitrogen forms including ammonium nh 4 nitrite no 2 and nitrate no 3 were measured using an ion chromatography device thermofisher scientific waltham united states of america concentrations of mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined according to the standard methods 23 filterability of sludge in each mbr was characterized by capillary suction time cst which was measured by a specifically designed device cst304b triton electronics ltd united kingdom a liquid chromatography device equipped with an organic carbon detector lc ocd model 8 doc labor dr huber karlsruhe germany was used to fractionate the dissolved organic matter excitation emission matrixes eems were generated by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer aqualog drjr764f horiba kyoto japan before the analysis for doc lc ocd and eems samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe filter advantec tokyo japan foulants deposited on the membrane surface were collected for analysis using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir freeze dried samples were mixed with potassium bromide kbr at a 1 200 ratio and then analyzed using an infrared spectrophotometer ftir 8400s shimadzu kyoto japan scanning electron microscopy sem s 4000 hitachi tokyo japan was used to observe the surfaces and cross sections of the membranes fouled in run 5 to observe the cross section of the fouling layer the fouled membranes were broken into small pieces about 1 cm2 by using a needle and a hammer and they were immersed in 2 glutaraldehyde with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 2 at 5 c for two hours to fix the structure of the fouling layer the treated samples were then fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide with 0 1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated at a series of different concentrations of ethanol before observing the membrane surfaces by sem the samples were dried using a critical point drying apparatus em cpd300 leica microsystems wetzlar germany they were subsequently coated with an auto fine coater jfc 1200 jeol tokyo japan using a platinum sputter to prevent the accumulation of a static electric charge during observations the morphology of the fouled membrane surface was also visualized by using atomic force microscopy afm spa 400 hitachi tokyo japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 nb size distribution fig 2 shows representative size distributions of nbs measured before and after passage through the ceramic membrane used in this study a ceramic membrane was backwashed with nb water and samples were taken for size distribution analysis the backwashing flux was the same as that described in section 2 2 8 lmh a new membrane was used for this test as shown in fig 2 a significant portion of nbs could penetrate the ceramic membrane in the sample for which data are shown in fig 2 the total nb concentration before filtration was 1 96 108 nb ml which is comparable to the reported values in related papers 24 25 the average sizes of nbs before and after passage through the membranes were 168 nm and 108 nm respectively it was clearly demonstrated that by the sieving effect small nbs selectively penetrated the membrane and large nbs could not penetrate it it was therefore assumed that nbs could be transported to the fouling layer from the permeate side during nbb 3 2 cleaning achieved by nbb fig 3 shows increases in tmp observed in runs 1 4 in the three mbrs operated side by side with different backwashing solutions mbr 1 twb mbr 2 nbb mbr 3 ceb the increase in tmp shown in fig 3 was relatively rapid as a result of setting membrane fluxes at high values of 50 60 lmh runs 1 4 were carried out in different seasons the quality of the feed water i e the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was therefore different in runs 1 4 it should be noted that real domestic wastewater was used in this study differences in the rates of tmp increases and displayed in the four panels of fig 3 partly reflect the differences in the feed water quality oscillations in tmp shown in fig 3 represent quick reattachments of foulants that were dislodged and or compaction of the fouling layer that was loosened in the previous backwash regardless of the season when the experiments were carried out i e quality of the feed wastewater as shown in fig 3 nbb exhibited better cleaning performance than did twb data on the filtration resistance assessed in run 2 are shown in fig s3 the mitigation of reversible fouling was more significant in the case of nbb when compared to twb irreversible fouling could be controlled relatively well by nbb and ceb although protection by the fouling layer reversible fouling was limited this indicates that nbs enhanced cleaning efficiency when introduced into the backwashing solution as expected ceb was much more efficient than twb it should be noted though that the performance of nbb was sometimes comparable to that of ceb runs 1 and 2 inevitable changes in the quality of municipal wastewater and temperature in the mbr tanks might explain the different effectiveness of nbb in runs 1 4 compared to ceb tmp data were converted to temperature corrected permeability data to remove the effect of temperature differences as shown in fig s4 membranes cleaned with twb showed more significant decreases in permeability than those cleaned with nbb and ceb nbb was effective for fouling mitigation and possible reasons for the high cleaning efficiency of nbb are discussed in the next section the data shown in fig 3 indicates an immense potential of nbb as an environmentally friendly measure for cleaning fouled membranes 3 3 investigation of fouling mitigation caused by nbb in run 5 3 3 1 distribution of filtration resistances based on the results obtained in runs 1 4 another experiment run 5 was conducted in order to try to reveal the mechanisms by which nbb improves cleaning efficiency fig 4 shows the increases in tmp observed in run 5 although a high permeate flux of 80 lmh was applied in run 5 the rate of tmp increase was not much higher than that in runs 1 4 this is due to the higher temperature in run 5 see table 1 and a very good condition of the mixed liquor suspension in terms of filterability as supported by low values of cst of the sludge samples collected from each bench scale mbr fig s5 in the cases of the reactors operated with ceb and nbb the rates of tmp increase were low in run 5 even at the high flux of 80 lmh as shown in fig 4 the performance of nbb was clearly higher than that of twb and slightly less than that of ceb on the second day of run 5 a sudden increase in tmp was observed in mbr 2 nbb although the reason for this increase in tmp could not be clearly identified it is very likely that it was due to the daily adjustment of permeate flux after that however increase in tmp in mbr 2 was hardly seen and the rate of tmp increase with nbb was comparable to that with ceb the high cleaning efficiency of nbb observed in runs 1 4 fig 3 could therefore be confirmed in run 5 temperature correction of membrane permeability was also performed for the data obtained in run 5 as shown in fig s4 deterioration of permeability was less significant in the mbr cleaned with ceb it was shown again that nbb was more effective for maintaining the permeability than was twb temperature corrected permeability data corroborates the tmp data shown previously when run 5 was terminated the distribution of filtration resistances in the three mbrs was assessed the intrinsic filtration resistances of the membranes used in run 5 and operated with twb nbb and ceb were 2 17 1011 m 1 2 06 1011 m 1 and 2 15 1011 m 1 respectively the summation of the intrinsic and irreversible fouling resistances did not vary among the three mbrs suggesting that differences in the degree of membrane fouling shown in fig 4 were due not to pore fouling but to gel cake layer formation the distributions of filtration resistance assessed at the termination of run 5 are shown in fig 5 indicating that surface fouling was dominant in the mbr operated with twb the severe degree of reversible fouling which can be partly attributed to the high flux imposed in run 5 80 lmh could not be mitigated with the combined effects of granular scouring and hydraulic backwashing in contrast mbr 2 nbb and mbr 3 ceb exhibited significantly lower degrees of reversible fouling whereas the degrees of irreversible fouling were comparable among the three mbrs it is expected that a thick fouling layer as shown in section 3 3 5 on the surface of membranes operated with twb would serve as a protective film helping to mitigate irreversible fouling on the other hand the low degree of irreversible fouling resistance in the cases of membranes cleaned by nbs and naclo indicates that nbb and ceb were effective for mitigation of irreversible fouling even in the absence of such thick protective layers the high cleaning efficiency of nbb observed was therefore attributed to the reduction of reversible surface fouling which was also observed in runs 1 4 it could be argued that such a high permeate flux is uncommon in municipal applications of mbrs thus the fouling developing in this study was more difficult to control remove than that formed in mbr systems working at lower fluxes as demonstrated in this work nbb could work for control of the difficult fouling formed in this study therefore it is safe to assume that nbb can also work for control of easy fouling observed in other mbrs operated at lower fluxes as shown in the following sections an attempt was made to determine why the introduction of nbs into the backwashing water can mitigate reversible fouling 3 3 2 influence of backwashing solution on sludge and treatment performance the characteristics of the mixed liquor suspension and the permeate water quality in run 5 fig 4 are summarized in the supplementary materials fig s6 shows the concentration of nitrogen species in the permeate ammonium nitrogen was not detected in any permeate samples indicating that sufficient nitrification occurred in the mbrs fig s7 shows the concentration of toc in the permeate obtained in run 5 rates of toc removal were approximately 95 in all reactors it can therefore be concluded that differences in the backwashing solution did not affect the treatment performance in the three mbrs in run 5 as shown in fig s8 mlss mlvss concentrations in each mbr also did not vary significantly in run 5 csts of sludge samples collected from each mbr fig s5 were also similar in the three mbrs therefore in run 5 there was no significant difference among the three mbrs in terms of treatment performance and sludge properties although several studies suggested that exposures of microorganisms to nbs provided them with extra oxygen supply leading to enhanced structures of microbial aggregates and evolution of bacterial communities 26 28 such benefits for microorganisms were not clearly seen in this study nbs introduced to the mbr via backwashing did not alter the mixed liquor suspension significantly in run 5 the high cleaning efficiency observed with nbb is therefore due to other factors 3 3 3 influence of backwashing solution on dissolved organic matter in the sludge supernatant to further investigate the impacts of backwashing solutions on the mixed liquor suspension dissolved organic matter in the sludge supernatant was analyzed several studies have shown that the dissolved organic matter dom in the mixed liquor suspension of mbrs is a cause of the acceleration of membrane fouling 29 30 thus sludge suspensions of the three bench scale mbrs were taken at the termination of run 5 and the respective supernatants were analyzed using lc ocd and eem apparatuses fig 6 shows lc ocd chromatograms of sludge supernatant samples collected from the three mbrs biopolymers which have been shown to be related to membrane fouling in mbrs 31 were not observed in any samples very low cst values in run 5 as shown in fig s5 are a reflection of good filterability of the sludge and absence of large molecules such as biopolymers in the mixed liquor suspension instead humic substances hs retention time of 100 min and building blocks bb retention time of 110 min were present in the sludge supernatant 31 as indicated by the chromatograms no significantly different peaks were observed among the three mbrs at the termination of run 5 the same conclusion could be drawn from eem analysis as shown in fig 7 all of the spectra showed distinctive peaks in the same regions the fluorescence peaks observed in the samples collected from all of the bench scale mbrs were very similar based on the data obtained by lc ocd and eem analysis it can be concluded that dom in the three mbrs was similar in run 5 regardless of the backwashing solution used dom has been reported to influence membrane fouling in mbrs 32 33 and a favorable change in dom might therefore explain the fouling mitigation observed in nbb however the results of lc ocd and eem analysis discounted this possibility 3 3 4 ft ir of the fouling layer ft ir is a powerful analytical method for assessing the characteristics of diverse types of organic matter and has been used in fouling studies 34 36 at the termination of run 5 gel layers were collected from the membrane surfaces from the bench scale mbrs operated with twb and nbb and were analyzed by ftir fig 8 shows ftir spectra of samples collected at the termination of run 5 ftir spectra of the sample collected from mbr 3 ceb could not be obtained due to the limited amount of the sample peaks at 1040 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 wavenumbers represent polysaccharides 37 while peaks at 1411 cm 1 1550 cm 1 and 1655 cm 1 wavenumbers are attributed to amide like substances suggesting the presence of proteins 38 on the other hand absorption peaks around 2920 cm 1 represent lipids 39 the relative signal intensity profiles were quite similar in the two samples suggesting that the gel layers collected from the two mbrs operated with twb and nbb had similar compositions it can be concluded that introducing nbs into the backwashing solution did not alter the components of the fouling layer thus in this study it was not likely that the fouling layer composition explained the difference in tmp evolution observed with twb and nbb instead it was hypothesized that the fouling layer structure played a more critical role in the high performance of nbb 3 3 5 structures of the fouling layer observed by sem and afm sem and afm were used to visualize the fouling layer developed on the membrane surface fig 9 a shows a cross section of a membrane backwashed by twb whereas fig 9 b shows a fouled membrane backwashed by nbb in fig 9 cross section images corresponding to the ceramic membrane are hidden as the supplier of the membrane did not permit it to be shown we attempted to determine the thicknesses of the fouling layers by observing different pieces of the samples of the fouled membranes fig s9 the thickness of the fouling layer on the twb sample 1 93 μm 0 38 μm was larger than that on the nbb sample 1 49 μm 0 38 μm as shown in fig s10 the significance of the difference between the mean thicknesses of the fouling layers was statistically assessed the p value obtained from student s t test was smaller than 0 05 i e 0 001 meaning that the thickness of the fouling layer on the twb sample was significantly greater than that on the nbb sample tables s2 s3 formation of a thick fouling layer could be linked to the high degree of reversible fouling observed with twb however the difference in the thicknesses of fouling layers observed with twb and nbb in run 5 30 was not proportional to the difference in reversible fouling 424 fig 5 additional factors such as differences in the structure of the fouling layer might play a role in enhancing the fouling mitigation effect of nbb however such differences could not be detected by sem observation to assess the potential differences in the structures of fouling layers formed with twb and nbb the surfaces of the fouled membranes were observed after the termination of run 5 using afm fig 10 shows representative afm images obtained the surface roughness of each fouling layer was also determined from the afm images six different areas were quantitatively assessed the mean surface roughness was calculated at ten different sites from a total of sixty observations fig s11 shows the results of the measurements the membrane operated with twb showed a surface roughness of 382 9 nm 102 78 while the membrane cleaned by nbb had a roughness of 414 8 nm 94 8 nm in the afm images the fouling layer on the surface of the membrane backwashed by nbb appears to be rougher suggesting that the fouling layer in the mbr backwashed with nbb had a more porous structure than that with twb this might enhance the effectiveness of granular scouring however the rougher fouling layer could also entrap pollutants in its valleys it is thought though that the enhanced granular scouring could offset the accumulation of pollutants this is the current possible explanation for the low degree of reversible fouling with nbb fig 5 although neither sem nor afm could demonstrate that the surface structure of the fouling layer was altered by nbb it was postulated that nbs intruded into the gel layer and made its internal structure loose the disproportion between the thickness of the fouling layer and the degree of reversible fouling mentioned above support this postulation also we postulate that nbs might have lifted up the gel layer when they were introduced at the interface between the membrane and the gel layer it has been reported that free radicals could be produced when nbs collapse 40 42 which might also change the structure of the gel layer however it was shown in this study that the resolution of the sem afm was not sufficient to detect the changes in the structure of the gel layer caused by nbb thus further investigation is needed to determine the causes of the high cleaning efficiency of nbb 4 summary in this study a novel method for cleaning of membranes fouled in mbrs backwashing with nb containing water was investigated experiments were carried out at an existing wastewater treatment plant with real municipal wastewater regardless of the season when the experiments were carried out i e differences in the quality of the feed wastewater the cleaning performance of nbb was always higher than that of twb clearly indicating the high potential of nbb for membrane cleaning it was found that nbb could lower the degree of reversible fouling and was also effective for the control of irreversible fouling the degree of reversible fouling observed with twb was 424 higher than that with nbb we attempted to identify the reasons why nbb lowered the reversible fouling comprehensive analysis of the mixed liquor suspension revealed that the introduction of nbs did not alter its characteristics also the composition of the fouling layer did not change with nbb on the other hand significant reduction in the thickness of the fouling layer was observed by sem observations when nbb was applied the fouling layer on the surface of twb samples was 30 thicker than that on nbb samples it was therefore postulated that rather than changes in the composition the structure of the fouling layer might have been modified when nbb was carried out although conventional sem afm observation could not detect such changes although the mechanisms of fouling mitigation by nbb could not be fully revealed this study gives a major contribution to the research on fouling mitigation by nbs since this study is the first study on the application of nbb there is a lot of room for investigation for instance the backwashing conditions used in this study were based on previous research that confirmed the efficiency of ceb for mitigation of membrane fouling however the backwashing conditions for nbb were not optimized and further research should therefore be carried out in addition there is a need to investigate the effects of varying characteristics of nbs on the cleaning efficiency of nbb we postulate that altering the concentration size or zeta potential of nbs would further enhance the cleaning efficiency of nbb finally by revealing the mechanisms by which nbb mitigates fouling nbb could be established as an environmentally friendly measure for membrane cleaning to do so innovative

12506,widespread application of membrane bioreactors mbrs is still difficult because of the problem of membrane fouling which increases operational and maintenance costs a novel approach to mitigate fouling in mbrs nanobubble assisted backwashing nbb is presented in this paper nanobubbles generated in this study had an average diameter of about 150 nm and some of the nanobubbles could pass through the pores of microfiltration mf membranes used for mbrs therefore nanobubbles introduced from the permeate side during backwashing might exhibit cleaning effects for membranes since applications of nanobubbles for cleaning of various materials such as protein coated gold electrodes and stainless steel have been reported the effectiveness of nbb was compared with that of tap water backwashing twb and chemically enhanced backwashing ceb using 50 ppm naclo experiments were carried out by using three bench scale mbrs installed at a local wastewater treatment plant the three mbrs were operated in parallel with identical operating conditions except for backwashing conditions polyethylene glycol peg granular materials were inserted in each membrane tank to scour the membrane surface regardless of the variation of the feed nbb always exhibited better cleaning performance than twb and the cleaning efficiency of nbb was sometimes comparable to that of ceb the degree of reversible fouling observed with twb was 424 higher than that with nbb indicating that nbb is much more effective than twb for the control of reversible fouling it was also found that nbb could mitigate irreversible fouling even in the absence of a thick protective layer on the surface of the membrane it was attempted to reveal the mechanism by which nbb enhances the cleaning effect by carrying out comprehensive analysis of the distribution of filtration resistance mixed liquor suspension and the fouling layer significant changes in microbial activity of the mixed liquor suspension and sludge properties in the mbrs were not observed when nbb was carried out the results of the analysis suggested that nbb made the structure of the fouling layer more porous possibly facilitating the removal of the fouling layer from the membrane graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane cleaning nanobubble backwashing chemically enhanced backwashing ceramic membranes fouling layer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the use of submerged membrane bioreactors mbrs has been increasing since their first introduction in a paper in 1989 by japanese and thai engineers 1 mbr technology has significant advantages over conventional activated sludge cas processes including complete removal of bacteria high effluent quality small footprint ease of operation and expandability nevertheless the widespread application of mbrs still faces a major obstacle membrane fouling the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface and inside its pores requires periodic cleaning which increases operational and maintenance costs and reduces membrane lifetime 2 3 several measures to mitigate membrane fouling in mbrs including intensive aeration granular material scouring antifouling membranes optimization of operating conditions coagulation and diverse cleaning protocols have been presented 4 7 the application of ceramic membranes is also increasing ceramic membranes are compact can withstand heat and high pressures have a long life and are resistant to chemical physical damage therefore ceramic membranes can be used with intensive cleaning without collapsing 8 9 kimura et al 10 showed that granular scouring was effective for controlling membrane fouling intensive physical cleaning with granular materials was possible due to the high resistance of ceramic membranes although these countermeasures are effective to some extent further improvements in cleaning efficiency are still necessary to promote the widespread installation of mbrs and bring impactful changes to wastewater treatment systems nanobubbles nbs also called ultrafine bubbles are defined as fine bubbles with a volume equivalent diameter smaller than 1 μm 10 nbs have unique characteristics including high stability durability large surface area per unit volume and a negative surface charge 11 12 recently the use of nbs for various cleaning applications has been investigated and their cleaning efficiencies have been reported as summarized in table s1 the mechanisms for their high cleaning efficiencies are still being investigated also applications of nbs for cleaning membranes used for water and wastewater treatment have recently been investigated ghadimkhani et al 13 investigated the cleaning of flat sheet ceramic membranes that were completely clogged with humic acid by air nbs in their study membrane cleaning was performed by flushing the surface of the fouled membranes with water containing nbs after continuously flushing for 6 h the permeate flux was almost completely recovered they suggested that the cleaning effect was attributed to reactive oxygen species ros generated during the collapse of nbs dayarathne et al applied micro nano bubbles mnb size range of 150 nm to 250 nm for cleaning reverse osmosis ro membranes mnbs were added to saline water nacl 35 g l and were circulated in the feed water channel to clean the surfaces of fouled ro membranes they observed that mnbs could completely restore the water permeability of the membranes by disrupting the concentration polarization layer formed on the membrane surface 14 the same research group conducted another study using mnbs for chemical free scale inhibition and compared them with commercially available antiscalants they concluded that introducing mnbs in the feed solutions of ro systems was more effective for maintaining permeability than using commercially available antiscalants the mechanism of the high anti scaling effect of mnbs was explained by their stimulation of a turbulent flow and their physicochemical properties including adsorption capacity and negative zeta potential 15 farid et al 16 used water containing nbs to clean membranes used in a forward osmosis fo system treating aquaculture wastewater adding nbs into the feed water reduced the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface they hypothesized that reactive radicals and shock pressure waves were produced when introduced nbs collapsed and subsequentially hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed stream could be improved in a later study 17 they investigated the effects of introducing nbs into the feed of membrane distillation md systems treating high salinity brine severe membrane scaling occurred on the surface of the membrane tested without nbs while little salt deposition was observed on the surface of the membrane in the presence of nbs they attributed it to two mechanisms high surface shear forces caused by flow turbulence generated by nbs and adsorption of ions onto the nb surface by the negative zeta potential of nbs the results of those studies in which nbs were used for cleaning membranes and the difficulties in cleaning them as mentioned before motivated the use of nbs for cleaning membranes used in mbrs to the best of our knowledge the application of nbs for fouling mitigation in mbrs has not been reported in the literature in addition the lack of studies on the use of nbs for membrane backwashing brings novelty to our study in our preliminary study 18 in which surface flushing with nb water of membranes fouled in mbrs had limiting cleaning effect it was also observed that nbs could pass through the pores of microfiltration mf membranes it was therefore thought that backwashing using water containing nbs nanobubble backwashing nbb could effectively clean mf membranes used for mbrs in this study the effectiveness of nbb was compared with that of twb and ceb with naclo on the basis of multiple experiments in which three bench scale mbrs installed at a local wastewater treatment plant were operated in parallel with different backwashing solutions as shown later nbb could be as effective as ceb and be regarded as an environmentally friendly membrane cleaning it was also attempted to reveal the mechanism by which nbb enhances cleaning in this study 2 methods 2 1 parallel operation of bench scale mbrs flat sheet ceramic membranes material alumina al2o3 with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and an available area of 0 04 m2 meidensha tokyo japan were inserted in each of the three identical bench scale mbrs pure water permeability and porosity of the membrane used in this study were 7 7 0 4 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 and 44 1 1 0 19 respectively the three mbrs were repeatedly operated side by side at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant in sapporo japan average values of the ph and electrical conductivity of the influent wastewater were 7 3 and 400 μs cm 1 respectively in japan any industrial wastewater that may have harmful effects on treatment needs to be adequately treated before it is discharged to the public sewer system therefore it is thought that the impact of industrial wastewater was minor in this study a schematic figure of each mbr system is presented in fig 1 the seed biomass used in all experiments was sourced from a pilot scale mbr installed at the same facility a volume of 7 5 l of aerated sludge was manually transferred from the pilot scale mbr to each bench scale mbr before starting the operation all three bench scale mbrs shared the same influent wastewater effluents from the primary sedimentation tank and were operated under the same conditions except for the backwash solutions as described in the next section the operation of the bench scale mbrs was conducted at a sludge retention time srt of 30 days which was the same as that for the pilot scale mbr it was therefore assumed that acclimatization for the bench scale mbrs was not necessary and the operation of the reactors was initiated immediately after the seeding of the biomass aeration was continuously conducted in the tanks during the operation at a fixed rate of 0 012 nm3 min 1 four runs of the experiments runs 1 4 were conducted in different seasons and at different permeate fluxes to investigate the efficiency of nbb the operational conditions in runs 1 4 are shown in table 1 the permeate fluxes of the bench scale mbrs in runs 1 4 were set at high values of 50 and 60 and l m 2 h 1 lmh which is considerably high compared to the standard practice in a full scale mbr operation in which the flux is generally set in the range of 15 25 lmh 20 such high fluxes were applied in this study to accelerate membrane fouling and facilitate distinguishing the differences in fouling in the three mbrs backwashed with different solutions the cleaning intensity applied in this study was high and it was expected that it would take a long time to observe fouling when the flux was set at a normal value such as 20 lmh the concentrations of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in the bench scale mbrs were different in each run of experiments reflecting fluctuations in the quality of wastewater entering the wwtp and the conditions in the pilot scale mbr from which the seeding biomass was obtained to investigate the mechanisms by which nbb can mitigate fouling another experiment run 5 was carried out to perform various analyses for the fouled membranes and the characteristics of sludge the operational conditions in run 5 are also shown in table 1 in run 5 a further higher flux of 80 lmh was set in order to accelerate fouling and clarify the differences caused by different backwashing solutions 2 2 membrane cleaning measures intermittent filtration was carried out in all runs a 1 min pause was provided for every 11 min of filtration time cylindrical polyethylene glycol peg granular materials size 4 mm specific density 1 01 g cm 3 were placed in each membrane tank 5 volume of the membrane tank to scour the membrane surface the granules were kept suspended by coarse bubble aeration provided from the bottom of the reactor high efficiency of granular scouring for cleaning membranes in mbrs particularly when combined with ceb 9 has already been confirmed 5 the use of robust membranes enables the application of such intensive cleanings and that is why ceramic membranes were used in this study periodical backwashing cleaning was automatically carried out in this study different solutions were used for backwashing in the three mbrs whereas the frequency duration and backwashing flux were the same mbr 1 was operated with hydraulic backwashing using tap water twb tap water was also used for the preparation of nb water and the 50 ppm naclo solution used for nbb mbr 2 and ceb mbr 3 respectively in this study 50 ppm naclo was chosen as a reagent for ceb because it could effectively control the fouling in mbrs operated at the same wastewater treatment plant 9 backwashing was conducted periodically for every 5 h of filtration at a constant flux of 8 lmh backwashing lasted for 60 min with aeration and granular scouring in each event these backwashing conditions were chosen on the basis of our previous study 9 in which the combination of granular scouring and ceb using 50 ppm naclo exhibited a high cleaning efficiency 2 3 generation of nanobubbles nbs nanobubbles source air were generated using a commercially available nb generator manufactured by idec corporation fz1n 7h osaka japan this device applies the pressurized dissolution method pressure 290 310 kpa to generate bubbles in the nanometer scale nb water was generated in the laboratory with tap water and used for nbb at the experimental site within 15 h after generation it has been reported that nbs stably exist in water over a long period e g several weeks 21 22 the long term stability of nbs was also verified in our previous study fig s1 particle numbers before and after generating nbs were measured fig s2 as shown in fig s2 the particle number significantly increased after the generation of nbs and it was confirmed that nbs quantified in this study were not other particles it was therefore assumed that nbs were present in bulk and mostly maintained when they were used for nbb at the experimental site nanoparticle tracking analysis nanosight 500 uk was used to measure the size distribution and concentration of nbs 2 4 measurement of filtration resistances of membranes the distribution of filtration resistances of the membranes was assessed prior to and at the termination of each run the fouled membranes were taken out of the tanks immersed in tap water and subjected to the measurement of water filterability the following equations were used to calculate the filtration resistances 1 r t δp j μ 2 r t r mb r rv r ir 3 r rv r t r f 4 r ir r f r mb where δp is the trans membrane pressure tmp pa j is the permeate flux m 3 m 2 s 1 μ is the

and r ir is the irreversible fouling resistance internal fouling r t r mb and r f are determined empirically r t is defined as the fouled membrane resistance recorded immediately after the termination of the experiment and r f r mb r ir is the filtration resistance measured after removing the deposited gel cake layer from the membrane surface with sponge cleaning 5 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc in the feed and permeate samples were measured by a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu kyoto japan concentrations of inorganic nitrogen forms including ammonium nh 4 nitrite no 2 and nitrate no 3 were measured using an ion chromatography device thermofisher scientific waltham united states of america concentrations of mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined according to the standard methods 23 filterability of sludge in each mbr was characterized by capillary suction time cst which was measured by a specifically designed device cst304b triton electronics ltd united kingdom a liquid chromatography device equipped with an organic carbon detector lc ocd model 8 doc labor dr huber karlsruhe germany was used to fractionate the dissolved organic matter excitation emission matrixes eems were generated by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer aqualog drjr764f horiba kyoto japan before the analysis for doc lc ocd and eems samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe filter advantec tokyo japan foulants deposited on the membrane surface were collected for analysis using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir freeze dried samples were mixed with potassium bromide kbr at a 1 200 ratio and then analyzed using an infrared spectrophotometer ftir 8400s shimadzu kyoto japan scanning electron microscopy sem s 4000 hitachi tokyo japan was used to observe the surfaces and cross sections of the membranes fouled in run 5 to observe the cross section of the fouling layer the fouled membranes were broken into small pieces about 1 cm2 by using a needle and a hammer and they were immersed in 2 glutaraldehyde with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 2 at 5 c for two hours to fix the structure of the fouling layer the treated samples were then fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide with 0 1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated at a series of different concentrations of ethanol before observing the membrane surfaces by sem the samples were dried using a critical point drying apparatus em cpd300 leica microsystems wetzlar germany they were subsequently coated with an auto fine coater jfc 1200 jeol tokyo japan using a platinum sputter to prevent the accumulation of a static electric charge during observations the morphology of the fouled membrane surface was also visualized by using atomic force microscopy afm spa 400 hitachi tokyo japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 nb size distribution fig 2 shows representative size distributions of nbs measured before and after passage through the ceramic membrane used in this study a ceramic membrane was backwashed with nb water and samples were taken for size distribution analysis the backwashing flux was the same as that described in section 2 2 8 lmh a new membrane was used for this test as shown in fig 2 a significant portion of nbs could penetrate the ceramic membrane in the sample for which data are shown in fig 2 the total nb concentration before filtration was 1 96 108 nb ml which is comparable to the reported values in related papers 24 25 the average sizes of nbs before and after passage through the membranes were 168 nm and 108 nm respectively it was clearly demonstrated that by the sieving effect small nbs selectively penetrated the membrane and large nbs could not penetrate it it was therefore assumed that nbs could be transported to the fouling layer from the permeate side during nbb 3 2 cleaning achieved by nbb fig 3 shows increases in tmp observed in runs 1 4 in the three mbrs operated side by side with different backwashing solutions mbr 1 twb mbr 2 nbb mbr 3 ceb the increase in tmp shown in fig 3 was relatively rapid as a result of setting membrane fluxes at high values of 50 60 lmh runs 1 4 were carried out in different seasons the quality of the feed water i e the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was therefore different in runs 1 4 it should be noted that real domestic wastewater was used in this study differences in the rates of tmp increases and displayed in the four panels of fig 3 partly reflect the differences in the feed water quality oscillations in tmp shown in fig 3 represent quick reattachments of foulants that were dislodged and or compaction of the fouling layer that was loosened in the previous backwash regardless of the season when the experiments were carried out i e quality of the feed wastewater as shown in fig 3 nbb exhibited better cleaning performance than did twb data on the filtration resistance assessed in run 2 are shown in fig s3 the mitigation of reversible fouling was more significant in the case of nbb when compared to twb irreversible fouling could be controlled relatively well by nbb and ceb although protection by the fouling layer reversible fouling was limited this indicates that nbs enhanced cleaning efficiency when introduced into the backwashing solution as expected ceb was much more efficient than twb it should be noted though that the performance of nbb was sometimes comparable to that of ceb runs 1 and 2 inevitable changes in the quality of municipal wastewater and temperature in the mbr tanks might explain the different effectiveness of nbb in runs 1 4 compared to ceb tmp data were converted to temperature corrected permeability data to remove the effect of temperature differences as shown in fig s4 membranes cleaned with twb showed more significant decreases in permeability than those cleaned with nbb and ceb nbb was effective for fouling mitigation and possible reasons for the high cleaning efficiency of nbb are discussed in the next section the data shown in fig 3 indicates an immense potential of nbb as an environmentally friendly measure for cleaning fouled membranes 3 3 investigation of fouling mitigation caused by nbb in run 5 3 3 1 distribution of filtration resistances based on the results obtained in runs 1 4 another experiment run 5 was conducted in order to try to reveal the mechanisms by which nbb improves cleaning efficiency fig 4 shows the increases in tmp observed in run 5 although a high permeate flux of 80 lmh was applied in run 5 the rate of tmp increase was not much higher than that in runs 1 4 this is due to the higher temperature in run 5 see table 1 and a very good condition of the mixed liquor suspension in terms of filterability as supported by low values of cst of the sludge samples collected from each bench scale mbr fig s5 in the cases of the reactors operated with ceb and nbb the rates of tmp increase were low in run 5 even at the high flux of 80 lmh as shown in fig 4 the performance of nbb was clearly higher than that of twb and slightly less than that of ceb on the second day of run 5 a sudden increase in tmp was observed in mbr 2 nbb although the reason for this increase in tmp could not be clearly identified it is very likely that it was due to the daily adjustment of permeate flux after that however increase in tmp in mbr 2 was hardly seen and the rate of tmp increase with nbb was comparable to that with ceb the high cleaning efficiency of nbb observed in runs 1 4 fig 3 could therefore be confirmed in run 5 temperature correction of membrane permeability was also performed for the data obtained in run 5 as shown in fig s4 deterioration of permeability was less significant in the mbr cleaned with ceb it was shown again that nbb was more effective for maintaining the permeability than was twb temperature corrected permeability data corroborates the tmp data shown previously when run 5 was terminated the distribution of filtration resistances in the three mbrs was assessed the intrinsic filtration resistances of the membranes used in run 5 and operated with twb nbb and ceb were 2 17 1011 m 1 2 06 1011 m 1 and 2 15 1011 m 1 respectively the summation of the intrinsic and irreversible fouling resistances did not vary among the three mbrs suggesting that differences in the degree of membrane fouling shown in fig 4 were due not to pore fouling but to gel cake layer formation the distributions of filtration resistance assessed at the termination of run 5 are shown in fig 5 indicating that surface fouling was dominant in the mbr operated with twb the severe degree of reversible fouling which can be partly attributed to the high flux imposed in run 5 80 lmh could not be mitigated with the combined effects of granular scouring and hydraulic backwashing in contrast mbr 2 nbb and mbr 3 ceb exhibited significantly lower degrees of reversible fouling whereas the degrees of irreversible fouling were comparable among the three mbrs it is expected that a thick fouling layer as shown in section 3 3 5 on the surface of membranes operated with twb would serve as a protective film helping to mitigate irreversible fouling on the other hand the low degree of irreversible fouling resistance in the cases of membranes cleaned by nbs and naclo indicates that nbb and ceb were effective for mitigation of irreversible fouling even in the absence of such thick protective layers the high cleaning efficiency of nbb observed was therefore attributed to the reduction of reversible surface fouling which was also observed in runs 1 4 it could be argued that such a high permeate flux is uncommon in municipal applications of mbrs thus the fouling developing in this study was more difficult to control remove than that formed in mbr systems working at lower fluxes as demonstrated in this work nbb could work for control of the difficult fouling formed in this study therefore it is safe to assume that nbb can also work for control of easy fouling observed in other mbrs operated at lower fluxes as shown in the following sections an attempt was made to determine why the introduction of nbs into the backwashing water can mitigate reversible fouling 3 3 2 influence of backwashing solution on sludge and treatment performance the characteristics of the mixed liquor suspension and the permeate water quality in run 5 fig 4 are summarized in the supplementary materials fig s6 shows the concentration of nitrogen species in the permeate ammonium nitrogen was not detected in any permeate samples indicating that sufficient nitrification occurred in the mbrs fig s7 shows the concentration of toc in the permeate obtained in run 5 rates of toc removal were approximately 95 in all reactors it can therefore be concluded that differences in the backwashing solution did not affect the treatment performance in the three mbrs in run 5 as shown in fig s8 mlss mlvss concentrations in each mbr also did not vary significantly in run 5 csts of sludge samples collected from each mbr fig s5 were also similar in the three mbrs therefore in run 5 there was no significant difference among the three mbrs in terms of treatment performance and sludge properties although several studies suggested that exposures of microorganisms to nbs provided them with extra oxygen supply leading to enhanced structures of microbial aggregates and evolution of bacterial communities 26 28 such benefits for microorganisms were not clearly seen in this study nbs introduced to the mbr via backwashing did not alter the mixed liquor suspension significantly in run 5 the high cleaning efficiency observed with nbb is therefore due to other factors 3 3 3 influence of backwashing solution on dissolved organic matter in the sludge supernatant to further investigate the impacts of backwashing solutions on the mixed liquor suspension dissolved organic matter in the sludge supernatant was analyzed several studies have shown that the dissolved organic matter dom in the mixed liquor suspension of mbrs is a cause of the acceleration of membrane fouling 29 30 thus sludge suspensions of the three bench scale mbrs were taken at the termination of run 5 and the respective supernatants were analyzed using lc ocd and eem apparatuses fig 6 shows lc ocd chromatograms of sludge supernatant samples collected from the three mbrs biopolymers which have been shown to be related to membrane fouling in mbrs 31 were not observed in any samples very low cst values in run 5 as shown in fig s5 are a reflection of good filterability of the sludge and absence of large molecules such as biopolymers in the mixed liquor suspension instead humic substances hs retention time of 100 min and building blocks bb retention time of 110 min were present in the sludge supernatant 31 as indicated by the chromatograms no significantly different peaks were observed among the three mbrs at the termination of run 5 the same conclusion could be drawn from eem analysis as shown in fig 7 all of the spectra showed distinctive peaks in the same regions the fluorescence peaks observed in the samples collected from all of the bench scale mbrs were very similar based on the data obtained by lc ocd and eem analysis it can be concluded that dom in the three mbrs was similar in run 5 regardless of the backwashing solution used dom has been reported to influence membrane fouling in mbrs 32 33 and a favorable change in dom might therefore explain the fouling mitigation observed in nbb however the results of lc ocd and eem analysis discounted this possibility 3 3 4 ft ir of the fouling layer ft ir is a powerful analytical method for assessing the characteristics of diverse types of organic matter and has been used in fouling studies 34 36 at the termination of run 5 gel layers were collected from the membrane surfaces from the bench scale mbrs operated with twb and nbb and were analyzed by ftir fig 8 shows ftir spectra of samples collected at the termination of run 5 ftir spectra of the sample collected from mbr 3 ceb could not be obtained due to the limited amount of the sample peaks at 1040 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 wavenumbers represent polysaccharides 37 while peaks at 1411 cm 1 1550 cm 1 and 1655 cm 1 wavenumbers are attributed to amide like substances suggesting the presence of proteins 38 on the other hand absorption peaks around 2920 cm 1 represent lipids 39 the relative signal intensity profiles were quite similar in the two samples suggesting that the gel layers collected from the two mbrs operated with twb and nbb had similar compositions it can be concluded that introducing nbs into the backwashing solution did not alter the components of the fouling layer thus in this study it was not likely that the fouling layer composition explained the difference in tmp evolution observed with twb and nbb instead it was hypothesized that the fouling layer structure played a more critical role in the high performance of nbb 3 3 5 structures of the fouling layer observed by sem and afm sem and afm were used to visualize the fouling layer developed on the membrane surface fig 9 a shows a cross section of a membrane backwashed by twb whereas fig 9 b shows a fouled membrane backwashed by nbb in fig 9 cross section images corresponding to the ceramic membrane are hidden as the supplier of the membrane did not permit it to be shown we attempted to determine the thicknesses of the fouling layers by observing different pieces of the samples of the fouled membranes fig s9 the thickness of the fouling layer on the twb sample 1 93 μm 0 38 μm was larger than that on the nbb sample 1 49 μm 0 38 μm as shown in fig s10 the significance of the difference between the mean thicknesses of the fouling layers was statistically assessed the p value obtained from student s t test was smaller than 0 05 i e 0 001 meaning that the thickness of the fouling layer on the twb sample was significantly greater than that on the nbb sample tables s2 s3 formation of a thick fouling layer could be linked to the high degree of reversible fouling observed with twb however the difference in the thicknesses of fouling layers observed with twb and nbb in run 5 30 was not proportional to the difference in reversible fouling 424 fig 5 additional factors such as differences in the structure of the fouling layer might play a role in enhancing the fouling mitigation effect of nbb however such differences could not be detected by sem observation to assess the potential differences in the structures of fouling layers formed with twb and nbb the surfaces of the fouled membranes were observed after the termination of run 5 using afm fig 10 shows representative afm images obtained the surface roughness of each fouling layer was also determined from the afm images six different areas were quantitatively assessed the mean surface roughness was calculated at ten different sites from a total of sixty observations fig s11 shows the results of the measurements the membrane operated with twb showed a surface roughness of 382 9 nm 102 78 while the membrane cleaned by nbb had a roughness of 414 8 nm 94 8 nm in the afm images the fouling layer on the surface of the membrane backwashed by nbb appears to be rougher suggesting that the fouling layer in the mbr backwashed with nbb had a more porous structure than that with twb this might enhance the effectiveness of granular scouring however the rougher fouling layer could also entrap pollutants in its valleys it is thought though that the enhanced granular scouring could offset the accumulation of pollutants this is the current possible explanation for the low degree of reversible fouling with nbb fig 5 although neither sem nor afm could demonstrate that the surface structure of the fouling layer was altered by nbb it was postulated that nbs intruded into the gel layer and made its internal structure loose the disproportion between the thickness of the fouling layer and the degree of reversible fouling mentioned above support this postulation also we postulate that nbs might have lifted up the gel layer when they were introduced at the interface between the membrane and the gel layer it has been reported that free radicals could be produced when nbs collapse 40 42 which might also change the structure of the gel layer however it was shown in this study that the resolution of the sem afm was not sufficient to detect the changes in the structure of the gel layer caused by nbb thus further investigation is needed to determine the causes of the high cleaning efficiency of nbb 4 summary in this study a novel method for cleaning of membranes fouled in mbrs backwashing with nb containing water was investigated experiments were carried out at an existing wastewater treatment plant with real municipal wastewater regardless of the season when the experiments were carried out i e differences in the quality of the feed wastewater the cleaning performance of nbb was always higher than that of twb clearly indicating the high potential of nbb for membrane cleaning it was found that nbb could lower the degree of reversible fouling and was also effective for the control of irreversible fouling the degree of reversible fouling observed with twb was 424 higher than that with nbb we attempted to identify the reasons why nbb lowered the reversible fouling comprehensive analysis of the mixed liquor suspension revealed that the introduction of nbs did not alter its characteristics also the composition of the fouling layer did not change with nbb on the other hand significant reduction in the thickness of the fouling layer was observed by sem observations when nbb was applied the fouling layer on the surface of twb samples was 30 thicker than that on nbb samples it was therefore postulated that rather than changes in the composition the structure of the fouling layer might have been modified when nbb was carried out although conventional sem afm observation could not detect such changes although the mechanisms of fouling mitigation by nbb could not be fully revealed this study gives a major contribution to the research on fouling mitigation by nbs since this study is the first study on the application of nbb there is a lot of room for investigation for instance the backwashing conditions used in this study were based on previous research that confirmed the efficiency of ceb for mitigation of membrane fouling however the backwashing conditions for nbb were not optimized and further research should therefore be carried out in addition there is a need to investigate the effects of varying characteristics of nbs on the cleaning efficiency of nbb we postulate that altering the concentration size or zeta potential of nbs would further enhance the cleaning efficiency of nbb finally by revealing the mechanisms by which nbb mitigates fouling nbb could be established as an environmentally friendly measure for membrane cleaning to do so innovative

12507,temperature based strategies are commonly applied to control microbial growth but the impact of those procedures on biofilm structure is usually not evaluated this study investigates how thermal disinfection procedures affect pre established pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms formed in a center for disease control cdc biofilm reactor it also assesses the biofilm regrowth potential over 24 h under 125 and 225 rpm biofilms structure was compared at the mesoscale thickness and at the microscale biovolume and surface coverage results showed that the impact of the thermal disinfection on the biofilm structure depends on the hydrodynamic conditions which are also critical to the biofilm structural rearrangement upon regrowth a thickness reduction of 80 was found after the shock for biofilms formed under 125 rpm however there was no significant biofilm sloughing off for the 225 rpm surface coverage was reduced by 65 and 6 after the thermal shock for 125 and 225 rpm respectively furthermore results seem to indicate that regardless the biofilm structural characteristics bacteria recovered their culturability and viability to similar values to the ones before the thermal shock this work provides an initial framework to develop more sustainable and effective thermal disinfection procedures in engineered water networks graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biofilm regrowth biofilm structural changes disinfection water systems temperature shock data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction thermal disinfection or heat sanitization approaches are widely applied to control microorganisms growth 1 increasing the water temperature above the operating temperature for a certain period the shock period is known to decrease the number of microorganisms in suspension 2 in engineered water systems it can be used to minimize the incidence of waterborne pathogens like legionella 3 6 or pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 7 8 each specific aim of the thermal disinfection requires different temperatures different shock periods and adjusted periodicities real field studies have been performed to evaluate thermal disinfection effectiveness 3 9 10 for example thermal disinfection efficacy was evaluated at 33 hot water distribution systems colonized by legionella 3 the temperature at the water storage tank was set to 70 80 c with water circulation through the system for up to 3 days ensuring at least 65 c at the end points of the networks e g taps results showed that unless repeatedly implemented over time thermal disinfection was not effective enough to eliminate pathogenic bacteria the authors argue that legionella prevalence after the thermal shock was most probably due to the protection conferred by biofilms indeed many temperature time studies found in the literature target the impact of thermal treatment on the inactivation of planktonic microorganisms 11 too often ignoring the role of biofilms in shielding such microorganisms against external harsh conditions including thermal shock 11 12 but the work of farhat et al 2010 12 who compared the impact of a heat shock treatment 70 c for 30 min in legionella populations in water and in biofilms showed that the heat shock did not completely destroy the biofilm which rapidly increased in cell density similarly wahlen et al 2016 13 studied the inactivation kinetics of sphingomonas parapaucimobilis in planktonic and sessile states at temperatures ranging from 65 to 80 c and observed greater resistance of the biofilm lower cell culturability reductions to the hot water when compared with the planktonic cells from the operational point of view of engineered water networks it is important to assess what happens to the bacterial cells and to the biofilm structure upon thermal disinfection the biofilm structure is intrinsically linked to the effect of hydrodynamics on mass transfer 14 15 and will ultimately affect the detachment rates 16 understanding what happens to the biofilm structure after a thermal shock and whether the thermal effect is similar or not under different flow velocities can provide important contributions to designing and implementing better thermal procedures the present work addresses these two points evaluating the biofilm structural parameters with microscale confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and mesoscale imaging optical coherence tomography oct for that pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms were formed in a center for disease control cdc biofilm reactor for 8 days the biofilm was subjected to thermal shocks 70 c over 15 min and coupons were sampled prior to the shock and post shock after 1 and 24 h the biofilm micro and mesoscale changes and the regrowth potential after the shock were evaluated under two turbulent flow stirring velocities 125 and 225 rpm additionally biofilm culturability by colony forming unit cfu counts and viability by adenosine triphosphate atp bioluminescence assay were also determined to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study that assesses the impact of a temperature shock on biofilms structure at the micro and mesoscale under different shear stress conditions this paper describes a proof of concept undertaken in a reproducible and standardized biofilm model to investigate and validate the role of biofilm structure on thermal disinfection efficacy 2 material and methods 2 1 bacteria culture and growth media the bacterial strain used to form biofilm was pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525t obtained from the american type culture collection pseudomonas fluorescens is a well studied gram negative bacterium a good biofilm producer and commonly used as a model bacterium in several biofilm studies 17 20 it is a frequent inhabitant of freshwater environments and one of the first colonizers of water supply networks 21 multispecies biofilms are more complex than monospecies ones and provide a more realistic representation of what happens in real field water systems 22 while monospecies biofilm models can offer simplicity standardization and a good reproducibility 23 besides p fluorescens is often found in water samples along

days old pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms was accomplished by assessing prior to and 1 h and 24 h after the shock a the biofilm structural changes at the meso and microscale b the microbiological indicators culturability and atp bioluminescence 3 1 thermal shock impact on biofilm mesoscale structure the biofilm structure at the mesoscale was investigated before the thermal shock and 1 and 24 h after the thermal shock using optical coherence tomography 2d oct imaging the 2d oct biofilm images depicted in fig 1 suggest that different structures were observed for the biofilms formed at the two tested shear stresses comparison between images before the thermal shock for 125 and 225 rpm furthermore when comparing the immediate impact of the thermal shock on each of the biofilms it seems that the biofilms rearrange differently depending on such shear stress comparison between fig 1a and b 3 1 1 thermal shock impact on biofilm thickness the results for the 125 rpm biofilm fig 2a show that the thermal shock had a significant impact on the biofilm thickness reduction such reduction is up to 80 when comparing the data before the shock bs 108 25 μm and 1 h after the shock 1 h as 20 11 μm these results suggest that for 125 rpm grown biofilms the thermal shock leads to immediate biofilm detachment at least from the outer layers which are probably less cohesive when compared to the basal layers this phenomenon has been named by other researchers as stratification of the biofilm cohesion 39 it is interesting to note that 24 h after the shock 24h as the biofilm thickness increased as compared to 1 h after the shock 1h as but to values significantly lower than the ones observed before the shock considering the thickness results observed for the biofilms formed at the higher rotational speed 225 rpm fig 2b no significant impact of the thermal shock on the biofilm thickness was observed indeed thickness was similar before bs and 1 h after the shock p 0 05 with an average value of 66 17 μm when comparing the effect of shear stress on biofilm formation fig 2 the biofilms formed at 125 rpm bs 125 rpm 108 25 μm were thicker than the ones formed at 225 rpm bs 225 rpm 64 20 μm these thickness values were found to be statistically different p 0 0001 3 2 thermal shock impact on biofilm microscale structure to further evaluate the effect of a thermal shock on mature p fluorescens biofilms their microstructure was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm before shock bs and 1 1h as and 24 24h as hours after shock the 8 days old biofilms formed under both hydrodynamic conditions and before the temperature shock were very dense however the biofilm grown at 125 rpm was thicker than the biofilm formed at 225 rpm as previously observed by oct figs 1 and 2 this lower thickness of biofilms formed at higher shear stress is in agreement with the lower biovolume of this biofilm when compared to the biofilm formed at 125 rpm about 55 less fig 4a b regarding the biofilm regrowth behavior after the heat treatment the differences in biofilm structure between 125 and 225 rpm are evident there was a drastic reduction in the biomass of the biofilm formed at 125 rpm fig 3a such that after 1 h of exposure to fresh culture medium the surface coverage of the biofilm was only 29 as opposed to 83 of biofilm surface coverage before t shock and the biovolume of 18 μm3 μm2 as opposed to 80 μm3 μm2 determined before t shock p 0 0001 fig 4a c indeed the representative image of biofilm 1 h after t shock fig 3a second line shows a thinner biofilm arrangement and isolated bacterial colonies heterogeneously distributed on the surface the effect of heat treatment was not as aggressive on the biofilm formed at 225 rpm where after 1 h the biovolume and surface coverage reduced by 6 p 0 05 and 23 p 0 0001 respectively fig 4b d when the regrowth time was extended to 24 h the biofilm under 125 rpm had a thicker and denser structure fig 3a third line reaching a biovolume of 34 μm3 μm2 p 0 0001 and surface coverage of 76 p 0 05 fig 4a c similar to that obtained before the t shock in the case of biofilms exposed to 225 rpm 24 h after the t shock the biovolume remained similar to that determined for the control sample bs and the biofilm 1 h after t shock p 0 05 but the surface coverage suffered a gradual decrease attaining 59 fig 4b d 3 3 culturability the log10 colony forming units per cm2 cfu cm2 of biofilm cells over time before and 1 and 24 h after the thermal shock is shown in fig 5 biofilms formed under 125 rpm had 108 cfu cm2 before the thermal shock biofilm age of 8 days in fig 5a it was possible to observe the reduction of colony forming units per cm2 a 4 log10 reduction was achieved 1 h after the shock which demonstrates the effectiveness of the thermal treatment on cell culturability reduction regarding the post shock period 24 h thermally treated biofilms showed a high culturability increase during the first 24 h after the thermal shock so the biofilms seemed to have recovered and reached their previous population plateau 8 01 107 cfu cm2 regarding the 225 rpm grown biofilms the culturability values before and after 1 and 24 h thermal shock were similar to those obtained for biofilms grown under 125 rpm p 0 05 fig 5b 3 4 viability to investigate the metabolic activity of p fluorescens cells in the biofilm atp was quantified fig 6a shows the luminescence values that were recorded in rlu cm2 for 125 rpm biofilms before and after 1 and 24 h the thermal shock the thermal shock had significantly reduced the atp production reduction of 98 p 0 0001 1 h after the shock this conclusion seems to agree with the fact that upon exposure to stress events bacteria tend to significantly reduce their atp levels 40 in the present study fig 6a the atp decrease was only observed in the sampling point of 1 h after the shock as in the following time point 24 h cells recovered their viability to levels like the ones determined prior to the shock p 0 05 furthermore when comparing these results with the ones from fig 6b it can be seen that the viability of the cells in the biofilm formed at 225 rpm followed a similar trend as the one from 125 rpm indeed the rlu cm2 values before and after thermal shock were all similar to those obtained for biofilms grown under 125 rpm p 0 05 issuing as expected that the tested shear stress does not seem to affect the p fluorescens viability within the biofilm nor to promote different response after the thermal shock 4 discussion the main results discussed so far are summarized in fig 7 4 1 the role of biofilm structure on temperature shock 4 1 1 biofilm characteristics prior to the shock biofilms formed under the tested shear stress conditions were found to be structurally different in terms of i mesoscale properties thickness and ii microscale properties surface coverage and biovolume as discussed the biofilms formed at higher rotational speed 225 rpm were found to be significantly thinner than those formed under 125 rpm this is in accordance with former studies 41 42 in fact it is widely established across literature that hydrodynamics strongly affects biofilm structures 43 and ultimately the mass transfer processes 44 45 for example under higher fluid velocities more nutrients and oxygen reach the biofilms surface 45 but diffusion inside the biofilm depends on its cohesiveness 46 in the present study regardless the structural differences already mentioned the number of culturable cells and the atp levels per area were comparable for both tested rotational speeds respectively 108 cfu cm2 and 105 rlu cm2 looking into the biofilm cell density calculated by dividing cfu cm2 by the biofilm thickness it becomes clear that although the total number of culturable cells per area was the same the cell density was much lower for the thicker biofilm the one formed at 125 rpm this might be explained by the fact that under lower fluid velocities a lower number of cells will be available to adhere to surfaces and colonize them thus lower cell densities will be achieved 47 4 1 2 biofilm characteristics after the thermal shock similarly to what happens when biofilms are exposed to other stresses like flow increase or biocides 48 49 the biofilm structural characteristics seem to be key to what happens when the biofilms are thermally shocked as shown in fig 7 the thermal shock has a significant impact on the biofilms formed at the lower velocity 125 rpm due to biofilm detachment sloughing off corresponding to an 80 decrease in thickness and biovolume after the stress event this detachment was followed by a quick structural reorganization of the biofilm in terms of micro and mesoscale into a thinner layer with a more homogeneous matrix this reorganization was noticeable in terms of thickness biovolume and surface coverage 1 h after the shock and did not significantly change over the 24 h period fig 7 similarly chang et al 2017 50 reported that bacillus subtilis biofilms became thinner with reduced volume and surface coverage after thermal shocks under different temperatures and exposure times on the other hand biofilms formed under higher rotational speed 225 rpm were found to be more stable less susceptible to slough off caused by thermal shock as no significant differences are observed in terms of mesoscale thickness over time in fact it is widely known that biofilms formed at higher shear stress conditions tend to be more resistant to external stresses biocides flow increase etc 51 52 for example a former study demonstrated that p fluorescens biofilms grown under higher shear stresses are more strongly adhered have stronger more compact eps matrix and thus tend to be more stable upon unexpected stress events 41 4 2 different impact of the thermal shocks on the biofilm structure versus cells culturability and viability it is interesting to note that the thermal shocks have a different impact on the structure and on the microbiological features culturability and viability of the biofilm for example when considering the 225 rpm rotational velocity even though thickness was similar prior and after the shock 1 and 24 h there was a significant decrease in culturability and atp levels 1 h after the thermal shock other authors also found that the application of chemical treatments could cause a significant reduction on biofilm cells count even though biomass does not significantly decrease 53 then in the 24 h after the shock these indicators increased to levels comparable to the ones prior to the thermal shock a similar trend was observed for the lower stirring velocity this data suggests that exposing p fluorescens biofilms to 70 c over 15 min endangered the bacterial cells within the biofilm to an extent that was still found 1 h after the initial bulk conditions were restored 25 c however it seems that the thermal effect on the biofilm cells was very limited in time as for both tested shear stresses 24 h after the shock culturability and viability atp recovered to values like the ones observed in the biofilm before the shock former work from ricker et al 2018 7 showed that above a critical post shock bacterial loading of approximately 103 cfu cm2 of pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms thermally shocked can regrowth to their initial population density barros et al 2022 19 also showed that previously labelled dead p fluorescens cells after biodical exposure 18 are able to regain viability increased atp production when optimum growth conditions are restored other authors concluded that a heat shock 70 c for 30 min did not destroy a drinking water biofilm that rapidly increased in log density 12 apart from the arguments already provided the culturability and viability recovery after 24 h might also be related to a the fact that 1 h after the shock the temperature inside the biofilm was still above the bulk temperature thus promoting an inhibition effect on the functional behavior of cells 54 b cells adhering to the pvc coupons might also attach to the reactor s walls this was clearly observed which might be responsible for a fast recolonization c high temperatures 80 90 c might have a baking effect on the attached biofilms increasing its adherence to the surface and enhancing a rapid recolonization 55 d dead biomass can be a source of nutrients by promoting necrotrophic growth upon regrowth 1 it is also worth noting that the shift in cell culturability and viability followed the same trend regardless of biofilm structural characteristics to design appropriate thermal disinfection procedures an understanding about the fundamental impact of thermal shock on biofilm structure should be known using a reproducible biofilm model assessed with a micro and mesoscale analysis this work provides new insights on the need of studying biofilm structure future studies should be performed with more complex biofilm models different temperature and time conditions and different pipe materials to better understand the points herein discussed 5 conclusions thermal disinfection procedures are widely used across engineered water systems to address microbiological control this study while combining micro and mesoscale imaging of the biofilm with microbial culturability and viability highlights important findings regarding the impact of thermal shocks on 8 days old pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms those findings are a the effect of thermal shock on the biofilm structure seems to depend on the prevailing hydrodynamic conditions b there is a different structural spatial arrangement of the biofilm after the thermal shock and c the thermal shock affects differently the biofilm structure and its cell culturability and viability credit

12507,temperature based strategies are commonly applied to control microbial growth but the impact of those procedures on biofilm structure is usually not evaluated this study investigates how thermal disinfection procedures affect pre established pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms formed in a center for disease control cdc biofilm reactor it also assesses the biofilm regrowth potential over 24 h under 125 and 225 rpm biofilms structure was compared at the mesoscale thickness and at the microscale biovolume and surface coverage results showed that the impact of the thermal disinfection on the biofilm structure depends on the hydrodynamic conditions which are also critical to the biofilm structural rearrangement upon regrowth a thickness reduction of 80 was found after the shock for biofilms formed under 125 rpm however there was no significant biofilm sloughing off for the 225 rpm surface coverage was reduced by 65 and 6 after the thermal shock for 125 and 225 rpm respectively furthermore results seem to indicate that regardless the biofilm structural characteristics bacteria recovered their culturability and viability to similar values to the ones before the thermal shock this work provides an initial framework to develop more sustainable and effective thermal disinfection procedures in engineered water networks graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biofilm regrowth biofilm structural changes disinfection water systems temperature shock data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction thermal disinfection or heat sanitization approaches are widely applied to control microorganisms growth 1 increasing the water temperature above the operating temperature for a certain period the shock period is known to decrease the number of microorganisms in suspension 2 in engineered water systems it can be used to minimize the incidence of waterborne pathogens like legionella 3 6 or pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 7 8 each specific aim of the thermal disinfection requires different temperatures different shock periods and adjusted periodicities real field studies have been performed to evaluate thermal disinfection effectiveness 3 9 10 for example thermal disinfection efficacy was evaluated at 33 hot water distribution systems colonized by legionella 3 the temperature at the water storage tank was set to 70 80 c with water circulation through the system for up to 3 days ensuring at least 65 c at the end points of the networks e g taps results showed that unless repeatedly implemented over time thermal disinfection was not effective enough to eliminate pathogenic bacteria the authors argue that legionella prevalence after the thermal shock was most probably due to the protection conferred by biofilms indeed many temperature time studies found in the literature target the impact of thermal treatment on the inactivation of planktonic microorganisms 11 too often ignoring the role of biofilms in shielding such microorganisms against external harsh conditions including thermal shock 11 12 but the work of farhat et al 2010 12 who compared the impact of a heat shock treatment 70 c for 30 min in legionella populations in water and in biofilms showed that the heat shock did not completely destroy the biofilm which rapidly increased in cell density similarly wahlen et al 2016 13 studied the inactivation kinetics of sphingomonas parapaucimobilis in planktonic and sessile states at temperatures ranging from 65 to 80 c and observed greater resistance of the biofilm lower cell culturability reductions to the hot water when compared with the planktonic cells from the operational point of view of engineered water networks it is important to assess what happens to the bacterial cells and to the biofilm structure upon thermal disinfection the biofilm structure is intrinsically linked to the effect of hydrodynamics on mass transfer 14 15 and will ultimately affect the detachment rates 16 understanding what happens to the biofilm structure after a thermal shock and whether the thermal effect is similar or not under different flow velocities can provide important contributions to designing and implementing better thermal procedures the present work addresses these two points evaluating the biofilm structural parameters with microscale confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and mesoscale imaging optical coherence tomography oct for that pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms were formed in a center for disease control cdc biofilm reactor for 8 days the biofilm was subjected to thermal shocks 70 c over 15 min and coupons were sampled prior to the shock and post shock after 1 and 24 h the biofilm micro and mesoscale changes and the regrowth potential after the shock were evaluated under two turbulent flow stirring velocities 125 and 225 rpm additionally biofilm culturability by colony forming unit cfu counts and viability by adenosine triphosphate atp bioluminescence assay were also determined to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study that assesses the impact of a temperature shock on biofilms structure at the micro and mesoscale under different shear stress conditions this paper describes a proof of concept undertaken in a reproducible and standardized biofilm model to investigate and validate the role of biofilm structure on thermal disinfection efficacy 2 material and methods 2 1 bacteria culture and growth media the bacterial strain used to form biofilm was pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525t obtained from the american type culture collection pseudomonas fluorescens is a well studied gram negative bacterium a good biofilm producer and commonly used as a model bacterium in several biofilm studies 17 20 it is a frequent inhabitant of freshwater environments and one of the first colonizers of water supply networks 21 multispecies biofilms are more complex than monospecies ones and provide a more realistic representation of what happens in real field water systems 22 while monospecies biofilm models can offer simplicity standardization and a good reproducibility 23 besides p fluorescens is often found in water samples along with waterborne pathogens such as legionella pneumophila 24 overnight cultures were grown at 30 3 c under agitation 120 rpm in 100 ml of a sterile nutrient medium this medium consisted of per liter 5

were also prepared to obtain a value for background luminescence negative control plate contents were mixed incubated for 5 min and read in a bioluminometer fluostar omega bmg labtech germany the output values are in relative light units per cm2 rlu cm2 2 5 statistical analysis the experimental data were analyzed using the software graphpad prism 9 0 for windows graphpad software usa all measurements were performed in duplicate and all experiments were performed in three independent replicates the mean and standard deviation sd for each set of results were calculated differences between measurements were evaluated using an anova single factor statistical analysis the level of significance was set for p values 0 05 3 results the effect of temperature shock 70 c 15 min on the 8 days old pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms was accomplished by assessing prior to and 1 h and 24 h after the shock a the biofilm structural changes at the meso and microscale b the microbiological indicators culturability and atp bioluminescence 3 1 thermal shock impact on biofilm mesoscale structure the biofilm structure at the mesoscale was investigated before the thermal shock and 1 and 24 h after the thermal shock using optical coherence tomography 2d oct imaging the 2d oct biofilm images depicted in fig 1 suggest that different structures were observed for the biofilms formed at the two tested shear stresses comparison between images before the thermal shock for 125 and 225 rpm furthermore when comparing the immediate impact of the thermal shock on each of the biofilms it seems that the biofilms rearrange differently depending on such shear stress comparison between fig 1a and b 3 1 1 thermal shock impact on biofilm thickness the results for the 125 rpm biofilm fig 2a show that the thermal shock had a significant impact on the biofilm thickness reduction such reduction is up to 80 when comparing the data before the shock bs 108 25 μm and 1 h after the shock 1 h as 20 11 μm these results suggest that for 125 rpm grown biofilms the thermal shock leads to immediate biofilm detachment at least from the outer layers which are probably less cohesive when compared to the basal layers this phenomenon has been named by other researchers as stratification of the biofilm cohesion 39 it is interesting to note that 24 h after the shock 24h as the biofilm thickness increased as compared to 1 h after the shock 1h as but to values significantly lower than the ones observed before the shock considering the thickness results observed for the biofilms formed at the higher rotational speed 225 rpm fig 2b no significant impact of the thermal shock on the biofilm thickness was observed indeed thickness was similar before bs and 1 h after the shock p 0 05 with an average value of 66 17 μm when comparing the effect of shear stress on biofilm formation fig 2 the biofilms formed at 125 rpm bs 125 rpm 108 25 μm were thicker than the ones formed at 225 rpm bs 225 rpm 64 20 μm these thickness values were found to be statistically different p 0 0001 3 2 thermal shock impact on biofilm microscale structure to further evaluate the effect of a thermal shock on mature p fluorescens biofilms their microstructure was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm before shock bs and 1 1h as and 24 24h as hours after shock the 8 days old biofilms formed under both hydrodynamic conditions and before the temperature shock were very dense however the biofilm grown at 125 rpm was thicker than the biofilm formed at 225 rpm as previously observed by oct figs 1 and 2 this lower thickness of biofilms formed at higher shear stress is in agreement with the lower biovolume of this biofilm when compared to the biofilm formed at 125 rpm about 55 less fig 4a b regarding the biofilm regrowth behavior after the heat treatment the differences in biofilm structure between 125 and 225 rpm are evident there was a drastic reduction in the biomass of the biofilm formed at 125 rpm fig 3a such that after 1 h of exposure to fresh culture medium the surface coverage of the biofilm was only 29 as opposed to 83 of biofilm surface coverage before t shock and the biovolume of 18 μm3 μm2 as opposed to 80 μm3 μm2 determined before t shock p 0 0001 fig 4a c indeed the representative image of biofilm 1 h after t shock fig 3a second line shows a thinner biofilm arrangement and isolated bacterial colonies heterogeneously distributed on the surface the effect of heat treatment was not as aggressive on the biofilm formed at 225 rpm where after 1 h the biovolume and surface coverage reduced by 6 p 0 05 and 23 p 0 0001 respectively fig 4b d when the regrowth time was extended to 24 h the biofilm under 125 rpm had a thicker and denser structure fig 3a third line reaching a biovolume of 34 μm3 μm2 p 0 0001 and surface coverage of 76 p 0 05 fig 4a c similar to that obtained before the t shock in the case of biofilms exposed to 225 rpm 24 h after the t shock the biovolume remained similar to that determined for the control sample bs and the biofilm 1 h after t shock p 0 05 but the surface coverage suffered a gradual decrease attaining 59 fig 4b d 3 3 culturability the log10 colony forming units per cm2 cfu cm2 of biofilm cells over time before and 1 and 24 h after the thermal shock is shown in fig 5 biofilms formed under 125 rpm had 108 cfu cm2 before the thermal shock biofilm age of 8 days in fig 5a it was possible to observe the reduction of colony forming units per cm2 a 4 log10 reduction was achieved 1 h after the shock which demonstrates the effectiveness of the thermal treatment on cell culturability reduction regarding the post shock period 24 h thermally treated biofilms showed a high culturability increase during the first 24 h after the thermal shock so the biofilms seemed to have recovered and reached their previous population plateau 8 01 107 cfu cm2 regarding the 225 rpm grown biofilms the culturability values before and after 1 and 24 h thermal shock were similar to those obtained for biofilms grown under 125 rpm p 0 05 fig 5b 3 4 viability to investigate the metabolic activity of p fluorescens cells in the biofilm atp was quantified fig 6a shows the luminescence values that were recorded in rlu cm2 for 125 rpm biofilms before and after 1 and 24 h the thermal shock the thermal shock had significantly reduced the atp production reduction of 98 p 0 0001 1 h after the shock this conclusion seems to agree with the fact that upon exposure to stress events bacteria tend to significantly reduce their atp levels 40 in the present study fig 6a the atp decrease was only observed in the sampling point of 1 h after the shock as in the following time point 24 h cells recovered their viability to levels like the ones determined prior to the shock p 0 05 furthermore when comparing these results with the ones from fig 6b it can be seen that the viability of the cells in the biofilm formed at 225 rpm followed a similar trend as the one from 125 rpm indeed the rlu cm2 values before and after thermal shock were all similar to those obtained for biofilms grown under 125 rpm p 0 05 issuing as expected that the tested shear stress does not seem to affect the p fluorescens viability within the biofilm nor to promote different response after the thermal shock 4 discussion the main results discussed so far are summarized in fig 7 4 1 the role of biofilm structure on temperature shock 4 1 1 biofilm characteristics prior to the shock biofilms formed under the tested shear stress conditions were found to be structurally different in terms of i mesoscale properties thickness and ii microscale properties surface coverage and biovolume as discussed the biofilms formed at higher rotational speed 225 rpm were found to be significantly thinner than those formed under 125 rpm this is in accordance with former studies 41 42 in fact it is widely established across literature that hydrodynamics strongly affects biofilm structures 43 and ultimately the mass transfer processes 44 45 for example under higher fluid velocities more nutrients and oxygen reach the biofilms surface 45 but diffusion inside the biofilm depends on its cohesiveness 46 in the present study regardless the structural differences already mentioned the number of culturable cells and the atp levels per area were comparable for both tested rotational speeds respectively 108 cfu cm2 and 105 rlu cm2 looking into the biofilm cell density calculated by dividing cfu cm2 by the biofilm thickness it becomes clear that although the total number of culturable cells per area was the same the cell density was much lower for the thicker biofilm the one formed at 125 rpm this might be explained by the fact that under lower fluid velocities a lower number of cells will be available to adhere to surfaces and colonize them thus lower cell densities will be achieved 47 4 1 2 biofilm characteristics after the thermal shock similarly to what happens when biofilms are exposed to other stresses like flow increase or biocides 48 49 the biofilm structural characteristics seem to be key to what happens when the biofilms are thermally shocked as shown in fig 7 the thermal shock has a significant impact on the biofilms formed at the lower velocity 125 rpm due to biofilm detachment sloughing off corresponding to an 80 decrease in thickness and biovolume after the stress event this detachment was followed by a quick structural reorganization of the biofilm in terms of micro and mesoscale into a thinner layer with a more homogeneous matrix this reorganization was noticeable in terms of thickness biovolume and surface coverage 1 h after the shock and did not significantly change over the 24 h period fig 7 similarly chang et al 2017 50 reported that bacillus subtilis biofilms became thinner with reduced volume and surface coverage after thermal shocks under different temperatures and exposure times on the other hand biofilms formed under higher rotational speed 225 rpm were found to be more stable less susceptible to slough off caused by thermal shock as no significant differences are observed in terms of mesoscale thickness over time in fact it is widely known that biofilms formed at higher shear stress conditions tend to be more resistant to external stresses biocides flow increase etc 51 52 for example a former study demonstrated that p fluorescens biofilms grown under higher shear stresses are more strongly adhered have stronger more compact eps matrix and thus tend to be more stable upon unexpected stress events 41 4 2 different impact of the thermal shocks on the biofilm structure versus cells culturability and viability it is interesting to note that the thermal shocks have a different impact on the structure and on the microbiological features culturability and viability of the biofilm for example when considering the 225 rpm rotational velocity even though thickness was similar prior and after the shock 1 and 24 h there was a significant decrease in culturability and atp levels 1 h after the thermal shock other authors also found that the application of chemical treatments could cause a significant reduction on biofilm cells count even though biomass does not significantly decrease 53 then in the 24 h after the shock these indicators increased to levels comparable to the ones prior to the thermal shock a similar trend was observed for the lower stirring velocity this data suggests that exposing p fluorescens biofilms to 70 c over 15 min endangered the bacterial cells within the biofilm to an extent that was still found 1 h after the initial bulk conditions were restored 25 c however it seems that the thermal effect on the biofilm cells was very limited in time as for both tested shear stresses 24 h after the shock culturability and viability atp recovered to values like the ones observed in the biofilm before the shock former work from ricker et al 2018 7 showed that above a critical post shock bacterial loading of approximately 103 cfu cm2 of pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms thermally shocked can regrowth to their initial population density barros et al 2022 19 also showed that previously labelled dead p fluorescens cells after biodical exposure 18 are able to regain viability increased atp production when optimum growth conditions are restored other authors concluded that a heat shock 70 c for 30 min did not destroy a drinking water biofilm that rapidly increased in log density 12 apart from the arguments already provided the culturability and viability recovery after 24 h might also be related to a the fact that 1 h after the shock the temperature inside the biofilm was still above the bulk temperature thus promoting an inhibition effect on the functional behavior of cells 54 b cells adhering to the pvc coupons might also attach to the reactor s walls this was clearly observed which might be responsible for a fast recolonization c high temperatures 80 90 c might have a baking effect on the attached biofilms increasing its adherence to the surface and enhancing a rapid recolonization 55 d dead biomass can be a source of nutrients by promoting necrotrophic growth upon regrowth 1 it is also worth noting that the shift in cell culturability and viability followed the same trend regardless of biofilm structural characteristics to design appropriate thermal disinfection procedures an understanding about the fundamental impact of thermal shock on biofilm structure should be known using a reproducible biofilm model assessed with a micro and mesoscale analysis this work provides new insights on the need of studying biofilm structure future studies should be performed with more complex biofilm models different temperature and time conditions and different pipe materials to better understand the points herein discussed 5 conclusions thermal disinfection procedures are widely used across engineered water systems to address microbiological control this study while combining micro and mesoscale imaging of the biofilm with microbial culturability and viability highlights important findings regarding the impact of thermal shocks on 8 days old pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms those findings are a the effect of thermal shock on the biofilm structure seems to depend on the prevailing hydrodynamic conditions b there is a different structural spatial arrangement of the biofilm after the thermal shock and c the thermal shock affects differently the biofilm structure and its cell culturability and viability credit

12508,nitrite accumulation could be achieved in algal bacterial consortia without energy intensive aeration which could be a sustainable alternative for wastewater treatment however few studies focused on the achievement of partial nitrification in different non aerated algal bacterial systems and the related microbial mechanisms are still unclear here two different algal bacterial systems photo sequencing batch reactor psbr and up flow sludge blanket bioreactor pusb were operated for anaerobic effluent treatment and the non aerated partial nitrification was evaluated results showed that the nitrite accumulation rates in the psbr and pusb were 92 70 7 81 and 81 44 11 28 respectively which was constant with microbial activities denser algal bacterial granules were observed in the psbr whereas looser algal bacterial flocs were in the pusb phormidium and leptolyngbya i e two filamentous cyanobacteria were enriched in the psbr and pusb respectively and the higher enrichment of nitrosomonas and complete inhibition of nitrospira contributed to better partial nitrification of psbr the pusb had more intensive interspecific interactions and more cooperative behavior in microbial network metagenomic analysis revealed that partial denitrification might partially contribute to the nitrite accumulation in the pusb owing to higher nitrate reductase gene expressions overall this study advances our understandings of the partial nitrification process and nitrite accumulation by algal bacterial consortia graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photobioreactor partial nitrification nitrification activity microbial community microbial interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction algal bacterial consortia represent a community dominated by eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria with a variety of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms co existing 1 in recent years there has been an increasing research on algal bacterial systems for wastewater treatment such as aeration free nitrification 2 3 nutrients removal 4 5 and bioproducts e g biodiesel generation 6 7 more recently safitri et al also investigated the co culture of green algae and methanotrophs for the dissolved methane removal from anaerobic effluent 8 compared with the conventional activated sludge cas process these phototrophs can autonomously produce the o2 required for the oxidation of organic matter and ammonia by bacteria without the need for energy intensive aeration 9 and meanwhile with the reduction of greenhouse gasses 10 11 therefore the algal bacterial consortia are a potentially sustainable and green alternative to the cas process in the future various photobioreactors pbrs have been extensively developed for nitrogen removal or partial nitrification as a carbon and energy efficient wastewater treatment technology in table 1 the nitrite accumulation rate nar varied widely from 0 to 99 8 depending on different conditions including reactor configurations photo sequencing batch reactor psbr and membrane photobioreactor mpbr substrate types synthetic and real wastewaters algae species eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria bacterial sources growth forms flocs and granulated sludge as well as biofilm light source intensity 30 1531 μmol m 2 s 1 water temperature 18 35 c ph 6 6 8 2 and initial ammonium concentration 22 2 326 mg n l 1 for instance akizuki et al reported a lower light illumination of 27 35 μmol m 2 s 1 to regulate a lower dissolved oxygen do value and thus to inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for achieving the nitrite accumulation in a batch algal nitrifying bacterial system 12 in addition the high concentrations of ammonia and nitrite in the psbr could form the free ammonia fa and nitrous acid fna for effectively inhibiting the nob and resulting in stable partial nitrification 13 note that ph and temperature could also impact the algal growth and bacterial activity which could lead to different nitrogen transformation 14 low temperature 20 c conditions are not conducive to algal growth whereas increased organic carbon secretion by algae would promote bacterial growth under this condition 15 overall there are many factors influencing the nitrite accumulation in such an algal bacterial consortia reactor thus it is essential for us to maintain the balance between algae and bacteria growth and reaction activity ammonia oxidation by nitrification and microalgal assimilation as well as the heterotroph growth 12 however the varying partial nitrification mechanisms including microbial activities communities and interactions in different algal bacterial systems are still unclear and need to be explored we noted that algal bacterial consortia have been widely studied in sequencing batch reactors sbr 16 17 liu et al inoculated chlorella and chlamydomonas together with aerobic granular sludge in a psbr system to achieve simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal 18 another recent work by si et al reported that a nar of 87 5 was achieved in a photo granular sbr by light intensity and free ammonia fa inhibiting the nob activity 19 generally sbr permits relatively easy combinations with other bioprocesses for instance the shortcut denitrification stage is achieved directly in psbr via regulating light and dark cycles 13 however large scale applications of sbr will require more complex designs and face more challenges in terms of operation management and control while continuous flow wastewater treatment facilities are usually favorable 20 yang et al initiated partial nitrification of nar 90 in a sole algal chlorella bacterial system with a semi continuous mode 21 another study by watari et al used a continuous photo baffled reactor under low do and high fa resulting in a higher nar of approximately 98 22 as such it is necessary to understand how the operating mode or reactor configuration impacts the partial nitrification by algal bacterial consortia in this work therefore a long term stable partial nitrification performance was achieved and the microbiological characteristics of the algal bacterial consortium were evaluated in two different experimental setups i e continuous flow and sequencing batch reactor for anaerobic wastewater treatment a nitrogen conversion activity of the algal bacterial sludge was monitored following its reaching steady state according to the high throughput and metagenomic sequencing the microbial community composition co occurrence network pattern functional genes and the underlying microbial mechanisms contributing to the nitrite accumulation in the two reactors were revealed results of this work are expected to provide basic and useful information for the design and operation of the cost effective photo biosystem to achieve nitrite accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation parameters a lab scale psbr was set up fig s1a and operated with the following cycle influent 5 min mixing and reaction 23 5 h settling 20 min the sludge volume index svi was approximately 83 ml g at 5 min indicating that the biomass had good settling properties and decanting 5 min the volumetric exchange ratio of the psbr a working volume of 0 6 l was set to 83 resulting in hydraulic retention time hrt set at around 24 h such a high volumetric exchange ratio could prevent nitrite from being retained in the mixture reducing the inhibition of high nitrite concentrations on microorganisms and avoiding further conversion of nitrite 23 24 the solid retention time srt was set at approximately 10 d another lab scale photo up flow sludge blanket bioreactor pusb with a working volume of 0 6 l was set up with two zones the bottom zone was filled with algal bacterial sludge and the feeding media was continuously pumped by a peristaltic pump jihpumpbt 100ea china the top zone was filled by floating carriers 30 volume ratio for floating flocs rejection and equipped with a 3 phase separator for continuous discharge of treated effluent fig s1b the srt for pusb was around 20 d as one third of the sludge bed was removed every week and the hrt was set at 12 h the inoculum of the algal bacterial community in the reactors was collected from the anaerobic effluent storage tanks under light exposure the initial solid concentration of approximately 0 5 g tss l was inoculated into the bioreactor fig s2a the two pbrs were operated at ambient temperature and the ph was controlled at 7 0 7 5 do concentrations were also monitored regularly for the reactors 0 55 0 17 and 0 58 0 14 mg l for psbr and pusb respectively table s2 throughout the experiment the reactors were illuminated with a led light strip red blue lights 4 1 12 w of light capacity under an illumination intensity of 30 μmol m 2 s 1 around the reactor given that monochromatic blue and red wavelengths have been reported to facilitate algal growth photosynthetic reactions and biosynthesis of carotenoids and other useful metabolites than full spectrum sunlight 14 15 the blue and red leds overlap was used here the light intensity was optimized in order to enhance the occurrence of nitritation 12 fig s2b the fresh effluent from a lab scale anmbr operated for synthetic wastewater treatment under steady conditions 25 was collected as the influent of the two reactors which is composed of 20 71 mg cod l 50 70 mg nh4 n l 0 1 50 mg no2 n l 0 0 50 mg no3 n l 5 mg po4 3 p l and trace element solution 1 ml l in table s1 changes in the concentration of n species i e c n h 4 n c n

using scanning electron microscopy sem samples for sem analysis were washed three times in phosphate buffer solution after being collected from reactors subsequently each sample was fixed overnight with 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c and dehydrated in a series of ethanol gradients 25 50 75 90 and 100 then the samples were dried under vacuum and sputter coated with gold using a sputter coater for sem characterization su3500 hitachi japan 2 3 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and analysis sludge samples in the psbr and pusb were collected during the stable period and stored in a 80 c refrigerator before being processed further the dna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing were carried out as previously described by zhi et al 27 the alpha diversity of bacterial communities such as the faith pd index and the chao 1 index was calculated and analyzed using qiime 2 0 microbial network analysis was performed according to the methodology described in our previous study 27 based on the mena pipeline for both reactor samples 28 significant associations p 0 05 were extracted for further network construction and a similarity matrix was calculated based on pearson s rank correlation network graphs were generated by using gephi software 29 the network topological properties were extracted including nodes edges degree average connectivity avgk average clustering coefficient avgcc harmonic geodesic distance hd transitivity and modularity 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and annotation genomic dna from two reactor samples was prepared with e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa following the manufacturer s procedures the concentration and integrity of dna were checked by nanodrop spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm nd2000 usa subsequently paired end libraries were constructed using truseqtm dna sample prep kit following a previous study 30 and whole genome sequencing was performed by illumina hiseq4000 platform the low quality reads i e length 50 bp or with 50 low quality nucleotides were discarded afterwards sequencing reads were pooled and assembled into contigs with a minimum length of 300 bp we performed gene prediction taxonomic annotation and kegg functional annotation analysis using the diamond program e value 10 5 31 reads per million mapped rpm were used to indicate the relative abundance of genes 2 5 analytical procedures and statistical methods the quantification of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were performed according to standard methods 32 batch tests and respirometry assays were carried out to measure the specific nitritation rates snr the specific ammonium aobact and nitrite nobact oxidation activity based on previous studies 27 33 determination of do and ph were performed with a do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany and a ph meter fe20k mettler toledo switzerland respectively the surface structure and morphology of algal bacterial sludge were also observed by white light and fluorescence microscopy uy203i uop china following the recommendations of the handbook of methods in aquatic microbial ecology we used a green yellow 520 to 560 nm excitation filter to detect the auto fluorescence of cyanobacteria 34 35 we used two statistical analyses including kruskal wallis and paired wilcoxon tests to determine the significance of differences in alpha diversity between groups in r studio a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant and p value 0 01 meant that the difference was more statistically significant beta diversity with bray curtis distance based principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed the significance of bray curtis dissimilarity based variances in the bacterial community structure was analyzed by performing permutation multivariate analysis of variance permanova analysis redundancy analysis rda was performed on canoco 4 5 to explore the correlation between microbial communities and operational parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the variations of effluent n species nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and nars in the psbr and pusb are shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the operation the inoculated biomass was very low 0 5 g l and the hrt 12h was short resulting in a less effective nitrification of the pusb by comparison the psbr with longer hrt 24 h had better nitrogen conversion despite of the shorter srt notably the nar reached 92 70 7 81 in the psbr which was higher than that of the pusb 81 44 11 28 fig 1c indicating that both the photobioreactors achieved excellent nitrite accumulation without mechanical aeration however the nitrate accumulation was observed in the pusb effluent thus resulting in a decline in the nar level from 100 day 30 to 66 0 day 108 in contrast the nitrite accumulation was maintained with less nitrate production in the psbr which could be further explained by the microbial activity and profile data the longer srt facilitates the enhancement of nob activity and complete nitrification by bacteria 27 36 which potentially leads to lower partial nitrification performance in pusb on the other hand hrt is another key operating factor 37 38 the kinetic tests showed that a longer hrt of the reactor was prone to enhance the conversion of nitrite to nitrate fig s3 meanwhile reducing hrt means an increase in nitrogen load rate which could thus promote the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate in pusb in the study of trebuch et al lower hrt promoted the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and consequently more denitrification nitrogen removal 38 notably denitrification potentially has a certain contribution to nitrite accumulation especially in the pusb with a longer srt and thus more endogenous decay products 39 these microbial by products might therefore be consumed resulting in a low effluent cod 50 mg l in table 1 we noted that the n removal and conversion greatly depended on the reactor setup and operating strategy used in similar reactor setups psbrs varied nh4 removal pathway nh4 no2 or nh4 no3 was observed in the study of zhi et al owing to different srts 27 partial nitrification nar 94 in cylindrical glass psbr and continuous photo baffled reactor were both achieved well by the inhibition of nob under low do and high fa fna conditions 13 22 table 1 the removal rate of total inorganic n tin in psbr and pusb was much similar 24 02 8 58 and 26 41 13 02 respectively p 0 05 fig 1c previous studies have reported high tin removal efficiency 60 observed in algal bacterial systems with stronger light intensity 200 μmol m 2 s 1 3 19 according to meng et al tin removal due to algal growth was higher in a continuous flow reactor cfr with light compared to the reactor without light 40 furthermore variations in the light intensity from 0 to 225 μmol m 2 s 1 had a positive effect on the algae bacterial granule system in the psbr with an increase in tin removal from 61 to 80 indicating that tin removal could be improved by intense light irradiation 12 41 in our work the low light intensity 30 μmol m 2 s 1 in both reactors might limit algal growth and thus led to lower algal n assimilation our preliminary experiments also showed that a stronger light intensity enhanced the removal of tin fig s2b the aob and nob activities of the psbr and pusb sludge were further measured by respirometry assays during steady state operation to understand the establishment of partial nitrification fig 1d in both cases the aob activity was much greater than the nob activity implying that the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite was improved but the step of nitrite transforming to nitrate was inhibited in the psbr and pusb which is consistent with the performance of the reactors notably the pusb had significantly lower aob activity and higher nob activity compared to the psbr resulting in an easier conversion of nitrite to nitrate which could be the main reason of nitrate accumulation in the pusb this result was further supported by a lower snr of the pusb fig 1d the retention of biomass in the pusb srt 20 d allowed more nob to be enriched in the reactor however the relatively compact sludge bed affected the gas and nutrient transfer between algae and bacteria thereby reducing microbial activity 6 and meanwhile led to the worse light penetration and thus lower partial nitrification in the pusb nevertheless we noted that the pusb achieved similar nitrite accumulation at a lower hrt 12 h compared with the psbr in the early stages probably because of the pusb containing more diverse microbial populations and denser interspecific associations see section 3 4 3 2 morphology of algal bacterial consortia in the psbr and pusb typical algal bacterial aggregation occurred and filamentous algae were present in the aggregation floc merging with unicellular algae and prokaryotes in fig s4 we found the enrichment of motile and filamentous cyanobacteria in pbrs by observing the autofluorescence of cyanobacteria 34 the sludge and fluorescence areas of psbr and pusb microscopy images were calculated by image j software where the percentage of fluorescence area was 88 28 and 64 63 of the psbr and pusb sludge respectively fig s4 this implies that the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria could play an important role in the dense structure of psbr sludge previous studies reported that lower light levels 100 μmol m 2 s 1 could promote the growth of filamentous cyanobacteria against filamentous green algae since cyanobacteria are better to adapt to light limited conditions 34 42 however the competitive advantage of filamentous cyanobacteria did not develop in the pusb as the small unicellular algae competed favorably due to their higher growth rate and nutrient availability 43 44 after long term reactor operation filamentous cyanobacteria served as a backbone in the psbr that inhabited other microbes on their surfaces fig 2 45 interwoven filamentous cyanobacteria and extracellular polymers eps formed a dense spherical network to trap bacteria fig 2d the slime produced by filamentous cyanobacteria is highly correlated with their sliding movements as it can act as a lubricant or substrate for the movement of filamentous cyanobacteria 46 47 moreover we directly observed the gliding motion of filamentous cyanobacteria using light microscopy many previous studies have reported the occurrence of sub collisions and random motions when filamentous cyanobacteria are present in large numbers leading to the formation of aggregates 48 in the pusb a mixture of branched flame like short filamentous cyanobacteria mainly leptolyngbya see section 3 3 49 and unicellular green algae were observed within the algal bacterial aggregates fig 2h interestingly unicellular green algae and bacteria were observed with eps like network 50 51 further close ups of this structure showed numerous algal and bacterial cells embedded in fibrous eps similar to spider webs forming a single knot on filamentous algae fig 2h which was observed and identified by comparison with the literature 52 of note eps are produced by cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae for cell motility and protection and help to stabilize the algal bacterial aggregation meanwhile carbon sources could be released from the eps and decaying algal substrates to initiate the bacteria growth for enhancing the formation of algal bacterial aggregation and leading to dynamic performance and communities in different systems overall this work shows that the symbiotic relationship between filamentous cyanobacteria algae and bacteria could be very important in two pbrs for adapting to different operating regimes 3 3 overview of the microbiota in the psbr and pusb 16 s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomics analysis was performed to characterize the microbial communities in the psbr and pusb the relative rarity of eukaryotic algae 3 relative abundance and abundant bacterial taxa in the two pbrs was demonstrated based on the taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences fig s5 which might be attributed to a greater potential for cyanobacteria to outcompete eukaryotic algae in wastewater treatment 6 furthermore the main microbiomes of psbr and pusb could be the bacterial community inferred from 16 s rrna gene sequencing 1 microbial diversity in the pusb was significantly higher than that in psbr concerning faith s pd and chao1 index kruskal wallis test s p 0 05 pairwise wilcoxon test s p 0 001 fig 3a which was in line with the observation of sem images fig 2 the light shading derived decay or disintegration of algae cyanobacteria in the pusb could become more serious to produce microbial organic products 1 to support more diverse microbial communities zhu et al used three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem to demonstrate the production of microbial metabolites in an algal bacterial system 53 and substrate gradient developing of the sludge bed in the pusb might provide additional ecological niches for such higher microbial diversity 18 while the sequencing and completely mixing operation modes in the psbr could prefer to enrich more homogeneous communities 54 meanwhile samples from the pusb and psbr were clustered separately according to the pcoa plot suggesting that the microbial composition of the two reactors was significantly different permanova s p 0 001 fig 3b of these the phyla cyanobacteria 43 2 and proteobacteria mainly alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria 16 8 and 15 7 dominated in the psbr which contained a variety of typical nitrifiers e g nitrosomonas and denitrifying bacteria e g rhodocyclaceae 55 56 the pusb also contained cyanobacteria 40 9 but with a lower proportion than that of the psbr in contrast the gammaproteobacteria 17 1 and bacteroidetes 18 9 were higher in the pusb fig 3c previous studies have shown that bacteroidetes are involved in the transformation of algal dom for supporting denitrifying bacteria through hydrolysis and fermentation of complex organic matter in bioreactors 57 bacteroidetes and gammaproteobacteria were regarded as fast growing taxa 58 59 probably allowing them to have a stronger competitive advantage on nutrients compared with cyanobacteria a clear difference in the composition of the cyanobacterial families was observed between psbr and pusb enriching for phormidium 33 5 and leptolyngbya 18 2 respectively figs 3c and s5 both the cyanobacteria are filamentous and motile and often found in the phototrophic biomass of algal bacterial consortia 8 in addition strong positive and negative pearson correlations were observed between the first principal co ordinates pco1 score and the relative abundance of phormidium and leptolyngbya respectively table s3 suggesting that the two families partially contributed to the sample separation of the psbr from pusb fig 3b concerning the nitrifiers a total of 90 ammonia oxidizing bacterial and archaeal asvs classified in the genera nitrosomonas 89 asvs and candidatus nitrosotenuis 1 asv 23 nitrite oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genera nitrospira 14 asvs and nitrolancea 9 asvs were determined as shown in fig s6 the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was about 1 65 in psbr which was much higher than that in pusb 0 008 furthermore relatively rare nitrospira 0 001 and 0 035 respectively was identified in psbr and pusb these results further indicated that the varied partial nitrification performance between psbr and pusb was largely attributed to the enrichment and growth of specific nitrifiers in algal bacteria systems in the pusb the proliferation of algal blooms and insufficient nutrients and gas liquid transfer could inhibit the growth of the nitrifying bacterial population 19 on the other hand the constant low ammonia concentrations in continuous flow operation mode are not suitable for the rapid growth of nitrifying bacteria 33 additionally the genera involved in the denitrification process such as terrimonas 13 6 and 7 2 denitratisoma 2 7 and 1 9 and thermomonas 0 7 and 1 9 might contribute to the nitrogen removal and nitrite accumulation in the pusb and psbr 60 fig s6 terrimonas have been reported as a common phycosphere bacteria with algal aggregation capabilities 61 notably the pusb had higher relative abundances of terrimonas and denitratisoma which could be due to more algal decay death and algal derived secretions in the pusb systems and thus facilitate the denitrification process watari et al also reported that the denitrifying bacteria 5 6 denitratisoma oestradiolicum and 5 6 denitratimonas tolerans were detected in a photo baffled reactor even without organic matter addition 22 3 4 microbes synergistically contributed to the partial nitrification microbial taxa in the two different types of reactors had distinct co occurrence patterns fig 4 exhibiting significant differences in the network structure and topological features the number of nodes and the total number of edges between taxa were much higher in the pusb compared to the psbr which is consistent with the lower microbial diversity of psbr fig 3a and table s4 the pusb network consisted of 326 nodes e g taxa and 2558 edges associations between taxa whereas the psbr network 125 nodes and 668 edges intriguingly positive interactions of the network were more pronounced in the pusb compared to the psbr i e 83 1 vs 40 0 positive associations indicating that the continuous operation mode of the reactor likely facilitated cooperative behaviors 62 specifically the pusb network harbored higher average connectivity avgk higher average clustering coefficient avgcc and higher average degree ave d further indicating more intensive species interactions compared to the psbr 63 64 the stress of low nutrients in the continuous flow mode could promote intensive inter species interactions and more cooperative behavior 65 zi pi plots in figs 4b and d showed that 18 and 2 keystone species were identified in the pusb 14 module hubs asvs and 4 connector asvs as well as psbr 1 module hubs asv and 1 connector asv community networks respectively according to the zi and pi cut offs 66 indicating crucial roles of the reactor operation mode and design in guiding the ecological structure of algal bacteria sludge microbiota in the pusb system a large majority of these keystone species that exhibit denitrification potential were closely associated with the removal and transformation of nitrogen and nitrogenous substances e g protein amino sugar like compounds 67 which were the primary substances in the bulk liquid or and algae derived organic substances 68 70 the results of a hierarchical cluster analysis in terms of pearson correlation coefficients between keystone species abundance and operational parameters are illustrated in fig s7 a high degree of homogeneity in the successional patterns of the asvs within each cluster was observed table s5 in cluster a the decreases of these populations such as roseomonas hydrogenophaga bosea and singulisphaera were positively correlated with the decline in the aob activity microbial populations in cluster b were mainly positively related to nitrite nitrate nar and the nob activity interestingly all keystone species in psbr were present in cluster a whereas most of the keystone species in pusb belonged to cluster b these results indicate that these keystone species could play a unique and crucial role in shaping community structures and functions we further performed the rda analysis to verify the relationship between microbial communities and partial nitrification fig 5 the aob activity and nar were the most two important variables influencing the composition of the bacterial community the high positive correlation between nitrosomonadaceae and aob activity implied its contribution to the excellent partial nitrification performance in psbr in addition the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria e g terrimicrobiaceae positively influenced nitrite accumulation further confirming the important role of denitrifying bacteria in the pusb system for the nitrite accumulation fig 5 and table s5 3 5 functional genes in the pusb and psbr in the pusb and psbr amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism were the three main metabolic pathways fig s8 genes involved in the nitrogen cycle were investigated in the two systems fig 6 ammonia monooxygenase amo genes amoabc and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao gene hao were detected in both psbr and pusb samples and the relative abundance of these amo and hao genes were higher in psbr 532 and 349 rpm compared to pusb 8 and 115 rpm especially for sequences related to the phylum proteobacteria fig 6a and b which corresponded to the enhanced aob activity and higher snr in psbr fig 1d however the bacteroidetes dominated genes responsible for nitrite oxidization nxrab in pusb 1253 rpm were higher than proteobacteria dominated genes in psbr 345 rpm which could be correlated with the high nitrate concentration observed in the effluent fig 1b with respect to the denitrification process the expressed ratio of nitrite reductase genes nirs nirk nitrate reductase genes narghi napab in psbr and pusb was 0 75 and 0 40 respectively according to previous studies nitrite could be accumulated when the nirs nirk napa narg expression ratio was 2 0 2 5 71 72 as such the partial denitrification process might be present in the two systems note that the expression ratio of narghi napab and amoabc hao in pusb was 14 18 indicating that partial denitrification could be mainly responsible for the efficient accumulation of nitrite in the pusb system overall the nitrogen assimilation nitrification and partial denitrification were coupled in the algal bacterial system but nitrogen metabolic pathways varied across the systems 3 6 implications and research needs stable partial nitrification is a crucial process for the successful application of anammox in the treatment of low strength ammonium wastewater in recent years aeration free partial nitrification by algal bacterial consortia in wastewater treatment has attracted increasing interests as it could reduce carbon emission and aeration energy have less greenhouse gas emissions and lower biomass production 9 13 however nitrite accumulation depends on different conditions including reactor configurations substrate types algal species bacterial sources growth forms light source intensity hrt and srt etc in the present study the nitrite accumulation in algal bacterial consortia was achieved in the two different types of reactor configurations i e psbr and pusb which greatly shaped different microbial activity morphology and community structure interaction and thus led to different nitrite accumulation mechanisms the psbr with a higher aob activity and stronger nob inhibition guaranteed more stable performance for the nitrite accumulation which could be due to the complete mixing culture and better light transmission as well as a shorter srt 10 d in contrast the pusb had a higher nob activity leading to nitrate production which could be related to a longer srt 20 d despite a shorter hrt 12 h in the pusb the proliferation of algal blooms owing to a longer srt 20 d and constant low ammonia concentrations in continuous flow operation mode could limit the growth of the nitrifying bacterial population 19 33 which could result in process failure in addition the formation of sludge beds in the pusb prevented the light penetration and created an anoxic zone which could provide favorable conditions for the growth and metabolism of denitrifying bacteria a higher abundance of nitrate reductase genes found in this study further observations in table 1 the psbr is more prevalent in the research of algal bacterial consortia systems due to its operational flexibility however the continuous operation of pbr is more suitable for the requirements of wastewater treatment plants in practical application therefore there is still a need to develop new continuous flow algal bacterial partial nitrification reactors in the future to ensure stable performance in addition the algal bacterial partial nitrification coupled with the anammox process is the important objective and the feasibility of the nitrogen removal process of algal bacterial systems e g canon and sharon anammox process should be further evaluated in mainstream wastewater treatment more stable and robust photosystems should be designed to integrate and control complex microbial communities meanwhile the role of eps in the complex algal bacterial consortia formation and nutrient removals could be further studied 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this work can be drawn as follows the ammonia nitrogen removal via nitrite pathway was successfully performed under 30 μmol m 2 s 1 illuminance in the tested two algal bacterial systems the nar in the psbr and pusb being 92 70 and 81 44 respectively although the different operation modes and conditions were applied microscopic observations and community analysis revealed great differences in the algal bacterial sludge morphology microbial diversity and interactions in the two photobioreactors denser algal bacterial granular sludge was observed in the psbr whereas the algal bacterial floc was looser in the pusb significant differences in the microbial community were further shown with phormidium and leptolyngbya being enriched in the psbr and pusb respectively a higher enrichment of nitrosomonas aob and a stronger inhibition of nitrospira nob contributed to a better partial nitrification performance in the psbr the pusb had more intensive interspecific interactions and more cooperative behavior in the microbial network as well as more complex nitrogen metabolic pathways declaration of competing interest the authors

12508,nitrite accumulation could be achieved in algal bacterial consortia without energy intensive aeration which could be a sustainable alternative for wastewater treatment however few studies focused on the achievement of partial nitrification in different non aerated algal bacterial systems and the related microbial mechanisms are still unclear here two different algal bacterial systems photo sequencing batch reactor psbr and up flow sludge blanket bioreactor pusb were operated for anaerobic effluent treatment and the non aerated partial nitrification was evaluated results showed that the nitrite accumulation rates in the psbr and pusb were 92 70 7 81 and 81 44 11 28 respectively which was constant with microbial activities denser algal bacterial granules were observed in the psbr whereas looser algal bacterial flocs were in the pusb phormidium and leptolyngbya i e two filamentous cyanobacteria were enriched in the psbr and pusb respectively and the higher enrichment of nitrosomonas and complete inhibition of nitrospira contributed to better partial nitrification of psbr the pusb had more intensive interspecific interactions and more cooperative behavior in microbial network metagenomic analysis revealed that partial denitrification might partially contribute to the nitrite accumulation in the pusb owing to higher nitrate reductase gene expressions overall this study advances our understandings of the partial nitrification process and nitrite accumulation by algal bacterial consortia graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photobioreactor partial nitrification nitrification activity microbial community microbial interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction algal bacterial consortia represent a community dominated by eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria with a variety of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms co existing 1 in recent years there has been an increasing research on algal bacterial systems for wastewater treatment such as aeration free nitrification 2 3 nutrients removal 4 5 and bioproducts e g biodiesel generation 6 7 more recently safitri et al also investigated the co culture of green algae and methanotrophs for the dissolved methane removal from anaerobic effluent 8 compared with the conventional activated sludge cas process these phototrophs can autonomously produce the o2 required for the oxidation of organic matter and ammonia by bacteria without the need for energy intensive aeration 9 and meanwhile with the reduction of greenhouse gasses 10 11 therefore the algal bacterial consortia are a potentially sustainable and green alternative to the cas process in the future various photobioreactors pbrs have been extensively developed for nitrogen removal or partial nitrification as a carbon and energy efficient wastewater treatment technology in table 1 the nitrite accumulation rate nar varied widely from 0 to 99 8 depending on different conditions including reactor configurations photo sequencing batch reactor psbr and membrane photobioreactor mpbr substrate types synthetic and real wastewaters algae species eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria bacterial sources growth forms flocs and granulated sludge as well as biofilm light source intensity 30 1531 μmol m 2 s 1 water temperature 18 35 c ph 6 6 8 2 and initial ammonium concentration 22 2 326 mg n l 1 for instance akizuki et al reported a lower light illumination of 27 35 μmol m 2 s 1 to regulate a lower dissolved oxygen do value and thus to inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for achieving the nitrite accumulation in a batch algal nitrifying bacterial system 12 in addition the high concentrations of ammonia and nitrite in the psbr could form the free ammonia fa and nitrous acid fna for effectively inhibiting the nob and resulting in stable partial nitrification 13 note that ph and temperature could also impact the algal growth and bacterial activity which could lead to different nitrogen transformation 14 low temperature 20 c conditions are not conducive to algal growth whereas increased organic carbon secretion by algae would promote bacterial growth under this condition 15 overall there are many factors influencing the nitrite accumulation in such an algal bacterial consortia reactor thus it is essential for us to maintain the balance between algae and bacteria growth and reaction activity ammonia oxidation by nitrification and microalgal assimilation as well as the heterotroph growth 12 however the varying partial nitrification mechanisms including microbial activities communities and interactions in different algal bacterial systems are still unclear and need to be explored we noted that algal bacterial consortia have been widely studied in sequencing batch reactors sbr 16 17 liu et al inoculated chlorella and chlamydomonas together with aerobic granular sludge in a psbr system to achieve simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal 18 another recent work by si et al reported that a nar of 87 5 was achieved in a photo granular sbr by light intensity and free ammonia fa inhibiting the nob activity 19 generally sbr permits relatively easy combinations with other bioprocesses for instance the shortcut denitrification stage is achieved directly in psbr via regulating light and dark cycles 13 however large scale applications of sbr will require more complex designs and face more challenges in terms of operation management and control while continuous flow wastewater treatment facilities are usually favorable 20 yang et al initiated partial nitrification of nar 90 in a sole algal chlorella bacterial system with a semi continuous mode 21 another study by watari et al used a continuous photo baffled reactor under low do and high fa resulting in a higher nar of approximately 98 22 as such it is necessary to understand how the operating mode or reactor configuration impacts the partial nitrification by algal bacterial consortia in this work therefore a long term stable partial nitrification performance was achieved and the microbiological characteristics of the algal bacterial consortium were evaluated in two different experimental setups i e continuous flow and sequencing batch reactor for anaerobic wastewater treatment a nitrogen conversion activity of the algal bacterial sludge was monitored following its reaching steady state according to the high throughput and metagenomic sequencing the microbial community composition co occurrence network pattern functional genes and the underlying microbial mechanisms contributing to the nitrite accumulation in the two reactors were revealed results of this work are expected to provide basic and useful information for the design and operation of the cost effective photo biosystem to achieve nitrite accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation parameters a lab scale psbr was set up fig s1a and operated with the following cycle influent 5 min mixing and reaction 23 5 h settling 20 min the sludge volume index svi was approximately 83 ml g at 5 min indicating that the biomass had good settling properties and decanting 5 min the volumetric exchange ratio of the psbr a working volume of 0 6 l was set to 83 resulting in hydraulic retention time hrt set at around 24 h such a high volumetric exchange ratio could prevent nitrite from being retained in the mixture reducing the inhibition of high nitrite concentrations on microorganisms and avoiding further conversion of nitrite 23 24 the solid retention time srt was set at approximately 10 d another lab scale photo up flow sludge blanket bioreactor pusb with a working volume of 0 6 l was set up with two zones the bottom zone was filled with algal bacterial sludge and the feeding media was continuously pumped by a peristaltic pump jihpumpbt 100ea china the top zone was filled by floating carriers 30 volume ratio for floating flocs rejection and equipped with a 3 phase separator for continuous discharge of treated effluent fig s1b the srt for pusb was around 20 d as one third of the sludge bed was removed every week and the hrt was set at 12 h the inoculum of the algal bacterial community in the reactors was collected from the anaerobic effluent storage tanks under light exposure the initial solid concentration of approximately 0 5 g tss l was inoculated into the bioreactor fig s2a the two pbrs were operated at ambient temperature and the ph was controlled at 7 0 7 5 do concentrations were also monitored regularly for the reactors 0 55 0 17 and 0 58 0 14 mg l for psbr and pusb respectively table s2 throughout the experiment the reactors were illuminated with a led light strip red blue lights 4 1 12 w of light capacity under an illumination intensity of 30 μmol m 2 s 1 around the reactor given that monochromatic blue and red wavelengths have been reported to facilitate algal growth photosynthetic reactions and biosynthesis of carotenoids and other useful metabolites than full spectrum sunlight 14 15 the blue and red leds overlap was used here the light intensity was optimized in order to enhance the occurrence of nitritation 12 fig s2b the fresh effluent from a lab scale anmbr operated for synthetic wastewater treatment under steady conditions 25 was collected as the influent of the two reactors which is composed of 20 71 mg cod l 50 70 mg nh4 n l 0 1 50 mg no2 n l 0 0 50 mg no3 n l 5 mg po4 3 p l and trace element solution 1 ml l in table s1 changes in the concentration of n species i e c n h 4 n c n o 2 n and c n o 3 n are measured regularly to monitor the performance of the reactor the nar was calculated according to eq 1 26 1 nar c n o 2 n c n o 2 n c n o 3 n 100 2 2 microscopic observations using scanning electron microscopy sem samples for sem analysis were washed three times in phosphate buffer solution after being collected from reactors subsequently each sample was fixed overnight with 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c and dehydrated in a series of ethanol gradients 25 50 75 90 and 100 then the samples were dried under vacuum and sputter coated with gold using a sputter coater for sem characterization su3500 hitachi japan 2 3 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and analysis sludge samples in the psbr and pusb were collected during the stable period and stored in a 80 c refrigerator before being processed further the dna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing were carried out as previously described by zhi et al 27 the alpha diversity of bacterial communities such as the faith pd index and the chao 1 index was calculated and analyzed using qiime 2 0 microbial network analysis was performed according to the methodology described in our previous study 27 based on the mena pipeline for both reactor samples 28 significant associations p 0 05 were extracted for further network construction and a similarity matrix was calculated based on pearson s rank correlation network graphs were generated by using gephi software 29 the network topological properties were extracted including nodes edges degree average connectivity avgk average clustering coefficient avgcc harmonic geodesic distance hd transitivity and modularity 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and annotation genomic dna from two reactor samples was prepared with e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa following the manufacturer s procedures the concentration and integrity of dna were checked by nanodrop spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm nd2000 usa subsequently paired end libraries were constructed using truseqtm dna sample prep kit following a previous study 30 and whole genome sequencing was performed by illumina hiseq4000 platform the low quality reads i e length 50 bp or with 50 low quality nucleotides were discarded afterwards sequencing reads were pooled and assembled into contigs with a minimum length of 300 bp we performed gene prediction taxonomic annotation and kegg functional annotation analysis using the diamond program e value 10 5 31 reads per million mapped rpm were used to indicate the relative abundance of genes 2 5 analytical procedures and statistical methods the quantification of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were performed according to standard methods 32 batch tests and respirometry assays were carried out to measure the specific nitritation rates snr the specific ammonium aobact and nitrite nobact oxidation activity based on previous studies 27 33 determination of do and ph were performed with a do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany and a ph meter fe20k mettler toledo switzerland respectively the surface structure and morphology of algal bacterial sludge were also observed by white light and fluorescence microscopy uy203i uop china following the recommendations of the handbook of methods in aquatic microbial ecology we used a green yellow 520 to 560 nm excitation filter to detect the auto fluorescence of cyanobacteria 34 35 we used two statistical analyses including kruskal wallis and paired wilcoxon tests to determine the significance of differences in alpha diversity between groups in r studio a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant and p value 0 01 meant that the difference was more statistically significant beta diversity with bray curtis distance based principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed the significance of bray curtis dissimilarity based variances in the bacterial community structure was analyzed by performing permutation multivariate analysis of variance permanova analysis redundancy analysis rda was performed on canoco 4 5 to explore the correlation between microbial communities and operational parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the variations of effluent n species nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and nars in the psbr and pusb are shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the operation the inoculated biomass was very low 0 5 g l and the hrt 12h was short resulting in a less effective nitrification of the pusb by comparison the psbr with longer hrt 24 h had better nitrogen conversion despite of the shorter srt notably the nar reached 92 70 7 81 in the psbr which was higher than that of the pusb 81 44 11 28 fig 1c indicating that both the photobioreactors achieved excellent nitrite accumulation without mechanical aeration however the nitrate accumulation was observed in the pusb effluent thus resulting in a decline in the nar level from 100 day 30 to 66 0 day 108 in contrast the nitrite accumulation was maintained with less nitrate production in the psbr which could be further explained by the microbial activity and profile data the longer srt facilitates the enhancement of nob activity and complete nitrification by bacteria 27 36 which potentially leads to lower partial nitrification performance in pusb on the other hand hrt is another key operating factor 37 38 the kinetic tests showed that a longer hrt of the reactor was prone to enhance the conversion of nitrite to nitrate fig s3 meanwhile reducing hrt means an increase in nitrogen load rate which could thus promote the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate in pusb in the study of trebuch et al lower hrt promoted the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and consequently more denitrification nitrogen removal 38 notably denitrification potentially has a certain contribution to nitrite accumulation especially in the pusb with a longer srt and thus more endogenous decay products 39 these microbial by products might therefore be consumed resulting in a low effluent cod 50 mg l in table 1 we noted that the n removal and conversion greatly depended on the reactor setup and operating strategy used in similar reactor setups psbrs varied nh4 removal pathway nh4 no2 or nh4 no3 was observed in the study of zhi et al owing to different srts 27 partial nitrification nar 94 in cylindrical glass psbr and continuous photo baffled reactor were both achieved well by the inhibition of nob under low do and high fa fna conditions 13 22 table 1 the removal rate of total inorganic n tin in psbr and pusb was much similar 24 02 8 58 and 26 41 13 02 respectively p 0 05 fig 1c previous studies have reported high tin removal efficiency 60 observed in algal bacterial systems with stronger light intensity 200 μmol m 2 s 1 3 19 according to meng et al tin removal due to algal growth was higher in a continuous flow reactor cfr with light compared to the reactor without light 40 furthermore variations in the light intensity from 0 to 225 μmol m 2 s 1 had a positive effect on the algae bacterial granule system in the psbr with an increase in tin removal from 61 to 80 indicating that tin removal could be improved by intense light irradiation 12 41 in our work the low light intensity 30 μmol m 2 s 1 in both reactors might limit algal growth and thus led to lower algal n assimilation our preliminary experiments also showed that a stronger light intensity enhanced the removal of tin fig s2b the aob and nob activities of the psbr and pusb sludge were further measured by respirometry assays during steady state operation to understand the establishment of partial nitrification fig 1d in both cases the aob activity was much greater than the nob activity implying that the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite was improved but the step of nitrite transforming to nitrate was inhibited in the psbr and pusb which is consistent with the performance of the reactors notably the pusb had significantly lower aob activity and higher nob activity compared to the psbr resulting in an easier conversion of nitrite to nitrate which could be the main reason of nitrate accumulation in the pusb this result was further supported by a lower snr of the pusb fig 1d the retention of biomass in the pusb srt 20 d allowed more nob to be enriched in the reactor however the relatively compact sludge bed affected the gas and nutrient transfer between algae and bacteria thereby reducing microbial activity 6 and meanwhile led to the worse light penetration and thus lower partial nitrification in the pusb nevertheless we noted that the pusb achieved similar nitrite accumulation at a lower hrt 12 h compared with the psbr in the early stages probably because of the pusb containing more diverse microbial populations and denser interspecific associations see section 3 4 3 2 morphology of algal bacterial consortia in the psbr and pusb typical algal bacterial aggregation occurred and filamentous algae were present in the aggregation floc merging with unicellular algae and prokaryotes in fig s4 we found the enrichment of motile and filamentous cyanobacteria in pbrs by observing the autofluorescence of cyanobacteria 34 the sludge and fluorescence areas of psbr and pusb microscopy images were calculated by image j software where the percentage of fluorescence area was 88 28 and 64 63 of the psbr and pusb sludge respectively fig s4 this implies that the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria could play an important role in the dense structure of psbr sludge previous studies reported that lower light levels 100 μmol m 2 s 1 could promote the growth of filamentous cyanobacteria against filamentous green algae since cyanobacteria are better to adapt to light limited conditions 34 42 however the competitive advantage of filamentous cyanobacteria did not develop in the pusb as the small unicellular algae competed favorably due to their higher growth rate and nutrient availability 43 44 after long term reactor operation filamentous cyanobacteria served as a backbone in the psbr that inhabited other microbes on their surfaces fig 2 45 interwoven filamentous cyanobacteria and extracellular polymers eps formed a dense spherical network to trap bacteria fig 2d the slime produced by filamentous cyanobacteria is highly correlated with their sliding movements as it can act as a lubricant or substrate for the movement of filamentous cyanobacteria 46 47 moreover we directly observed the gliding motion of filamentous cyanobacteria using light microscopy many previous studies have reported the occurrence of sub collisions and random motions when filamentous cyanobacteria are present in large numbers leading to the formation of aggregates 48 in the pusb a mixture of branched flame like short filamentous cyanobacteria mainly leptolyngbya see section 3 3 49 and unicellular green algae were observed within the algal bacterial aggregates fig 2h interestingly unicellular green algae and bacteria were observed with eps like network 50 51 further close ups of this structure showed numerous algal and bacterial cells embedded in fibrous eps similar to spider webs forming a single knot on filamentous algae fig 2h which was observed and identified by comparison with the literature 52 of note eps are produced by cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae for cell motility and protection and help to stabilize the algal bacterial aggregation meanwhile carbon sources could be released from the eps and decaying algal substrates to initiate the bacteria growth for enhancing the formation of algal bacterial aggregation and leading to dynamic performance and communities in different systems overall this work shows that the symbiotic relationship between filamentous cyanobacteria algae and bacteria could be very important in two pbrs for adapting to different operating regimes 3 3 overview of the microbiota in the psbr and pusb 16 s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomics analysis was performed to characterize the microbial communities in the psbr and pusb the relative rarity of eukaryotic algae 3 relative abundance and abundant bacterial taxa in the two pbrs was demonstrated based on the taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences fig s5 which might be attributed to a greater potential for cyanobacteria to outcompete eukaryotic algae in wastewater treatment 6 furthermore the main microbiomes of psbr and pusb could be the bacterial community inferred from 16 s rrna gene sequencing 1 microbial diversity in the pusb was significantly higher than that in psbr concerning faith s pd and chao1 index kruskal wallis test s p 0 05 pairwise wilcoxon test s p 0 001 fig 3a which was in line with the observation of sem images fig 2 the light shading derived decay or disintegration of algae cyanobacteria in the pusb could become more serious to produce microbial organic products 1 to support more diverse microbial communities zhu et al used three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem to demonstrate the production of microbial metabolites in an algal bacterial system 53 and substrate gradient developing of the sludge bed in the pusb might provide additional ecological niches for such higher microbial diversity 18 while the sequencing and completely mixing operation modes in the psbr could prefer to enrich more homogeneous communities 54 meanwhile samples from the pusb and psbr were clustered separately according to the pcoa plot suggesting that the microbial composition of the two reactors was significantly different permanova s p 0 001 fig 3b of these the phyla cyanobacteria 43 2 and proteobacteria mainly alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria 16 8 and 15 7 dominated in the psbr which contained a variety of typical nitrifiers e g nitrosomonas and denitrifying bacteria e g rhodocyclaceae 55 56 the pusb also contained cyanobacteria 40 9 but with a lower proportion than that of the psbr in contrast the gammaproteobacteria 17 1 and bacteroidetes 18 9 were higher in the pusb fig 3c previous studies have shown that bacteroidetes are involved in the transformation of algal dom for supporting denitrifying bacteria through hydrolysis and fermentation of complex organic matter in bioreactors 57 bacteroidetes and gammaproteobacteria were regarded as fast growing taxa 58 59 probably allowing them to have a stronger competitive advantage on nutrients compared with cyanobacteria a clear difference in the composition of the cyanobacterial families was observed between psbr and pusb enriching for phormidium 33 5 and leptolyngbya 18 2 respectively figs 3c and s5 both the cyanobacteria are filamentous and motile and often found in the phototrophic biomass of algal bacterial consortia 8 in addition strong positive and negative pearson correlations were observed between the first principal co ordinates pco1 score and the relative abundance of phormidium and leptolyngbya respectively table s3 suggesting that the two families partially contributed to the sample separation of the psbr from pusb fig 3b concerning the nitrifiers a total of 90 ammonia oxidizing bacterial and archaeal asvs classified in the genera nitrosomonas 89 asvs and candidatus nitrosotenuis 1 asv 23 nitrite oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genera nitrospira 14 asvs and nitrolancea 9 asvs were determined as shown in fig s6 the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was about 1 65 in psbr which was much higher than that in pusb 0 008 furthermore relatively rare nitrospira 0 001 and 0 035 respectively was identified in psbr and pusb these results further indicated that the varied partial nitrification performance between psbr and pusb was largely attributed to the enrichment and growth of specific nitrifiers in algal bacteria systems in the pusb the proliferation of algal blooms and insufficient nutrients and gas liquid transfer could inhibit the growth of the nitrifying bacterial population 19 on the other hand the constant low ammonia concentrations in continuous flow operation mode are not suitable for the rapid growth of nitrifying bacteria 33 additionally the genera involved in the denitrification process such as terrimonas 13 6 and 7 2 denitratisoma 2 7 and 1 9 and thermomonas 0 7 and 1 9 might contribute to the nitrogen removal and nitrite accumulation in the pusb and psbr 60 fig s6 terrimonas have been reported as a common phycosphere bacteria with algal aggregation capabilities 61 notably the pusb had higher relative abundances of terrimonas and denitratisoma which could be due to more algal decay death and algal derived secretions in the pusb systems and thus facilitate the denitrification process watari et al also reported that the denitrifying bacteria 5 6 denitratisoma oestradiolicum and 5 6 denitratimonas tolerans were detected in a photo baffled reactor even without organic matter addition 22 3 4 microbes synergistically contributed to the partial nitrification microbial taxa in the two different types of reactors had distinct co occurrence patterns fig 4 exhibiting significant differences in the network structure and topological features the number of nodes and the total number of edges between taxa were much higher in the pusb compared to the psbr which is consistent with the lower microbial diversity of psbr fig 3a and table s4 the pusb network consisted of 326 nodes e g taxa and 2558 edges associations between taxa whereas the psbr network 125 nodes and 668 edges intriguingly positive interactions of the network were more pronounced in the pusb compared to the psbr i e 83 1 vs 40 0 positive associations indicating that the continuous operation mode of the reactor likely facilitated cooperative behaviors 62 specifically the pusb network harbored higher average connectivity avgk higher average clustering coefficient avgcc and higher average degree ave d further indicating more intensive species interactions compared to the psbr 63 64 the stress of low nutrients in the continuous flow mode could promote intensive inter species interactions and more cooperative behavior 65 zi pi plots in figs 4b and d showed that 18 and 2 keystone species were identified in the pusb 14 module hubs asvs and 4 connector asvs as well as psbr 1 module hubs asv and 1 connector asv community networks respectively according to the zi and pi cut offs 66 indicating crucial roles of the reactor operation mode and design in guiding the ecological structure of algal bacteria sludge microbiota in the pusb system a large majority of these keystone species that exhibit denitrification potential were closely associated with the removal and transformation of nitrogen and nitrogenous substances e g protein amino sugar like compounds 67 which were the primary substances in the bulk liquid or and algae derived organic substances 68 70 the results of a hierarchical cluster analysis in terms of pearson correlation coefficients between keystone species abundance and operational parameters are illustrated in fig s7 a high degree of homogeneity in the successional patterns of the asvs within each cluster was observed table s5 in cluster a the decreases of these populations such as roseomonas hydrogenophaga bosea and singulisphaera were positively correlated with the decline in the aob activity microbial populations in cluster b were mainly positively related to nitrite nitrate nar and the nob activity interestingly all keystone species in psbr were present in cluster a whereas most of the keystone species in pusb belonged to cluster b these results indicate that these keystone species could play a unique and crucial role in shaping community structures and functions we further performed the rda analysis to verify the relationship between microbial communities and partial nitrification fig 5 the aob activity and nar were the most two important variables influencing the composition of the bacterial community the high positive correlation between nitrosomonadaceae and aob activity implied its contribution to the excellent partial nitrification performance in psbr in addition the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria e g terrimicrobiaceae positively influenced nitrite accumulation further confirming the important role of denitrifying bacteria in the pusb system for the nitrite accumulation fig 5 and table s5 3 5 functional genes in the pusb and psbr in the pusb and psbr amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism were the three main metabolic pathways fig s8 genes involved in the nitrogen cycle were investigated in the two systems fig 6 ammonia monooxygenase amo genes amoabc and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao gene hao were detected in both psbr and pusb samples and the relative abundance of these amo and hao genes were higher in psbr 532 and 349 rpm compared to pusb 8 and 115 rpm especially for sequences related to the phylum proteobacteria fig 6a and b which corresponded to the enhanced aob activity and higher snr in psbr fig 1d however the bacteroidetes dominated genes responsible for nitrite oxidization nxrab in pusb 1253 rpm were higher than proteobacteria dominated genes in psbr 345 rpm which could be correlated with the high nitrate concentration observed in the effluent fig 1b with respect to the denitrification process the expressed ratio of nitrite reductase genes nirs nirk nitrate reductase genes narghi napab in psbr and pusb was 0 75 and 0 40 respectively according to previous studies nitrite could be accumulated when the nirs nirk napa narg expression ratio was 2 0 2 5 71 72 as such the partial denitrification process might be present in the two systems note that the expression ratio of narghi napab and amoabc hao in pusb was 14 18 indicating that partial denitrification could be mainly responsible for the efficient accumulation of nitrite in the pusb system overall the nitrogen assimilation nitrification and partial denitrification were coupled in the algal bacterial system but nitrogen metabolic pathways varied across the systems 3 6 implications and research needs stable partial nitrification is a crucial process for the successful application of anammox in the treatment of low strength ammonium wastewater in recent years aeration free partial nitrification by algal bacterial consortia in wastewater treatment has attracted increasing interests as it could reduce carbon emission and aeration energy have less greenhouse gas emissions and lower biomass production 9 13 however nitrite accumulation depends on different conditions including reactor configurations substrate types algal species bacterial sources growth forms light source intensity hrt and srt etc in the present study the nitrite accumulation in algal bacterial consortia was achieved in the two different types of reactor configurations i e psbr and pusb which greatly shaped different microbial activity morphology and community structure interaction and thus led to different nitrite accumulation mechanisms the psbr with a higher aob activity and stronger nob inhibition guaranteed more stable performance for the nitrite accumulation which could be due to the complete mixing culture and better light transmission as well as a shorter srt 10 d in contrast the pusb had a higher nob activity leading to nitrate production which could be related to a longer srt 20 d despite a shorter hrt 12 h in the pusb the proliferation of algal blooms owing to a longer srt 20 d and constant low ammonia concentrations in continuous flow operation mode could limit the growth of the nitrifying bacterial population 19 33 which could result in process failure in addition the formation of sludge beds in the pusb prevented the light penetration and created an anoxic zone which could provide favorable conditions for the growth and metabolism of denitrifying bacteria a higher abundance of nitrate reductase genes found in this study further observations in table 1 the psbr is more prevalent in the research of algal bacterial consortia systems due to its operational flexibility however the continuous operation of pbr is more suitable for the requirements of wastewater treatment plants in practical application therefore there is still a need to develop new continuous flow algal bacterial partial nitrification reactors in the future to ensure stable performance in addition the algal bacterial partial nitrification coupled with the anammox process is the important objective and the feasibility of the nitrogen removal process of algal bacterial systems e g canon and sharon anammox process should be further evaluated in mainstream wastewater treatment more stable and robust photosystems should be designed to integrate and control complex microbial communities meanwhile the role of eps in the complex algal bacterial consortia formation and nutrient removals could be further studied 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this work can be drawn as follows the ammonia nitrogen removal via nitrite pathway was successfully performed under 30 μmol m 2 s 1 illuminance in the tested two algal bacterial systems the nar in the psbr and pusb being 92 70 and 81 44 respectively although the different operation modes and conditions were applied microscopic observations and community analysis revealed great differences in the algal bacterial sludge morphology microbial diversity and interactions in the two photobioreactors denser algal bacterial granular sludge was observed in the psbr whereas the algal bacterial floc was looser in the pusb significant differences in the microbial community were further shown with phormidium and leptolyngbya being enriched in the psbr and pusb respectively a higher enrichment of nitrosomonas aob and a stronger inhibition of nitrospira nob contributed to a better partial nitrification performance in the psbr the pusb had more intensive interspecific interactions and more cooperative behavior in the microbial network as well as more complex nitrogen metabolic pathways declaration of competing interest the authors

12509,at present low carbon treatment of printed circuit board pcb tail wastewater by anammox process had not been reported stably produced nitrite instead of nitrate was the key to anammox process in this study a zeolite biological fixed bed zbfb reactor was started up to investigate the partial nitritation pn performance for the treatment of synthetic wastewater and pcb tail wastewater with ammonium concentration of 100 and 105 mg l respectively zbfb presented stable nitrite accumulation rate nar of 98 20 and 97 61 during the biological desorption stage respectively the pn mechanism was proven as the free ammonia fa inhibition which was maintained by the continuous desorption of ammonium from zeolite although pcb tail wastewater showed strong inhibition on bioactivity stable and efficient nitrite accumulation was obtained the average nitrite producing rate npr was 0 816 and 0 352 kg n m3 d separately the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps decreased high throughput sequencing analysis results further presented the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas in zbfb the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria thauera indicated the occurrence of simultaneous partial nitritation and denitrification spnd these results meant a novel and reliable pn method by zbfb for real wastewater was feasible which further promoted the development of energy saving anammox process in industrial wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pcb tail wastewater zeolite free ammonia nitrite accumulation ammonia oxidizing bacteria data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction printed circuit board pcb is the basic component of electronic products providing mechanical support and interconnection for other electronic components on the circuit board 1 in recent year the continuous expansion of electronic industry has also driven the rapid development of pcb industry pcb manufacturing is a long and complicated process which generates a large amount of wastewater such as pickling electroplating and etching process the annual output of pcb tail wastewater is 2 million m3 in china 2 this wastewater treatment must be carried out to avoid adverse impact on the environment the complex components such as heavy metals organic matter nitrogen additives and surfactants in pcb tail wastewater originate from different processes 3 4 nh4 n mainly produced in the etching section contributes most of the total nitrogen tn in pcb tail wastewater after removing most of the heavy metal ions by the lime and sodium sulfide precipitation process organic substances and nh4 n still remain in the tail wastewater traditional physico chemical methods could not efficiently remove tn and the cost of chemicals are prohibitively expensive in contrast biological method might be an appropriate way to remove tn from this wastewater for its low cost and excellent performance conventional nitrification denitrification has been the common biological method for nitrogen removal off industrial wastewater it has been reported that high efficiency was achieved by this process treating pcb tail wastewater optoelectronic wastewater and electroplating tail wastewater 5 7 however the lower reaction rate means that larger reactor size was required to meet the emission standard 8 in addition the consumption of extra carbon sources and aeration would increase the operational cost which is contrary to the interests of enterprises and low carbon development at present biological nitrogen removal via nitritation has received the widespread attention deriving from its economical and energy saving features 9 10 compared with nitrification denitrification nitritation denitrification could reduce 40 cod and save 25 oxygen consumption 11 partial nitritation and anammox pn a can eliminate external carbon resource requirements and reduce 60 of energy costs 12 pn a has achieved high efficiency and low cost nitrogen removal in the treatment of landfill leachate textile and digesting wastewater containing high strength ammonium 13 15 however it is faltering in realizing stable partial nitritation pn for wastewater with nh4 n concentration below 100 mg l which are the tough obstacles for the development and application of pn a process for industrial wastewater several common strategies for stable pn have been reported such as high temperature 16 inhibition of high free ammonia fa or free nitrous acid fna 17 18 low dissolved oxygen do 19 and intermittent aeration 20 however energy consumption would be huge to heat wastewater in practical operation and increase the burden on enterprises for low do strategy the ammonium removal rate would be low which could not meet the process requirements 21 intermittent aeration might have adverse impact on aob due to the frequent changes between different do conditions 22 these strategies might not be suitable for treating industrial wastewater containing various components in recent year zeolite has attracted the attention of researchers on account of its application in nitrogen removal as an inclusion compound of hydrated aluminosilicate mineral zeolite has a large adsorption capacity for ammonium and could provide growing sites for microorganisms thus the cycles operation of ammonium adsorbed by zeolite and then converted by nitrifying bacteria might be suitable for such wastewater treatment during the adsorption step high standard effluent could be obtained because most of the ammonium is conserved in zeolite then ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob on the biofilm could transfer ammonium into nitrite during biological desorption thus zeolite could be regenerated during this step as the adsorbed ammonium were released to supplement the transferred part in the liquid phase because of ammonium adsorption equilibrium an appropriate free ammonia fa might be maintained to selectively inhibit the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and stable pn could be achieved 23 previous research has shown that a novel zeolite biological fixed bed zbfb could realize stable pn for low strength ammonium synthetic wastewater with addition of nahco3 as alkalinity 24 but whether zbfb reactor could realize stable nitrite accumulation for real pcb tail wastewater remains unclear various kinds of components remained in the pcb tail wastewater might lead to undesired competitive adsorption since zeolite is also adsorbent of different pollutants 25 26 the adsorption sites of zeolite might be completely occupied by other ions it is uncertain whether the adsorption capacity of zeolite can be recovered in biological desorption stage and nh4 ion in pcb tail wastewater can be retained in the next adsorption stage nevertheless it was reported that aob showed a tolerance capacity towards the negative factors 27 28 thus despite the inhibition of high concentration of salinity and organic pollutants in pcb tail wastewater 29 31 achieving stable pn under extreme environment of real pcb tail wastewater is possible at present most of the research on pn was aimed at wastewater with low toxicity and there is scarcely any relevant article focusing on realizing stable pn for real industrial wastewater if this hypothesis is feasible the carbon low nitrogen removal process via the nitrite pathway might expand its engineering applicability in this study a laboratory scale zbfb reactor was started up by synthetic wastewater with approximately 100 mg l ammonium and then applied for real pcb tail wastewater with similar ammonium concentration the main purpose of this experiment was to 1 explore whether zbfb process could achieve stable pn for pcb tail wastewater 2 investigate the impacts of pcb wastewater towards eps production and components to explain the variations of bioactivities 3 analyze the evolution and differences of microbial communities using high throughput sequencing analysis to further discussed the mechanism for stable pn this study is helpful to promote the practical application of zbfb and provide technical suggestions for realizing low cost nitrogen removal process of industrial wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental reactor setup zbfb reactor was a cylindrical column with an inner diameter of 6 5 cm and a height of 80 0 cm fig 1 it was made of polymethyl methacrylate and filled with packing natural zeolite v 0 85 l mean particle size 0 5 mm adsorption capacity 3 0 mg nh4 n g in the adsorption stage wastewater would pass through the zeolite from the bottom of zbfb and nh4 ion was adsorbed in the zeolite in the desorption step an air compressor provided aeration from the bottom of zbfb aeration rate was controlled with a rotor meter the adsorption was conducted without temperature control while the biological desorption operational temperature was maintained in the range of 25 0 29 0 c by the heating equipment 2 2 wastewater and seed sludge the synthetic wastewater with a concentration of approximately 100 mg l nh4 n was prepared by adding nh4cl in proportion to tap water pcb tail wastewater was collected from guangdong xindayu environmental technology co ltd guangdong china and the specific characteristics of the wastewater were as follows cod 81 8 222 mg l nh4 n 84 1 125 7 mg l no2 n 0 3 mg l no3 n 0 8 mg l electrical conductivity 5 19 6 14 ms cm some elements of pcb wastewater and their concentrations were listed in table s1 adding nahco3 was to adjust influent ph ranging from 8 02 to 8 32 other necessary elements were supplied according to the literature 32 the seed sludge was taken from the discharged sludge of a nitritation reactor in our laboratory the reactor was utilized to treat synthetic wastewater with high strength ammonium and achieved an average nitrite accumulation ratio of 91 2 2 3 the startup and operation of zbfb approximately 10 l of 100 mg l nh4 n synthetic wastewater was pumped into zbfb for zeolite adsorption followed by the addition of seed sludge nahco3 and other necessary elements aeration was provided to the bottom of zbfb and the aeration rate was controlled at a low level of 0 4 l min when nitrite accumulation ratio nar exceeded 80 the startup of nitritation system was completed liquid in the reactor was discharged and the zeolite was backwashed with tap water after that zbfb was conducted by cycles operation the overall operation was divided into two phases treating synthetic wastewater at phase і cycle 1 75 and subsequent pcb tail wastewater at phase ii cycle 76 135 the main purpose of this investigation was to explore the feasibility of treating pcb tail wastewater by zbfb the influence of pcb tail wastewater towards this system could be analyzed by comparing the operation performance between two kinds of wastewater for each cycle wastewater was pumped into zbfb to adsorb nh4 for 1 5 2 h the inflow rate was set at 1 8 l h then zbfb were shifted to biological desorption the aeration time was set at 3 5 h phase і and 8 h phase ii respectively to obtain an appropriate nh4 n no2 n ratio of 1 35 1 mixed with influent during this process aeration was controlled at 1 6 l min 2 4 analytical methods in order to reduce the influence of flocs and impurities on the measurement results the samples were analyzed after filtrating through syringe filter the concentrations of nitrogen species and cod were detected according to the standard analysis method 33 the temperature and dissolved oxygen do were both measured by a digital do meter hq30d hach usa and ph by a ph meter phs 3c inesa scientific instrument co ltd china the nar the nitrite production rate npr fa and free nitrous acid fna concentration was calculated by eqs 1 4 1 nar no 2 n ultimate

extraction and quantification in zbfb the biofilm samples on cycle 51 and 130 were selected for eps extraction the extraction details were provided in supplementary material proteins and polysaccharide in eps were determined by the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as a standard reference and the anthrone method with glucose as a standard respectively 2 6 high throughput sequencing analysis 2 6 1 extraction of dna from microbiological samples to investigate functional bacteria and bacterial community difference in zbfb sludge samples were collected from seed sludge and zbfb on cycle 36 sample s1 and cycle 95 sample s2 according to per protocol described 34 total genomic dna was extracted by a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen inc netherlands before formal analysis sludge samples would be stored below 20 c to inhibit the activities of microorganisms the extracted dna samples would be subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine the microbial structure of the sludge samples 2 6 2 amplicon generation and purification in order to obtain a large number of target gene fragments for subsequent gene detection pcr amplification technology was applied the specific primers were applied to amplify the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene of bacteria by raising the temperature to above 98 c dna will denature and change from double helix structure to single strand structure then 25 cycles including denaturation annealing and extension were carried out to achieve a large number of amplication of target dna after multiple cycles of amplification some low quality sequences with unqualified length base pairing errors and excessive single nucleotide repeats might be generated in the pcr amplification process in order to improve sequencing accuracy initial quality filtering was applied to remove low quality sequences and shield the interference of non specific products 2 6 3 statistical analysis fast length adjustment of short reads an efficient calculation tool was applied to read the dna data 35 the quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline and r packages was employed to process the sequencing data sequences within a 0 03 difference 97 00 similarity would be classified as the same operational taxonomic units 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption performance of zbfb reactor as shown in fig 2 the average adsorption effluent nh4 n was 7 24 mg l in phase і because of the high adsorption capacity of zeolite most nh4 from the synthetic wastewater was intercepted since few nitrite rich wastewater was left in the rector after the decanting stage the average adsorption effluent no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 21 80 and 1 64 mg l respectively when the influent was switched to pcb tail wastewater ammonium adsorption performance was obviously affected the average concentration of adsorption effluent nh4 n increased to 24 02 mg l which was mainly related to the disruption of undesired ions in pcb tail wastewater other ions could replace nh4 being adsorbed on zeolite affecting the water quality of the effluent although the adsorption performance deteriorated treating real pcb tail wastewater adsorption capacity for nh4 would not be completely deprived this might be attributed to the adsorption equilibrium that other ions would not be continuously accumulated in zeolite leaving adsorption sites for nh4 thus the concentration of adsorption effluent nh4 n stayed in a certain range rather than continuously increased as the experiment went on the average adsorption effluent no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 16 74 and 2 05 mg l respectively this result indicated that the adsorption capacity for nh4 could be partially regenerated in the subsequent biological desorption process in engineering application the frequent replacement of adsorbent and recultivation of biofilm were not needed 3 2 biological desorption performance in zbfb reactor 3 2 1 pn performance of the process fig 3a illustrated the variations of nitrogen concentration after biological desorption no2 n contributed most of the inorganic nitrogen in the wastewater with an average ultimate concentration of 126 0 mg l while average ultimate concentration of no3 n was 3 30 mg l in phase ii the influent was changed to pcb tail wastewater and the aeration time lasted for 8 h to reach similar no2 n level of phase і the average ultimate concentration of nh4 n increase to 23 7 mg l along with the increase of adsorption effluent nh4 n concentration the ultimate no2 n stayed in the range of 76 9 154 8 mg l while the ultimate no3 n was kept at a low level the average npr was 0 82 kg n m3 d significant nitrite accumulation was obtained at both phase with the average nar of 98 20 phase і and 97 61 phase ii respectively fig 3b these results indicated that pn could be successfully established and effectively maintained by zbfb reactor treating 100 mg l ammonium wastewater however the average npr decreased severely to 0 35 kg n m3 d in the treatment of pcb tail wastewater this phenomenon was mainly caused by some residual metal ions in pcb tail wastewater which probably contributed to the protein dysfunction and the loss of enzyme activity 36 in addition high salinity would alter osmotic pressure which might lead to the cells dehydration and the inhibition of aob activity 37 although metabolic activity of bacteria was challenged during the treatment of real pcb tail wastewater zbfb still showed advantages in no2 n production efficiency compared with other strategy from the above applying zbfb to achieve pn for real pcb tail wastewater was feasible convenient and effective these results laid the foundation for the further efficient and low carbon removal of nitrogen from industrial wastewater 3 2 2 comparison of typical cycles in phase і and ii the changes in nitrogen species do and ph with aeration time on the biological desorption process of cycle 69 were shown in fig 4a no2 n concentration kept in a rising trend from 7 9 to 165 1 mg l while the nh4 n concentration decreased from 21 2 to 14 1 mg l during 3 5 h aeration in this study zeolite accumulated adequate nh4 in adsorption stage so the nh4 n consumed by pn process could be replenished in time thus in fig 4c npr was almost constant at about 1 0 kg n m3 d during the whole biological desorption process which was similar to the results of previous study 24 the do concentration was maintained below 1 0 mg l in the first 3 h and increased to 2 4 mg l in the last hour aob was superior to nob in growth and enrichment when do stayed 2 5 mg l 38 which explained the reason why no3 n was barely detected in desorption ultimate wastewater when the influent was real pcb tail wastewater in phase ii nh4 n concentration slowly decreased from 21 8 to 18 4 mg l in cycle 111 fig 4b no2 n increased from 3 6 to 126 5 mg l while the no3 n slowly increased to 3 8 mg l as shown in fig 4d a high nar of 99 0 was achieved with a relatively low average npr of 0 38 kg n m3 d it was worth mentioning that zbfb was run with higher do concentration of 5 47 0 15 mg l this phenomenon was possibly owing to the drawbacks of biological metabolic activities in an extreme environment which accounted for a lower oxygen utilization rate and npr 39 it was reported that high do is a necessary condition for complete nitrification 40 however the concentration of no3 n showed that the activity of nob was at a low level this result might be attributed to the adverse effects of pcb tail wastewater on microorganisms besides nob was selectively inhibited during the operation of zbfb it was notable that a certain concentration of cod was remained in the pcb tail wastewater cod continuously decreased from 102 01 to 80 53 mg l during aeration suggesting that biodegradable organic matter could be utilized by hetertrophic bacteria simultaneous partial nitritation and denitrification spnd might occur in phase ii which would decrease the no2 n accumulating efficiency 3 3 eps characterization of sludge as metabolic products eps played an important role on forming matrix structures and mitigating the impact of the external environment 41 the excreted eps was conductive to microbial adhesion and provided stable living conditions for bacteria there were evident changes in the eps content after cycles operation for synthetic wastewater and pcb tail wastewater fig 5 the total eps decreased from 321 5 mg g vss on cycle 51 to 210 0 mg g vss on cycle 130 the corresponding protein decreased from 278 2 to 169 7 mg g vss p 0 05 while polysaccharide slightly decreased from 43 3 to 40 3 mg g vss p 0 05 several studies have reported that a certain range of salinity and heavy metal would stimulate bacteria to release eps against the adverse impact on cells 42 43 but long term heavy metal accumulation would inhibit microbial activity and reduce the production of eps 44 thus in this study less eps secretion of microorganisms in phase ii was mainly related to severely inhibited microbial activity by toxicity in pcb tail wastewater in addition higher protein content is beneficial to sludge aggregation 45 the decline of protein to polysaccharide ratio accelerated the disintegration of sludge which might lead to the deterioration of nitrifying activity 46 moreover low protein was not conductive to the eps adsorption and would reduce the nutrients and enzymes content required by microorganisms 47 these results further explained the npr decrease in the treatment of real pcb tail wastewater 3 4 microbial community diversity the microbial community structure was analyzed using high throughput sequencing technology to investigate the microbial community variations and identify potential functional bacteria in zbfb reactor in the level of genus and phylum fig 6 relative abundance of the first three phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in the seed sludge were 33 58 32 52 and 15 40 the microbial structure changed greatly after cycles operation of adsorption and biological desorption relative to the seed sludge proteobacteria relative abundances increased to 55 75 sample s1 and slightly declined to 55 62 sample s2 the significant enrichment of phylum proteobacteria was mainly responsible for the pn in zbfb 48 moreover this phylum was limitedly affected by the stress of pcb tail wastewater which manifested that proteobacteria was halophilic bacteria and maintained a stable pn performance in extreme environment 49 although bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes were not the functional bacteria during the operation they occupied a large proportion and played a role in maintaining a stable environment for aob bacteroidetes was known for the ability to metabolize secondary metabolites produced by aging sludge and thereby maintaining the stability of sludge 50 chloroflexi usually occurred in sludge in the form of floc skeletons to provide a good foundation for aob flora 51 the relative abundance of firmicutes increased from 0 55 sample s1 to 4 93 sample s2 firmicutes could produce endospores to alleviate the impact of extreme aquatic environment when the influent was changed to industrial wastewater and its enrichment was profit to biofilm systems 52 the relative abundance of bacteria involved at genus level were given in fig 6b in seed sludge four most abundant bacterial at genus level were blvii28 wastewater sludge group 7 89 phos he36 6 77 nitrosomonas 6 14 truepera 5 86 among which nitrosomonas was the dominant aob as previously reported 53 in addition the relative abundance of nitrospira known as nob was 0 75 after cycles operation nitrosomonas became the most dominant genera with relative abundance of 32 62 and 12 33 at sample s1 and sample s2 respectively these results indicate that zbfb process was beneficial to the growth and enrichment of aob which verified the feasibility for stable pn in phase ii there was detrimental effect on aob due to the existence of components in pcb tail wastewater which decreased the relative abundance of nitrosomonas the abundances of arenimonas and ferruginibacter showed the similar downward trend nitrospira was undetected by high throughput sequencing technology at both samples indicating nob was completely inhibited in this zbfb reactor it was stable and effective fa inhibition that prevented proliferation of nob and the destruction of pn it was worth mentioning that denitrifying bacteria genera thauera got significantly accumulated from 0 31 sample s1 to 10 52 sample s2 implying that it could utilize substrates and nitrite to realize bacterial enrichment this result was similar to the previous article 54 confirming the existence of biodegradable organic substances in pcb tail wastewater other genera involved in denitrification such as truepera thermomonas limnobacter pseudomonas were found which promoted the occurrence of spnd and reduced cod during biological desorption 3 5 mechanisms of pn achieved in zbfb reactor in zbfb zeolite played a dual role as adsorbent for ammonium and biofilm carrier for microbial adhesion and cultivation therefore the continuous desorption of nh4 ion and nitritation of biofilm existed during the biological desorption stage as eqs 5 and 6 55 5 adsorption and desorption z n a n h 4 z n h 4 n a 6 pn cl n h 4 3 2 o 2 cl n o 2 2 h h 2 o where z zeolite when the wastewater was pumped into zbfb nh4 ion was rapidly absorbed by zeolite to form combination z nh4 and ion exchange equilibrium between nh4 and other ions was built up aob would gradually convert nh4 n in liquid phase into no2 n through eq 6 during the aerobic biological desorption the continuous reduction of nh4 in the reactor led to the continuous destruction of adsorption equilibrium resulting in the nh4 desorption from z nh4 until aeration was over in this study when the influent was switched to pcb tail wastewater the extra cations brought about the readjustment of adsorption equilibrium and the eq 5 would proceed in opposite direction the results explained the higher nh4 concentration of both adsorption and biological desorption ultimate wastewater at phase ii it was reported that fa and fna inhibition on nob ranges 0 1 1 0 mg l and 0 011 0 070 mg l respectively 56 ma et al suggested that the inhibiting threshold values towards nob was 0 08 0 82 mg l 57 during biological desorption fa continuously decreased with the consumption of nh4 n and alkalinity fig 4 it could be calculated that the average ultimate fa was 1 36 and 0 96 mg l at phase і and ii respectively the absorbed nh4 in zeolite kept fa higher than 0 10 mg l during the whole biological desorption stage in both phase which ensured the inhibition towards nob and kept stable nitrite accumulation moreover with the increase of no2 n fna gradually increased to over 0 011 mg l after 3 h in phase і and 6 h in phase ii respectively thus fna might be beneficial to nob inhibition at a certain period of biological desorption in the literature the oxygen saturation constant ko nob is higher than ko aob at low do 58 based on this pn was successfully started up based on low do strategy in many studies although the do concentration remained low at phase і it increased to high level of approximately 5 47 mg l at phase ii with significant nitrite accumulation also obtained this indicated that low do might not be the main factor for successful pn in this research it was reported that a certain concentration of salinity could selectively inhibit nob activity liu et al reported that nob could be selectively inhibited with the addition of 10 0 g l nacl 59 nevertheless real pcb tail wastewater contains complicated components including na cu mg k and many other ions which constitute the salinity of this wastewater there is no evidence yet that salinity under this condition is a factor to enhance pn above all it could be concluded that appropriate fa inhibition for nob instead of aob was the main factor to achieve significant pn in zbfb 3 6 potential application and issue to be addressed the zbfb applied in this study was firstly reported for achieving stable pn of pcb tail wastewater with 100 mg l ammonium as typical industrial wastewater pcb tail wastewater contains complex components which cause certain adverse impact on the operation of zbfb process despite the competitive adsorption and inhibition of bioactivity nitrite production by zbfb process was stable and efficient in the treatment of wastewater with nh4 n concentration below 100 mg l it would be difficult to achieve pn without control since nob could easily become the dominant bacteria several strategies were reported for the start up of nitrite accumulation but little literature focuses on the treatment of real industrial wastewater table 1 compared with other methods there is advantage in nitrite producing efficiency during by zbfb process with a relatively higher npr this meant a higher wastewater treatment capacity in practical applications applying zbfb to achieve stable nitrite accumulation is more convenient and economical strategy since extra reagent addition precise operational control or a long time start up were unneeded thus zbfb process is potential for extension to other industrial wastewater or domestic sewage treatment however there are some noteworthy disadvantages in engineering application of zbfb firstly regular backwash may be necessary to ensure sufficient aeration which will cause inconvenience in operation in order to carry enough zeolite for production the size of the reactor will be large which will undoubtedly increase the cost of construction besides this study was done with single industrial wastewater at lab scale experiment every factory is different as well as its wastewater constituents and it remains unclear what will happen in zbfb treating other industrial wastewater thus the treatment of other real wastewater is of significance in the following research which is helpful to verify universal applicability of zbfb theoretically zbfb can achieve better performance treating industrial wastewater with less impurities in both the adsorption stage or biological desorption stage on the other hand although better than many other pn strategies an average npr of 0 35 kg n m3 d obtained in biological desorption stage was not enough which limited wastewater treatment capacity how to further improve nitrite production efficiency is a difficulty that needs to be overcome in the application of zbfb in addition the realization of pn in zbfb is to provide nitrite for anammox process and finally achieve nitrogen removal in a carbon low method it was reported that anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria are sensitive to several environmental factors such as organic matter ph and metal ion 67 68 therefore the nitrogen removal capacity of pn a process based on zbfb reactor in the treatment of industrial wastewater should be investigated 4 conclusion in order to expand the application of pn a process in industrial wastewater stable nitrification of pcb tail wastewater with about 100 mg l was successfully achieved by zbfb reactor a significant nar of 97 61 and an average npr 0 35 kg n m3 d were acquired although bioactivity was partial inhibited by the industrial wastewater zbfb process showed advantage in nitrite accumulating efficiency fa inhibition based on nh4 adsorption equilibrium might be the main factor for stable pn during biological desorption stage the nitrosomonas as aob turned into the dominant nitrifiers in zbfb with the relative abundance of 12 33 the sustainably generated nitrite provides the foundation for the subsequent nitrogen removal

12509,at present low carbon treatment of printed circuit board pcb tail wastewater by anammox process had not been reported stably produced nitrite instead of nitrate was the key to anammox process in this study a zeolite biological fixed bed zbfb reactor was started up to investigate the partial nitritation pn performance for the treatment of synthetic wastewater and pcb tail wastewater with ammonium concentration of 100 and 105 mg l respectively zbfb presented stable nitrite accumulation rate nar of 98 20 and 97 61 during the biological desorption stage respectively the pn mechanism was proven as the free ammonia fa inhibition which was maintained by the continuous desorption of ammonium from zeolite although pcb tail wastewater showed strong inhibition on bioactivity stable and efficient nitrite accumulation was obtained the average nitrite producing rate npr was 0 816 and 0 352 kg n m3 d separately the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps decreased high throughput sequencing analysis results further presented the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas in zbfb the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria thauera indicated the occurrence of simultaneous partial nitritation and denitrification spnd these results meant a novel and reliable pn method by zbfb for real wastewater was feasible which further promoted the development of energy saving anammox process in industrial wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pcb tail wastewater zeolite free ammonia nitrite accumulation ammonia oxidizing bacteria data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction printed circuit board pcb is the basic component of electronic products providing mechanical support and interconnection for other electronic components on the circuit board 1 in recent year the continuous expansion of electronic industry has also driven the rapid development of pcb industry pcb manufacturing is a long and complicated process which generates a large amount of wastewater such as pickling electroplating and etching process the annual output of pcb tail wastewater is 2 million m3 in china 2 this wastewater treatment must be carried out to avoid adverse impact on the environment the complex components such as heavy metals organic matter nitrogen additives and surfactants in pcb tail wastewater originate from different processes 3 4 nh4 n mainly produced in the etching section contributes most of the total nitrogen tn in pcb tail wastewater after removing most of the heavy metal ions by the lime and sodium sulfide precipitation process organic substances and nh4 n still remain in the tail wastewater traditional physico chemical methods could not efficiently remove tn and the cost of chemicals are prohibitively expensive in contrast biological method might be an appropriate way to remove tn from this wastewater for its low cost and excellent performance conventional nitrification denitrification has been the common biological method for nitrogen removal off industrial wastewater it has been reported that high efficiency was achieved by this process treating pcb tail wastewater optoelectronic wastewater and electroplating tail wastewater 5 7 however the lower reaction rate means that larger reactor size was required to meet the emission standard 8 in addition the consumption of extra carbon sources and aeration would increase the operational cost which is contrary to the interests of enterprises and low carbon development at present biological nitrogen removal via nitritation has received the widespread attention deriving from its economical and energy saving features 9 10 compared with nitrification denitrification nitritation denitrification could reduce 40 cod and save 25 oxygen consumption 11 partial nitritation and anammox pn a can eliminate external carbon resource requirements and reduce 60 of energy costs 12 pn a has achieved high efficiency and low cost nitrogen removal in the treatment of landfill leachate textile and digesting wastewater containing high strength ammonium 13 15 however it is faltering in realizing stable partial nitritation pn for wastewater with nh4 n concentration below 100 mg l which are the tough obstacles for the development and application of pn a process for industrial wastewater several common strategies for stable pn have been reported such as high temperature 16 inhibition of high free ammonia fa or free nitrous acid fna 17 18 low dissolved oxygen do 19 and intermittent aeration 20 however energy consumption would be huge to heat wastewater in practical operation and increase the burden on enterprises for low do strategy the ammonium removal rate would be low which could not meet the process requirements 21 intermittent aeration might have adverse impact on aob due to the frequent changes between different do conditions 22 these strategies might not be suitable for treating industrial wastewater containing various components in recent year zeolite has attracted the attention of researchers on account of its application in nitrogen removal as an inclusion compound of hydrated aluminosilicate mineral zeolite has a large adsorption capacity for ammonium and could provide growing sites for microorganisms thus the cycles operation of ammonium adsorbed by zeolite and then converted by nitrifying bacteria might be suitable for such wastewater treatment during the adsorption step high standard effluent could be obtained because most of the ammonium is conserved in zeolite then ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob on the biofilm could transfer ammonium into nitrite during biological desorption thus zeolite could be regenerated during this step as the adsorbed ammonium were released to supplement the transferred part in the liquid phase because of ammonium adsorption equilibrium an appropriate free ammonia fa might be maintained to selectively inhibit the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and stable pn could be achieved 23 previous research has shown that a novel zeolite biological fixed bed zbfb could realize stable pn for low strength ammonium synthetic wastewater with addition of nahco3 as alkalinity 24 but whether zbfb reactor could realize stable nitrite accumulation for real pcb tail wastewater remains unclear various kinds of components remained in the pcb tail wastewater might lead to undesired competitive adsorption since zeolite is also adsorbent of different pollutants 25 26 the adsorption sites of zeolite might be completely occupied by other ions it is uncertain whether the adsorption capacity of zeolite can be recovered in biological desorption stage and nh4 ion in pcb tail wastewater can be retained in the next adsorption stage nevertheless it was reported that aob showed a tolerance capacity towards the negative factors 27 28 thus despite the inhibition of high concentration of salinity and organic pollutants in pcb tail wastewater 29 31 achieving stable pn under extreme environment of real pcb tail wastewater is possible at present most of the research on pn was aimed at wastewater with low toxicity and there is scarcely any relevant article focusing on realizing stable pn for real industrial wastewater if this hypothesis is feasible the carbon low nitrogen removal process via the nitrite pathway might expand its engineering applicability in this study a laboratory scale zbfb reactor was started up by synthetic wastewater with approximately 100 mg l ammonium and then applied for real pcb tail wastewater with similar ammonium concentration the main purpose of this experiment was to 1 explore whether zbfb process could achieve stable pn for pcb tail wastewater 2 investigate the impacts of pcb wastewater towards eps production and components to explain the variations of bioactivities 3 analyze the evolution and differences of microbial communities using high throughput sequencing analysis to further discussed the mechanism for stable pn this study is helpful to promote the practical application of zbfb and provide technical suggestions for realizing low cost nitrogen removal process of industrial wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental reactor setup zbfb reactor was a cylindrical column with an inner diameter of 6 5 cm and a height of 80 0 cm fig 1 it was made of polymethyl methacrylate and filled with packing natural zeolite v 0 85 l mean particle size 0 5 mm adsorption capacity 3 0 mg nh4 n g in the adsorption stage wastewater would pass through the zeolite from the bottom of zbfb and nh4 ion was adsorbed in the zeolite in the desorption step an air compressor provided aeration from the bottom of zbfb aeration rate was controlled with a rotor meter the adsorption was conducted without temperature control while the biological desorption operational temperature was maintained in the range of 25 0 29 0 c by the heating equipment 2 2 wastewater and seed sludge the synthetic wastewater with a concentration of approximately 100 mg l nh4 n was prepared by adding nh4cl in proportion to tap water pcb tail wastewater was collected from guangdong xindayu environmental technology co ltd guangdong china and the specific characteristics of the wastewater were as follows cod 81 8 222 mg l nh4 n 84 1 125 7 mg l no2 n 0 3 mg l no3 n 0 8 mg l electrical conductivity 5 19 6 14 ms cm some elements of pcb wastewater and their concentrations were listed in table s1 adding nahco3 was to adjust influent ph ranging from 8 02 to 8 32 other necessary elements were supplied according to the literature 32 the seed sludge was taken from the discharged sludge of a nitritation reactor in our laboratory the reactor was utilized to treat synthetic wastewater with high strength ammonium and achieved an average nitrite accumulation ratio of 91 2 2 3 the startup and operation of zbfb approximately 10 l of 100 mg l nh4 n synthetic wastewater was pumped into zbfb for zeolite adsorption followed by the addition of seed sludge nahco3 and other necessary elements aeration was provided to the bottom of zbfb and the aeration rate was controlled at a low level of 0 4 l min when nitrite accumulation ratio nar exceeded 80 the startup of nitritation system was completed liquid in the reactor was discharged and the zeolite was backwashed with tap water after that zbfb was conducted by cycles operation the overall operation was divided into two phases treating synthetic wastewater at phase і cycle 1 75 and subsequent pcb tail wastewater at phase ii cycle 76 135 the main purpose of this investigation was to explore the feasibility of treating pcb tail wastewater by zbfb the influence of pcb tail wastewater towards this system could be analyzed by comparing the operation performance between two kinds of wastewater for each cycle wastewater was pumped into zbfb to adsorb nh4 for 1 5 2 h the inflow rate was set at 1 8 l h then zbfb were shifted to biological desorption the aeration time was set at 3 5 h phase і and 8 h phase ii respectively to obtain an appropriate nh4 n no2 n ratio of 1 35 1 mixed with influent during this process aeration was controlled at 1 6 l min 2 4 analytical methods in order to reduce the influence of flocs and impurities on the measurement results the samples were analyzed after filtrating through syringe filter the concentrations of nitrogen species and cod were detected according to the standard analysis method 33 the temperature and dissolved oxygen do were both measured by a digital do meter hq30d hach usa

extraction and quantification in zbfb the biofilm samples on cycle 51 and 130 were selected for eps extraction the extraction details were provided in supplementary material proteins and polysaccharide in eps were determined by the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as a standard reference and the anthrone method with glucose as a standard respectively 2 6 high throughput sequencing analysis 2 6 1 extraction of dna from microbiological samples to investigate functional bacteria and bacterial community difference in zbfb sludge samples were collected from seed sludge and zbfb on cycle 36 sample s1 and cycle 95 sample s2 according to per protocol described 34 total genomic dna was extracted by a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen inc netherlands before formal analysis sludge samples would be stored below 20 c to inhibit the activities of microorganisms the extracted dna samples would be subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine the microbial structure of the sludge samples 2 6 2 amplicon generation and purification in order to obtain a large number of target gene fragments for subsequent gene detection pcr amplification technology was applied the specific primers were applied to amplify the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene of bacteria by raising the temperature to above 98 c dna will denature and change from double helix structure to single strand structure then 25 cycles including denaturation annealing and extension were carried out to achieve a large number of amplication of target dna after multiple cycles of amplification some low quality sequences with unqualified length base pairing errors and excessive single nucleotide repeats might be generated in the pcr amplification process in order to improve sequencing accuracy initial quality filtering was applied to remove low quality sequences and shield the interference of non specific products 2 6 3 statistical analysis fast length adjustment of short reads an efficient calculation tool was applied to read the dna data 35 the quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline and r packages was employed to process the sequencing data sequences within a 0 03 difference 97 00 similarity would be classified as the same operational taxonomic units 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption performance of zbfb reactor as shown in fig 2 the average adsorption effluent nh4 n was 7 24 mg l in phase і because of the high adsorption capacity of zeolite most nh4 from the synthetic wastewater was intercepted since few nitrite rich wastewater was left in the rector after the decanting stage the average adsorption effluent no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 21 80 and 1 64 mg l respectively when the influent was switched to pcb tail wastewater ammonium adsorption performance was obviously affected the average concentration of adsorption effluent nh4 n increased to 24 02 mg l which was mainly related to the disruption of undesired ions in pcb tail wastewater other ions could replace nh4 being adsorbed on zeolite affecting the water quality of the effluent although the adsorption performance deteriorated treating real pcb tail wastewater adsorption capacity for nh4 would not be completely deprived this might be attributed to the adsorption equilibrium that other ions would not be continuously accumulated in zeolite leaving adsorption sites for nh4 thus the concentration of adsorption effluent nh4 n stayed in a certain range rather than continuously increased as the experiment went on the average adsorption effluent no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 16 74 and 2 05 mg l respectively this result indicated that the adsorption capacity for nh4 could be partially regenerated in the subsequent biological desorption process in engineering application the frequent replacement of adsorbent and recultivation of biofilm were not needed 3 2 biological desorption performance in zbfb reactor 3 2 1 pn performance of the process fig 3a illustrated the variations of nitrogen concentration after biological desorption no2 n contributed most of the inorganic nitrogen in the wastewater with an average ultimate concentration of 126 0 mg l while average ultimate concentration of no3 n was 3 30 mg l in phase ii the influent was changed to pcb tail wastewater and the aeration time lasted for 8 h to reach similar no2 n level of phase і the average ultimate concentration of nh4 n increase to 23 7 mg l along with the increase of adsorption effluent nh4 n concentration the ultimate no2 n stayed in the range of 76 9 154 8 mg l while the ultimate no3 n was kept at a low level the average npr was 0 82 kg n m3 d significant nitrite accumulation was obtained at both phase with the average nar of 98 20 phase і and 97 61 phase ii respectively fig 3b these results indicated that pn could be successfully established and effectively maintained by zbfb reactor treating 100 mg l ammonium wastewater however the average npr decreased severely to 0 35 kg n m3 d in the treatment of pcb tail wastewater this phenomenon was mainly caused by some residual metal ions in pcb tail wastewater which probably contributed to the protein dysfunction and the loss of enzyme activity 36 in addition high salinity would alter osmotic pressure which might lead to the cells dehydration and the inhibition of aob activity 37 although metabolic activity of bacteria was challenged during the treatment of real pcb tail wastewater zbfb still showed advantages in no2 n production efficiency compared with other strategy from the above applying zbfb to achieve pn for real pcb tail wastewater was feasible convenient and effective these results laid the foundation for the further efficient and low carbon removal of nitrogen from industrial wastewater 3 2 2 comparison of typical cycles in phase і and ii the changes in nitrogen species do and ph with aeration time on the biological desorption process of cycle 69 were shown in fig 4a no2 n concentration kept in a rising trend from 7 9 to 165 1 mg l while the nh4 n concentration decreased from 21 2 to 14 1 mg l during 3 5 h aeration in this study zeolite accumulated adequate nh4 in adsorption stage so the nh4 n consumed by pn process could be replenished in time thus in fig 4c npr was almost constant at about 1 0 kg n m3 d during the whole biological desorption process which was similar to the results of previous study 24 the do concentration was maintained below 1 0 mg l in the first 3 h and increased to 2 4 mg l in the last hour aob was superior to nob in growth and enrichment when do stayed 2 5 mg l 38 which explained the reason why no3 n was barely detected in desorption ultimate wastewater when the influent was real pcb tail wastewater in phase ii nh4 n concentration slowly decreased from 21 8 to 18 4 mg l in cycle 111 fig 4b no2 n increased from 3 6 to 126 5 mg l while the no3 n slowly increased to 3 8 mg l as shown in fig 4d a high nar of 99 0 was achieved with a relatively low average npr of 0 38 kg n m3 d it was worth mentioning that zbfb was run with higher do concentration of 5 47 0 15 mg l this phenomenon was possibly owing to the drawbacks of biological metabolic activities in an extreme environment which accounted for a lower oxygen utilization rate and npr 39 it was reported that high do is a necessary condition for complete nitrification 40 however the concentration of no3 n showed that the activity of nob was at a low level this result might be attributed to the adverse effects of pcb tail wastewater on microorganisms besides nob was selectively inhibited during the operation of zbfb it was notable that a certain concentration of cod was remained in the pcb tail wastewater cod continuously decreased from 102 01 to 80 53 mg l during aeration suggesting that biodegradable organic matter could be utilized by hetertrophic bacteria simultaneous partial nitritation and denitrification spnd might occur in phase ii which would decrease the no2 n accumulating efficiency 3 3 eps characterization of sludge as metabolic products eps played an important role on forming matrix structures and mitigating the impact of the external environment 41 the excreted eps was conductive to microbial adhesion and provided stable living conditions for bacteria there were evident changes in the eps content after cycles operation for synthetic wastewater and pcb tail wastewater fig 5 the total eps decreased from 321 5 mg g vss on cycle 51 to 210 0 mg g vss on cycle 130 the corresponding protein decreased from 278 2 to 169 7 mg g vss p 0 05 while polysaccharide slightly decreased from 43 3 to 40 3 mg g vss p 0 05 several studies have reported that a certain range of salinity and heavy metal would stimulate bacteria to release eps against the adverse impact on cells 42 43 but long term heavy metal accumulation would inhibit microbial activity and reduce the production of eps 44 thus in this study less eps secretion of microorganisms in phase ii was mainly related to severely inhibited microbial activity by toxicity in pcb tail wastewater in addition higher protein content is beneficial to sludge aggregation 45 the decline of protein to polysaccharide ratio accelerated the disintegration of sludge which might lead to the deterioration of nitrifying activity 46 moreover low protein was not conductive to the eps adsorption and would reduce the nutrients and enzymes content required by microorganisms 47 these results further explained the npr decrease in the treatment of real pcb tail wastewater 3 4 microbial community diversity the microbial community structure was analyzed using high throughput sequencing technology to investigate the microbial community variations and identify potential functional bacteria in zbfb reactor in the level of genus and phylum fig 6 relative abundance of the first three phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in the seed sludge were 33 58 32 52 and 15 40 the microbial structure changed greatly after cycles operation of adsorption and biological desorption relative to the seed sludge proteobacteria relative abundances increased to 55 75 sample s1 and slightly declined to 55 62 sample s2 the significant enrichment of phylum proteobacteria was mainly responsible for the pn in zbfb 48 moreover this phylum was limitedly affected by the stress of pcb tail wastewater which manifested that proteobacteria was halophilic bacteria and maintained a stable pn performance in extreme environment 49 although bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes were not the functional bacteria during the operation they occupied a large proportion and played a role in maintaining a stable environment for aob bacteroidetes was known for the ability to metabolize secondary metabolites produced by aging sludge and thereby maintaining the stability of sludge 50 chloroflexi usually occurred in sludge in the form of floc skeletons to provide a good foundation for aob flora 51 the relative abundance of firmicutes increased from 0 55 sample s1 to 4 93 sample s2 firmicutes could produce endospores to alleviate the impact of extreme aquatic environment when the influent was changed to industrial wastewater and its enrichment was profit to biofilm systems 52 the relative abundance of bacteria involved at genus level were given in fig 6b in seed sludge four most abundant bacterial at genus level were blvii28 wastewater sludge group 7 89 phos he36 6 77 nitrosomonas 6 14 truepera 5 86 among which nitrosomonas was the dominant aob as previously reported 53 in addition the relative abundance of nitrospira known as nob was 0 75 after cycles operation nitrosomonas became the most dominant genera with relative abundance of 32 62 and 12 33 at sample s1 and sample s2 respectively these results indicate that zbfb process was beneficial to the growth and enrichment of aob which verified the feasibility for stable pn in phase ii there was detrimental effect on aob due to the existence of components in pcb tail wastewater which decreased the relative abundance of nitrosomonas the abundances of arenimonas and ferruginibacter showed the similar downward trend nitrospira was undetected by high throughput sequencing technology at both samples indicating nob was completely inhibited in this zbfb reactor it was stable and effective fa inhibition that prevented proliferation of nob and the destruction of pn it was worth mentioning that denitrifying bacteria genera thauera got significantly accumulated from 0 31 sample s1 to 10 52 sample s2 implying that it could utilize substrates and nitrite to realize bacterial enrichment this result was similar to the previous article 54 confirming the existence of biodegradable organic substances in pcb tail wastewater other genera involved in denitrification such as truepera thermomonas limnobacter pseudomonas were found which promoted the occurrence of spnd and reduced cod during biological desorption 3 5 mechanisms of pn achieved in zbfb reactor in zbfb zeolite played a dual role as adsorbent for ammonium and biofilm carrier for microbial adhesion and cultivation therefore the continuous desorption of nh4 ion and nitritation of biofilm existed during the biological desorption stage as eqs 5 and 6 55 5 adsorption and desorption z n a n h 4 z n h 4 n a 6 pn cl n h 4 3 2 o 2 cl n o 2 2 h h 2 o where z zeolite when the wastewater was pumped into zbfb nh4 ion was rapidly absorbed by zeolite to form combination z nh4 and ion exchange equilibrium between nh4 and other ions was built up aob would gradually convert nh4 n in liquid phase into no2 n through eq 6 during the aerobic biological desorption the continuous reduction of nh4 in the reactor led to the continuous destruction of adsorption equilibrium resulting in the nh4 desorption from z nh4 until aeration was over in this study when the influent was switched to pcb tail wastewater the extra cations brought about the readjustment of adsorption equilibrium and the eq 5 would proceed in opposite direction the results explained the higher nh4 concentration of both adsorption and biological desorption ultimate wastewater at phase ii it was reported that fa and fna inhibition on nob ranges 0 1 1 0 mg l and 0 011 0 070 mg l respectively 56 ma et al suggested that the inhibiting threshold values towards nob was 0 08 0 82 mg l 57 during biological desorption fa continuously decreased with the consumption of nh4 n and alkalinity fig 4 it could be calculated that the average ultimate fa was 1 36 and 0 96 mg l at phase і and ii respectively the absorbed nh4 in zeolite kept fa higher than 0 10 mg l during the whole biological desorption stage in both phase which ensured the inhibition towards nob and kept stable nitrite accumulation moreover with the increase of no2 n fna gradually increased to over 0 011 mg l after 3 h in phase і and 6 h in phase ii respectively thus fna might be beneficial to nob inhibition at a certain period of biological desorption in the literature the oxygen saturation constant ko nob is higher than ko aob at low do 58 based on this pn was successfully started up based on low do strategy in many studies although the do concentration remained low at phase і it increased to high level of approximately 5 47 mg l at phase ii with significant nitrite accumulation also obtained this indicated that low do might not be the main factor for successful pn in this research it was reported that a certain concentration of salinity could selectively inhibit nob activity liu et al reported that nob could be selectively inhibited with the addition of 10 0 g l nacl 59 nevertheless real pcb tail wastewater contains complicated components including na cu mg k and many other ions which constitute the salinity of this wastewater there is no evidence yet that salinity under this condition is a factor to enhance pn above all it could be concluded that appropriate fa inhibition for nob instead of aob was the main factor to achieve significant pn in zbfb 3 6 potential application and issue to be addressed the zbfb applied in this study was firstly reported for achieving stable pn of pcb tail wastewater with 100 mg l ammonium as typical industrial wastewater pcb tail wastewater contains complex components which cause certain adverse impact on the operation of zbfb process despite the competitive adsorption and inhibition of bioactivity nitrite production by zbfb process was stable and efficient in the treatment of wastewater with nh4 n concentration below 100 mg l it would be difficult to achieve pn without control since nob could easily become the dominant bacteria several strategies were reported for the start up of nitrite accumulation but little literature focuses on the treatment of real industrial wastewater table 1 compared with other methods there is advantage in nitrite producing efficiency during by zbfb process with a relatively higher npr this meant a higher wastewater treatment capacity in practical applications applying zbfb to achieve stable nitrite accumulation is more convenient and economical strategy since extra reagent addition precise operational control or a long time start up were unneeded thus zbfb process is potential for extension to other industrial wastewater or domestic sewage treatment however there are some noteworthy disadvantages in engineering application of zbfb firstly regular backwash may be necessary to ensure sufficient aeration which will cause inconvenience in operation in order to carry enough zeolite for production the size of the reactor will be large which will undoubtedly increase the cost of construction besides this study was done with single industrial wastewater at lab scale experiment every factory is different as well as its wastewater constituents and it remains unclear what will happen in zbfb treating other industrial wastewater thus the treatment of other real wastewater is of significance in the following research which is helpful to verify universal applicability of zbfb theoretically zbfb can achieve better performance treating industrial wastewater with less impurities in both the adsorption stage or biological desorption stage on the other hand although better than many other pn strategies an average npr of 0 35 kg n m3 d obtained in biological desorption stage was not enough which limited wastewater treatment capacity how to further improve nitrite production efficiency is a difficulty that needs to be overcome in the application of zbfb in addition the realization of pn in zbfb is to provide nitrite for anammox process and finally achieve nitrogen removal in a carbon low method it was reported that anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria are sensitive to several environmental factors such as organic matter ph and metal ion 67 68 therefore the nitrogen removal capacity of pn a process based on zbfb reactor in the treatment of industrial wastewater should be investigated 4 conclusion in order to expand the application of pn a process in industrial wastewater stable nitrification of pcb tail wastewater with about 100 mg l was successfully achieved by zbfb reactor a significant nar of 97 61 and an average npr 0 35 kg n m3 d were acquired although bioactivity was partial inhibited by the industrial wastewater zbfb process showed advantage in nitrite accumulating efficiency fa inhibition based on nh4 adsorption equilibrium might be the main factor for stable pn during biological desorption stage the nitrosomonas as aob turned into the dominant nitrifiers in zbfb with the relative abundance of 12 33 the sustainably generated nitrite provides the foundation for the subsequent nitrogen removal of anammox process zbfb process is potential in the practical application of pn a declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
