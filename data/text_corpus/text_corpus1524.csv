7620,study region oueme basin threatened by climate change and upstream energy projects is limited by the quality of the adapted meteorological data through the assessment of their impacts with some models study focus this study focuses on the parflow clm model and describes its ability to simulate the water balances with good observation data and bad observation transformed and reanalysis corrected and uncorrected data meteorological forcing new hydrological insights for the region the model correctly simulates all the terms of water balance mainly evaporation and water table depth wtd with kge always higher than 0 70 it is less sensitive to temperature shortwave sw and longwave lw forcing with those three variables parflow clm simulates none significative difference in water balance terms using the reanalysis forcings on which we note an overestimation of temperature and an underestimation of lw the same results are obtained with the other so called bad meteorological forcings on the other hand the precipitation of the latter significantly influences the water balance the annual water balance and especially evapotranspiration shows 683 70 mm for observations versus 753 63 mm and 662 44 mm for era5 and merra2 respectively the corrections applied on these variables seem to work better on merra2 734 mm or 51 mm difference with observations compared to era5 760 mm or 77 mm difference with observations the temperate sw lw variables of the reanalyses can be used for hydrological simulations with parflow clm and probably with other physics based models over the

available water resources on a watershed scale many different hydrological models used in previous studies aimed at solving short or long term problems within a basin in west africa many of such studies are usually based on global models for several reasons including the unsatisfactory quality of observation data and their irregular distribution in time and space dembélé et al 2020 this is the case for the sudanian zone of benin within this zone lies the oueme basin the largest basin in benin the basin has seen an increase in the number of studies evaluating the rainfall flow relationship using rural engineering models in recent years kodja et al 2018 nounangnonhou et al 2018 and other global models such as hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv hydrologic modeling system hec hms hydrological model based on the least action principle hymolap biao 2017 houngue 2020 the region is characterized by complex hydrological processes which limits the use of majority of these models giertz et al 2010 first they are limited to the study of surface water resources and do not account for the entire hydrological cycle this does not help to robustly identify the causes of the poor estimation of flows consequently it is difficult to formulate tangible recommendations to decision makers in this region second the parameters used in these models are generally adjusted to a given period and do not always account for the present day realities of the environment moreover these parameters evolve due to anthropogenic factors which modifies surface conditions and hydrodynamic characteristics of the soil they can also evolve due to climatic factors causing the decrease of water masses and the lowering of the water table these changes are often not accounted for in the models negatively affecting the quality of simulations over their validation periods and or other periods biao et al 2016 in addition the oueme basin crosses all three of benin s climatic zones namely the sub equatorial zone which has two rainy seasons the sudano guinean zone and the sudanian zone which has only one rainy season bodjrènou et al 2021 the use of a global model in this basin is therefore a poor option because of this climatic diversity to which is added the strong variation in vegetation cover depending on whether one is in the north or south of the basin bodjrènou et al 2023 for these reasons recent research on the functioning of the oueme basin hydrosystem advocates the use of physically based models these include the study of hector et al 2018 who proposed to use the parflow model which is a critical zone model based on richard s equation for 3d saturated and unsaturated subsurface transfers and the kinematic wave equation for surface flow it is coupled to community land model clm which is a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model to calculate the energy balance and evapotranspiration fluxes kollet and maxwell 2005 2008 hector et al 2018 highlighted the strong ability of the model to simulate water and energy fluxes and soil water stock streamflow evapotranspiration soil moisture wtd and water storage in the sudanian zone the study used data from the analyse multidisciplinaire de la mousson africaine couplage de l atmosphère tropicale et du cycle hydrologique amma catch observatory both for model inputs and for the evaluation of its outputs two constraints limit the evaluation of the hydrological behavior of the entire oueme basin in this study firstly it did not show long term changes in water balance fluxes one of the main reasons is that qualified data for these high temporal resolution hydrological simulations in this basin are only available in the early 2000 s the second constraint is that the amma catch observation which is the best monitored network in benin is limited to the northern part of the basin galle et al 2018 an alternative for the use of this and other distributed models is to resort to reanalyses which also have their shortcomings in describing the climate of this environment dembélé et al 2020 grenier et al 2020 bodjrènou et al 2021 bodjrènou et al 2021 after a comparative study of two high temporal resolution reanalyses identified era5 compared to merra2 as the most suitable to describe the climate of this environment however we do not know if it is this reanalysis that allows us to make better simulations on the benin basins also we do not know if the correction of the variables that they present are essential to optimize the simulations of the terms of the water balance on this basin moreover it is difficult to systematically identify that all the variables of merra2 the least good reanalysis are bad in terms of simulation of the water balance at the end of their study bodjrènou et al 2021 recommend the use of bias correction to improve on the shortcomings of the reanalysis in the representation of the region s climate but they do not mention their advantages or disadvantages over the simulations ardoin bardin et al 2006 and dembélé et al 2020 showed the presence of holes in the time series has a knock on effect on the perfect evaluation of ground based reanalysis satellite products additionally danso et al 2019 showed that dust carried by strong winds settles on sensors and measuring instruments in the west african region affects the quality of soil data therefore the importance of data correction must be further explored and techniques appropriate to this region must be well thought out according to dembélé et al 2020 studies comparing reanalyses and satellite data with a model should advocate the use of a hydrological model whose sensitivity to forcings is known to draw consistent conclusions in this case it is essential to ensure that parflow clm is capable of simulating water fluxes in oueme basin and to know its sensitivity to different forcings before using it early sensitivity studies of the parflow model by herzog et al 2021 were based on soil hydrodynamic parameters currently it is unclear how to detect the impact of model forcings with biased and unbiased meteorological variables on the other hand the prioritized list of variables is not yet sufficiently clarified over the region and especially with this model it is therefore unclear which variables to focus on for bias correction koutsouris et al 2017 given the above this study proposes to a light on shortcoming of the reanalyses era5 and merra2 by relying on their precipitation temperature short wave radiation sw and long wave radiation lw variable b evaluate the sensitivity of parflow clm with a good and bad meteorological forcing c investigate the importance of applying some bias correction techniques to the reanalysis input data on the output of the parflow clm model this paper is organized as following section 2 describes the methodology of the study section 3 describes the results obtained according to the specific objectives namely the reanalyses performances in describing the climate of the region the performance and sensitivity of the models the comparison of the reanalyses and the effect of the bias corrections section 4 presents the well documented discussion of the results before the conclusion summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 study area and watershed typology 2 1 1 study area benin is a small west african country bordered by the atlantic ocean to the south nigeria to the east togo to the west and burkina faso and niger to the north fig 1 the oueme basin is located in the interior of this country it has climatic and topographical characteristics that vary greatly with latitude bodjrènou et al 2021 amou et al 2022 climatically the oueme basin shares the country s three climatic zones namely the two rainy seasons in the south one rainy season in the north and the transition region considered between 7 and 9 latitude which are determined by the west african rainfall database bodjrènou et al 2021 with this diversity it is not appropriate to consider the use of global hydrological models in the basin 2 1 2 watershed typology the study was carried out on a typical watershed at the nalohou site which is an uncultivated area of the amma catch observatory oueme upper in situ observations and documented reports of the hydro geomorphological characteristics such as vegetation slope friction coefficient porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil layer profile are used information obtained from interviews conducted with resource persons were also used to reduce the computation time the basin is represented in a 2d slope of 50 pixels of 100 m x 100 m corresponding to 50 km in longitudinal dimension and 24 m depth the hydrodynamic characteristics considered in this study are homogeneous along each longitudinal layer before simulating the water balance terms with the parflow clm model kollet and maxwell 2005 2008 the consistency of the introduced values was analyzed with the van genuchten 1980 curves fig 2 2 2 hydrometeorological datasets the hydrometeorological dataset includes the forcings that are used as inputs to the parflow clm model it also includes the in situ measurements that are used to evaluate the outputs of the model the forcing data are prescribed with observations data with and without transformation comes from a point station on amma catch observatory and the merra2 and era5 reanalyses with and without bias corrections selected on their grid closer to the observational station era5 come from the european center for medium range weather forecasts hersbach et al 2020 implemented by the copernicus climate change service and merra2 from national aeronautics and space administration gelaro et al 2017 all those data are at hourly time step except for the wtd data measured in situ which are at daily time step all the other meteorological data necessary to simulate water balance with parflow clm model wind speed pressure specific humidity come from the amma catch observatory in addition in situ measurements are needed to evaluate the model s outputs these are streamflow evapotranspiration and wtd the streamflow measurements come from an ara pont hydrometric station located at 1 6639 e and 9 7622 n the evapotranspiration measurements are taken from a 2 m flux tower located in the nalohou watershed 2 6125 e and 9 7448 e for the assessment of the wtd we use measurements from a piezometric station located at a depth of 20 m at an altitude of 452 792 m and located 190 m from the river recall that only the variables precipitation temperature lw and sw are used in this study their use depends on the objective pursued see details in appendix to evaluate the performance of the model we use in situ measurements of the four variables for the study of the model sensitivity we transformed the in situ data based on the shortcomings of the reanalyses bodjrènou et al 2021 the transformations consist of increasing sw by 20w m2 and precipitation by 25 noted prec1 the model sensitivity is also investigated with temperature decreased by 2 c lw by 10w m2 and precipitation by 25 noted prec2 the comparison of the reanalyses is performed using the four variables simultaneously and selecting them individually the effect of the bias corrections was also investigated for all the variables of reanalyses corrected with techniques described in section 2 4 2 3 conceptualization of the study fig 3 conceptualizes the different simulations performed to achieve the objectives the first simulation used in situ measurements as inputs this provides a basis to evaluate the capacity of the model to simulate the different terms of the water balance the model s sensitivity is also assessed using the same data which have undergone transformations the second set of simulations used either era5 or merra2 as inputs both reanalyse products are first used as forcings in individual simulations they are then bias corrected and also used in another set of simulations 2 4 bias correction techniques the bias correction was performed over a period of 11 years from 2005 to 2015 and was based mainly on two methods namely the correction of the average of the series and the correction of the interannual trend these two techniques were applied successively on the time series at an hourly time step for temperature short and long wave radiation and precipitation the first technique also called the simple correction or delta method consists of determining a correction factor obtained by the ratio of the average of the two series observation vs reanalysis the importance of this bias correction technique in hydrological modeling is well established fang et al 2015 it has helped to maintain consistency between the uncorrected and corrected series eq 1 presents the mathematical formula applied for this bias correction for the trend correction a weighted decrease or increase was applied depending on whether the trend of the simulations was higher than the trend of the observations or vice versa eq 2 it assumes that the description of the climate of this study environment gradually improves over time thanks to the increasing

based on several metrics that allowed us to understand the overall behavior of the simulations compared to the in situ data over or underestimation the rmse defined by root mean square error eq 3 provides information on the dispersion of the values chai and oceanic 2015 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash are also used the kge eq 4 provides an aggregated view of the correlation r mean μ and standard deviation σ ratios between the simulation and observations however it is often difficult to identify the component responsible for a low kge value to overcome this problem gupta et al 2009 and knoben et al 2019 suggested decomposing the kge submetrics and or accompanying them with other evaluators therefore we presented the correlations between observations and simulations in this study the nash eq 5 is a standardized criterion that aims to express the proportion of the variance in the observations explained by the simulations by comparing it to a reference estimator that is the mean of the observed streamflow nash and sutcliffe 1970 as with the kge the closer the nash is to 1 the better the simulation these estimators were

hand and the evolution on monthly scale of precipitation temperature sw and lw the in situ meteorological data from the observatory helped to determine that the era5 and merra2 reanalyses underestimated the annual mean lw and overestimated the annual mean temperature over the basin the sw is better simulated on merra2 with a strong correlation 0 5 and trends closer to the observations compared to era5 which has a poorer correlation and trend for the other variables merra2 is less good at the annual scale at the monthly scale we note that both reanalyses underestimate the lw in almost all months with the exception of december and january where merra2 underestimates the mean temperature both reanalyses overestimate the monthly mean temperature for all months on the precipitation distribution fig 5 it shows that the annual number of rainfall events greater than or equal to 5 mm h1 in both reanalyses is about three times less than the rainfall events greater than or equal to 5 mm h1 in the observations 20 and 19 respectively for era5 and merra2 against 69 for the observations compared to era5 merra2 has a better distribution of rainfall events greater than 5 mm h1 fig 5 while the latter has rainfall events greater than 25 mm h1 rainfall events in era5 are practically 100 less than 10 mm h1 3 2 performance of the parflow clm model fig 6 presents the performance of the parflow clm model in simulating the different terms of the water balance the outputs of this model were compared on a daily time scale with the in situ measurements from the nalohou watershed the best performances of the model are noted in the simulation of evapotranspiration and wtd the amplitudes and variabilities of the simulations agree moderately well with the observations which leads to the best correlation always above 0 80 and kge scores always above 0 70 the comparison of fluxes shows that on the streamflow the model globally overestimates the observations with a small error rmse 0 07 the correlation between observed and simulated streamflow is lower r 0 61 than that for the evaporation and the wtd zooming in on 2012 fig 7 it is seen that the model overestimates the streamflow especially in october to april which represents the dry season during this period the streamflow is often non zero in the simulations in contrary to the observations where the streamflow is practically zero it also seen that the variability of the simulated evaporation during this period is generally lower than the observation the case is similar during the rainy season leading to a high root mean square error rmse 0 83 3 3 model sensitivity analysis with transformed data sensitivity analysis based on the shortcomings of the transformed data shows that the parflow clm model is more sensitive to the poor forcing of precipitation than to other variables a difference of 25 less precipitation induces significant impacts at the 5 threshold on the water balance and mainly on the first order streamflow followed by evaporation table 1 a 25 increase in precipitation induced a 44 increase in streamflow and a 16 increase in evaporation in contrast a 25 decrease in precipitation reduced streamflow by 51 and evaporation by 11 there was no effect on the water storage when precipitation is increased or decreased by 25 similar results are obtained during the rainy season especially with respect to streamflow fig 8 it can be seen that while the average streamflow observed are about 0 031 mm h1 over the entire period there is a significant increase on prec1 0 048 mm h1 and a significant decrease on prec2 0 016 mm h1 only the changes in precipitation also have a significant effect on the wtd but on evaporation it is only lw that has no significant difference the transformation of precipitation temperature and sw showed significant differences at the daily scale not presented there is a decrease in the kge between the simulated wtd with the transformed precipitation kge less than 0 60 compared to the actual observations kge 0 71 the same is seen for the streamflow with a decrease of the kge between the streamflow with observed data kge 0 56 compared to simulated streamflow 0 21 for prec1 and 0 32 for prec2 for the transformation of the other studied variables only small variations are noticed for the first and second order evaporation and streamflow respectively these variations are however not significant prec1 for precipitation increased by 25 prec2 for precipitation decreased by 25 t lw and sw denote observed temperature longwave and shortwave radiation respectively statistical tests indicate a significant difference red letter a or a non significant difference red letter b 3 4 performance of the era5 and mera2 reanalyses and effect of bias corrections firstly the outputs of the model simulations forced with era5 merra2 variables take individually are compared to the simulations of in situ measurements from this comparison not presented it is finding no significant difference on the simulations made with a temperature sw and lw of era5 compared to the simulation made with the same in situ data variable lw of the era5 reanalysis improved the simulation of evapotranspiration the same is true for the merra2 on which its lw has improved the simulation of evaporation for the precipitation the difference is clearly significant with both era5 and merra2 regarding the comparative study of the two reanalyses also with variables taken individually we are not able to assert in a systematic way the simulation potential of the water balance terms of era5 vs merra2 we note however that precipitation lw and temperature in the era5 reanalysis appear to have better kge scores on evapotranspiration on the other hand the simulation carried out with the sw of the merra2 reanalysis also seems to have slightly better performances than the simulations carried out with the sw of the era5 reanalysis not presented secondly we compare globally all data uncorrected and corrected from era5 vs merra2 we note in daily scale table 2 that era5 is better than merra2 at simulating the different terms of the water balance which is likely due to its precipitation being closer to the observations overall the corrections applied to the reanalyses improved the simulations and the performance indicators particularly the kge this is reflected in the era5 correction that increases the measured kge on streamflow from 11 to 13 and the merra2 reanalysis correction that increases the measured kge on evapotranspiration from 66 to 73 we also find that the simulations improved primarily during the rainy season but with a phase shift in the peak on streamflow and evaporation fig 9 the phase shift of about one month on streamflow peak observed in august for reanalyses instead of september for observations is likely related to the underestimation of precipitation by the reanalyse products during the first half of the year the corrections applied significantly improve the performance of the merra2 reanalysis to simulate the streamflow that was underestimated in the rain season fig 9 third the effect of bias correction of the individual variables precipitation temperature lw and sw of reanalyses is analyzed in detail the corrections applied to these variables do not show a significant improvement we found that the uncorrected merra2 sometimes produced better simulations of the water balance terms than the corrected version the corrections applied to some variables sometimes degraded the rmse and sometimes the kge and therefore weakened the performance of the model this is the case for the corrected lw of era5 which increased the biases with the observations by almost 4 rmse goes from 0 87 to 0 84 and the decrease of the kge from 0 74 to 0 71 at the annual scale the era5 reanalysis precipitation correction tends to degrade the annual mean streamflow fig 10 with the observations we note a difference of 87 mm year on uncorrected era5 against 95 mm year on corrected era5 the same is true for the correction effect which seems to reduce the performance of the wtd on the other hand the bias corrections applied to the merra2 reanalysis precipitation bring the annual reanalysis totals closer to the observations likely because the reanalysis precipitation is moderately worse than the era5 reanalysis its also shows that the mean wtd of the streamflow with corrected merra2 343 mm yr is worse than the mean wtd of the era5 uncorrected 481 mm yr and corrected 473 mm yr however it observed that merra2 has a standard deviation of annual streamflow 153 mm yr closer to the observed standard deviation 169 mm yr which is likely due to the good distribution of precipitation in merra2 at the seasonal scale and especially in the rainy season fig 11 the correction applied to the era5 precipitation did not improve its ability to simulate the water balance terms which is also likely because the mean of the series is equal to that found in the observations the analysis performed with merra2 precipitation which has an opposite trend to the observations and a totally different mean shows that the correction techniques on the reanalysis precipitation brought their variation on the streamflow closer and improved the correlation of the evaporation and the wtd 4 discussion comparison studies of the reanalyses with the point station data show that era5 better describes the climate of the environment better correlation mean and trend on all variables except sw on which merra2 is better these results may be related to the coarser spatial resolution of merra2 than era5 these results are consistent with those of grenier et al 2020 over benin showing that the performance of era5 spatial resolution 0 25 x 0 25 is better than the cfsr reanalysis which has a resolution of 0 3122 x 0 3125 the comparison of the reanalyses with the station point data can therefore be affected by the distance between the station and the chosen pixel point it is also clear that there is diversity in performance not all merra2 variables compared to era5 are systematically the worst these results are consistent with the studies of grenier et al 2020 who found that in the month of april the minimum temperature is better simulated in cfsr on the station of natitingou synoptic station near our study area compared to era5 in contrast the latter is worse for the maximum temperature and precipitation on the same station and in the same month our results based on comparisons of model outputs show that simulations with sw lw and temperature forcing taken individually confirm that there is no significant difference on any of the reanalyses vs observations probably because the model is less sensitive to these variables these results are similar to those obtained with transformed observation data no significant difference with transformed vs untransformed sw lw and temperature data our analyses show that the parflow clm model performs well in simulating the different water balance terms the results of this study support the findings of jabot robert 2013 hector et al 2018 and herzog et al 2021 who have already evaluated and found that parflow clm is performing well and exploitable model for water and energy flow simulations in the upper oueme basin the best simulations are observed for evapotranspiration and water table depth this could be explained by the homogeneity of the vegetation in this basin which leads to a homogeneous transpiration of the plants in time and from one point of the watershed to another similarly this homogeneity could lead to the same pumping of the water table by the vegetation over the entire basin which implies that the simulated water table depths are very consistent with the observed water table depths over time this was also attempted by li et al 2007 when they evaluated the hydrologic impact of land use change using a hydrologic model they indicated that deforestation can increase the streamflow rate by up to 44 and even the annual streamflow by up to 65 therefore keeping the basin homogeneous throughout the study period without deforestation of any portion would be equivalent to having the same streamflow rate under the same climate unfortunately even if the study area was left undeveloped and unchanged by humans certain natural transformations such as the presence of termites can alter soil properties dosso and kone 2016 as a result they can alter streamflow in addition the terrain is not flat and therefore our 2d simulations cannot correctly interpret the realities of the environment hence the poor performance of the model on streamflow simulation model sensitivity studies show that transformations of temperature longwave radiation lw and shortwave radiation sw data do not have significant effects on water balance simulations in contrast rainfall transformations have significant impacts on the simulations these results can be explained by the studies of vissin and sintondji 2011 who reported that rainfall has the largest influence on tropical environments among all climate variables the transformation of temperature lw and sw variables and mainly the decrease of the former by 2 c influenced the evaporations in the first order this result is similar to the outcome studies of hounguè et al 2019 who show that when temperature increases evaporation increases significantly and that the variation of the latter is induced by almost 50 by the variation of temperature in opposed to simulations performed with sw lw and temperature variables in the reanalyses the simulations performed with rainfall from the reanalyses show poor performance vs observations this can be explained not only by the climate under which the work is performed but also that the models are more sensitive to rainfall vissin and sintondji 2011 fang et al 2015 these results can also be explained by the fact that observational data are derived from a point measurement station while reanalyses encompass information on large spatial scales and thus aggregate information over the area covered by the scale bodjrènou et al 2021 we note in this study that simulations performed with the sw merra2 also appear to perform slightly better than simulations performed with the sw era5 particularly on evaporations this result can be linked to the better correlation of the sw merra2 with respect to the observations which amounts to 0 50 compared to the correlation of the sw era5 with respect to the observations which amounts to 0 16 the results of this study show that it is difficult to identify the best reanalysis by taking the temperature and radiation variables individually this result matches with those of dembélé et al 2020 who did not find potentially better products when they evaluated seventeen rainfall and temperature products over west africa based on modeling our results also show that bias correction on some variables such as longwave radiation has negative impacts on evaporation simulation this result is consistent with studies by koutsouris et al 2017 who concluded at the end of their study on the hydrological impact of bias corrections tend to have a negative impact on streamflow simulations 5 conclusion this study analyzed the issues related to the use of meteorological forcings from the era5 and merra2 reanalyses corrected or not to simulate the water balance terms of the oueme basin the analysis was based on the parflow clm model after verification of its potential and its sensitivity to temperature rainfall lw and sw variables it can be concluded that the parflow clm model is very efficient and recommendable for hydrological impact studies in the oueme basin the analysis of its sensitivity with the transformed variables and those of the reanalyses allows us to conclude that the parflow clm model is more sensitive to rainfall than to the other variables the good simulations observed on a few occasions with the temperature sw or lw of the reanalyses and the degradation of the simulations observed on a few occasions when they are corrected allow us to conclude that these variables do not require corrections they can be used directly in the hydrological models to simulate the water balance terms of the oueme basin without being subjected to bias correction techniques on the other hand the meteorological forcing of the reanalysis rainfall was found to degrade the simulations and the bias correction techniques applied here are not sufficient to recommend their use in the models the corrections applied to merra2 rainfall showed positive effects on the simulation of water balance terms while the effects are not as good on the era5 correction in addition to the correction techniques used here this study provides an incentive to experiment with other bias correction techniques on precipitation reanalyses prior to their use in hydrological models corrections that retain the same precipitation distributions and monthly totals should be sufficient interest to improve the quality of the era5 precipitation reanalysis declaration of

available water resources on a watershed scale many different hydrological models used in previous studies aimed at solving short or long term problems within a basin in west africa many of such studies are usually based on global models for several reasons including the unsatisfactory quality of observation data and their irregular distribution in time and space dembélé et al 2020 this is the case for the sudanian zone of benin within this zone lies the oueme basin the largest basin in benin the basin has seen an increase in the number of studies evaluating the rainfall flow relationship using rural engineering models in recent years kodja et al 2018 nounangnonhou et al 2018 and other global models such as hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv hydrologic modeling system hec hms hydrological model based on the least action principle hymolap biao 2017 houngue 2020 the region is characterized by complex hydrological processes which limits the use of majority of these models giertz et al 2010 first they are limited to the study of surface water resources and do not account for the entire hydrological cycle this does not help to robustly identify the causes of the poor estimation of flows consequently it is difficult to formulate tangible recommendations to decision makers in this region second the parameters used in these models are generally adjusted to a given period and do not always account for the present day realities of the environment moreover these parameters evolve due to anthropogenic factors which modifies surface conditions and hydrodynamic characteristics of the soil they can also evolve due to climatic factors causing the decrease of water masses and the lowering of the water table these changes are often not accounted for in the models negatively affecting the quality of simulations over their validation periods and or other periods biao et al 2016 in addition the oueme basin crosses all three of benin s climatic zones namely the sub equatorial zone which has two rainy seasons the sudano guinean zone and the sudanian zone which has only one rainy season bodjrènou et al 2021 the use of a global model in this basin is therefore a poor option because of this climatic diversity to which is added the strong variation in vegetation cover depending on whether one is in the north or south of the basin bodjrènou et al 2023 for these reasons recent research on the functioning of the oueme basin hydrosystem advocates the use of physically based models these include the study of hector et al 2018 who proposed to use the parflow model which is a critical zone model based on richard s equation for 3d saturated and unsaturated subsurface transfers and the kinematic wave equation for surface flow it is coupled to community land model clm which is a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model to calculate the energy balance and evapotranspiration fluxes kollet and maxwell 2005 2008 hector et al 2018 highlighted the strong ability of the model to simulate water and energy fluxes and soil water stock streamflow evapotranspiration soil moisture wtd and water storage in the sudanian zone the study used data from the analyse multidisciplinaire de la mousson africaine couplage de l atmosphère tropicale et du cycle hydrologique amma catch observatory both for model inputs and for the evaluation of its outputs two constraints limit the evaluation of the hydrological behavior of the entire oueme basin in this study firstly it did not show long term changes in water balance fluxes one of the main reasons is that qualified data for these high temporal resolution hydrological simulations in this basin are only available in the early 2000 s the second constraint is that the amma catch observation which is the best monitored network in benin is limited to the northern part of the basin galle et al 2018 an alternative for the use of this and other distributed models is to resort to reanalyses which also have their shortcomings in describing the climate of this environment dembélé et al 2020 grenier et al 2020 bodjrènou et al 2021 bodjrènou et al 2021 after a comparative study of two high temporal resolution reanalyses identified era5 compared to merra2 as the most suitable to describe the climate of this environment however we do not know if it is this reanalysis that allows us to make better simulations on the benin basins also we do not know if the correction of the variables that they present are essential to optimize the simulations of the terms of the water balance on this basin moreover it is difficult to systematically identify that all the variables of merra2 the least good reanalysis are bad in terms of simulation of the water balance at the end of their study bodjrènou et al 2021 recommend the use of bias correction to improve on the shortcomings of the reanalysis in the representation of the region s climate but they do not mention their advantages or disadvantages over the simulations ardoin bardin et al 2006 and dembélé et al 2020 showed the presence of holes in the time series has a knock on effect on the perfect evaluation of ground based reanalysis satellite products additionally danso et al 2019 showed that dust carried by strong winds settles on sensors and measuring instruments in the west african region affects the quality of soil data therefore the importance of data correction must be further explored and techniques appropriate to this region must be well thought out according to dembélé et al 2020 studies comparing reanalyses and satellite data with a model should advocate the use of a hydrological model whose sensitivity to forcings is known to draw consistent conclusions in this case it is essential to ensure that parflow clm is capable of simulating water fluxes in oueme basin and to know its sensitivity to different forcings before using it early sensitivity studies of the parflow model by herzog et al 2021 were based on soil hydrodynamic parameters currently it is unclear how to detect the impact of model forcings with biased and unbiased meteorological variables on the other hand the prioritized list of variables is not yet sufficiently clarified over the region and especially with this model it is therefore unclear which variables to focus on for bias correction koutsouris et al 2017 given the above this study proposes to a light on shortcoming of the reanalyses era5 and merra2 by relying on their precipitation temperature short wave radiation sw and long wave radiation lw variable b evaluate the sensitivity of parflow clm with a good and bad meteorological forcing c investigate the importance of applying some bias correction techniques to the reanalysis input data on the output of the parflow clm model this paper is organized as following section 2 describes the methodology of the study section 3 describes the results obtained according to the specific objectives namely the reanalyses performances in describing the climate of the region the performance and sensitivity of the models the comparison of the reanalyses and the effect of the bias corrections section 4 presents the well documented discussion of the results before the conclusion summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 study area and watershed typology 2 1 1 study area benin is a small west african country bordered by the atlantic ocean to the south nigeria to the east togo to the west and burkina faso and niger to the north fig 1 the oueme basin is located in the interior of this country it has climatic and topographical characteristics that vary greatly with latitude bodjrènou et al 2021 amou et al 2022 climatically the oueme basin shares the country s three climatic zones namely the two rainy seasons in the south one rainy season in the north and the transition region considered between 7 and 9 latitude which are determined by the west african rainfall database bodjrènou et al 2021 with this diversity it is not appropriate to consider the use of global hydrological models in the basin 2 1 2 watershed typology the study was carried out on a typical watershed at the nalohou site which is an uncultivated area of the amma catch observatory oueme upper in situ observations and documented reports of the hydro geomorphological characteristics such as vegetation slope friction coefficient porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil layer profile are used information obtained from interviews conducted with resource persons were also used to reduce the computation time the basin is represented in a 2d slope of 50 pixels of 100 m x 100 m corresponding to 50 km in longitudinal dimension and 24 m depth the hydrodynamic characteristics considered in this study are homogeneous along each longitudinal layer before simulating the water balance terms with the parflow clm model kollet and maxwell 2005 2008 the consistency of the introduced values was analyzed with the van genuchten 1980 curves fig 2 2 2 hydrometeorological datasets the hydrometeorological dataset includes the forcings that are used as inputs to the parflow clm model it also includes the in situ measurements that are used to evaluate the outputs of the model the forcing data are prescribed with observations data with and without transformation comes from a point station on amma catch observatory and the merra2 and era5 reanalyses with and without bias corrections selected on their grid closer to the observational station era5 come from the european center for medium range weather forecasts hersbach et al 2020 implemented by the copernicus climate change service and merra2 from national aeronautics and space administration gelaro et al 2017 all those data are at hourly time step except for the wtd data measured in situ which are at daily time step all the other meteorological data necessary to simulate water balance with parflow clm model wind speed pressure specific humidity come from the amma catch observatory in addition in situ measurements are needed to evaluate the model s outputs these are streamflow evapotranspiration and wtd the streamflow measurements come from an ara pont hydrometric station located at 1 6639 e and 9 7622 n the evapotranspiration measurements are taken from a 2 m flux tower located in the nalohou watershed 2 6125 e and 9 7448 e for the assessment of the wtd we use measurements from a piezometric station located at a depth of 20 m at an altitude of 452 792 m and located 190 m from the river recall that only the variables precipitation temperature lw and sw are used in this study their use depends on the objective pursued see details in appendix to evaluate the performance of the model we use in situ measurements of the four variables for the study of the model sensitivity we transformed the in situ data based on the shortcomings of the reanalyses bodjrènou et al 2021 the transformations consist of increasing sw by 20w m2 and precipitation by 25 noted prec1 the model sensitivity is also investigated with temperature decreased by 2 c lw by 10w m2 and precipitation by 25 noted prec2 the comparison of the reanalyses is performed using the four variables simultaneously and selecting them individually the effect of the bias corrections was also investigated for all the variables of reanalyses corrected with techniques described in section 2 4 2 3 conceptualization of the study fig 3 conceptualizes the different simulations performed to achieve the objectives the first simulation used in situ measurements as inputs this provides a basis to evaluate the capacity of the model to simulate the different terms of the water balance the model s sensitivity is also assessed using the same data which have undergone transformations the second set of simulations used either era5 or merra2 as inputs both reanalyse products are first used as forcings in individual simulations they are then bias corrected and also used in another set of simulations 2 4 bias correction techniques the bias correction was performed over a period of 11 years from 2005 to 2015 and was based mainly on two methods namely the correction of the average of the series and the correction of the interannual trend these two techniques were applied successively on the time series at an hourly time step for temperature short and long wave radiation and precipitation the first technique also called the simple correction or delta method consists of determining a correction factor obtained by the ratio of the average of the two series observation vs reanalysis the importance of this bias correction technique in hydrological modeling is well established fang et al 2015 it has helped to maintain consistency between the uncorrected and corrected series eq 1 presents the mathematical formula applied for this bias correction for the trend correction a weighted decrease or increase was applied depending on whether the trend of the simulations was higher than the trend of the observations or vice versa eq 2 it assumes that the description of the climate of this study environment gradually improves over time thanks to the increasing installation of observation stations and their good monitoring n tcha m po et al 2017 galle et al 2018 1 d cor c d sim with d cor d sim the corrected and simulated data and c the correction factor

based on several metrics that allowed us to understand the overall behavior of the simulations compared to the in situ data over or underestimation the rmse defined by root mean square error eq 3 provides information on the dispersion of the values chai and oceanic 2015 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash are also used the kge eq 4 provides an aggregated view of the correlation r mean μ and standard deviation σ ratios between the simulation and observations however it is often difficult to identify the component responsible for a low kge value to overcome this problem gupta et al 2009 and knoben et al 2019 suggested decomposing the kge submetrics and or accompanying them with other evaluators therefore we presented the correlations between observations and simulations in this study the nash eq 5 is a standardized criterion that aims to express the proportion of the variance in the observations explained by the simulations by comparing it to a reference estimator that is the mean of the observed streamflow nash and sutcliffe 1970 as with the kge the closer the nash is to 1 the better the simulation these estimators were

hand and the evolution on monthly scale of precipitation temperature sw and lw the in situ meteorological data from the observatory helped to determine that the era5 and merra2 reanalyses underestimated the annual mean lw and overestimated the annual mean temperature over the basin the sw is better simulated on merra2 with a strong correlation 0 5 and trends closer to the observations compared to era5 which has a poorer correlation and trend for the other variables merra2 is less good at the annual scale at the monthly scale we note that both reanalyses underestimate the lw in almost all months with the exception of december and january where merra2 underestimates the mean temperature both reanalyses overestimate the monthly mean temperature for all months on the precipitation distribution fig 5 it shows that the annual number of rainfall events greater than or equal to 5 mm h1 in both reanalyses is about three times less than the rainfall events greater than or equal to 5 mm h1 in the observations 20 and 19 respectively for era5 and merra2 against 69 for the observations compared to era5 merra2 has a better distribution of rainfall events greater than 5 mm h1 fig 5 while the latter has rainfall events greater than 25 mm h1 rainfall events in era5 are practically 100 less than 10 mm h1 3 2 performance of the parflow clm model fig 6 presents the performance of the parflow clm model in simulating the different terms of the water balance the outputs of this model were compared on a daily time scale with the in situ measurements from the nalohou watershed the best performances of the model are noted in the simulation of evapotranspiration and wtd the amplitudes and variabilities of the simulations agree moderately well with the observations which leads to the best correlation always above 0 80 and kge scores always above 0 70 the comparison of fluxes shows that on the streamflow the model globally overestimates the observations with a small error rmse 0 07 the correlation between observed and simulated streamflow is lower r 0 61 than that for the evaporation and the wtd zooming in on 2012 fig 7 it is seen that the model overestimates the streamflow especially in october to april which represents the dry season during this period the streamflow is often non zero in the simulations in contrary to the observations where the streamflow is practically zero it also seen that the variability of the simulated evaporation during this period is generally lower than the observation the case is similar during the rainy season leading to a high root mean square error rmse 0 83 3 3 model sensitivity analysis with transformed data sensitivity analysis based on the shortcomings of the transformed data shows that the parflow clm model is more sensitive to the poor forcing of precipitation than to other variables a difference of 25 less precipitation induces significant impacts at the 5 threshold on the water balance and mainly on the first order streamflow followed by evaporation table 1 a 25 increase in precipitation induced a 44 increase in streamflow and a 16 increase in evaporation in contrast a 25 decrease in precipitation reduced streamflow by 51 and evaporation by 11 there was no effect on the water storage when precipitation is increased or decreased by 25 similar results are obtained during the rainy season especially with respect to streamflow fig 8 it can be seen that while the average streamflow observed are about 0 031 mm h1 over the entire period there is a significant increase on prec1 0 048 mm h1 and a significant decrease on prec2 0 016 mm h1 only the changes in precipitation also have a significant effect on the wtd but on evaporation it is only lw that has no significant difference the transformation of precipitation temperature and sw showed significant differences at the daily scale not presented there is a decrease in the kge between the simulated wtd with the transformed precipitation kge less than 0 60 compared to the actual observations kge 0 71 the same is seen for the streamflow with a decrease of the kge between the streamflow with observed data kge 0 56 compared to simulated streamflow 0 21 for prec1 and 0 32 for prec2 for the transformation of the other studied variables only small variations are noticed for the first and second order evaporation and streamflow respectively these variations are however not significant prec1 for precipitation increased by 25 prec2 for precipitation decreased by 25 t lw and sw denote observed temperature longwave and shortwave radiation respectively statistical tests indicate a significant difference red letter a or a non significant difference red letter b 3 4 performance of the era5 and mera2 reanalyses and effect of bias corrections firstly the outputs of the model simulations forced with era5 merra2 variables take individually are compared to the simulations of in situ measurements from this comparison not presented it is finding no significant difference on the simulations made with a temperature sw and lw of era5 compared to the simulation made with the same in situ data variable lw of the era5 reanalysis improved the simulation of evapotranspiration the same is true for the merra2 on which its lw has improved the simulation of evaporation for the precipitation the difference is clearly significant with both era5 and merra2 regarding the comparative study of the two reanalyses also with variables taken individually we are not able to assert in a systematic way the simulation potential of the water balance terms of era5 vs merra2 we note however that precipitation lw and temperature in the era5 reanalysis appear to have better kge scores on evapotranspiration on the other hand the simulation carried out with the sw of the merra2 reanalysis also seems to have slightly better performances than the simulations carried out with the sw of the era5 reanalysis not presented secondly we compare globally all data uncorrected and corrected from era5 vs merra2 we note in daily scale table 2 that era5 is better than merra2 at simulating the different terms of the water balance which is likely due to its precipitation being closer to the observations overall the corrections applied to the reanalyses improved the simulations and the performance indicators particularly the kge this is reflected in the era5 correction that increases the measured kge on streamflow from 11 to 13 and the merra2 reanalysis correction that increases the measured kge on evapotranspiration from 66 to 73 we also find that the simulations improved primarily during the rainy season but with a phase shift in the peak on streamflow and evaporation fig 9 the phase shift of about one month on streamflow peak observed in august for reanalyses instead of september for observations is likely related to the underestimation of precipitation by the reanalyse products during the first half of the year the corrections applied significantly improve the performance of the merra2 reanalysis to simulate the streamflow that was underestimated in the rain season fig 9 third the effect of bias correction of the individual variables precipitation temperature lw and sw of reanalyses is analyzed in detail the corrections applied to these variables do not show a significant improvement we found that the uncorrected merra2 sometimes produced better simulations of the water balance terms than the corrected version the corrections applied to some variables sometimes degraded the rmse and sometimes the kge and therefore weakened the performance of the model this is the case for the corrected lw of era5 which increased the biases with the observations by almost 4 rmse goes from 0 87 to 0 84 and the decrease of the kge from 0 74 to 0 71 at the annual scale the era5 reanalysis precipitation correction tends to degrade the annual mean streamflow fig 10 with the observations we note a difference of 87 mm year on uncorrected era5 against 95 mm year on corrected era5 the same is true for the correction effect which seems to reduce the performance of the wtd on the other hand the bias corrections applied to the merra2 reanalysis precipitation bring the annual reanalysis totals closer to the observations likely because the reanalysis precipitation is moderately worse than the era5 reanalysis its also shows that the mean wtd of the streamflow with corrected merra2 343 mm yr is worse than the mean wtd of the era5 uncorrected 481 mm yr and corrected 473 mm yr however it observed that merra2 has a standard deviation of annual streamflow 153 mm yr closer to the observed standard deviation 169 mm yr which is likely due to the good distribution of precipitation in merra2 at the seasonal scale and especially in the rainy season fig 11 the correction applied to the era5 precipitation did not improve its ability to simulate the water balance terms which is also likely because the mean of the series is equal to that found in the observations the analysis performed with merra2 precipitation which has an opposite trend to the observations and a totally different mean shows that the correction techniques on the reanalysis precipitation brought their variation on the streamflow closer and improved the correlation of the evaporation and the wtd 4 discussion comparison studies of the reanalyses with the point station data show that era5 better describes the climate of the environment better correlation mean and trend on all variables except sw on which merra2 is better these results may be related to the coarser spatial resolution of merra2 than era5 these results are consistent with those of grenier et al 2020 over benin showing that the performance of era5 spatial resolution 0 25 x 0 25 is better than the cfsr reanalysis which has a resolution of 0 3122 x 0 3125 the comparison of the reanalyses with the station point data can therefore be affected by the distance between the station and the chosen pixel point it is also clear that there is diversity in performance not all merra2 variables compared to era5 are systematically the worst these results are consistent with the studies of grenier et al 2020 who found that in the month of april the minimum temperature is better simulated in cfsr on the station of natitingou synoptic station near our study area compared to era5 in contrast the latter is worse for the maximum temperature and precipitation on the same station and in the same month our results based on comparisons of model outputs show that simulations with sw lw and temperature forcing taken individually confirm that there is no significant difference on any of the reanalyses vs observations probably because the model is less sensitive to these variables these results are similar to those obtained with transformed observation data no significant difference with transformed vs untransformed sw lw and temperature data our analyses show that the parflow clm model performs well in simulating the different water balance terms the results of this study support the findings of jabot robert 2013 hector et al 2018 and herzog et al 2021 who have already evaluated and found that parflow clm is performing well and exploitable model for water and energy flow simulations in the upper oueme basin the best simulations are observed for evapotranspiration and water table depth this could be explained by the homogeneity of the vegetation in this basin which leads to a homogeneous transpiration of the plants in time and from one point of the watershed to another similarly this homogeneity could lead to the same pumping of the water table by the vegetation over the entire basin which implies that the simulated water table depths are very consistent with the observed water table depths over time this was also attempted by li et al 2007 when they evaluated the hydrologic impact of land use change using a hydrologic model they indicated that deforestation can increase the streamflow rate by up to 44 and even the annual streamflow by up to 65 therefore keeping the basin homogeneous throughout the study period without deforestation of any portion would be equivalent to having the same streamflow rate under the same climate unfortunately even if the study area was left undeveloped and unchanged by humans certain natural transformations such as the presence of termites can alter soil properties dosso and kone 2016 as a result they can alter streamflow in addition the terrain is not flat and therefore our 2d simulations cannot correctly interpret the realities of the environment hence the poor performance of the model on streamflow simulation model sensitivity studies show that transformations of temperature longwave radiation lw and shortwave radiation sw data do not have significant effects on water balance simulations in contrast rainfall transformations have significant impacts on the simulations these results can be explained by the studies of vissin and sintondji 2011 who reported that rainfall has the largest influence on tropical environments among all climate variables the transformation of temperature lw and sw variables and mainly the decrease of the former by 2 c influenced the evaporations in the first order this result is similar to the outcome studies of hounguè et al 2019 who show that when temperature increases evaporation increases significantly and that the variation of the latter is induced by almost 50 by the variation of temperature in opposed to simulations performed with sw lw and temperature variables in the reanalyses the simulations performed with rainfall from the reanalyses show poor performance vs observations this can be explained not only by the climate under which the work is performed but also that the models are more sensitive to rainfall vissin and sintondji 2011 fang et al 2015 these results can also be explained by the fact that observational data are derived from a point measurement station while reanalyses encompass information on large spatial scales and thus aggregate information over the area covered by the scale bodjrènou et al 2021 we note in this study that simulations performed with the sw merra2 also appear to perform slightly better than simulations performed with the sw era5 particularly on evaporations this result can be linked to the better correlation of the sw merra2 with respect to the observations which amounts to 0 50 compared to the correlation of the sw era5 with respect to the observations which amounts to 0 16 the results of this study show that it is difficult to identify the best reanalysis by taking the temperature and radiation variables individually this result matches with those of dembélé et al 2020 who did not find potentially better products when they evaluated seventeen rainfall and temperature products over west africa based on modeling our results also show that bias correction on some variables such as longwave radiation has negative impacts on evaporation simulation this result is consistent with studies by koutsouris et al 2017 who concluded at the end of their study on the hydrological impact of bias corrections tend to have a negative impact on streamflow simulations 5 conclusion this study analyzed the issues related to the use of meteorological forcings from the era5 and merra2 reanalyses corrected or not to simulate the water balance terms of the oueme basin the analysis was based on the parflow clm model after verification of its potential and its sensitivity to temperature rainfall lw and sw variables it can be concluded that the parflow clm model is very efficient and recommendable for hydrological impact studies in the oueme basin the analysis of its sensitivity with the transformed variables and those of the reanalyses allows us to conclude that the parflow clm model is more sensitive to rainfall than to the other variables the good simulations observed on a few occasions with the temperature sw or lw of the reanalyses and the degradation of the simulations observed on a few occasions when they are corrected allow us to conclude that these variables do not require corrections they can be used directly in the hydrological models to simulate the water balance terms of the oueme basin without being subjected to bias correction techniques on the other hand the meteorological forcing of the reanalysis rainfall was found to degrade the simulations and the bias correction techniques applied here are not sufficient to recommend their use in the models the corrections applied to merra2 rainfall showed positive effects on the simulation of water balance terms while the effects are not as good on the era5 correction in addition to the correction techniques used here this study provides an incentive to experiment with other bias correction techniques on precipitation reanalyses prior to their use in hydrological models corrections that retain the same precipitation distributions and monthly totals should be sufficient interest to improve the quality of the era5 precipitation reanalysis declaration of

7621,study region the thaya river basin provides multiple water uses in the transboundary region of lower austria and southern moravia due to the low precipitation p to reference evapotranspiration eto ratio the thaya river basin is among the most sensitive to climate change in the region study focus the main objective is to understand the changes in the water balance variables including actual evapotranspiration et p and runoff ro and their drivers for the period 1981 2020 and 2001 2020 in the case of using remote sensing data new hydrological insights for the region the analyses confirm previously reported increasing trends in air temperature eto and no trends in p et consistently increased during spring and decreased during summer although insignificantly this change was associated with a significant increase of spring vegetation development followed by summer stagnation the spring ro shows significantly decreasing trends especially in the upland water source areas the correlation analysis reveals a different behavior along the altitude gradient with et in the uplands generally limited by available energy whilst in the lowlands by available water in spring in summer however the entire basin is often water limited with a more pronounced limitation in the lowlands complex adaptation measures reflecting the different hydroclimate relations across the altitudinal gradient are needed to sustain the water dependent sectors operating in the region facing increasing aridity graphical abstract keywords climate change evapotranspiration precipitation remote sensing runoff trend analysis water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic global climate change is characterized by rising mean annual air temperature t a and consequently an increase of potentially precipitable atmospheric water vapor clausius clapeyron equation leading to among others an acceleration of the hydrological cycle katul et al 2012 vargas godoy et al 2021 the rate of this global hydrological cycle acceleration has been reported to vary between 2 to 7 c 1 liepert and previdi 2009 wentz et al 2007 regionally however the change in climate manifests itself in numerous complex forms which can largely deviate from global values and even in the opposite direction of trends brázdil et al 2021 the consequences of climate change together with impacts of land use changes on runoff ro in europe have been studied extensively alfieri et al 2015 vormoor et al 2015 teuling et al 2019 according to mostowik et al 2019 observations suggest increases of ro in northern europe and decreases in southern europe in the last 50 years in central europe there is a clear evidence of earlier winter floods due to a changing snow regime blöschl et al 2017 langhammer and bernsteinová 2020 the czech republic being in the center of this region can be regarded as an area with transitional effects of climate change on ro with site specific phenomena previous studies suggest an increasing trend in mean annual seasonal and monthly t a zahradníček et al 2021 yet hardly any trend in precipitation totals p at any temporal scale brázdil et al 2021 since t a is tightly related to the atmospheric evaporative demand oudin et al 2005 these two trends suggest an increasing aridity and higher likelihood of drought occurrence trnka et al 2015 2016 hari et al 2020 the role of the trends in t a p and other hydroclimate variables including vegetation and especially their causal consequences on hydrology in the czech republic has been documented only to a limited extent hanel et al 2012 blahušiaková et al 2020 since an increase of t a should lead to an increase of actual evapotranspiration et up to the point when it is limited by p one might expect a notable decrease of ro and or different storage terms of the water balance the regional study from neighboring austria duethmann and blöschl 2018 suggests that in the past 40 years et has increased by 20 while p has remained relatively constant however the trends in ro are often reported to be not significant trnka et al 2022b or locally even in the opposite direction ledvinka 2015 kliment et al 2011 these trends can naturally vary over space ledvinka 2015 fiala et al 2010 e g for regions where et is prevailingly limited by energy kliment et al 2011 oulehle et al 2021 vs where it is limited by water trnka et al 2022b the thaya river basin characterized by the combined influence of lower elevations and the leeward effect of the highlands from westerly directions řehoř et al 2021 belongs to the basins with the lowest p to reference evapotranspiration eto ratio trnka et al 2022b making it potentially the most vulnerable larger basin to climate change in the czech republic currently a wide spectrum of adaptation measures is being planned or implemented to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the landscape water balance and water resources in the czech republic including the thaya river basin hlásny et al 2014 trnka et al 2022a b these adaptation measures range from purely technical e g building new water reservoirs inter basin water transfer irrigation to nature based e g river renaturalization and revitalization remediating soil proprieties changes in crop rotations or forest species composition in order to realistically assess their efficiency and interactions a holistic approach is needed allowing an accurate quantification of the basin water balance a first step in such an analysis is to exploit the available data sets of terrestrial and remote sensing observations therefore this study aims at understanding the spatiotemporal variability and relationships in the hydroclimatic and vegetation conditions of the thaya river basin over the last 40 years more specifically it examines how the climatic conditions propagate to the hydrological regime and whether the dynamics of this relationship change over time to that end in situ observations of ro and various climatological variables as well as remote sensing data describing et snow and vegetation dynamics were analyzed we hypothesize that there exists a difference in response to rising t a between the lower and higher elevation parts of the basin since et for the lower parts is mainly limited by p no trend in et is expected in contrast the higher parts are limited rather by available energy and hence we expect to observe an increasing trend in et consequently we expect decreasing trends of the overall ro driven by the most pronounced decreases in the higher basin parts besides testing these hypotheses an analytical quantitative attribution of the expected changes in ro was conducted aiming at disentangling the role of different climatic drivers in ro trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the thaya river basin drains a total area of 13 419 km2 located in the southern part of the czech republic 83 and the northern part of austria 17 the river thaya in the czech language dyje is formed by the confluence of the austrian or also called german and moravian thaya in lower austria and represents the longest tributary of the morava river danube basin the sources of the two branches are both located in the highlands at elevations of 676 m a s l at and 635 m a s l cz the main tributaries are in the moravian part of the basin and follow mainly a nw se direction the jihlava river flows through the eponymous city and the svratka together with the svitava rivers drain brno the second largest city of the czech republic the upper reaches of the river are formed on crystalline bedrocks while the lower parts consist of quaternary sediments soils follow a similar pattern and consist of predominantly cambisols in the highlands 58 and fertile chernozems in the lower reaches 20 the middle and lower reach of the thaya river is characterized by anthropogenic modifications including large reservoirs constructed for water supply or irrigation purposes the long term annual p of the higher parts of the thaya river basin exceeds 650 mm řehoř et al 2021 and the annual ro coefficient ranges from 0 2 to 0 3 with mean annual ro of 187 mm trnka et al 2022b nevertheless the lowland region with lower annual p combined with high eto results in a significantly reduced ro coefficient 0 1 0 15 because of a mean annual ro of nearly 60 mm the relatively limited water resources hardly satisfy the water demand of households industry energy and agriculture especially in dry years the total water demand reaches up to 1 3 of river streamflow as an example during the dry period 2014 2019 drinking water supplies from the vranov reservoir were threatened due to low water level and additional measures like usage restriction had to be imposed the water scarcity is partly solved by water detention in 21 surface water reservoirs located at the thaya river or tributaries the lowland characteristics together with a mild and warm climate make the agricultural landscape in the thaya river basin fertile arable lands occupy 66 while forests 28 16 coniferous 6 mixed and 6 broadleaved of the basin the coniferous forests have been facing an unprecedented bark beetle outbreak forced by high t a and a severe drought period from 2014 2019 brázdil et al 2022a this outbreak caused a significant decay of coniferous forest stands requiring a radically increased sanitary logging which by the end of 2020 represented about 30 of the total area of coniferous stands in the basin compared to 2012 2 2 in situ observations the thaya river basin excluding the confluence of the morava river was divided into 42 topographically delineated subcatchments based on the presence of discharge gauging stations with the measurement starting in or before the year 1981 these subcatchments were considered as the main spatial units to which all other variables were aggregated the area of 847 km2 in the southeast near the cities kyjov hodonín and lanžhot was not represented by any discharge measurement ungauged subcatchment and therefore was excluded from further analyses fig 1 the mean area of the subcatchments was 251 km2 with a range from 12 km2 to 1073 km2 2 2 1 meteorological variables and snow depth the daily meteorological data encompassed p totals mean t a sums of global radiation r g derived from sunshine duration mean relative humidity rh and mean wind speed u from 50 climatological and 159 precipitation stations covering the thaya river basin and close surroundings originating from the czech hydrometeorological institute cz and the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics at note that daily minimum and maximum t a were also collected and processed nevertheless these two variables were used only for intermediate calculations and are not part of any presented analyses therefore all results and presented analyses of t a in this study are strictly based on mean daily t a the daily meteorological data were quality controlled and homogenized for the period 1981 2020 applying several methods for detecting outliers and inhomogeneities štěpánek et al 2013 brázdil et al 2021 zahradníček et al 2021 and own methods for inhomogeneities corrections at daily time scale based on quantile mapping štěpánek et al 2016 squintu et al 2020 to satisfy the requirement of the continuous time series by further analyses an occasionally missing data were gap filled using a standardized procedure štěpánek et al 2013 for snow depth sd a process for data homogenization has not yet been standardized therefore only data quality control and gap filling štěpánek et al 2013 brázdil et al 2021 have been performed for sd for all available stations 184 in the thaya river basin and close surroundings to match the spatial coverage represented by the ro measurements the daily data were interpolated by regression kriging into a gridded data set with a spatial resolution of 500 m using geographical coordinates elevation and other terrain characteristics as kriging predictors štěpánek et al 2011 the spatial resolution of 500 m was deemed to be appropriate to capture the topographical complexity while keeping a reasonable computational intensity and in addition commensurate with the resolution of other used remote sensing data in the thaya river basin the average distance between two neighboring precipitation stations is less than 8 km and in the case of the variables measured at the climatological stations it is approximately 14 km for further analyses additional variables including actual vapor pressure e vapor pressure deficit vpd and eto were computed from daily inputs following the food and agriculture organization of the united nations standard methodology allen et al 1998 in brief e was computed from the saturated vapor pressure derived as an average from daily minimum and maximum t a using clausius clapeyron equation and rh while eto was computed based on the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 with strictly defined vegetation parameters albedo stomatal resistance and height and the above mentioned meteorological inputs including r g t a vpd and u allen et al 1998 all meteorological data were spatially aggregated arithmetic mean over the 42 subcatchments 2 2 2 runoff runoff was determined from discharge measurements at the outlet of each subcatchment the discharge data come from the network of automatic water gauging stations of the czech hydrometeorological institute and the hydrographic service of austria the stations are equipped with hydrostatic pressure or ultrasonic water level sensors from which the flow is calculated using calibrated rating curves the daily series were aggregated to the monthly mean observed discharge q o to enable conversion into naturalized flow values q n through the methodology developed by the ministry of agriculture of the czech republic for water balance assessments at river basin scale tureček 2002 working with national water usage database based on official monthly evidence the estimation of q n accounts for the influence of human activities including withdrawals releases and impacts of water reservoirs and reservoir management and follows as 1 q n q o q r q w δ q o where q r represents the releases to the surface water may originate from both surface and subsurface withdrawals including water transfer from another catchments or basins q w the withdrawals from the surface and subsurface waters and δ q o the changes in observed discharge due to water manipulations being positive if the outflow is greater than the inflow streamflow enhancement and negative if the outflow is smaller than the inflow reservoir water accumulation if the sum of inflow and p exceeds the sum of outflow and open water evaporation the naturalized streamflow data were obtained from the t g masaryk water research institute representing the sole authority in the czech republic in charge of quality control and release of the water management data both q r and q w originate from the official registry of the mandatory reports and δ q o from the prescribed water reservoir ruling curves and regulation plans provided by the state water management enterprise in the river morava basin brno cz the natural naturalized or unimpaired runoff depth hereinafter just runoff ro mm if not otherwise stated was then determined by dividing q n by the subcatchment area always delineated to a gauging station we opted to use the abbreviation ro instead of q to clearly distinguish runoff from streamflow in this text the monthly ro time series were also used to estimate water balance evapotranspiration etwb as et wb p c ro where p c is precipitation corrected by the snow model snowmaus trnka et al 2010 to account for the water from snowfall entering the water balance only after the snow melt 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 actual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration was determined by the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 1997 hain and anderson 2017 alexi is a diagnostic model based on time differential land surface temperature lst measurements and other primarily remote sensing inputs related to meteorological conditions and land cover properties alexi quantifies the evaporative flux and cooling required to keep the soil and vegetation at the observed lst under the known solar radiation inputs and other meteorological conditions anderson et al 2007 the core of alexi is a two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 which partitions fluxes and radiometric temperature between soil and vegetation components based on the local vegetation cover fraction apparent at the thermal sensor view angle anderson et al 2007 tseb estimates et by partitioning the energy available at the land surface i e the net radiation r n and the soil heat flux g into turbulent fluxes of sensible h and latent heat le as r n g h le all in w m 2 where le λ et with λ being the latent heat of vaporization in alexi the tseb model is coupled with a simple planetary boundary layer pbl model during the period of nearly linear morning t a as well as lst rise anderson et al 1997 through iterative coupling the tseb model diagnoses the surface energy balance which in turns drives the boundary layer growth and t a development within the pbl model thereby constraining the gradient between lst and t a at the blending height 50 m i e t a representing a mixture of landscape surfaces required by tseb the morning lst rise can be directly monitored by geostationary satellites or it can be approximated from day night lst retrievals hain and anderson 2017 solving this land surface atmosphere feedback requires the model to be run at scales commensurate with surface forcing of t a at the blending height mecikalski et al 1999 for these reasons a relatively coarse 0 05 i e 5 km lst product aggregated from the modis myd11c1 product is used for the global alexi version based on day night lst retrievals however for the landscape analysis including this hydroclimatic study finer spatial resolution is beneficial to satisfy this need a disaggregation disalexi and data fusion was applied yang et al 2017 in disalexi higher resolution remote sensing inputs of lst leaf area index lai and albedo α are used to spatially downscale regional alexi et fluxes in this study modis inputs e g mcd43a3 for α mcd15a3h and mod15a2h for lai mcd12q1 for landcover and mod11 l2 for lst were used facilitating downscaling of 5 km alexi et to a spatial resolution of 500 m the daily et values were then spatially aggregated over the 42 subcatchments for further analyses the subcatchment scale et from disalexi was also used to quantify the surface resistance r s representing a variable primarily integrating the landscape root zone water availability the surface resistance was determined from the rewritten form of the penman monteith monteith 1965 equation as 2 r s r a δ γ r n g λ et δ γ γ ρ c p γ vpd λ et where r a is the aerodynamic resistance δ is the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve with respect to t a γ is the psychrometric constant ρ is the air density and c p is the specific heat of moist air 2 3 2 albedo leaf area index and normalized difference vegetation index the modis albedo product mcd43a3 covering the period data 2001 2020 was used as an input for disalexi and as one of the variables within the time series analysis the lai m2 m 2 data covering the period 2001 2020 were obtained from the combination of 4 day and 8 day modis lai composite products mcd15a3h and mod15a2h the reason for combining these two lai products is because the mcd15a3h is preferred for disalexi due to its higher frequency of images but available only since summer 2002 therefore mod15a2h was used for the years 2001 and 2002 to provide temporally continuous time series and to minimize the noise in the original data a flexfit gao et al 2020 moving window filter approach using the polynomial fitting from nearby dates was used these data were used as an input for disalexi as well as for lai time series analyses besides modis lai a product from the copernicus global land service cgls project providing lai based on spot vgt from 2001 to 2014 and proba v from 2014 to 2020 satellite data 1 km resolution was tested normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series covering the period 1981 2020 were prepared from combination of advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data 1 km resolution and the modis ndvi product mod13a1 250 m resolution for the purpose of the time series analyses all mentioned variables were spatially aggregated arithmetic mean into 42 subcatchments 2 3 3 snow cover snow cover fraction scf was estimated from the modis terra satellite dataset hall and riggs 2021 using daily images with a spatial resolution of 500 m mod10a1 for the period 2001 2020 snow covered pixels were identified by using the normalized difference snow index hall and riggs 2011 and classified as snow if the index is larger than 0 4 tong et al 2020 the mean monthly seasonal or annual snow cover area of each subcatchment was estimated from the days when cloud coverage was smaller than 60 the snow cover fraction for those days was estimated as a ratio between the frequency of pixels classified as snow and the sum of pixel frequencies classified as snow and land 2 4 data analyses 2 4 1 temporal trends and correlation analyses to analyze the possible trends in time series of individual variables the non parametric theil sen regression was applied theil 1950 sen 1968 the related statistical significance of the trends was evaluated using the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall and gibbons 1990 these tests were applied on temporally aggregated data covering either the entire year growing season april to september or four individual seasons december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son to quantify a correlation between all variables a kendall rank correlation kendall 1938 was applied for specific analysis where variables needed to be scaled to a similar magnitude a z score transformation was applied i e deviation from the mean normalized by standard deviation in order to show the long term variation the time series were smoothed with a low pass gaussian filter applied in the frequency domain fast fourier transform while the trend analyses were conducted for both 40 and 20 year series the results from the 20 year series were interpreted with high caution due to their borderline length for a trend analysis the main justification for performing the trend analysis over the 20 year series is to utilize the remote sensing methods as a unique opportunity to gain more insights into hydroclimate processes and their temporal changes 2 4 2 attribution analysis over a sufficiently long period of time such that the storage fluctuations are negligible the overall water balance can be simplified to ro p et katul et al 2012 as a consequence the mass conservation law provides that changes in ro can be attributed directly to changes in p and et as 3 δ ro δ p δ et the changes in et are more complex and can be decomposed by applying partial derivatives of the penman monteith model an approximation using a first order taylor series expansion can be written as beven 1979 4 δ et et t a δ t a et r n g δ r n g et rh δ rh et u δ u et r s δ r s where the terms on the right hand side represent contributions of t a available energy r n g rh u and r s respectively the partial derivatives of the penman monteith can also be solved using second order or higher order taylor series expansion feng and fu 2013 chen et al 2020 however our results did not provide a clear evidence of additional benefit of the higher order expansion and hence we used the simpler and more straightforward e g not requiring the interpretation of complex interactive terms expression described in eq 4 the attribution analysis in this study was based on the application of the above mentioned expressions eqs 3 and 4 with the changes determined as the sen s slope per decade i e 10 years 2 4 3 budyko framework the budyko 1974 framework was used to analyze the long term state and potential shifts in the evaporative index et p along the aridity index eto p due to the changes in climate but also possibly other factors like vegetation cover li et al 2013 the one parameter function choudhúry 1999 5 et p 1 1 p et o n 1 n with the parameter n describing the shape of the budyko curve was fitted to the observed data the higher values of the parameter n suggest a steeper shape of the budyko curve and p partitioning favoring more et than ro the parameter n is empirically related positive correlation with vegetation cover ndvi or lai li et al 2013 and thus allows to attribute the changes in p partitioning within the budyko space to changes in climate and vegetation separately 3 results 3 1 temporal trends 3 1 1 trends over the period 1981 2020 the time series analysis of climate variables over the entire basin at the annual time scale over the period 1981 2020 revealed statistically significant increasing trends in e eto t a and vpd as well as statistically significant decreasing trends in sd and u table 1 highly significant was also an increasing trend in ndvi table 1 although statistically not significant increasing trends in annual p decreasing climatic water balance p et o and decreasing ro are also relevant for this study trends with similar significance and direction yet different slopes were detected for the above mentioned variables also during the growing season period april to september when analyzing the trends for different parts of the season consistently positive and significant trends were observed in the case of t a and ndvi and consistently negative and significant trends in the case of u the steepest decrease in ro was detected in spring when the trends were also significant for the remaining parts of the year the trends were also negative yet not statistically significant despite the significant increases in t a eto increased primarily during the summer months accompanied by the steepest and most significant increase of vpd the contribution of trends in individual components of evaporative demand and et are elaborated in section 3 3 the spatial patterns of the subset of variables listed in table 1 were highly consistent for t a eto and ndvi showing overall positive and significant trends over most of the entire basin fig 2 consistently negative trends were observed only for sd in some areas primarily those at higher elevations statistically significantly decreasing trends were also observed for ro some areas also showed statistically significantly increasing trends in etwb precipitation and p et o showed no statically significant trends except in two neighboring subcatchments in the southwest of the basin in the case of p the most significant trend table 1 and fig 3 and the most consistent low frequency temporal variation was a characteristic of t a which when smoothed by a 10 year gaussian filter showed a predominantly increasing tendency fig 3 a similar situation was also identified for ndvi while eto showed a few more pronounced decreasing periods low p and p et o were observed in 1983 at the end of the 80 s and in the first half of the 90 s and in the years 2003 2008 2011 2015 and 2017 the period 2015 2019 was identified as the period with the most negative p et o and was also characterized by a decrease in ro in contrast high p and high ro were observed in 1985 1987 1997 2002 2010 and 2020 the highest sd was recorded during the winter of 2005 2006 followed by high ro after the snow melt an additional inspection of longer term temporal trends using a 20 year running window fig 4 revealed that at the annual and growing season time scale only t a and ndvi showed consistently increasing trends the remaining variables showed periods with increasing as well as decreasing trends an obvious switch from positive to negative trends around the window ending in 2013 i e the period 1994 2013 was observed for etwb p p et o and ro a similar switch in the trend sign also occurred in the case of sd a few years earlier in terms of individual seasons noteworthy is the declining tendency in the positive trend of ndvi in summer when in 2020 i e for the period 2001 2020 the first negative trend was observed the period 2001 2020 for which more satellite data sets are available is discussed in more detail in the next section 3 1 2 the trends over the period 2001 2020 compared to 1981 2020 the period 2001 2020 was generally characterized by steeper trends for all of the investigated variables except for ndvi yet more often insignificant due the shorter length of the analyzed period table 2 for instance although t a showed positive trends across all the investigated time blocks these trends were significant only at the annual time scale and during the fall and winter months similar to the 1981 2020 interval ndvi showed increasing trends for all the seasons yet these trends were significant only at the annual time scale and for the early and late seasons growing season ndvi did not change significantly lai similarly increased during these seasons although modis lai showed a higher rate of increase than cgls the small and in some cases negative trends in lai and ndvi during the summer periods may indicate vegetation stress due to water limitations water limitations are also supported by etlst and etwb which both showed negative anomalies with the most pronounced declines in summer during the last decade table 2 fig 6 precipitation and p et o showed both insignificantly decreasing trends during all investigated time blocks except for fall when a small positive insignificant trend was detected similarly to 1981 2020 sd and for 2001 2020 available scf showed statistically significantly decreasing trends importantly for the period 2001 2020 ro showed statistically significant decreasing trends at the annual time scale with the steepest changes occurring again in the spring months the steeper trends for 2001 2020 vs 1981 2020 are very evident in comparing the spatial trend maps cfr figs 2 and 5 also noteworthy is the change of sign of trend in p between these two investigated periods from positive to negative in general all the investigated variables suggest a shift of the entire basin towards more arid conditions characterized by more frequent drought stress this shift appears to be more pronounced for the upper subcatchments of the basin the temporal variation of additional modis based variables scf ndvi and lai available for 2001 2020 fig 6 are in line with those presented for 1981 2020 sd and ndviavhrr trends in α also depend on the land cover and studied season overall a more pronounced decreasing trend of α was observed for the urban agriculture and grassland categories and the least for the forest categories in terms of season the declining trend was most pronounced for the djf period due to the presence of snow albedo at the annual time scale is also strongly affected by winter snow cover and hence its peaks coincide with the peaks in scf notably modis based etlst and the derived r s indicate the dry years of 2003 2007 2012 2015 2017 and 2018 more clearly than the vegetation indices ndvi and lai this is partly due to increases in the vegetation indices during the off season period however it should be stressed that detection of drought based on annual data can smear our short term droughts this is e g the case in 2018 which showed strongly positive anomalies in ndvi lai and et during the spring which compensate negative summertime anomalies due to drought 3 2 correlation analysis a pairwise correlation for variables potentially related to ro was conducted for annual and sub annual time scales for both periods 1981 2020 as well as 2001 2020 for the period 1981 2020 fig 7 ro positively correlates with p p et o etwb and sd while negatively with eto and t a all the correlations are significant the only insignificant positive correlation of ro is with ndvi similar relationships were found for the growing season the correlation between ro and ndvi became significant for spring negative and summer positive months such behavior indicates that ro is reduced if spring is warmer and vegetation more developed while during the summer both ro and vegetation growth ndvi are limited by p the stronger dependence of ro on p during the summer is also evident from the strength of the correlation between these two variables similar relationships can be observed in the period 2001 2020 fig 8 although due to the shorter period of the correlation analysis they are more frequently insignificant the surface resistance representing the level of landscape water stress negatively correlated with series of variables including p ro and et in contrast it showed highly positive correlation with eto meaning that higher eto itself is often associated with higher landscape water deficit the impacts of water stress on vegetation are also reflected by the negative correlation of r s with lai and ndvi in summer for this period one can observe the above mentioned switch in the relationship between ro and the vegetation development ndvi and lai during spring and summer even more clearly likely due to the generally drier character of this period in contrast to etwb there is an insignificant relationship between etlst and ro nevertheless it is worth mentioning that this relationship is negative during spring while positive during the summer months further insights to these relationships are provided by exploring the spatial patterns of the correlations between ro and etlst fig 9a this analysis indicates that the higher elevation subcatchments in the southeast often show a significantly negative correlation between ro and etlst during the spring months in contrast during the summer months the relationship becomes positive and is significant in the lower elevation areas note that some of the subcatchments do not obey this pattern as result of water reservoirs that do not strictly follow the water management plan personal communication with the state enterprise morava river basin brno cz leading to additional challenges to provide truly unimpaired ro time series eq 1 for completeness the analyses of the correlation between etlst with p fig 9b t a fig 9c and eto fig 9d are provided this analysis explains why no correlations are found when the basin is treated as a whole in spring there is a distinct boundary between subcatchments where etlst and p are negatively correlated in higher elevation areas and positively correlated in lower elevation areas in summer the entire basin shows a positive relationship between etlst and p but only in the lower elevation areas is this correlation significant this suggests that during the summer etlst at the entire basin scale is limited by p and that this limitation is stronger in the lower elevation areas in these areas et is limited by p also during the spring while in the higher elevation areas et is limited by t a fig 9a or more generally by the available energy the boundary delimiting this contrasting behavior can be approximated by the contour line at 450 m a s l 3 3 attribution of runoff trends the partial derivatives of ro p et lst where etlst is further decomposed by the partial derivatives of the penman monteith model with varying r s were used to analyze the contributions of different drivers of ro for the period 2001 2020 at the annual time scale the significant decline in ro in higher elevation areas was primarily driven by the decline in p fig 10b but also by increases in t a fig 10e and decreases in rh fig 10f i e all negative contributions a substantial positive contribution was also due to increases in r s fig 10h which more or less compensated the negative contributions of t a and rh leading to very small and insignificant changes in etlst fig 10c the magnitude of contributions by r n g and u were in most cases negligible compared to the other drivers the spring months were characterized by the most pronounced decline in ro with significant negative trends over the major parts of the basin and especially all water source areas fig 10a the attribution analysis for the spring months again confirms the pivotal role of the decline in p fig 10b followed by decreases in rh fig 10f and increases in t a fig 10e on the negative ro trends during the spring months r s showed only small positive trends fig 10h with the result that the negative contribution of rh and t a were not compensated leading to a negative contribution of et fig 10c during the summer months the decreasing trends in ro were significantly smaller as compared to the annual or spring values fig 10a the contributions to decreasing ro were again dominated by p fig 10b t a fig 10e and rh fig 10f since r s showed strong positive trends its positive contribution fig 10h compensated the negative contributions of t a and rh leading to negative trends in et fig 10c and its positive contribution to the water balance it is interesting to note that while u showed negative trends over all time blocks its contribution to the water balance was positive in spring months but negative during the summer months fig 10g the contributions to the water balance for all analyzed time blocks and either for the entire basin or the higher or lower elevation areas threshold at 450 m a s l based on fig 9 are summarized in fig 11 it should be remembered that the contributions to ro at sub annual time scales must be treated with caution since at these time scales the varying storage term plays a significant role this is very apparent in the comparison of changes in ro and contributions to these changes by p and etlst which are mostly in balance at the annual level a perfect match cannot be achieved due to accumulation of various errors including the fact that the changes are inferred from the temporal trends while they are generally negative in spring and the summer months the positive balance is then observed in the fall months 3 4 evaporative vs dryness index budyko analysis by plotting eto p vs etlst p representing the aridity index and evaporative index respectively a budyko 1974 diagram was obtained fig 12 the long term 2001 2020 mean of eto p vs etlst p overestimated the theoretical budyko 1974 curve fig 12a the fit of the parametric curve choudhúry 1999 using the mean values weighted by the size of the subcatchment yielded a value of n 2 76 the mean and median values are generally distributed more in the area with eto p 1 suggesting a rather arid climate and low ro in the majority of the subcatchments the values representing the 25th percentile of the aridity index and with them the paired evaporative index were from 60 smaller than unity suggesting that under 5 years from the period 2001 2020 at each subcatchment note that the years differ for different parts of basin and they were 2001 2002 2004 2006 2009 2010 2013 2014 and 2020 et of a larger number of subcatchments is limited by energy and not by water when considering the minimum of the aridity index nearly all subcatchments have a value smaller than unity suggesting that there are cases when nearly the entire basin is not limited by water depending on the area it was 2001 2002 2010 or 2020 on the other hand the values representing the 75th percentile of the aridity index where from 88 cases larger than unity suggesting that under 5 years represented by 2003 2008 2011 2012 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 majority of the basin was limited by water finally by considering the maximum of aridity index all subcatchments have its value larger than unity indicating that entire basin was limited by water depending on the area it was either the 2003 2015 2017 or 2018 moreover during the dry year etlst p 1 suggests a depletion of the overall storage by et which is temporarily possible analysis of the decadal trends in eto p and etlst p over the 2001 2020 allows us to visualize the shifts in the budyko space fig 12b this analysis indicates that nearly the entire basin except for two subcatchments with water reservoirs is shifting along the trajectory of the budyko curve to the right i e increasing aridity and decreasing water ro p and towards water limitation over the entire basin the mean shift along the abscissa is 0 09 while the maximum is 0 18 per 10 years 3 5 overall water storage and climatic water deficits at the annual time scale p et lst ro of the entire basin can be interpreted as the change of the overall storage term over the longer term this change converges to zero while there are years with deficits e g the already mentioned dry years 2003 2007 2012 2015 2019 and years with surplus e g the wet years 2002 2010 or 2020 when this change of the storage term is accumulated fig 13a one can verify if the whole system is in equilibrium this should be the case at least for long time scales or shows some trends which can be real but may also point to systematic errors in any of the three variables fig 13a suggests that the entire basin is in a water balance equilibrium with insignificant declining trends notable is the dry period 2015 2019 when the cumulative changes in the storage term showed the most persistent negative anomaly fig 13a also suggests that without the wet years 2009 and in particular 2010 the trend of the overall storage would be more pronounced and the cumulative storage would likely reach more negative values however fig 13a also suggests relatively small amplitudes of the cumulative storage term this is to be expected given that the wet years characterized by a large water surplus such as 2002 and 2010 have significantly higher ro while the dry years such as 2007 or the period 2015 2019 are characterized by significant reductions of et precluding further basin desiccation such compensating mechanisms are not included in the standard climatological concept of accumulating anomalies of p fig 13b or p et o fig 13c these two terms both show much larger amplitudes worth mentioning is also the change between 2014 and 2018 2019 where in the case p et lst ro the difference was 92 mm while in the case of p the difference was 379 mm and in the case of p et o it was 545 mm choice of these variables thus leads to significantly different interpretations of the basin deficit although all have their own justification since the climatological water deficit accurately highlights shifts in climatic conditions but does not express the amount of water needed for return to the normal conditions 4 discussion this study aimed at understanding the temporal trends in a comprehensive set of hydroclimate and related variables in the thaya river basin over the 1981 2020 period and in the case of some more recent remote sensing datasets for the 2001 2020 period based on previous studies trnka et al 2015 2016 brázdil et al 2021 zahradníček et al 2021 orság et al 2022 duethmann and blöschl 2018 we expected positive trends in t a and eto yet no trends in p in line with these trends we hypothesized that positive trends in eto will lead also to positive trends in et at least in headwater catchments with higher elevation we further conjectured that the increase in et combined with stagnation of p will lead to a reduction of ro in other words we assumed that the water source areas of the basin are prevailingly limited by energy and that the positive trends in t a and eto are an opportunity for et to be increased this increase of et will have negative consequences for ro under the assumption of no trends in p the results generally confirmed the already reported trends for t a and eto and no trends in p however the original hypotheses were only partly confirmed since the expected mechanisms manifested themselves only in specific parts of the season analysis at the annual time scale for the period 1981 2020 showed an insignificant increase in etwb and an insignificant decrease in ro for the period 2001 2020 annual etwb showed a small insignificant increase while etlst decrease and annual ro over the entire basin showed statistically significant decrease of 24 80 mm yr 1 per decade note that the values of etwb at a sub annual time scale must be treated with caution and may be indicative of changes in unaccounted storage terms which preclude accurate determination of et from p and ro measurements at such short time scales the greatest contribution to these annual trends occurred due to a significant reduction of ro during the spring months a significant spring ro reduction was detected for both periods i e 1981 2020 as well as 2001 2020 this reduction was associated with a significant decline of sd during the winter accompanied by earlier disappearance of snow and also increase of ndvi and lai during the spring caused by earlier start of the vegetation growth and insignificant increase in etlst further although the trends in p as well as p et o were insignificant at the annual and seasonal levels they were both negative during the spring months and p et o showed the strongest reduction just during springs in the case of 1981 2020 with the strongest contribution by april during the 2001 2020 this reduction was even more pronounced with the strongest contribution by march closely followed by april but was lower than the summer reduction p et o the warm and dry anomalies in central europe during the spring months were pointed out also by other authors brázdil et al 2021 hanel et al 2018 jaagus et al 2022 ionita et al 2020 zahradníček et al 2021 as one of the main triggers of negative p et o anomaly is considered a multiyear recurrent high pressure system centered over the north sea and northern germany and a decline in the temperature gradient between the arctic region and the mid latitudes diverting the moisture transport from the atlantic northward ionita et al 2020 a general increase in frequency of anticyclonic circulation types and decrease in frequency of some cyclonic types during spring in central europe was also found by other authors brázdil et al 2022b hofstätter et al 2018 at the same time the warmer spring with a higher amount of r g and higher vpd or lower rh are the main precursors of higher eto and also et which is often not limited by soil water availability in this early part of the year it is worth mentioning that these were exactly the attributes of springs antecedent to the important drought events in 2003 2007 2012 and 2018 the mechanisms of drought propagation from spring to summer were extensively discussed e g by schär et al 1999 or miralles et al 2019 the correlation analysis applied in this study implies that the combination of warmer and drier springs is intensifying et in the higher elevation parts of the thaya river basin but has almost no or even negative effects on et in lower elevation areas this suggests that during the spring months the higher elevation parts of the basin are limited by energy and that for these areas the warmer springs and earlier start of the growing season significantly enhance et and likely also ecosystem productivity as evidenced by positive trends in lai and ndvi in these areas and the correlations with lai and ndvi this is however not the case for the lower elevation areas during the spring and for the entire basin during the summer when the entire basin shows strong negative correlations of t a with lai and ndvi whereas a positive correlation of p with lai and ndvi this means that in summer warmer and drier weather conditions are associated with increased drought stress it is further evident that these correlations are much stronger during the period 2001 2020 than in the longer period 1981 2020 clearly providing an evidence of more arid climate conditions during the later period the correlation of p and et during the summer is also positive however significant only in the lowlands further demonstrating that et in these parts of the basin is more limited by water availability note that the above mentioned behavior is valid primarily for rain fed areas and that alluvial areas with vegetation benefiting from access to the groundwater table in lowlands may act rather as the higher elevation areas i e the warmer springs yet not limited by water may increase et and productivity which can compensate the potential reduction due to summer droughts kowalska et al 2020 in order to disentangle the main drivers of these changes an attribution analysis was performed this analysis was based on partial derivatives of ro p et lst betts et al 2007 and the decomposition of etlst following beven 1979 although the decomposition of et can be approximated by taylor series expansion of higher orders we found that the first order is sufficiently accurate at least for the purpose of the attribution analysis at the annual time scale the contribution to negative trends in ro of the entire thaya river basin during the period 2001 2020 was mainly caused by the negative tendency in p followed by significant trends in t a and rh the contribution of these variables to negative trends in ro was partly compensated by positive trends in r s a small contribution to negative ro was also caused by increasing tendencies in r g driving r n g interestingly the significantly decreasing trend in u contributed also although very negligibly to negative trends in ro at an annual time scale and to a larger extent during the summer period although it may appear as counterintuitive since one may conjecture that lower u will translate into lower et the opposite may be the case monteith 1965 already described the complex role of u in et and introduced so called critical value of r s below which an increase of u will cause an increase of et yet above which an increase of u will cause a decrease of et in other words the critical value of r s determines whether the higher u will mean an increase of the atmospheric evaporative demand i e values below the critical value or rather increase of cooling due transport of fresh air into the boundary layer warmed by the surface with rather high bowen ratio i e values above the critical value since eto represents a hypothetical reference grass with no water limitation and has prescribed r s of 70 s m 1 allen et al 1998 the decreasing trends in u over the thaya river basin almost always contributed to the decreasing trends in eto mcvicar et al 2012 however in the case of observed etlst for the thaya river basin r s was often higher than its critical value and hence caused the negative trends in u do contribute to the increase of et due to lack of cooling and consequently to a decrease in ro this phenomenon is most pronounced in dry and warm summer months such a bidirectional role of u should be taken into account when adaptation measures aiming to reduce et by increasing landscape aerodynamic roughness are considered this identified significant negative trend of u is a subject of ongoing discussion not only in the regional zahradníček et al 2019 but also global context mcvicar et al 2012 the main causes of these negative trends are among others often explained by increasing land surface roughness instrumental issues but also mesoscale circulation changes mcvicar et al 2012 these trends in u likely caused relatively small increases in eto as compared to the pronounced and consistent trends in t a another important feature of the attribution analysis is a contribution of increasing rh on increase of et and decrease of ro by its extent the contribution of rh is similar to the contribution of t a the role of rh or vpd is relevant from the perspective of potential evaporation and the fact that numerous hydrological models are relying on potential evaporation which is not accounting for the role of air humidity e g oudin et al 2005 although rh or vpd is not independent of t a care should be taken when largely different conditions are simulated e g future climate projections the study by duethmann and blöschl 2018 reported an increasing etwb in a number of catchments in austria over the period 1977 2014 driven mainly by increasing r g t a and lengthening of the active growing season positive trend in ndvi in our study increasing etwb and ndvi in 1981 2020 was also observed with some flattening during the last two decades for the period of 2001 2020 when the etlst was available no trend in et was observed and this was mainly caused by water limitations both of the studies duethmann and blöschl 2018 and this study indicate a hiatus in et increasing in central europe during the first two decades of the 21st century driven either by increasing t a and eto or increasing t a and eto together with decreasing p our study further shows that these changes have significant impacts on ro in the thaya river basin and possibly also other central european river basins with similar aridity index this study introduces a regionally unique 20 year long dataset of the remotely sensed et based on the alexi model to study the hydrology at the level of the entire basin and individual subcatchments previous studies from this central european region used alexi based et only to a limited extent with the main focus on crop yields prediction and drought impacts evaluation anderson et al 2016 crocetti et al 2020 jurečka et al 2021 bartošová et al 2022 given the good water balance closure of p ro et lst presented above this study supports its validity for the water balance studies and unlocks new opportunities for further utilization within hydrological modeling efforts where it can provide an important constraint in the calibration validation process mendiguren et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 but also more detailed insights into studying droughts crocetti et al 2020 besides the hydrology the alexi based et can also be useful for addressing large scale processes related to precipitation recycling or water vapor mass and heat conservation of a given area within the so called complementary hypothesis bouchet 1963 brutsaert and parlange 1998 this hypothesis suggests that at large scales the sum of et o and et is conserved for a fixed available energy level over time since an increase in et should cause a decrease in eto and vice versa in the thaya river basin the computed coefficients of variation of annual etlst eto and et o et lst were 4 7 6 0 and 3 7 respectively indicating a certain amount of complementary mechanisms to be valid even at the scale of this basin these mechanisms must be taken into account when adaptation measures aiming to modulate landscape et are considered as such hypothetically efforts in reducing et by crops with lower water requirements may cause higher eto and hence lead to an originally unintended increase of et at the same time non convergence of et o et to a constant value indicates that the basin extent is far too limited to allow ignoring advection of moisture and heat and to expect a significant regional p recycling ratio i e the ratio of regionally recycled p to total p in a region in fact according to van der ent et al 2010 the regional p recycling ratio in the region of the thaya river basin is about 1 further the continental p recycling ratio of this region is about 40 meaning that this amount of p origins from land while the remaining 60 origins from the sea and the ocean van der ent et al 2010 finally the global study by van der ent and savenije 2011 suggests that the water evaporated from the czech territory is likely recycled to p some 3 000 km eastwards these findings must be taken into account when hypothetical adaptation measures strive to alter regional et e g through land use change the hydroclimate trends described in this study mirror also in notable shifts towards an increasing aridity et o p increased et p and decreased p ro within the budyko space the resulting parameter n 2 76 describing the shape of the budyko curve exceeds the original budyko predictions and ranks among the highest ones reported by choudhúry 1999 and li et al 2013 the higher values might be partly explained by different choice of the potential et formulation but in general they are suggesting an important role of vegetation in p partitioning within the thaya river basin nevertheless since fitting of this parameter on the values of et p and eto p along their trends led only to a minor increase of n we conjecture that the observed positive trends in vegetation variables ndvi and lai play much less prominent role on p partitioning than the changes of climatic variables this study provides evidence about the trends during the last 40 years characterized mainly by increasing t a and eto while stagnating p leading to regional water deficit the climate projections generally support that this direction towards aridity in the summer half year will be progressively worsening throughout the 21st century with different intensities conditioned by unknown socioeconomic pathways and emission scenarios as well by uncertainties in climate models hari et al 2020 oulehle et al 2021 trnka et al 2022b as shown the real hydrological deficits are smaller than those inferred from the climatological analysis due to several self compensating processes e g the low soil moisture limited et preventing extreme soil water deficits however it must be taken into account that the long lasting deficit periods affect not only hydrology but also ecosystem productivity biodiversity and ultimately the landscape carbon balance 5 conclusions this study combined terrestrial and remote sensing data to provide new insights into the complex interplay of climate vegetation and the hydrological cycle of the thaya river basin in central europe the overall trends were characterized by significantly increasing t a and eto along with statistically non significant trends in p and significant decreases of ro the negative trends in ro were attributed to non significant decreases in p and rh and significant increases of t a suggesting that even statistically non significant trends should be of interest since complex response variables such as et and ro are dependent on several drivers whose effects may accumulate or further interact the identified positive trends in vegetation indices represented by ndvi and lai were shown to be important features of the hydrological system potentially meaning higher vegetation water requirements however these trends have flattened during the last decade characterized by more pronounced drought stress and water limitations et in the higher elevation parts of the basin is mainly limited by energy while in the lower parts by available water nevertheless this feature is relevant only during the spring whereas during the summer months et in the entire basin is often limited by water the results of this study suggest that complex adaptation to climate change will be needed to sustain the water dependent sectors operating in the thaya river basin characterized by an increasing aridity these measures must reflect the different hydroclimate relationships across the altitudinal gradient characterized by water and energy limits that are shifting over time as well as several local

7621,study region the thaya river basin provides multiple water uses in the transboundary region of lower austria and southern moravia due to the low precipitation p to reference evapotranspiration eto ratio the thaya river basin is among the most sensitive to climate change in the region study focus the main objective is to understand the changes in the water balance variables including actual evapotranspiration et p and runoff ro and their drivers for the period 1981 2020 and 2001 2020 in the case of using remote sensing data new hydrological insights for the region the analyses confirm previously reported increasing trends in air temperature eto and no trends in p et consistently increased during spring and decreased during summer although insignificantly this change was associated with a significant increase of spring vegetation development followed by summer stagnation the spring ro shows significantly decreasing trends especially in the upland water source areas the correlation analysis reveals a different behavior along the altitude gradient with et in the uplands generally limited by available energy whilst in the lowlands by available water in spring in summer however the entire basin is often water limited with a more pronounced limitation in the lowlands complex adaptation measures reflecting the different hydroclimate relations across the altitudinal gradient are needed to sustain the water dependent sectors operating in the region facing increasing aridity graphical abstract keywords climate change evapotranspiration precipitation remote sensing runoff trend analysis water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic global climate change is characterized by rising mean annual air temperature t a and consequently an increase of potentially precipitable atmospheric water vapor clausius clapeyron equation leading to among others an acceleration of the hydrological cycle katul et al 2012 vargas godoy et al 2021 the rate of this global hydrological cycle acceleration has been reported to vary between 2 to 7 c 1 liepert and previdi 2009 wentz et al 2007 regionally however the change in climate manifests itself in numerous complex forms which can largely deviate from global values and even in the opposite direction of trends brázdil et al 2021 the consequences of climate change together with impacts of land use changes on runoff ro in europe have been studied extensively alfieri et al 2015 vormoor et al 2015 teuling et al 2019 according to mostowik et al 2019 observations suggest increases of ro in northern europe and decreases in southern europe in the last 50 years in central europe there is a clear evidence of earlier winter floods due to a changing snow regime blöschl et al 2017 langhammer and bernsteinová 2020 the czech republic being in the center of this region can be regarded as an area with transitional effects of climate change on ro with site specific phenomena previous studies suggest an increasing trend in mean annual seasonal and monthly t a zahradníček et al 2021 yet hardly any trend in precipitation totals p at any temporal scale brázdil et al 2021 since t a is tightly related to the atmospheric evaporative demand oudin et al 2005 these two trends suggest an increasing aridity and higher likelihood of drought occurrence trnka et al 2015 2016 hari et al 2020 the role of the trends in t a p and other hydroclimate variables including vegetation and especially their causal consequences on hydrology in the czech republic has been documented only to a limited extent hanel et al 2012 blahušiaková et al 2020 since an increase of t a should lead to an increase of actual evapotranspiration et up to the point when it is limited by p one might expect a notable decrease of ro and or different storage terms of the water balance the regional study from neighboring austria duethmann and blöschl 2018 suggests that in the past 40 years et has increased by 20 while p has remained relatively constant however the trends in ro are often reported to be not significant trnka et al 2022b or locally even in the opposite direction ledvinka 2015 kliment et al 2011 these trends can naturally vary over space ledvinka 2015 fiala et al 2010 e g for regions where et is prevailingly limited by energy kliment et al 2011 oulehle et al 2021 vs where it is limited by water trnka et al 2022b the thaya river basin characterized by the combined influence of lower elevations and the leeward effect of the highlands from westerly directions řehoř et al 2021 belongs to the basins with the lowest p to reference evapotranspiration eto ratio trnka et al 2022b making it potentially the most vulnerable larger basin to climate change in the czech republic currently a wide spectrum of adaptation measures is being planned or implemented to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the landscape water balance and water resources in the czech republic including the thaya river basin hlásny et al 2014 trnka et al 2022a b these adaptation measures range from purely technical e g building new water reservoirs inter basin water transfer irrigation to nature based e g river renaturalization and revitalization remediating soil proprieties changes in crop rotations or forest species composition in order to realistically assess their efficiency and interactions a holistic approach is needed allowing an accurate quantification of the basin water balance a first step in such an analysis is to exploit the available data sets of terrestrial and remote sensing observations therefore this study aims at understanding the spatiotemporal variability and relationships in the hydroclimatic and vegetation conditions of the thaya river basin over the last 40 years more specifically it examines how the climatic conditions propagate to the hydrological regime and whether the dynamics of this relationship change over time to that end in situ observations of ro and various climatological variables as well as remote sensing data describing et snow and vegetation dynamics were analyzed we hypothesize that there exists a difference in response to rising t a between the lower and higher elevation parts of the basin since et for the lower parts is mainly limited by p no trend in et is expected in contrast the higher parts are limited rather by available energy and hence we expect to observe an increasing trend in et consequently we expect decreasing trends of the overall ro driven by the most pronounced decreases in the higher basin parts besides testing these hypotheses an analytical quantitative attribution of the expected changes in ro was conducted aiming at disentangling the role of different climatic drivers in ro trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the thaya river basin drains a total area of 13 419 km2 located in the southern part of the czech republic 83 and the northern part of austria 17 the river thaya in the czech language dyje is formed by the confluence of the austrian or also called german and moravian thaya in lower austria and represents the longest tributary of the morava river danube basin the sources of the two branches are both located in the highlands at elevations of 676 m a s l at and 635 m a s l cz the main tributaries are in the moravian part of the basin and follow mainly a nw se direction the jihlava river flows through the eponymous city and the svratka together with the svitava rivers drain brno the second largest city of the czech republic the upper reaches of the river are formed on crystalline bedrocks while the lower parts consist of quaternary sediments soils follow a similar pattern and consist of predominantly cambisols in the highlands 58 and fertile chernozems in the lower reaches 20 the middle and lower reach of the thaya river is characterized by anthropogenic modifications including large reservoirs constructed for water supply or irrigation purposes the long term annual p of the higher parts of the thaya river basin exceeds 650 mm řehoř et al 2021 and the annual ro coefficient ranges from 0 2 to 0 3 with mean annual ro of 187 mm trnka et al 2022b nevertheless the lowland region with lower annual p combined with high eto results in a significantly reduced ro coefficient 0 1 0 15 because of a mean annual ro of nearly 60 mm the relatively limited water resources hardly satisfy the water demand of households industry energy and agriculture especially in dry years the total water demand reaches up to 1 3 of river streamflow as an example during the dry period 2014 2019 drinking water supplies from the vranov reservoir were threatened due to low water level and additional measures like usage restriction had to be imposed the water scarcity is partly solved by water detention in 21 surface water reservoirs located at the thaya river or tributaries the lowland characteristics together with a mild and warm climate make the agricultural landscape in the thaya river basin fertile arable lands occupy 66 while forests 28 16 coniferous 6 mixed and 6 broadleaved of the basin the coniferous forests have been facing an unprecedented bark beetle outbreak forced by high t a and a severe drought period from 2014 2019 brázdil et al 2022a this outbreak caused a significant decay of coniferous forest stands requiring a radically increased sanitary logging which by the end of 2020 represented about 30 of the total area of coniferous stands in the basin compared to 2012 2 2 in situ observations the thaya river basin excluding the confluence of the morava river was divided into 42 topographically delineated subcatchments based on the presence of discharge gauging stations with the measurement starting in or before the year 1981 these subcatchments were considered as the main spatial units to which all other variables were aggregated the area of 847 km2 in the southeast near the cities kyjov hodonín and lanžhot was not represented by any discharge measurement ungauged subcatchment and therefore was excluded from further analyses fig 1 the mean area of the subcatchments was 251 km2 with a range from 12 km2 to 1073 km2 2 2 1 meteorological variables and snow depth the daily meteorological data encompassed p totals mean t a sums of global radiation r g derived from sunshine duration mean relative humidity rh and mean wind speed u from 50 climatological and 159 precipitation stations covering the thaya river basin and close surroundings originating from the czech hydrometeorological institute cz and the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics at note that daily minimum and maximum t a were also collected and processed nevertheless these two variables were used only for intermediate calculations and are not part of any presented analyses therefore all results and presented analyses of t a in this study are strictly based on mean daily t a the daily meteorological data were quality controlled and homogenized for the period 1981 2020 applying several methods for detecting outliers and inhomogeneities štěpánek et al 2013 brázdil et al 2021 zahradníček et al 2021 and own methods for inhomogeneities corrections at daily time scale based on quantile mapping štěpánek et al 2016 squintu et al 2020 to satisfy the requirement of the continuous time series by further analyses an occasionally missing data were gap filled using a standardized procedure štěpánek et al 2013 for snow depth sd a process for data homogenization has not yet been standardized therefore only data quality control and gap filling štěpánek et al 2013 brázdil et al 2021 have been performed for sd for all available stations 184 in the thaya river basin and close surroundings to match the spatial coverage represented by the ro measurements the daily data were interpolated by regression kriging into a gridded data set with a spatial resolution of 500 m using geographical coordinates elevation and other terrain characteristics as kriging predictors štěpánek et al 2011 the spatial resolution of 500 m was deemed to be appropriate to capture the topographical complexity while keeping a reasonable computational intensity and in addition commensurate with the resolution of other used remote sensing data in the thaya river basin the average distance between two neighboring precipitation stations is less than 8 km and in the case of the variables measured at the climatological stations it is approximately 14 km for further analyses additional variables including actual vapor pressure e vapor pressure deficit vpd and eto were computed from daily inputs following the food and agriculture organization of the united nations standard methodology allen et al 1998 in brief e was computed from the saturated vapor pressure derived as an average from daily minimum and maximum t a using clausius clapeyron equation and rh while eto was computed based on the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 with strictly defined vegetation parameters albedo stomatal resistance and height and the above mentioned meteorological inputs including r g t a vpd and u allen et al 1998 all meteorological data were spatially aggregated arithmetic mean over the 42 subcatchments 2 2 2 runoff runoff was determined from discharge measurements at the outlet of each subcatchment the discharge data come from the network of automatic water gauging stations of the czech hydrometeorological institute and the hydrographic service of austria the stations are equipped with hydrostatic pressure or ultrasonic water level sensors from which the flow is calculated using calibrated rating curves the daily series were aggregated to the monthly mean observed discharge q o to enable conversion into naturalized flow values q n through the methodology developed by the ministry of agriculture of the czech republic for water balance assessments at river basin scale tureček 2002 working with national water usage database based on official monthly evidence the estimation of q n accounts for the influence of human activities including withdrawals releases and impacts of water reservoirs and reservoir management and follows as 1 q n q o q r q w δ q o where q r represents the releases to the surface water may originate from both surface and subsurface withdrawals including water transfer from another catchments or basins q w the withdrawals from the surface and subsurface waters and δ q o the changes in observed discharge due to water manipulations being positive if the outflow is greater than the inflow streamflow enhancement and negative if the outflow is smaller than the inflow reservoir water accumulation if the sum of inflow and p exceeds the sum of outflow and open water evaporation the naturalized streamflow data were obtained from the t g masaryk water research institute representing the sole authority in the czech republic in charge of quality control and release of the water management data both q r and q w originate from the official registry of the mandatory reports and δ q o from the prescribed water reservoir ruling curves and regulation plans provided by the state water management enterprise in the river morava basin brno cz the natural naturalized or unimpaired runoff depth hereinafter just runoff ro mm if not otherwise stated was then determined by dividing q n by the subcatchment area always delineated to a gauging station we opted to use the abbreviation ro instead of q to clearly distinguish runoff from streamflow in this text the monthly ro time series were also used to estimate water balance evapotranspiration etwb as et wb p c ro where p c is precipitation corrected by the snow model snowmaus trnka et al 2010 to account for the water from snowfall entering the water balance only after the snow melt 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 actual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration was determined by the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 1997 hain and anderson 2017 alexi is a diagnostic model based on time differential land surface temperature lst measurements and other primarily remote sensing inputs related to meteorological conditions and land cover properties alexi quantifies the evaporative flux and cooling required to keep the soil and vegetation at the observed lst under the known solar radiation inputs and other meteorological conditions anderson et al 2007 the core of alexi is a two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 which partitions fluxes and radiometric temperature between soil and vegetation components based on the local vegetation cover fraction apparent at the thermal sensor view angle anderson et al 2007 tseb estimates et by partitioning the energy available at the land surface i e the net radiation r n and the soil heat flux g into turbulent fluxes of sensible h and latent heat le as r n g h le all in w m 2 where le λ et with λ being the latent heat of vaporization in alexi the tseb model is coupled with a simple planetary boundary layer pbl model during the period of nearly linear morning t a as well as lst rise anderson et al 1997 through iterative coupling the tseb model diagnoses the surface energy balance which in turns drives the boundary layer growth and t a development within the pbl model thereby constraining the gradient between lst and t a at the blending height 50 m i e t a representing a mixture of landscape surfaces required by tseb the morning lst rise can be directly monitored by geostationary satellites or it can be approximated from day night lst retrievals hain and anderson 2017 solving this land surface atmosphere feedback requires the model to be run at scales commensurate with surface forcing of t a at the blending height mecikalski et al 1999 for these reasons a relatively coarse 0 05 i e 5 km lst product aggregated from the modis myd11c1 product is used for the global alexi version based on day night lst retrievals however for the landscape analysis including this hydroclimatic study finer spatial resolution is beneficial to satisfy this need a disaggregation disalexi and data fusion was applied yang et al 2017 in disalexi higher resolution remote sensing inputs of lst leaf area index lai and albedo α are used to spatially downscale regional alexi et fluxes in this study modis inputs e g mcd43a3 for α mcd15a3h and mod15a2h for lai mcd12q1 for landcover and mod11 l2 for lst were used facilitating downscaling of 5 km alexi et to a spatial resolution of 500 m the daily et values were then spatially aggregated over the 42 subcatchments for further analyses the subcatchment scale et from disalexi was also used to quantify the surface resistance r s representing a variable primarily integrating the landscape root zone water availability the surface resistance was determined from the rewritten form of the penman monteith monteith 1965 equation as 2 r s r a δ γ r n g λ et δ γ γ ρ c p γ vpd λ et where r a is the aerodynamic resistance δ is the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve with respect to t a γ is the psychrometric constant ρ is the air density and c p is the specific heat of moist air 2 3 2 albedo leaf area index and normalized difference vegetation index the modis albedo product mcd43a3 covering the period data 2001 2020 was used as an input for disalexi and as one of the variables within the time series analysis the lai m2 m 2 data covering the period 2001 2020 were obtained from the combination of 4 day and 8 day modis lai composite products mcd15a3h and mod15a2h the reason for combining these two lai products is because the mcd15a3h is preferred for disalexi due to its higher frequency of images but available only since summer 2002 therefore mod15a2h was used for the years 2001 and 2002 to provide temporally continuous time series and to minimize the noise in the original data a flexfit gao et al 2020 moving window filter approach using the polynomial fitting from nearby dates was used these data were used as an input for disalexi as well as for lai time series analyses besides modis lai a product from the copernicus global land service cgls project providing lai based on spot vgt from 2001 to 2014 and proba v from 2014 to 2020 satellite data 1 km resolution was tested normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series covering the period 1981 2020 were prepared from combination of advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data 1 km resolution and the modis ndvi product mod13a1 250 m resolution for the purpose of the time series analyses all mentioned variables were spatially aggregated arithmetic mean into 42 subcatchments 2 3 3 snow cover snow cover fraction scf was estimated from the modis terra satellite dataset hall and riggs 2021 using daily images with a spatial resolution of 500 m mod10a1 for the period 2001 2020 snow covered pixels were identified by using the normalized difference snow index hall and riggs 2011 and classified as snow if the index is larger than 0 4 tong et al 2020 the mean monthly seasonal or annual snow cover area of each subcatchment was estimated from the days when cloud coverage was smaller than 60 the snow cover fraction for those days was estimated as a ratio between the frequency of pixels classified as snow and the sum of pixel frequencies classified as snow and land 2 4 data analyses 2 4 1 temporal trends and correlation analyses to analyze the possible trends in time series of individual variables the non parametric theil sen regression was applied theil 1950 sen 1968 the related statistical significance of the trends was evaluated using the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall and gibbons 1990 these tests were applied on temporally aggregated data covering either the entire year growing season april to september or four individual seasons december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son to quantify a correlation between all variables a kendall rank correlation kendall 1938 was applied for specific analysis where variables needed to be scaled to a similar magnitude a z score transformation was applied i e deviation from the mean normalized by standard deviation in order to show the long term variation the time series were smoothed with a low pass gaussian filter applied in the frequency domain fast fourier transform while the trend analyses were conducted for both 40 and 20 year series the results from the 20 year series were interpreted with high caution due to their borderline length for a trend analysis the main justification for performing the trend analysis over the 20 year series is to utilize the remote sensing methods as a unique opportunity to gain more insights into hydroclimate processes and their temporal changes 2 4 2 attribution analysis over a sufficiently long period of time such that the storage fluctuations are negligible the overall water balance can be simplified to ro p et katul et al 2012 as a consequence the mass conservation law provides that changes in ro can be attributed directly to changes in p and et as 3 δ ro δ p δ et the changes in et are more complex and can be decomposed by applying partial derivatives of the penman monteith model an approximation using a first order taylor series expansion can be written as beven 1979 4 δ et et t a δ t a et r n g δ r n g et rh δ rh et u δ u et r s δ r s where the terms on the right hand side represent contributions of t a available energy r n g rh u and r s respectively the partial derivatives of the penman monteith can also be solved using second order or higher order taylor series expansion feng and fu 2013 chen et al 2020 however our results did not provide a clear evidence of additional benefit of the higher order expansion and hence we used the simpler and more straightforward e g not requiring the interpretation of complex interactive terms expression described in eq 4 the attribution analysis in this study was based on the application of the above mentioned expressions eqs 3 and 4 with the changes determined as the sen s slope per decade i e 10 years 2 4 3 budyko framework the budyko 1974 framework was used to analyze the long term state and potential shifts in the evaporative index et p along the aridity index eto p due to the changes in climate but also possibly other factors like vegetation cover li et al 2013 the one parameter function choudhúry 1999 5 et p 1 1 p et o n 1 n with the parameter n describing the shape of the budyko curve was fitted to the observed data the higher values of the parameter n suggest a steeper shape of the budyko curve and p partitioning favoring more et than ro the parameter n is empirically related positive correlation with vegetation cover ndvi or lai li et al 2013 and thus allows to attribute the changes in p partitioning within the budyko space to changes in climate and vegetation separately 3 results 3 1 temporal trends 3 1 1 trends over the period 1981 2020 the time series analysis of climate variables over the entire basin at the annual time scale over the period 1981 2020 revealed statistically significant increasing trends in e eto t a and vpd as well as statistically significant decreasing trends in sd and u table 1 highly significant was also an increasing trend in ndvi table 1 although statistically not significant increasing trends in annual p decreasing climatic water balance p et o and decreasing ro are also relevant for this study trends with similar significance and direction yet different slopes were detected for the above mentioned variables also during the growing season period april to september when analyzing the trends for different parts of the season consistently positive and significant trends were observed in the case of t a and ndvi and consistently negative and significant trends in the case of u the steepest decrease in ro was detected in spring when the trends were also significant for the remaining parts of the year the trends were also negative yet not statistically significant despite the significant increases in t a eto increased primarily during the summer months accompanied by the steepest and most significant increase of vpd the contribution of trends in individual components of evaporative demand and et are elaborated in section 3 3 the spatial patterns of the subset of variables listed in table 1 were highly consistent for t a eto and ndvi showing overall positive and significant trends over most of the entire basin fig 2 consistently negative trends were observed only for sd in some areas primarily those at higher elevations statistically significantly decreasing trends were also observed for ro some areas also showed statistically significantly increasing trends in etwb precipitation and p et o showed no statically significant trends except in two neighboring subcatchments in the southwest of the basin in the case of p the most significant trend table 1 and fig 3 and the most consistent low frequency temporal variation was a characteristic of t a which when smoothed by a 10 year gaussian filter showed a predominantly increasing tendency fig 3 a similar situation was also identified for ndvi while eto showed a few more pronounced decreasing periods low p and p et o were observed in 1983 at the end of the 80 s and in the first half of the 90 s and in the years 2003 2008 2011 2015 and 2017 the period 2015 2019 was identified as the period with the most negative p et o and was also characterized by a decrease in ro in contrast high p and high ro were observed in 1985 1987 1997 2002 2010 and 2020 the highest sd was recorded during the winter of 2005 2006 followed by high ro after the snow melt an additional inspection of longer term temporal trends using a 20 year running window fig 4 revealed that at the annual and growing season time scale only t a and ndvi showed consistently increasing trends the remaining variables showed periods with increasing as well as decreasing trends an obvious switch from positive to negative trends around the window ending in 2013 i e the period 1994 2013 was observed for etwb p p et o and ro a similar switch in the trend sign also occurred in the case of sd a few years earlier in terms of individual seasons noteworthy is the declining tendency in the positive trend of ndvi in summer when in 2020 i e for the period 2001 2020 the first negative trend was observed the period 2001 2020 for which more satellite data sets are available is discussed in more detail in the next section 3 1 2 the trends over the period 2001 2020 compared to 1981 2020 the period 2001 2020 was generally characterized by steeper trends for all of the investigated variables except for ndvi yet more often insignificant due the shorter length of the analyzed period table 2 for instance although t a showed positive trends across all the investigated time blocks these trends were significant only at the annual time scale and during the fall and winter months similar to the 1981 2020 interval ndvi showed increasing trends for all the seasons yet these trends were significant only at the annual time scale and for the early and late seasons growing season ndvi did not change significantly lai similarly increased during these seasons although modis lai showed a higher rate of increase than cgls the small and in some cases negative trends in lai and ndvi during the summer periods may indicate vegetation stress due to water limitations water limitations are also supported by etlst and etwb which both showed negative anomalies with the most pronounced declines in summer during the last decade table 2 fig 6 precipitation and p et o showed both insignificantly decreasing trends during all investigated time blocks except for fall when a small positive insignificant trend was detected similarly to 1981 2020 sd and for 2001 2020 available scf showed statistically significantly decreasing trends importantly for the period 2001 2020 ro showed statistically significant decreasing trends at the annual time scale with the steepest changes occurring again in the spring months the steeper trends for 2001 2020 vs 1981 2020 are very evident in comparing the spatial trend maps cfr figs 2 and 5 also noteworthy is the change of sign of trend in p between these two investigated periods from positive to negative in general all the investigated variables suggest a shift of the entire basin towards more arid conditions characterized by more frequent drought stress this shift appears to be more pronounced for the upper subcatchments of the basin the temporal variation of additional modis based variables scf ndvi and lai available for 2001 2020 fig 6 are in line with those presented for 1981 2020 sd and ndviavhrr trends in α also depend on the land cover and studied season overall a more pronounced decreasing trend of α was observed for the urban agriculture and grassland categories and the least for the forest categories in terms of season the declining trend was most pronounced for the djf period due to the presence of snow albedo at the annual time scale is also strongly affected by winter snow cover and hence its peaks coincide with the peaks in scf notably modis based etlst and the derived r s indicate the dry years of 2003 2007 2012 2015 2017 and 2018 more clearly than the vegetation indices ndvi and lai this is partly due to increases in the vegetation indices during the off season period however it should be stressed that detection of drought based on annual data can smear our short term droughts this is e g the case in 2018 which showed strongly positive anomalies in ndvi lai and et during the spring which compensate negative summertime anomalies due to drought 3 2 correlation analysis a pairwise correlation for variables potentially related to ro was conducted for annual and sub annual time scales for both periods 1981 2020 as well as 2001 2020 for the period 1981 2020 fig 7 ro positively correlates with p p et o etwb and sd while negatively with eto and t a all the correlations are significant the only insignificant positive correlation of ro is with ndvi similar relationships were found for the growing season the correlation between ro and ndvi became significant for spring negative and summer positive months such behavior indicates that ro is reduced if spring is warmer and vegetation more developed while during the summer both ro and vegetation growth ndvi are limited by p the stronger dependence of ro on p during the summer is also evident from the strength of the correlation between these two variables similar relationships can be observed in the period 2001 2020 fig 8 although due to the shorter period of the correlation analysis they are more frequently insignificant the surface resistance representing the level of landscape water stress negatively correlated with series of variables including p ro and et in contrast it showed highly positive correlation with eto meaning that higher eto itself is often associated with higher landscape water deficit the impacts of water stress on vegetation are also reflected by the negative correlation of r s with lai and ndvi in summer for this period one can observe the above mentioned switch in the relationship between ro and the vegetation development ndvi and lai during spring and summer even more clearly likely due to the generally drier character of this period in contrast to etwb there is an insignificant relationship between etlst and ro nevertheless it is worth mentioning that this relationship is negative during spring while positive during the summer months further insights to these relationships are provided by exploring the spatial patterns of the correlations between ro and etlst fig 9a this analysis indicates that the higher elevation subcatchments in the southeast often show a significantly negative correlation between ro and etlst during the spring months in contrast during the summer months the relationship becomes positive and is significant in the lower elevation areas note that some of the subcatchments do not obey this pattern as result of water reservoirs that do not strictly follow the water management plan personal communication with the state enterprise morava river basin brno cz leading to additional challenges to provide truly unimpaired ro time series eq 1 for completeness the analyses of the correlation between etlst with p fig 9b t a fig 9c and eto fig 9d are provided this analysis explains why no correlations are found when the basin is treated as a whole in spring there is a distinct boundary between subcatchments where etlst and p are negatively correlated in higher elevation areas and positively correlated in lower elevation areas in summer the entire basin shows a positive relationship between etlst and p but only in the lower elevation areas is this correlation significant this suggests that during the summer etlst at the entire basin scale is limited by p and that this limitation is stronger in the lower elevation areas in these areas et is limited by p also during the spring while in the higher elevation areas et is limited by t a fig 9a or more generally by the available energy the boundary delimiting this contrasting behavior can be approximated by the contour line at 450 m a s l 3 3 attribution of runoff trends the partial derivatives of ro p et lst where etlst is further decomposed by the partial derivatives of the penman monteith model with varying r s were used to analyze the contributions of different drivers of ro for the period 2001 2020 at the annual time scale the significant decline in ro in higher elevation areas was primarily driven by the decline in p fig 10b but also by increases in t a fig 10e and decreases in rh fig 10f i e all negative contributions a substantial positive contribution was also due to increases in r s fig 10h which more or less compensated the negative contributions of t a and rh leading to very small and insignificant changes in etlst fig 10c the magnitude of contributions by r n g and u were in most cases negligible compared to the other drivers the spring months were characterized by the most pronounced decline in ro with significant negative trends over the major parts of the basin and especially all water source areas fig 10a the attribution analysis for the spring months again confirms the pivotal role of the decline in p fig 10b followed by decreases in rh fig 10f and increases in t a fig 10e on the negative ro trends during the spring months r s showed only small positive trends fig 10h with the result that the negative contribution of rh and t a were not compensated leading to a negative contribution of et fig 10c during the summer months the decreasing trends in ro were significantly smaller as compared to the annual or spring values fig 10a the contributions to decreasing ro were again dominated by p fig 10b t a fig 10e and rh fig 10f since r s showed strong positive trends its positive contribution fig 10h compensated the negative contributions of t a and rh leading to negative trends in et fig 10c and its positive contribution to the water balance it is interesting to note that while u showed negative trends over all time blocks its contribution to the water balance was positive in spring months but negative during the summer months fig 10g the contributions to the water balance for all analyzed time blocks and either for the entire basin or the higher or lower elevation areas threshold at 450 m a s l based on fig 9 are summarized in fig 11 it should be remembered that the contributions to ro at sub annual time scales must be treated with caution since at these time scales the varying storage term plays a significant role this is very apparent in the comparison of changes in ro and contributions to these changes by p and etlst which are mostly in balance at the annual level a perfect match cannot be achieved due to accumulation of various errors including the fact that the changes are inferred from the temporal trends while they are generally negative in spring and the summer months the positive balance is then observed in the fall months 3 4 evaporative vs dryness index budyko analysis by plotting eto p vs etlst p representing the aridity index and evaporative index respectively a budyko 1974 diagram was obtained fig 12 the long term 2001 2020 mean of eto p vs etlst p overestimated the theoretical budyko 1974 curve fig 12a the fit of the parametric curve choudhúry 1999 using the mean values weighted by the size of the subcatchment yielded a value of n 2 76 the mean and median values are generally distributed more in the area with eto p 1 suggesting a rather arid climate and low ro in the majority of the subcatchments the values representing the 25th percentile of the aridity index and with them the paired evaporative index were from 60 smaller than unity suggesting that under 5 years from the period 2001 2020 at each subcatchment note that the years differ for different parts of basin and they were 2001 2002 2004 2006 2009 2010 2013 2014 and 2020 et of a larger number of subcatchments is limited by energy and not by water when considering the minimum of the aridity index nearly all subcatchments have a value smaller than unity suggesting that there are cases when nearly the entire basin is not limited by water depending on the area it was 2001 2002 2010 or 2020 on the other hand the values representing the 75th percentile of the aridity index where from 88 cases larger than unity suggesting that under 5 years represented by 2003 2008 2011 2012 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 majority of the basin was limited by water finally by considering the maximum of aridity index all subcatchments have its value larger than unity indicating that entire basin was limited by water depending on the area it was either the 2003 2015 2017 or 2018 moreover during the dry year etlst p 1 suggests a depletion of the overall storage by et which is temporarily possible analysis of the decadal trends in eto p and etlst p over the 2001 2020 allows us to visualize the shifts in the budyko space fig 12b this analysis indicates that nearly the entire basin except for two subcatchments with water reservoirs is shifting along the trajectory of the budyko curve to the right i e increasing aridity and decreasing water ro p and towards water limitation over the entire basin the mean shift along the abscissa is 0 09 while the maximum is 0 18 per 10 years 3 5 overall water storage and climatic water deficits at the annual time scale p et lst ro of the entire basin can be interpreted as the change of the overall storage term over the longer term this change converges to zero while there are years with deficits e g the already mentioned dry years 2003 2007 2012 2015 2019 and years with surplus e g the wet years 2002 2010 or 2020 when this change of the storage term is accumulated fig 13a one can verify if the whole system is in equilibrium this should be the case at least for long time scales or shows some trends which can be real but may also point to systematic errors in any of the three variables fig 13a suggests that the entire basin is in a water balance equilibrium with insignificant declining trends notable is the dry period 2015 2019 when the cumulative changes in the storage term showed the most persistent negative anomaly fig 13a also suggests that without the wet years 2009 and in particular 2010 the trend of the overall storage would be more pronounced and the cumulative storage would likely reach more negative values however fig 13a also suggests relatively small amplitudes of the cumulative storage term this is to be expected given that the wet years characterized by a large water surplus such as 2002 and 2010 have significantly higher ro while the dry years such as 2007 or the period 2015 2019 are characterized by significant reductions of et precluding further basin desiccation such compensating mechanisms are not included in the standard climatological concept of accumulating anomalies of p fig 13b or p et o fig 13c these two terms both show much larger amplitudes worth mentioning is also the change between 2014 and 2018 2019 where in the case p et lst ro the difference was 92 mm while in the case of p the difference was 379 mm and in the case of p et o it was 545 mm choice of these variables thus leads to significantly different interpretations of the basin deficit although all have their own justification since the climatological water deficit accurately highlights shifts in climatic conditions but does not express the amount of water needed for return to the normal conditions 4 discussion this study aimed at understanding the temporal trends in a comprehensive set of hydroclimate and related variables in the thaya river basin over the 1981 2020 period and in the case of some more recent remote sensing datasets for the 2001 2020 period based on previous studies trnka et al 2015 2016 brázdil et al 2021 zahradníček et al 2021 orság et al 2022 duethmann and blöschl 2018 we expected positive trends in t a and eto yet no trends in p in line with these trends we hypothesized that positive trends in eto will lead also to positive trends in et at least in headwater catchments with higher elevation we further conjectured that the increase in et combined with stagnation of p will lead to a reduction of ro in other words we assumed that the water source areas of the basin are prevailingly limited by energy and that the positive trends in t a and eto are an opportunity for et to be increased this increase of et will have negative consequences for ro under the assumption of no trends in p the results generally confirmed the already reported trends for t a and eto and no trends in p however the original hypotheses were only partly confirmed since the expected mechanisms manifested themselves only in specific parts of the season analysis at the annual time scale for the period 1981 2020 showed an insignificant increase in etwb and an insignificant decrease in ro for the period 2001 2020 annual etwb showed a small insignificant increase while etlst decrease and annual ro over the entire basin showed statistically significant decrease of 24 80 mm yr 1 per decade note that the values of etwb at a sub annual time scale must be treated with caution and may be indicative of changes in unaccounted storage terms which preclude accurate determination of et from p and ro measurements at such short time scales the greatest contribution to these annual trends occurred due to a significant reduction of ro during the spring months a significant spring ro reduction was detected for both periods i e 1981 2020 as well as 2001 2020 this reduction was associated with a significant decline of sd during the winter accompanied by earlier disappearance of snow and also increase of ndvi and lai during the spring caused by earlier start of the vegetation growth and insignificant increase in etlst further although the trends in p as well as p et o were insignificant at the annual and seasonal levels they were both negative during the spring months and p et o showed the strongest reduction just during springs in the case of 1981 2020 with the strongest contribution by april during the 2001 2020 this reduction was even more pronounced with the strongest contribution by march closely followed by april but was lower than the summer reduction p et o the warm and dry anomalies in central europe during the spring months were pointed out also by other authors brázdil et al 2021 hanel et al 2018 jaagus et al 2022 ionita et al 2020 zahradníček et al 2021 as one of the main triggers of negative p et o anomaly is considered a multiyear recurrent high pressure system centered over the north sea and northern germany and a decline in the temperature gradient between the arctic region and the mid latitudes diverting the moisture transport from the atlantic northward ionita et al 2020 a general increase in frequency of anticyclonic circulation types and decrease in frequency of some cyclonic types during spring in central europe was also found by other authors brázdil et al 2022b hofstätter et al 2018 at the same time the warmer spring with a higher amount of r g and higher vpd or lower rh are the main precursors of higher eto and also et which is often not limited by soil water availability in this early part of the year it is worth mentioning that these were exactly the attributes of springs antecedent to the important drought events in 2003 2007 2012 and 2018 the mechanisms of drought propagation from spring to summer were extensively discussed e g by schär et al 1999 or miralles et al 2019 the correlation analysis applied in this study implies that the combination of warmer and drier springs is intensifying et in the higher elevation parts of the thaya river basin but has almost no or even negative effects on et in lower elevation areas this suggests that during the spring months the higher elevation parts of the basin are limited by energy and that for these areas the warmer springs and earlier start of the growing season significantly enhance et and likely also ecosystem productivity as evidenced by positive trends in lai and ndvi in these areas and the correlations with lai and ndvi this is however not the case for the lower elevation areas during the spring and for the entire basin during the summer when the entire basin shows strong negative correlations of t a with lai and ndvi whereas a positive correlation of p with lai and ndvi this means that in summer warmer and drier weather conditions are associated with increased drought stress it is further evident that these correlations are much stronger during the period 2001 2020 than in the longer period 1981 2020 clearly providing an evidence of more arid climate conditions during the later period the correlation of p and et during the summer is also positive however significant only in the lowlands further demonstrating that et in these parts of the basin is more limited by water availability note that the above mentioned behavior is valid primarily for rain fed areas and that alluvial areas with vegetation benefiting from access to the groundwater table in lowlands may act rather as the higher elevation areas i e the warmer springs yet not limited by water may increase et and productivity which can compensate the potential reduction due to summer droughts kowalska et al 2020 in order to disentangle the main drivers of these changes an attribution analysis was performed this analysis was based on partial derivatives of ro p et lst betts et al 2007 and the decomposition of etlst following beven 1979 although the decomposition of et can be approximated by taylor series expansion of higher orders we found that the first order is sufficiently accurate at least for the purpose of the attribution analysis at the annual time scale the contribution to negative trends in ro of the entire thaya river basin during the period 2001 2020 was mainly caused by the negative tendency in p followed by significant trends in t a and rh the contribution of these variables to negative trends in ro was partly compensated by positive trends in r s a small contribution to negative ro was also caused by increasing tendencies in r g driving r n g interestingly the significantly decreasing trend in u contributed also although very negligibly to negative trends in ro at an annual time scale and to a larger extent during the summer period although it may appear as counterintuitive since one may conjecture that lower u will translate into lower et the opposite may be the case monteith 1965 already described the complex role of u in et and introduced so called critical value of r s below which an increase of u will cause an increase of et yet above which an increase of u will cause a decrease of et in other words the critical value of r s determines whether the higher u will mean an increase of the atmospheric evaporative demand i e values below the critical value or rather increase of cooling due transport of fresh air into the boundary layer warmed by the surface with rather high bowen ratio i e values above the critical value since eto represents a hypothetical reference grass with no water limitation and has prescribed r s of 70 s m 1 allen et al 1998 the decreasing trends in u over the thaya river basin almost always contributed to the decreasing trends in eto mcvicar et al 2012 however in the case of observed etlst for the thaya river basin r s was often higher than its critical value and hence caused the negative trends in u do contribute to the increase of et due to lack of cooling and consequently to a decrease in ro this phenomenon is most pronounced in dry and warm summer months such a bidirectional role of u should be taken into account when adaptation measures aiming to reduce et by increasing landscape aerodynamic roughness are considered this identified significant negative trend of u is a subject of ongoing discussion not only in the regional zahradníček et al 2019 but also global context mcvicar et al 2012 the main causes of these negative trends are among others often explained by increasing land surface roughness instrumental issues but also mesoscale circulation changes mcvicar et al 2012 these trends in u likely caused relatively small increases in eto as compared to the pronounced and consistent trends in t a another important feature of the attribution analysis is a contribution of increasing rh on increase of et and decrease of ro by its extent the contribution of rh is similar to the contribution of t a the role of rh or vpd is relevant from the perspective of potential evaporation and the fact that numerous hydrological models are relying on potential evaporation which is not accounting for the role of air humidity e g oudin et al 2005 although rh or vpd is not independent of t a care should be taken when largely different conditions are simulated e g future climate projections the study by duethmann and blöschl 2018 reported an increasing etwb in a number of catchments in austria over the period 1977 2014 driven mainly by increasing r g t a and lengthening of the active growing season positive trend in ndvi in our study increasing etwb and ndvi in 1981 2020 was also observed with some flattening during the last two decades for the period of 2001 2020 when the etlst was available no trend in et was observed and this was mainly caused by water limitations both of the studies duethmann and blöschl 2018 and this study indicate a hiatus in et increasing in central europe during the first two decades of the 21st century driven either by increasing t a and eto or increasing t a and eto together with decreasing p our study further shows that these changes have significant impacts on ro in the thaya river basin and possibly also other central european river basins with similar aridity index this study introduces a regionally unique 20 year long dataset of the remotely sensed et based on the alexi model to study the hydrology at the level of the entire basin and individual subcatchments previous studies from this central european region used alexi based et only to a limited extent with the main focus on crop yields prediction and drought impacts evaluation anderson et al 2016 crocetti et al 2020 jurečka et al 2021 bartošová et al 2022 given the good water balance closure of p ro et lst presented above this study supports its validity for the water balance studies and unlocks new opportunities for further utilization within hydrological modeling efforts where it can provide an important constraint in the calibration validation process mendiguren et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 but also more detailed insights into studying droughts crocetti et al 2020 besides the hydrology the alexi based et can also be useful for addressing large scale processes related to precipitation recycling or water vapor mass and heat conservation of a given area within the so called complementary hypothesis bouchet 1963 brutsaert and parlange 1998 this hypothesis suggests that at large scales the sum of et o and et is conserved for a fixed available energy level over time since an increase in et should cause a decrease in eto and vice versa in the thaya river basin the computed coefficients of variation of annual etlst eto and et o et lst were 4 7 6 0 and 3 7 respectively indicating a certain amount of complementary mechanisms to be valid even at the scale of this basin these mechanisms must be taken into account when adaptation measures aiming to modulate landscape et are considered as such hypothetically efforts in reducing et by crops with lower water requirements may cause higher eto and hence lead to an originally unintended increase of et at the same time non convergence of et o et to a constant value indicates that the basin extent is far too limited to allow ignoring advection of moisture and heat and to expect a significant regional p recycling ratio i e the ratio of regionally recycled p to total p in a region in fact according to van der ent et al 2010 the regional p recycling ratio in the region of the thaya river basin is about 1 further the continental p recycling ratio of this region is about 40 meaning that this amount of p origins from land while the remaining 60 origins from the sea and the ocean van der ent et al 2010 finally the global study by van der ent and savenije 2011 suggests that the water evaporated from the czech territory is likely recycled to p some 3 000 km eastwards these findings must be taken into account when hypothetical adaptation measures strive to alter regional et e g through land use change the hydroclimate trends described in this study mirror also in notable shifts towards an increasing aridity et o p increased et p and decreased p ro within the budyko space the resulting parameter n 2 76 describing the shape of the budyko curve exceeds the original budyko predictions and ranks among the highest ones reported by choudhúry 1999 and li et al 2013 the higher values might be partly explained by different choice of the potential et formulation but in general they are suggesting an important role of vegetation in p partitioning within the thaya river basin nevertheless since fitting of this parameter on the values of et p and eto p along their trends led only to a minor increase of n we conjecture that the observed positive trends in vegetation variables ndvi and lai play much less prominent role on p partitioning than the changes of climatic variables this study provides evidence about the trends during the last 40 years characterized mainly by increasing t a and eto while stagnating p leading to regional water deficit the climate projections generally support that this direction towards aridity in the summer half year will be progressively worsening throughout the 21st century with different intensities conditioned by unknown socioeconomic pathways and emission scenarios as well by uncertainties in climate models hari et al 2020 oulehle et al 2021 trnka et al 2022b as shown the real hydrological deficits are smaller than those inferred from the climatological analysis due to several self compensating processes e g the low soil moisture limited et preventing extreme soil water deficits however it must be taken into account that the long lasting deficit periods affect not only hydrology but also ecosystem productivity biodiversity and ultimately the landscape carbon balance 5 conclusions this study combined terrestrial and remote sensing data to provide new insights into the complex interplay of climate vegetation and the hydrological cycle of the thaya river basin in central europe the overall trends were characterized by significantly increasing t a and eto along with statistically non significant trends in p and significant decreases of ro the negative trends in ro were attributed to non significant decreases in p and rh and significant increases of t a suggesting that even statistically non significant trends should be of interest since complex response variables such as et and ro are dependent on several drivers whose effects may accumulate or further interact the identified positive trends in vegetation indices represented by ndvi and lai were shown to be important features of the hydrological system potentially meaning higher vegetation water requirements however these trends have flattened during the last decade characterized by more pronounced drought stress and water limitations et in the higher elevation parts of the basin is mainly limited by energy while in the lower parts by available water nevertheless this feature is relevant only during the spring whereas during the summer months et in the entire basin is often limited by water the results of this study suggest that complex adaptation to climate change will be needed to sustain the water dependent sectors operating in the thaya river basin characterized by an increasing aridity these measures must reflect the different hydroclimate relationships across the altitudinal gradient characterized by water and energy limits that are shifting over time as well as several local

7622,study region nenjiang river basin nrb northeast china study focus water safety management and sustainable development planning increasingly seek to incorporate the impact of reservoirs on downstream floods and droughts while the effectiveness of reservoir operation in regulating flood and drought risks under climate change has not been assessed extensively we focus on discerning whether and to what extent reservoirs can mitigate the risk of hydrologic extremes from the perspective of historical and future climate change new hydrological insight for the region we found that coupling reservoir operations into basin hydrological simulation can efficiently improve model capacity to capture both flood and hydrological drought characteristics the nierji reservoir contributed largely to reducing historical flood and drought risks in the nrb however the risk of floods and hydrological droughts will increase under future climate change and reservoir operations cannot completely eliminate the increasing risks of future floods and hydrological droughts the annual probability of flooding under different future scenarios will exceed 48 much higher than the 22 2 for the historical period the frequency of droughts is anticipated to increase by 139 20 under the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 370 scenario to mitigate the increase of flood and drought risks caused by future climate change it is necessary to further optimize reservoir scheduling principles thereby improving the basin s resilience to hydrological extremes graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrologic projection floods and droughts reservoir operations nenjiang river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods and droughts are global issues and the world s most devastating and urgent natural disasters with serious social ecological and economic impacts correa et al 2017 bessah et al 2020 in 1995 2015 floods and droughts worldwide were estimated to have affected about 2 3 billion and about 1 1 billion people respectively pearson and pelling 2015 furthermore they have caused more severe negative impacts over the past century due to climate change and intense human activities such impacts will likely increase further in the future ward et al 2020 williams et al 2020 meanwhile the magnitude duration and frequency of droughts are likely to increase leng et al 2015 gupta and jain 2018 especially the probability of flash droughts and floods is rising rahmani et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 reservoirs can regulate flow regimes by redistributing the spatiotemporal changes of river flow lópez moreno et al 2009 particularly mitigating hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts guo et al 2019 ding et al 2015 specifically the reservoir can reduce flood risks by storing extensive water during flood events and postponing the time of flood peaks which is conducive to downstream flood management and decision making brunner 2021a in addition the water storage in a reservoir can largely support low flow during the drought period thus alleviating runoff drought lazin et al 2023 raczyński 2020 for example the construction of the three gorges reservoir has increased the relative humidity and alleviated agricultural drought downstream of the yangtze river china li et al 2021 wang et al 2017 found that reservoir regulation can reduce the drought affected area by 10 20 in a normal year considerably reducing the impact of short term drought wu et al 2017 reported that the operation of shanmei reservoir has significantly reduced the duration and magnitude of hydrological drought downstream compared with the natural influence period these studies comprehensively demonstrated that reservoir operation contributes largely to enhancing basin resilience to drought risks zhu et al 2022 jing et al 2022 xiong et al 2020 however certain studies have proven that reservoirs can exacerbate drought downstream to some extent al faraj and scholz 2014 xing et al 2021 di baldassarre et al 2018 found that over reliance on reservoirs will increase the demand for water supply and lead to potential drought damage even under certain conditions the low flow water level at the same discharge can decrease after reservoir operation zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 lu and chua 2021 therefore hydrological droughts may be underestimated and management decisions and measures will not effectively address drought risks leading to more severe droughts xu et al 2022 however how effective the regulation is and whether it has negative effects remain largely unexplored there are generally two research lines to explore the regulation capacity of reservoirs for floods and droughts based on model calculations and field measurements scholars use hydrological models combined with optimization algorithms to obtain reservoir outlet and downstream flows and verify the simulation results with the actually observed flows brunner 2021b yuan et al 2022 xue et al 2022 the pairs simulation i e the runoff simulation in the absence and presence of reservoir operation is often used to quantify the effect of reservoirs on flood and drought events previous studies found that reservoirs can significantly regulate downstream runoff and reduce upstream annual runoff yun et al 2020b maza et al 2020 naz et al 2018 larabi et al 2022 in addition some scholars have continued to optimize the ability of reservoirs to mediate floods and droughts under the influence of climate change by improving the operating rules of reservoirs seifollahi aghmiuni and bozorg haddad 2019 paliwal et al 2020 there are also studies on reservoirs based on models that allow specific assumptions to be made about water supply and demand flow regulation and hydropower generation yassin et al 2019 furthermore studies based on observations only mostly use comparisons between upstream and downstream of reservoirs rangecroft et al 2019 or use comparisons before and after reservoir construction to evaluate the ability of reservoirs to regulate flood and drought risks van loon et al 2019 long et al 2019 a comparative analysis of the reservoir before and after construction revealed that the reservoir construction would have significant temporal differences and flow differences in the runoff characteristics of the sub basin xu et al 2020 as well as the potential for adverse effects leading to a decrease in the 1 day minimum flow and disrupting the ecological balance ali et al 2019 however such studies have primarily focused on evaluating the utility of reservoirs for floods and hydrologic droughts during the historical period while less research has been conducted on the capability of reservoirs to cope with hydrological risks under future climate change whether and to what extent reservoirs can mitigate the risk of hydrologic extremes from the perspective of historical and future climate change requires further systematic research in this paper a hydrological simulation coupled with reservoir operation for drought and flood prone nengjiang river basin in northeast china was conducted to achieve the above aims this paper aims to address a central question to what extent can reservoirs mitigate floods and droughts under climate change specifically this study aims to analyze i whether a hydrological model with coupled reservoir operations can better simulate basin hydrological processes ii how can the estimated future flood and drought risks be changed by considering the effects of reservoirs we address these questions by a comparing model performance with and without reservoirs in terms of runoff processes as well as flood and drought characteristics b predicting flood and drought risks based on their characteristic indicators with consideration of reservoir operation and c discussing our findings and implications for actual flood and drought risk management our framework and results are expected to bring new insights into dam based floods and droughts mitigation and provide a basis for better decision making to curb the impacts of unprecedented and increasingly severe future extreme conditions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the nenjiang river basin nrb is located in northeast china and its downstream songnen plain is an important national commercial grain base for china the main stream is 1370 km long with a basin area of 290 000 km2 feng et al 2013 li et al 2014 the source of water vapor in the nrb is mainly from the pacific ocean dong and zhang 2013 during the summer season the warm and humid air masses on the ocean are transmitted to the north by the pacific monsoon with more abundant water vapor and higher temperatures the maximum annual precipitation in the basin is 937 4 mm the minimum annual precipitation is 152 5 mm and summer precipitation accounts for about 82 of the annual precipitation wu et al 2016 li et al 2019a the average annual temperature of the nrb ranges from 2 to 4 the historical minimum temperature was 39 5 and the maximum low temperature was 40 1 zheng et al 2019 the average multi year runoff in the basin is 623 0 m3s 1 from 1972 to 2020 with a total natural annual runoff of 196 6 108 m3 wu et al 2022 the runoff varies widely within and between years with a minimum flow of 59 6 m3s 1 during the dry period from december to january each year and a flat period from april to june and october with an average monthly flow variation of 223 3 694 9 m3s 1 july to september is the period of abundant water with an average monthly flow variation of 1210 1 2126 7 m3s 1 which is prone to flooding according to statistics in the past 30 years there have been two major floods in the neng river basin a 100 year flood occurred in 1998 with a peak flow of 16 100 m3s 1 and an average annual runoff of 1953 1 m3s 1 in 2013 a 50 year flood occurred in the nrb with a maximum inlet flow of 9440 m3s 1 in a single day in the nierji reservoir during the heavy rainfall in the flood season summer and autumn the hills produce more flow nierji reservoir is the only dam located at the main stream of the nenjiang river which is the last gorge of the river flowing from the greater hinggan mountains and the small hinggan mountains to the songnun plain the reservoir began construction in 2001 and began operation in 2006 the reservoir site controls 66 400 km2 of basin area accounting for 24 of the nrb the reservoir capacity is 83 74 billion m3 2 2 datasets and processing the datasets used in this study include observed

collected reservoir operation data including dead level flood limit level initial reservoir capacity first ambient flow inflow outflow and other data for estimating reservoir outflow in this study we projected future floods and hydrological droughts using five general circulation models gcms projections under three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps from the latest cmip6 cmip6 presents new

development characteristics and influencing factors such as population growth economic development technological progress environmental conditions equity principles government management and globalization as well as a specific description of the degree speed and direction of social development the model used in this paper consists of the following three combinations of scenarios ssp126

flood and drought conditions which had been used to simulate and project river flows under climate change and anthropogenic activities fortin et al 2001a fossey et al 2015 foulon et al 2018 physitel is a gis based pre processing platform for preparing model input data digital elevation models vector river networks and lake water bodies and raster based maps of land use and soil matrix distribution hydrotel divides the basin into more detailed hydrologic response units or relatively homogeneous hydrologic units rhhus fossey and rousseau 2016 blanchette et al 2019 hydrotel is built around seven computational modules performing various tasks and calculations in successive steps i e i meteorological data interpolation ii accumulation and melt of snowpack iii potential evapotranspiration calculation iv vertical water budget v terrestrial flow generation vi river flow routing and vii wetlands water budget please refer to fortin et al 2001b turcotte et al 2003 2007 and fossey et al 2015 for more details about hydrotel 3 1 2 model calibration we calibrated the hydrotel model for coupling reservoirs using eight years 2010 10 01 2018 09 30 of daily flow observations one year warming up 2010 10 01 2011 09 30 and seven years of calibration 2011 10 01 2018 09 30 foulon and rousseau 2018 performed a global sensitivity analysis of the model using the safe toolbox quantifying the sensitivity of the model to 18 key parameters the 13 most sensitive parameters were selected for calibration and validation of the hydrotel model the dynamic dimensional search algorithm developed by thorslund et al 2017 was later used to optimize the 13 most sensitive parameters see supplement table s1 the method is based on the maximization of the kling gupta efficiency kge a total of ten validation sets of 250 trials each were performed with the best parameter results from the ten experiments finally selected as the best rate determining parameters of the model the calibration performance was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and percent deviation pbias as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 to evaluate the performance of calibrated hydrotel in the nrb 3 2 reservoir operation simulation 3 2 1 reservoir operation scheme most reservoirs provide various functions such as water supply flood control and power generation different reservoir dispatch rules vary widely for different regions and different hydrometeorological conditions reservoir regulation schemes must be determined to simulate the effect of reservoirs on channel runoff generally the water released from a reservoir depends on several factors such as water demand downstream flow and current storage zhao et al 2011 in this study the operating design curve of reservoir operation was obtained by analyzing the flow data of the reservoir while simulating the operation of the nierji reservoir using the ressimopt matlab software package developed by dobson et al 2019 ressimopt matlab contains three algorithms for reservoir simulation the first algorithm considers a case when we want to always release a constant amount over the simulation period this constant amount is the target release that would cover all downstream demand for water for instance for domestic use and or irrigation the second consider a case when we still want to release the target demand but we would also like to 1 apply some hedging that is an intentional reduction of the release even if it would still be feasible to release the target demand aimed at saving more water and thus facing smaller deficits at later time and 2 attenuate downstream peak flows for flood control purpose the third algorithm which was used in this study dynamizes the operation rules a dynamic operation schemes was used in this study to achieve the simulation specifically following dobson et al 2019 and according to actual hydrological conditions we defined two seasons the wet season from june to september when the risk of flooding is higher and we wanted to release the target demand and provide some storage space for flood control and the dry season when the risk of flooding is low and the main objective is to sustain ecological baseflows the required input data for the algorithm include reservoir inflow q in m3 s minimum ambient flow e env m3 s initial storage s o m3 minimum s min and maximum s max storage m3 estimated evaporation loss e vap mm released discharge q out m3 s and simulation time step day based on the required data we performed reservoir simulation by implementing the mass balance equation at each simulation time step t 2 s t 1 s t q i n t e v a p t q o u t t o r s t q i n t e min t e v a p t 0 s t s max 0 r t min s t q i n t e min t e v a p t q max where s t is the reservoir storage at time t s t and q out are constrained by the design specifications and operation rules of a reservoir specifically s t cannot exceed the reservoir capacity s max while q out m3 s is constrained by the operation schemes and capacity of the turbines q max m3 s the excess water if any is spilled 3 q s p i l l t max s t q i n t e v a p t q o u t t based on this the dynamic q out can be represented using the eqs 2 and 3 3 2 2 incorporation of reservoirs into hydrotel in this study the nrb was divided into 1551 river sections and 3686 hydrological response units rhhus first the specific location of the nierji reservoir was determined in the hydrotel model after comparing with the actual project the reservoir was finally located between river sections 428 and 449 then the daily flow in the upper basin of river section 428 was simulated for the set time and river section 449 was selected as the data outlet i e the reservoir outlet the reservoir outflow was then calculated based on the simulated inflow and reservoir operation rules using the ressimopt matlab software package the reservoir outlet outflow can be used as the inflow into the downstream river section furthermore flow simulations of the downstream reservoir were carried out to further analyze the downstream flood and drought risks based on this framework the incorporation of reservoirs into the hydrotel model could be achieved 3 3 flood event determination and characteristics identification screening flood and drought events is challenging to infer extremes in complex hydrometeorological systems due to the sparsity of events and small sample sizes tabari 2019 for flood events extreme events are usually selected using extreme value theory evt coles et al 2001 evt consists of two basic methods katz et al 2002 the traditional method called block maxima bm and the peak over threshold pot method bm is used by selecting the maximum value in each year s data with the number of events equal to the number of years however bm cannot consider the characteristics of the high and low water years and tends to define the smaller flows in the low water years as a single flood event thus also ignoring the flood events that take second place in the high flow years in this regard the bm model can easily lead to information loss especially when the data records are short tabari 2021 in recent studies pot has become a preferential method for flood event determination and characteristics identification the pot method provides a larger sample size for a more accurate approximation of the distribution parameters than the bm method of selecting a maximum event per year lang et al 1999 it also works well in the case of asymmetric distribution tails mcneil and frey 2000 the pot model considers exceeding the generalized pareto distribution sample to make the independence assumption of the extracted peaks more acceptable the decluttering method proposed by liang et al lang et al 1999 was used this method verifies that all extracted peaks obey the following two conditions on arrival time r and the minimal intermediate flow rate x min 4 r 5 log a 1 609 2 a n d x min 0 75 min x i x j where x i and x j represent sequential peaks of daily river discharge m3s 1 and a is the drainage area of the basin km2 the first condition ensures that two consecutive peaks are separated by a sufficient period r in days that depends on drainage area a the second condition ensures that intermediate flows x min between two peaks x i and x j reach at least a level as low as 75 of the lowest peak the lowest one is discarded if two peaks do not meet these conditions in this study flood events at dalai and fulaerji stations in the historical period 2006 2018 were screened respectively using the pot method and each event consisted of three main basic flood characteristics peak flow flood volume and flood duration the annual maximum peak flow for the past years 1983 2018 was used as input data to obtain the frequency accumulation curves using the log pearson3 calculation method to obtain the recurrence period flow for different years the pot threshold selected for this study is a 2 year flood event this threshold value can exclude too small flood flows and retain most large flood events 3 4 determination of hydrological drought events and characteristics identification hydrologic drought is a water shortage in the hydrologic system usually manifested as abnormally low river flow van loon 2015 the run theory has been widely applied to extract drought features guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in this paper the standardized flow index ssi based on the theory of spi calculation is used to represent the hydrological drought index in previous studies some scholars used ssi with a multi month time scale 3 6 12 months etc to extract drought events zhou et al 2020 wu et al 2021 alternatively a one month ssi was used and then a fixed time interval e g 6 months was set to remove droughts smaller than that time interval zhou et al 2021 the former drought events screened using multiple time scales generally had longer duration and higher severity causing serious deviations in the duration of droughts and overlapping information the latter overly straightforward selection condition would eliminate some of the apparent droughts or include the insignificant ones depending on the selection of the time threshold zhou et al 2021 5 s s i s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 where c 0 2

probability of the precipitation distribution associated with the gamma function 10 w s 1 n l 1 n 1 l 0 35 n s x l s 0 1 2 where w s is the probability weight matrix l is the number of runoff sequences x in ascending order in this study hydrological drought events were extracted based on thresholds the results are shown in table 1 we merged adjacent hydrological drought events a the interval between adjacent drought events did not exceed t c t c is the time criterion and t c 2 was taken in this study following guo et al 2020 b the ratio of the area above the threshold to the area below the threshold in the previous hydrological drought event was less than ρ c ρ c is the standard value for severity assessment after merging small hydrological drought events with short duration and low severity need to be further excluded r d and r s represent the mean hydrological drought duration d ave and percentage of hydrological drought severity s ave respectively if the duration of a hydrological drought event is less than r d d ave or the severity is less than r s s ave the hydrological drought event should be eliminated in general r d and r s are the same therefore r d r s r ds was used in this study the specific process of hydrological drought event pooling and exclusion can be found in the study of guo et al guo et al 2020 then sensitivity analysis was used to determine the key values ρ c and r ds used for the convergence and elimination of different subregions according to the ratio of hydrological drought event characteristics i e number of drought events drought duration severity and intensity before and after convergence and elimination the selected values of ρ c and r ds were those when the rate of change of the ratio was significantly lower or even zero for the first time guo et al 2020 fig 2 shows the sensitivity results of ρ c and r ds as an example of historical hydrological drought with a reservoir and the relevant results for other scenarios are shown in figs s1 s4 in fig 2 the two rising curves represent the duration and severity of drought events respectively and it is generally believed that the longer the drought duration the more severe the drought and the two are positively correlated the descending curves represent the frequency of drought events and all drought events are independent when ρ c or r ds is close to 0 value as the coefficient increases drought events of short duration and low severity will be combined resulting in a decrease in total drought events and an increase in duration and severity since droughts occur at discrete times the inflection point indicates that droughts within a certain range are combined when ρ c or r ds exceeds a certain threshold ssi values were calculated for the dalai and fulaerji stations on a one month time scale the ssi calculations were used to characterize hydrological drought based on negative values below the threshold hydrological drought characteristics mainly include duration severity and intensity where severity is the cumulative value of ssi below the threshold and intensity is the severity divided by duration in this study ssi was calculated on the time scale of 1983 2018 in order to compare and analyze the effect of reservoirs on hydrological drought only the results of ssi values from 2006 to 2018 were presented the runoff deficit is represented by the red area and divided into different classes according to the extent table 1 to define each hydrological drought category in this analysis a threshold value of 0 5 was used to determine the occurrence of hydrological drought the hydrological drought events and their characteristics at dalai and fulaerji stations were identified after determining the corresponding thresholds using run theory and the hydrological drought event screening method proposed by zhou et al 2021 3 5 research approach to reservoir regulation of floods and hydrological droughts the first step is to compare and analyze the role of runoff regulation with without reservoirs in the historical period we used the model to simulate the operation results under the condition without a reservoir and compare the analysis with the observed data when there is a reservoir to explore the characteristics of downstream flood and hydrological drought changes under the condition with without a reservoir thereby we quantitatively evaluated the reduction effect of reservoirs on floods and hydrological droughts in the historical period furthermore to predict whether the nierji reservoir can efficiently mitigate flood risks under future climate change in the nrb the calibrated hydrological model coupled with reservoir operations has been conducted to simulate future streamflow and project the characteristics of future floods peak flow flood volume and duration at the dalai and fulaerji stations the ensemble means of the bias corrected cmip6 forcing scenarios ssp126 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios were used to drive the hydrological model the flood characteristic indices were extracted and performed a comparative analysis of their temporal evolution in the near future 2026 2050 mid century 2051 2075 and end of the century 2076 2100 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation five goodness of fit indices were used to verify the reasonableness of the calibrated model collectively the simulation results with coupled reservoirs were better than those without reservoirs in all aspects fig 3 specifically the simulation results for the tongmeng fulaerji and dalai stations exceeded 0 78 for the kge with reservoirs while the results without reservoirs were below 0 57 in addition the simulation results for the coupled reservoirs showed some improvements in other indices at the three stations exhibiting a 20 0 and 124 1 increase in cc and nse respectively and a 73 0 and a 70 6 decrease in rmse and pbias respectively the simulated daily streamflow for the coupled reservoirs meets the acceptable criteria proposed by moriasi et al moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 i e nse 0 5 and pbias 17 furthermore coupled reservoirs can improve the model performance to a greater extent in daily runoff simulations and bring the simulation results closer to reality to further understand whether the simulation capability of the model is effectively improved after coupling reservoir regulation we compared the simulation and observation at three hydrological stations including their daily process lines and flow duration curves figs 4 and 5 for the three hydrological stations tongmeng fulaerji and dalai the daily flow duration curves under the reservoir scenario agreed with the observations however the simulation without a reservoir overestimated high flows to some extent especially during flood periods e g 2018 while underestimated streamflow during low flow periods at the tongmeng fulaerji and dalai stations figs 4 and 5 these results indicate that the absence of reservoirs can overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows fig 5 furthermore this simulation error becomes increasingly evident as the runoff moves downstream such results further suggest that the inclusion of reservoirs can greatly improve the accuracy of the model to reproduce basic hydrologic features and capture extreme hydrologic conditions 4 2 impacts of the reservoir on historical flood risks to assess the role of reservoirs in regulating flood risks the annual flood flow variation characteristics with without reservoirs in the historical period 2006 2018 were compared it was found that the difference in runoff volume between tongmeng station and fulaerji station was not significant due to their close distance and the small amount of runoff confluence between them to avoid duplication of discussions the results of the subsequent study are therefore discussed only for the fulaerji and dalai stations fig 6a shows that reservoirs generally exhibit a reduction in flood flow with a large difference in the degree of reduction in different years reservoir reductions to flood peaks were the greatest in 2017 and 2018 but the greatest percentage reduction in reservoir reductions to flood peaks occurred in 2017 with reductions of more than 75 and percentage reductions were generally around 50 fig 6c and d secondly the reservoir reduced the 20 year floods of 2013 and 2018 10 year and 5 year floods respectively which largely alleviated the flood risk in the nrb the annual peak flood flow was mostly concentrated below 2000 m3s 1 and the average multi year flood flow was 2221 0 m3s 1 under reservoir presence fig 6b in the absence of the reservoir the average multi year flood flow is 4421 1 m3s 1 which was 99 1 higher than that in the presence of reservoir the flood flow at the dalai hydrological station exceeded 8000 m3s 1 only once with consideration of the reservoir while the flood flow without the reservoir exceeded 10 000 m3s 1 two times therefore the nierji reservoir considerably contributes to decreasing download extreme flood risks in the nrb for the fulaerji station the years with higher flood reduction intensity were 2018 and 2012 with flood reduction of 5750 0 m3s 1 and 2914 9 m3s 1 respectively which was slightly different from the dalai station fig 7a furthermore due to the influence of reservoir storage the intensity of flooding in all years was less than one in five years except for the occurrence of a 20 year return flood in 2013 fig 7b compared with no reservoir the overall flood risks were lower as evidenced by the reduction of extreme flood events and their severity in addition a larger proportion of flood events showed relatively lower flood flows similar to the dalai station the averaged reduction effect of the reservoir on peak flow was 44 8 over the study period and the specific reduction effect of events mainly ranged from 20 to 60 fig 7c and d these results indicate that the nierji reservoir is crucial in reducing flood risks at the fulaerji station the duration flood volume and peak flow with without reservoir scenarios screening for the fulaerji and dalai stations are shown in fig 8 under the reservoir scenario only a major flood event 2013 flood occurred at the dalai station with a peak flow of 8160 0 m3s 1 duration of 55 days and volume of 227 0 108 m3 fig 8a however the flood event without reservoir in the same year showed a much higher risk i e a peak flow of 10 043 0 m3s 1 a duration of 66 days and a volume of 273 6 108 m3 the probability of flood events in the case with reservoirs was less than in the scenario without reservoirs and this was particularly evident at the fulaerji station fig 8b specifically the fulaerji station experienced 12 flood events in the case without reservoirs in comparison only two flood events occurred in the case with reservoirs secondly flood flow volume and duration exhibited a distinct difference the fulaerji station generally showed a similar pattern i e reducing the probability of flooding events and decreasing the severity of the same flooding event i e peak flow flood volume and flood duration 4 3 reservoir impacts on future flood risks the left half of fig 9 shows the flood evolution characteristics of the dalai station under different future scenarios the occurrence rate of flood events will largely increase for all three future scenarios compared with the historical period specifically the annual probability of historical floods at the dalai station is only 22 2 while the probability of flooding will increase significantly under the three future scenarios specifically the occurrence rate of flood events for the short term mid term and long term periods is 64 0 52 0 and 92 0 under ssp126 56 0 68 0 and 72 0 under ssp370 and 64 0 48 0 and 60 0 under ssp585 respectively the future flood risks are reflected in the increasing occurrence rate of floods and the augmented magnitude of extreme flood events table 2 for example a near 100 year flood event will occur in the near future under the ssp126 scenario with a peak flow of 13 574 0 m3s 1 a duration of 74 days and a flood volume of 311 5 108 m3 the severity of this flood event far exceeds the magnitude of the 2013 flood after reservoir construction other flood events are mostly 5 year and 10 year events with a small amount exceeding 50 year events the ssp126 scenario and the ssp370 scenario mainly dominated by minor flood events have a low occurrence rate of major flood events while the dalai station is expected to experience a higher number of extreme severe flood events under the ssp585 scenario there were differences in the flood variability characteristics of the fulaerji station compared with the dalai station the severity of flood events under the ssp126 scenario was less than that of the ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios but still much more severe than that in the historical period the overall flood characteristics under the ssp126 scenario were not severe and no extreme flood events occurred fig 9d in contrast the dalai station located downstream of the fulaerji station will experience more severe flood events fig 9a however the confluent flood flow from the sub basins further increased the flood risks at the fulaerji station especially the recent flood event with a peak flow of 11 667 m3s 1 fig 9e and table 2 furthermore the ssp370 scenario will generate a flood event with a volume of 153 108 m3 and a duration of 42 days in the long term in comparison the ssp585 scenario would bring the most severe flood events especially three flood events with high flood volume and long duration and one flood event with high flood peak flow in the mid term period high peak flow floods will dominate in the long term with three flood events approaching a 50 year return period table 2 4 4 reservoir impacts on historical hydrological drought risks in contrast both fulaerji and dalai stations experienced a more severe risk of hydrological drought i e longer duration more frequent and more severe hydrological drought in the absence of a reservoir than in the presence of a reservoir at the dalai station 48 months of hydrological drought existed with the reservoir while 57 months of hydrological drought existed without the reservoir indicating a 15 7 reduction in the total duration of hydrological drought due to the regulation of the reservoir in addition the duration of moderate hydrological drought and extreme hydrological drought increased by 30 7 and 75 0 respectively while the duration of severe hydrological drought decreased by 45 4 in the absence of reservoirs the overall drought severity was reduced by 18 3 figs 10a and 10b in contrast at the fulaerji station a hydrological drought existed for 38 days with a reservoir and 52 months without a reservoir the duration of the hydrological drought was reduced by 14 months generally the hydrological drought in fulaerji is less severe than in dalai station the duration of moderate hydrological drought severe hydrological drought and extreme hydrological drought without reservoirs increased by 33 3 0 and 35 7 respectively compared that with reservoirs the total drought severity decreased by 29 7 figs 10c and 10d further the degree of the hydrological drought was much weaker at the stations closer to the reservoir downstream the results indicate that the impact of the reservoir on hydrological drought has a distance difference the hydrological drought duration and severity of river runoff downstream of the reservoir increased significantly but the intensity decreased slightly the results indicate that the reservoir can significantly regulate the hydrological drought in addition the hydrological drought duration increased more significantly than the severity in the case of no reservoir the results indicate that the regulation of hydrological drought duration by reservoirs is the most important for example the maximum duration of floods at the dalai station was 39 months and 18 months for the with and without reservoir scenarios respectively indicating a 53 8 reduction in the duration of floods by reservoirs fig 11a the hydrological drought severity at the fulaerji station is similar to that at the dalai station however the hydrological drought severity at the fulaerji station is slightly greater than that at the dalai station fig 11b indicating that reservoirs do not entirely eliminate the risk of drought especially in extreme drought conditions 4 5 reservoir impacts on future hydrological drought risks the duration severity and number of hydrological drought events will increase in the short term 2026 2050 mid term 2051 2075 and long term 2076 2100 periods at the dalai station fig 12 a c and table 3 in all three scenarios the number of hydrological drought events and intensity will experience an increasing trend while duration and severity will undergo a decreasing pattern in some periods such as in short term and long term periods under the ssp126 scenario mid term and long term periods under the ssp370 scenario under the ssp126 scenario the hydrological droughts in the mid term period will be much greater than those in the historical period and more intense than those in the short term future for example nine hydrological drought events will continue as long as five months and five will last more than ten months in the mid term period moreover a most severe hydrological drought event spanning thirty three months will happen the results indicate that future hydrological droughts will become more severe in some particular periods in the ssp370 scenario the recent hydrological drought performance is the most severe with an increase of 139 20 in the annual average hydrological drought frequency compared with the historical period under the ssp585 scenario the hydrological drought characteristics of the three periods are relatively similar with extreme hydrological drought events occurring mostly in the short term and mid term periods the characteristics of the hydrological drought at the fulaerji station are similar to those at the dalai station but the hydrological drought duration and severity are different fig 12 d f and table 4 in general the frequency and intensity of hydrological droughts at the fulaerji station will increase greatly but the average annual duration and severity of hydrological drought events will generally decrease the results indicate that the hydrological droughts at the fulaerji station will occur with high frequency and high intensity in the future in the ssp126 scenario extreme hydrological drought events will intensify with five of these events expected to last for more than ten months the most severe hydrological drought will last thirty three months fig 12d for the ssp370 scenario four hydrological drought events are also expected to last longer than 10 months showing that lengthy hydrological drought events will be a distinctive feature in the future fig 12e in the near future of the ssp370 scenario all hydrological drought indicators will exceed the historical period especially the probability of hydrological drought occurrence and intensity will exceed the historical period by 163 16 and 238 42 respectively table 4 in the ssp585 scenario the duration of hydrological drought events will generally be less than 5 months accounting for about 77 4 of the total hydrological drought events fig 12f however the increase of hydrological drought occurrence probability will be more than 100 therefore the lower reaches of the nierjir reservoir will experience more frequent longer lasting and more severe hydrological droughts under the projected future climate change 5 discussion 5 1 the efficiency of the reservoir in mitigating flood risks we found that the nierji reservoir can largely reduce flood risks especially can reduce peak flow the occurrence rate and the severity of extreme flood events to a large extent the capability of reservoirs to reduce flood risk has been demonstrated in several basins for example in the lancang mekong river basin where the operation of upstream reservoirs reduces the magnitude and frequency of floods by 16 and 36 respectively yun et al 2020a however even considering the impact of reservoir flood regulation services the flood risk downstream of the nierji reservoir will show an overall increasing trend under future climate change scenarios one of the findings indicates that the annual probability of flooding at the dalai station will generally exceed 50 0 much higher than the historical period i e 30 8 figs 8a and 9 furthermore the reservoir cannot completely eliminate the impact of extreme floods under future climate scenarios which indicates that the risk of flooding in the nrb will still increase according to previous studies this phenomenon is partly because the timing of the arrival of flood runoff characteristics may change under future climate change when the reservoir operating rules are kept constant an early or delayed flooding period will fail the nierji reservoir to mitigate the future flood peak flows and flood volume efficiently thus making the flood mitigation capacity of the reservoir less effective yu et al 2019 such extreme flood events can lead to ecological economic and social losses in addition other scholars have shown that the diminished flood mitigation capacity of reservoirs also depends on the extreme precipitation patterns during the flood season davenport et al 2021b mishra et al 2018 tabari 2021b prior to the occurrence of extreme precipitation when the reservoir capacity has reached a certain threshold the flood reduction capacity of the reservoir will be weakened at this time and cannot effectively regulate the subsequent extreme precipitation induced major flood events changes in atmospheric circulation and water circulation caused by global warming can affect the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of precipitation which in turn affects the variation of river runoff dougherty et al 2021 cui et al 2022 the climate change has altered both atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamics and thus impacting the water cycle as well as floods and droughts yin et al 2022a 2022b increased extreme heat and lower relative humidity will also cause increased drought yin et al 2022a 2022b and the frequency of extreme compound drought heatwave events is expected to increase tenfold globally in the future under the highest emission scenario yin et al 2023 in conclusion the increase in extreme weather will cause some weakening of reservoir regulation capacity we found that reservoirs alone cannot fully mitigate flood risks caused by future climate change which requires a combination of measures to improve the resilience of nrb to future flood risks as jongman 2018 suggested an effective adaptation strategy needs a combination of flood control infrastructure and nature based solutions to manage floods and buffer their economic and social impacts sun et al 2022 and wu et al 2020a 2020b showed that wetlands have some resistance to flooding which endows wetlands with the potential to be used as a nature based solution for improving the resilience of a river basin to flood risks the nrb as a concentrated distribution area of wetlands in china has an extensive distribution of wetlands i e accounting for 12 of the basin area if wetlands and reservoirs can be considered synergistically and optimally designed in the future the flood risk in the nrb will be significantly reduced 5 2 the efficiency of the reservoir in mitigating hydrological drought risks in the previous findings we analyzed the regulation of drought by reservoirs on downstream river runoff the reservoirs performed well in regulating hydrological drought overall the main manifestation is the weakening of extreme hydrological drought events followed by reducing the number of hydrological droughts the findings are somewhat similar to the work conducted by other scholars in the yangtze and yellow rivers where reservoirs can better withstand hydrological droughts with a joint recurrence period of fewer than two years while the hydrological drought resistance is weaker when the joint recurrence period exceeds six years wang et al 2019 yu et al 2019 future hydrological drought events in the nrb will increase and their severity will increase for example the hydrological drought intensity of ssp370 even exceeded 238 of the historical one thus although reservoirs can mitigate the historical stage they cannot fully relieve hydrological drought risks under future climate change the hydrological drought at the dalai station is slightly more severe compared with the fulaerji station which may attribute to a large amount of water extraction for farmland irrigation between the two hydrological stations ma et al 2021 thus causing more severe droughts at the further downstream the lower reaches of the nengjiang river are important commercial grain bases in china with its agriculture still expanding wang et al 2015 li et al 2019b under future climate change the risks of hydrological drought in the lower nrb will be further exacerbated by the increasing water demand for irrigation due to the rising agricultural expansion the results suggest an urgent need for basin scale optimal water resource scheduling to achieve healthy water demand for agricultural development and riverine ecosystems 5 3 limitations and recommendations for future research there are some uncertainties in the definition of drought events in this study the hydrological drought event screening method used in the previous paper can combine and eliminate drought events and ignore some hydrological drought events with short duration and low severity however for the selection of thresholds ρ c and r ds the human subjective consciousness will affect the final screening results the result is because the method requires the artificial selection of ρ c and r ds with the first significant change as thresholds which different people may get different conclusions for this study hydrological drought thresholds were tentatively investigated when the thresholds were chosen to be larger especially ρ c fewer drought events would be screened but the average duration of hydrological drought events would greatly increase conversely when p c is taken as a lower value hydrological drought events are more dispersed in between this uncertainty in this study to ensure the accuracy of the research results the same screening criteria were kept as much as possible when selecting the threshold value for the treatment of drought events in the same period or the same station this method can avoid errors caused by human factors to a certain extent further since we mainly focus on the effects of the nierji reservoir on flood and drought in the nrb we did not present improved reservoir operation rules that may efficiently mitigate extreme floods and droughts caused by future climate change we will conduct this research in the next step to improve the basin resilience hydrological to hydrological extremes 6 conclusion we coupled reservoirs into the hydrological model in this study to investigate the effects of reservoir regulation on floods and droughts in the nrb under historical and future climate change the results showed that coupling reservoir operations into the basin hydrology simulation can effectively improve the model s ability to capture flood and hydrologic drought characteristics this is shown by the presence of the reservoir where kge can reach 0 78 which is 20 0 and 124 1 increase for cc and nse respectively and 73 0 and 70 6 decrease for rmse and pbias respectively nierji reservoir contributes largely to mitigating flood and drought risks in the nrb two floods exceeding 10 000 m3s 1 can be mitigated to one 8000 m3s 1 during 2002 2018 at the same time the duration of droughts can be reduced by 15 7 and the degree of drought by 18 3 while the mitigation capacity will be weakened under future hydrological extremes for example there will be a flood event with a storage volume of 153 108 m3 and a duration of 42 days under the ssp370 scenario which is much more severe than the historical period therefore it is necessary to further optimize the design of the reservoir scheduling rules and consider a combination of nature based solutions e g wetland mitigation services for floods and droughts to reduce flood and drought risks across the nrb to the greatest extent these findings highlight that there is still a large potential risk of extreme disasters in the nrb under future climate change and accurate prediction and effective planning are necessary to protect the water security of the nrb better credit authorship contribution statement jingxuan sun writing original draft visualization

7622,study region nenjiang river basin nrb northeast china study focus water safety management and sustainable development planning increasingly seek to incorporate the impact of reservoirs on downstream floods and droughts while the effectiveness of reservoir operation in regulating flood and drought risks under climate change has not been assessed extensively we focus on discerning whether and to what extent reservoirs can mitigate the risk of hydrologic extremes from the perspective of historical and future climate change new hydrological insight for the region we found that coupling reservoir operations into basin hydrological simulation can efficiently improve model capacity to capture both flood and hydrological drought characteristics the nierji reservoir contributed largely to reducing historical flood and drought risks in the nrb however the risk of floods and hydrological droughts will increase under future climate change and reservoir operations cannot completely eliminate the increasing risks of future floods and hydrological droughts the annual probability of flooding under different future scenarios will exceed 48 much higher than the 22 2 for the historical period the frequency of droughts is anticipated to increase by 139 20 under the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 370 scenario to mitigate the increase of flood and drought risks caused by future climate change it is necessary to further optimize reservoir scheduling principles thereby improving the basin s resilience to hydrological extremes graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrologic projection floods and droughts reservoir operations nenjiang river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods and droughts are global issues and the world s most devastating and urgent natural disasters with serious social ecological and economic impacts correa et al 2017 bessah et al 2020 in 1995 2015 floods and droughts worldwide were estimated to have affected about 2 3 billion and about 1 1 billion people respectively pearson and pelling 2015 furthermore they have caused more severe negative impacts over the past century due to climate change and intense human activities such impacts will likely increase further in the future ward et al 2020 williams et al 2020 meanwhile the magnitude duration and frequency of droughts are likely to increase leng et al 2015 gupta and jain 2018 especially the probability of flash droughts and floods is rising rahmani et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 reservoirs can regulate flow regimes by redistributing the spatiotemporal changes of river flow lópez moreno et al 2009 particularly mitigating hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts guo et al 2019 ding et al 2015 specifically the reservoir can reduce flood risks by storing extensive water during flood events and postponing the time of flood peaks which is conducive to downstream flood management and decision making brunner 2021a in addition the water storage in a reservoir can largely support low flow during the drought period thus alleviating runoff drought lazin et al 2023 raczyński 2020 for example the construction of the three gorges reservoir has increased the relative humidity and alleviated agricultural drought downstream of the yangtze river china li et al 2021 wang et al 2017 found that reservoir regulation can reduce the drought affected area by 10 20 in a normal year considerably reducing the impact of short term drought wu et al 2017 reported that the operation of shanmei reservoir has significantly reduced the duration and magnitude of hydrological drought downstream compared with the natural influence period these studies comprehensively demonstrated that reservoir operation contributes largely to enhancing basin resilience to drought risks zhu et al 2022 jing et al 2022 xiong et al 2020 however certain studies have proven that reservoirs can exacerbate drought downstream to some extent al faraj and scholz 2014 xing et al 2021 di baldassarre et al 2018 found that over reliance on reservoirs will increase the demand for water supply and lead to potential drought damage even under certain conditions the low flow water level at the same discharge can decrease after reservoir operation zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 lu and chua 2021 therefore hydrological droughts may be underestimated and management decisions and measures will not effectively address drought risks leading to more severe droughts xu et al 2022 however how effective the regulation is and whether it has negative effects remain largely unexplored there are generally two research lines to explore the regulation capacity of reservoirs for floods and droughts based on model calculations and field measurements scholars use hydrological models combined with optimization algorithms to obtain reservoir outlet and downstream flows and verify the simulation results with the actually observed flows brunner 2021b yuan et al 2022 xue et al 2022 the pairs simulation i e the runoff simulation in the absence and presence of reservoir operation is often used to quantify the effect of reservoirs on flood and drought events previous studies found that reservoirs can significantly regulate downstream runoff and reduce upstream annual runoff yun et al 2020b maza et al 2020 naz et al 2018 larabi et al 2022 in addition some scholars have continued to optimize the ability of reservoirs to mediate floods and droughts under the influence of climate change by improving the operating rules of reservoirs seifollahi aghmiuni and bozorg haddad 2019 paliwal et al 2020 there are also studies on reservoirs based on models that allow specific assumptions to be made about water supply and demand flow regulation and hydropower generation yassin et al 2019 furthermore studies based on observations only mostly use comparisons between upstream and downstream of reservoirs rangecroft et al 2019 or use comparisons before and after reservoir construction to evaluate the ability of reservoirs to regulate flood and drought risks van loon et al 2019 long et al 2019 a comparative analysis of the reservoir before and after construction revealed that the reservoir construction would have significant temporal differences and flow differences in the runoff characteristics of the sub basin xu et al 2020 as well as the potential for adverse effects leading to a decrease in the 1 day minimum flow and disrupting the ecological balance ali et al 2019 however such studies have primarily focused on evaluating the utility of reservoirs for floods and hydrologic droughts during the historical period while less research has been conducted on the capability of reservoirs to cope with hydrological risks under future climate change whether and to what extent reservoirs can mitigate the risk of hydrologic extremes from the perspective of historical and future climate change requires further systematic research in this paper a hydrological simulation coupled with reservoir operation for drought and flood prone nengjiang river basin in northeast china was conducted to achieve the above aims this paper aims to address a central question to what extent can reservoirs mitigate floods and droughts under climate change specifically this study aims to analyze i whether a hydrological model with coupled reservoir operations can better simulate basin hydrological processes ii how can the estimated future flood and drought risks be changed by considering the effects of reservoirs we address these questions by a comparing model performance with and without reservoirs in terms of runoff processes as well as flood and drought characteristics b predicting flood and drought risks based on their characteristic indicators with consideration of reservoir operation and c discussing our findings and implications for actual flood and drought risk management our framework and results are expected to bring new insights into dam based floods and droughts mitigation and provide a basis for better decision making to curb the impacts of unprecedented and increasingly severe future extreme conditions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the nenjiang river basin nrb is located in northeast china and its downstream songnen plain is an important national commercial grain base for china the main stream is 1370 km long with a basin area of 290 000 km2 feng et al 2013 li et al 2014 the source of water vapor in the nrb is mainly from the pacific ocean dong and zhang 2013 during the summer season the warm and humid air masses on the ocean are transmitted to the north by the pacific monsoon with more abundant water vapor and higher temperatures the maximum annual precipitation in the basin is 937 4 mm the minimum annual precipitation is 152 5 mm and summer precipitation accounts for about 82 of the annual precipitation wu et al 2016 li et al 2019a the average annual temperature of the nrb ranges from 2 to 4 the historical minimum temperature was 39 5 and the maximum low temperature was 40 1 zheng et al 2019 the average multi year runoff in the basin is 623 0 m3s 1 from 1972 to 2020 with a total natural annual runoff of 196 6 108 m3 wu et al 2022 the runoff varies widely within and between years with a minimum flow of 59 6 m3s 1 during the dry period from december to january each year and a flat period from april to june and october with an average monthly flow variation of 223 3 694 9 m3s 1 july to september is the period of abundant water with an average monthly flow variation of 1210 1 2126 7 m3s 1 which is prone to flooding according to statistics in the past 30 years there have been two major floods in the neng river basin a 100 year flood occurred in 1998 with a peak flow of 16 100 m3s 1 and an average annual runoff of 1953 1 m3s 1 in 2013 a 50 year flood occurred in the nrb with a maximum inlet flow of 9440 m3s 1 in a single day in the nierji reservoir during the heavy rainfall in the flood season summer and autumn the hills produce more flow nierji reservoir is the only dam located at the main stream of the nenjiang river which

calibration performance was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and percent deviation pbias as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 to evaluate the performance of calibrated hydrotel in the nrb 3 2 reservoir operation simulation 3 2 1 reservoir operation scheme most reservoirs provide various functions such as water supply flood control and power generation different reservoir dispatch rules vary widely for different regions and different hydrometeorological conditions reservoir regulation schemes must be determined to simulate the effect of reservoirs on channel runoff generally the water released from a reservoir depends on several factors such as water demand downstream flow and current storage zhao et al 2011 in this study the operating design curve of reservoir operation was obtained by analyzing the flow data of the reservoir while simulating the operation of the nierji reservoir using the ressimopt matlab software package developed by dobson et al 2019 ressimopt matlab contains three algorithms for reservoir simulation the first algorithm considers a case when we want to always release a constant amount over the simulation period this constant amount is the target release that would cover all downstream demand for water for instance for domestic use and or irrigation the second consider a case when we still want to release the target demand but we would also like to 1 apply some hedging that is an intentional reduction of the release even if it would still be feasible to release the target demand aimed at saving more water and thus facing smaller deficits at later time and 2 attenuate downstream peak flows for flood control purpose the third algorithm which was used in this study dynamizes the operation rules a dynamic operation schemes was used in this study to achieve the simulation specifically following dobson et al 2019 and according to actual hydrological conditions we defined two seasons the wet season from june to september when the risk of flooding is higher and we wanted to release the target demand and provide some storage space for flood control and the dry season when the risk of flooding is low and the main objective is to sustain ecological baseflows the required input data for the algorithm include reservoir inflow q in m3 s minimum ambient flow e env m3 s initial storage s o m3 minimum s min and maximum s max storage m3 estimated evaporation loss e vap mm released discharge q out m3 s and simulation time step day based on the

into 1551 river sections and 3686 hydrological response units rhhus first the specific location of the nierji reservoir was determined in the hydrotel model after comparing with the actual project the reservoir was finally located between river sections 428 and 449 then the daily flow in the upper basin of river section 428 was simulated for the set time and river section 449 was selected as the data outlet i e the reservoir outlet the reservoir outflow was then calculated based on the simulated inflow and reservoir operation rules using the ressimopt matlab software package the reservoir outlet outflow can be used as the inflow into the downstream river section furthermore flow simulations of the downstream reservoir were carried out to further analyze the downstream flood and drought risks based on this framework the incorporation of reservoirs into the hydrotel model could be achieved 3 3 flood event determination and characteristics identification screening flood and drought events is challenging to infer extremes in complex hydrometeorological systems due to the sparsity of events and small sample sizes tabari 2019 for flood events extreme events are usually selected using extreme value theory evt coles et al 2001 evt consists of two basic methods katz et al 2002 the traditional method called block maxima bm and the peak over threshold pot method bm is used by selecting the maximum value in each year s data with the number of events equal to the number of years however bm cannot consider the characteristics of the high and low water years and tends to define the smaller flows in the low water years as a single flood event thus also ignoring the flood events that take second place in the high flow years in this regard the bm model can easily lead to information loss especially when the data records are short tabari 2021 in recent studies pot has become a preferential method for flood event determination and characteristics identification the pot method provides a larger sample size for a more accurate approximation of the distribution parameters than the bm method of selecting a maximum event per year lang et al 1999 it also works well in the case of asymmetric distribution tails mcneil and frey 2000 the pot model considers exceeding the generalized pareto distribution sample to make the independence assumption of the extracted peaks more acceptable the decluttering method proposed by liang et al lang et al 1999 was used this method verifies that all extracted peaks obey the following two conditions on arrival time r and the minimal intermediate flow rate x min 4 r 5 log a 1 609 2 a n d x min 0 75 min x i x j where x i and x j represent sequential peaks of daily river discharge m3s 1 and a is the drainage area of the basin km2 the first condition ensures that two consecutive peaks are separated by a sufficient period r in days that depends on drainage area a the second condition ensures that intermediate flows x min between two peaks x i and x j reach at least a level as low as 75 of the lowest peak the lowest one is discarded if two peaks do not meet these conditions in this study flood events at dalai and fulaerji stations in the historical period 2006 2018 were screened respectively using the pot method and each event consisted of three main basic flood characteristics peak flow flood volume and flood duration the annual maximum peak flow for the past years 1983 2018 was used as input data to obtain the frequency accumulation curves using the log pearson3 calculation method to obtain the recurrence period flow for different years the pot threshold selected for this study is a 2 year flood event this threshold value can exclude too small flood flows and retain most large flood events 3 4 determination of hydrological drought events and characteristics identification hydrologic drought is a water shortage in the hydrologic system usually manifested as abnormally low river flow van loon 2015 the run theory has been widely applied to extract drought features guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in this paper the standardized flow index ssi based on the theory of spi calculation is used to represent the hydrological drought index in previous studies some scholars used ssi with a multi month time scale 3 6 12 months etc to extract drought events zhou et al 2020 wu et al 2021 alternatively a one month ssi was used and then a fixed time interval e g 6 months was set to remove droughts smaller than that time interval zhou et al 2021 the former drought events screened using multiple time scales generally had longer duration and higher severity causing serious deviations in the duration of droughts and overlapping information the latter overly straightforward selection condition would eliminate some of the apparent droughts or include the insignificant ones depending on the selection of the time threshold zhou et al 2021 5 s s i s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 where c 0 2

sequences x in ascending order in this study hydrological drought events were extracted based on thresholds the results are shown in table 1 we merged adjacent hydrological drought events a the interval between adjacent drought events did not exceed t c t c is the time criterion and t c 2 was taken in this study following guo et al 2020 b the ratio of the area above the threshold to the area below the threshold in the previous hydrological drought event was less than ρ c ρ c is the standard value for severity assessment after merging small hydrological drought events with short duration and low severity need to be further excluded r d and r s represent the mean hydrological drought duration d ave and percentage of hydrological drought severity s ave respectively if the duration of a hydrological drought event is less than r d d ave or the severity is less than r s s ave the hydrological drought event should be eliminated in general r d and r s are the same therefore r d r s r ds was used in this study the specific process of hydrological drought event pooling and exclusion can be found in the study of guo et al guo et al 2020 then sensitivity analysis was used to determine the key values ρ c and r ds used for the convergence and elimination of different subregions according to the ratio of hydrological drought event characteristics i e number of drought events drought duration severity and intensity before and after convergence and elimination the selected values of ρ c and r ds were those when the rate of change of the ratio was significantly lower or even zero for the first time guo et al 2020 fig 2 shows the sensitivity results of ρ c and r ds as an example of historical hydrological drought with a reservoir and the relevant results for other scenarios are shown in figs s1 s4 in fig 2 the two rising curves represent the duration and severity of drought events respectively and it is generally believed that the longer the drought duration the more severe the drought and the two are positively correlated the descending curves represent the frequency of drought events and all drought events are independent when ρ c or r ds is close to 0 value as the coefficient increases drought events of short duration and low severity will be combined resulting in a decrease in total drought events and an increase in duration and severity since droughts occur at discrete times the inflection point indicates that droughts within a certain range are combined when ρ c or r ds exceeds a certain threshold ssi values were calculated for the dalai and fulaerji stations on a one month time scale the ssi calculations were used to characterize hydrological drought based on negative values below the threshold hydrological drought characteristics mainly include duration severity and intensity where severity is the cumulative value of ssi below the threshold and intensity is the severity divided by duration in this study ssi was calculated on the time scale of 1983 2018 in order to compare and analyze the effect of reservoirs on hydrological drought only the results of ssi values from 2006 to 2018 were presented the runoff deficit is represented by the red area and divided into different classes according to the extent table 1 to define each hydrological drought category in this analysis a threshold value of 0 5 was used to determine the occurrence of hydrological drought the hydrological drought events and their characteristics at dalai and fulaerji stations were identified after determining the corresponding thresholds using run theory and the hydrological drought event screening method proposed by zhou et al 2021 3 5 research approach to reservoir regulation of floods and hydrological droughts the first step is to compare and analyze the role of runoff regulation with without reservoirs in the historical period we used the model to simulate the operation results under the condition without a reservoir and compare the analysis with the observed data when there is a reservoir to explore the characteristics of downstream flood and hydrological drought changes under the condition with without a reservoir thereby we quantitatively evaluated the reduction effect of reservoirs on floods and hydrological droughts in the historical period furthermore to predict whether the nierji reservoir can efficiently mitigate flood risks under future climate change in the nrb the calibrated hydrological model coupled with reservoir operations has been conducted to simulate future streamflow and project the characteristics of future floods peak flow flood volume and duration at the dalai and fulaerji stations the ensemble means of the bias corrected cmip6 forcing scenarios ssp126 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios were used to drive the hydrological model the flood characteristic indices were extracted and performed a comparative analysis of their temporal evolution in the near future 2026 2050 mid century 2051 2075 and end of the century 2076 2100 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation five goodness of fit indices were used to verify the reasonableness of the calibrated model collectively the simulation results with coupled reservoirs were better than those without reservoirs in all aspects fig 3 specifically the simulation results for the tongmeng fulaerji and dalai stations exceeded 0 78 for the kge with reservoirs while the results without reservoirs were below 0 57 in addition the simulation results for the coupled reservoirs showed some improvements in other indices at the three stations exhibiting a 20 0 and 124 1 increase in cc and nse respectively and a 73 0 and a 70 6 decrease in rmse and pbias respectively the simulated daily streamflow for the coupled reservoirs meets the acceptable criteria proposed by moriasi et al moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 i e nse 0 5 and pbias 17 furthermore coupled reservoirs can improve the model performance to a greater extent in daily runoff simulations and bring the simulation results closer to reality to further understand whether the simulation capability of the model is effectively improved after coupling reservoir regulation we compared the simulation and observation at three hydrological stations including their daily process lines and flow duration curves figs 4 and 5 for the three hydrological stations tongmeng fulaerji and dalai the daily flow duration curves under the reservoir scenario agreed with the observations however the simulation without a reservoir overestimated high flows to some extent especially during flood periods e g 2018 while underestimated streamflow during low flow periods at the tongmeng fulaerji and dalai stations figs 4 and 5 these results indicate that the absence of reservoirs can overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows fig 5 furthermore this simulation error becomes increasingly evident as the runoff moves downstream such results further suggest that the inclusion of reservoirs can greatly improve the accuracy of the model to reproduce basic hydrologic features and capture extreme hydrologic conditions 4 2 impacts of the reservoir on historical flood risks to assess the role of reservoirs in regulating flood risks the annual flood flow variation characteristics with without reservoirs in the historical period 2006 2018 were compared it was found that the difference in runoff volume between tongmeng station and fulaerji station was not significant due to their close distance and the small amount of runoff confluence between them to avoid duplication of discussions the results of the subsequent study are therefore discussed only for the fulaerji and dalai stations fig 6a shows that reservoirs generally exhibit a reduction in flood flow with a large difference in the degree of reduction in different years reservoir reductions to flood peaks were the greatest in 2017 and 2018 but the greatest percentage reduction in reservoir reductions to flood peaks occurred in 2017 with reductions of more than 75 and percentage reductions were generally around 50 fig 6c and d secondly the reservoir reduced the 20 year floods of 2013 and 2018 10 year and 5 year floods respectively which largely alleviated the flood risk in the nrb the annual peak flood flow was mostly concentrated below 2000 m3s 1 and the average multi year flood flow was 2221 0 m3s 1 under reservoir presence fig 6b in the absence of the reservoir the average multi year flood flow is 4421 1 m3s 1 which was 99 1 higher than that in the presence of reservoir the flood flow at the dalai hydrological station exceeded 8000 m3s 1 only once with consideration of the reservoir while the flood flow without the reservoir exceeded 10 000 m3s 1 two times therefore the nierji reservoir considerably contributes to decreasing download extreme flood risks in the nrb for the fulaerji station the years with higher flood reduction intensity were 2018 and 2012 with flood reduction of 5750 0 m3s 1 and 2914 9 m3s 1 respectively which was slightly different from the dalai station fig 7a furthermore due to the influence of reservoir storage the intensity of flooding in all years was less than one in five years except for the occurrence of a 20 year return flood in 2013 fig 7b compared with no reservoir the overall flood risks were lower as evidenced by the reduction of extreme flood events and their severity in addition a larger proportion of flood events showed relatively lower flood flows similar to the dalai station the averaged reduction effect of the reservoir on peak flow was 44 8 over the study period and the specific reduction effect of events mainly ranged from 20 to 60 fig 7c and d these results indicate that the nierji reservoir is crucial in reducing flood risks at the fulaerji station the duration flood volume and peak flow with without reservoir scenarios screening for the fulaerji and dalai stations are shown in fig 8 under the reservoir scenario only a major flood event 2013 flood occurred at the dalai station with a peak flow of 8160 0 m3s 1 duration of 55 days and volume of 227 0 108 m3 fig 8a however the flood event without reservoir in the same year showed a much higher risk i e a peak flow of 10 043 0 m3s 1 a duration of 66 days and a volume of 273 6 108 m3 the probability of flood events in the case with reservoirs was less than in the scenario without reservoirs and this was particularly evident at the fulaerji station fig 8b specifically the fulaerji station experienced 12 flood events in the case without reservoirs in comparison only two flood events occurred in the case with reservoirs secondly flood flow volume and duration exhibited a distinct difference the fulaerji station generally showed a similar pattern i e reducing the probability of flooding events and decreasing the severity of the same flooding event i e peak flow flood volume and flood duration 4 3 reservoir impacts on future flood risks the left half of fig 9 shows the flood evolution characteristics of the dalai station under different future scenarios the occurrence rate of flood events will largely increase for all three future scenarios compared with the historical period specifically the annual probability of historical floods at the dalai station is only 22 2 while the probability of flooding will increase significantly under the three future scenarios specifically the occurrence rate of flood events for the short term mid term and long term periods is 64 0 52 0 and 92 0 under ssp126 56 0 68 0 and 72 0 under ssp370 and 64 0 48 0 and 60 0 under ssp585 respectively the future flood risks are reflected in the increasing occurrence rate of floods and the augmented magnitude of extreme flood events table 2 for example a near 100 year flood event will occur in the near future under the ssp126 scenario with a peak flow of 13 574 0 m3s 1 a duration of 74 days and a flood volume of 311 5 108 m3 the severity of this flood event far exceeds the magnitude of the 2013 flood after reservoir construction other flood events are mostly 5 year and 10 year events with a small amount exceeding 50 year events the ssp126 scenario and the ssp370 scenario mainly dominated by minor flood events have a low occurrence rate of major flood events while the dalai station is expected to experience a higher number of extreme severe flood events under the ssp585 scenario there were differences in the flood variability characteristics of the fulaerji station compared with the dalai station the severity of flood events under the ssp126 scenario was less than that of the ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios but still much more severe than that in the historical period the overall flood characteristics under the ssp126 scenario were not severe and no extreme flood events occurred fig 9d in contrast the dalai station located downstream of the fulaerji station will experience more severe flood events fig 9a however the confluent flood flow from the sub basins further increased the flood risks at the fulaerji station especially the recent flood event with a peak flow of 11 667 m3s 1 fig 9e and table 2 furthermore the ssp370 scenario will generate a flood event with a volume of 153 108 m3 and a duration of 42 days in the long term in comparison the ssp585 scenario would bring the most severe flood events especially three flood events with high flood volume and long duration and one flood event with high flood peak flow in the mid term period high peak flow floods will dominate in the long term with three flood events approaching a 50 year return period table 2 4 4 reservoir impacts on historical hydrological drought risks in contrast both fulaerji and dalai stations experienced a more severe risk of hydrological drought i e longer duration more frequent and more severe hydrological drought in the absence of a reservoir than in the presence of a reservoir at the dalai station 48 months of hydrological drought existed with the reservoir while 57 months of hydrological drought existed without the reservoir indicating a 15 7 reduction in the total duration of hydrological drought due to the regulation of the reservoir in addition the duration of moderate hydrological drought and extreme hydrological drought increased by 30 7 and 75 0 respectively while the duration of severe hydrological drought decreased by 45 4 in the absence of reservoirs the overall drought severity was reduced by 18 3 figs 10a and 10b in contrast at the fulaerji station a hydrological drought existed for 38 days with a reservoir and 52 months without a reservoir the duration of the hydrological drought was reduced by 14 months generally the hydrological drought in fulaerji is less severe than in dalai station the duration of moderate hydrological drought severe hydrological drought and extreme hydrological drought without reservoirs increased by 33 3 0 and 35 7 respectively compared that with reservoirs the total drought severity decreased by 29 7 figs 10c and 10d further the degree of the hydrological drought was much weaker at the stations closer to the reservoir downstream the results indicate that the impact of the reservoir on hydrological drought has a distance difference the hydrological drought duration and severity of river runoff downstream of the reservoir increased significantly but the intensity decreased slightly the results indicate that the reservoir can significantly regulate the hydrological drought in addition the hydrological drought duration increased more significantly than the severity in the case of no reservoir the results indicate that the regulation of hydrological drought duration by reservoirs is the most important for example the maximum duration of floods at the dalai station was 39 months and 18 months for the with and without reservoir scenarios respectively indicating a 53 8 reduction in the duration of floods by reservoirs fig 11a the hydrological drought severity at the fulaerji station is similar to that at the dalai station however the hydrological drought severity at the fulaerji station is slightly greater than that at the dalai station fig 11b indicating that reservoirs do not entirely eliminate the risk of drought especially in extreme drought conditions 4 5 reservoir impacts on future hydrological drought risks the duration severity and number of hydrological drought events will increase in the short term 2026 2050 mid term 2051 2075 and long term 2076 2100 periods at the dalai station fig 12 a c and table 3 in all three scenarios the number of hydrological drought events and intensity will experience an increasing trend while duration and severity will undergo a decreasing pattern in some periods such as in short term and long term periods under the ssp126 scenario mid term and long term periods under the ssp370 scenario under the ssp126 scenario the hydrological droughts in the mid term period will be much greater than those in the historical period and more intense than those in the short term future for example nine hydrological drought events will continue as long as five months and five will last more than ten months in the mid term period moreover a most severe hydrological drought event spanning thirty three months will happen the results indicate that future hydrological droughts will become more severe in some particular periods in the ssp370 scenario the recent hydrological drought performance is the most severe with an increase of 139 20 in the annual average hydrological drought frequency compared with the historical period under the ssp585 scenario the hydrological drought characteristics of the three periods are relatively similar with extreme hydrological drought events occurring mostly in the short term and mid term periods the characteristics of the hydrological drought at the fulaerji station are similar to those at the dalai station but the hydrological drought duration and severity are different fig 12 d f and table 4 in general the frequency and intensity of hydrological droughts at the fulaerji station will increase greatly but the average annual duration and severity of hydrological drought events will generally decrease the results indicate that the hydrological droughts at the fulaerji station will occur with high frequency and high intensity in the future in the ssp126 scenario extreme hydrological drought events will intensify with five of these events expected to last for more than ten months the most severe hydrological drought will last thirty three months fig 12d for the ssp370 scenario four hydrological drought events are also expected to last longer than 10 months showing that lengthy hydrological drought events will be a distinctive feature in the future fig 12e in the near future of the ssp370 scenario all hydrological drought indicators will exceed the historical period especially the probability of hydrological drought occurrence and intensity will exceed the historical period by 163 16 and 238 42 respectively table 4 in the ssp585 scenario the duration of hydrological drought events will generally be less than 5 months accounting for about 77 4 of the total hydrological drought events fig 12f however the increase of hydrological drought occurrence probability will be more than 100 therefore the lower reaches of the nierjir reservoir will experience more frequent longer lasting and more severe hydrological droughts under the projected future climate change 5 discussion 5 1 the efficiency of the reservoir in mitigating flood risks we found that the nierji reservoir can largely reduce flood risks especially can reduce peak flow the occurrence rate and the severity of extreme flood events to a large extent the capability of reservoirs to reduce flood risk has been demonstrated in several basins for example in the lancang mekong river basin where the operation of upstream reservoirs reduces the magnitude and frequency of floods by 16 and 36 respectively yun et al 2020a however even considering the impact of reservoir flood regulation services the flood risk downstream of the nierji reservoir will show an overall increasing trend under future climate change scenarios one of the findings indicates that the annual probability of flooding at the dalai station will generally exceed 50 0 much higher than the historical period i e 30 8 figs 8a and 9 furthermore the reservoir cannot completely eliminate the impact of extreme floods under future climate scenarios which indicates that the risk of flooding in the nrb will still increase according to previous studies this phenomenon is partly because the timing of the arrival of flood runoff characteristics may change under future climate change when the reservoir operating rules are kept constant an early or delayed flooding period will fail the nierji reservoir to mitigate the future flood peak flows and flood volume efficiently thus making the flood mitigation capacity of the reservoir less effective yu et al 2019 such extreme flood events can lead to ecological economic and social losses in addition other scholars have shown that the diminished flood mitigation capacity of reservoirs also depends on the extreme precipitation patterns during the flood season davenport et al 2021b mishra et al 2018 tabari 2021b prior to the occurrence of extreme precipitation when the reservoir capacity has reached a certain threshold the flood reduction capacity of the reservoir will be weakened at this time and cannot effectively regulate the subsequent extreme precipitation induced major flood events changes in atmospheric circulation and water circulation caused by global warming can affect the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of precipitation which in turn affects the variation of river runoff dougherty et al 2021 cui et al 2022 the climate change has altered both atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamics and thus impacting the water cycle as well as floods and droughts yin et al 2022a 2022b increased extreme heat and lower relative humidity will also cause increased drought yin et al 2022a 2022b and the frequency of extreme compound drought heatwave events is expected to increase tenfold globally in the future under the highest emission scenario yin et al 2023 in conclusion the increase in extreme weather will cause some weakening of reservoir regulation capacity we found that reservoirs alone cannot fully mitigate flood risks caused by future climate change which requires a combination of measures to improve the resilience of nrb to future flood risks as jongman 2018 suggested an effective adaptation strategy needs a combination of flood control infrastructure and nature based solutions to manage floods and buffer their economic and social impacts sun et al 2022 and wu et al 2020a 2020b showed that wetlands have some resistance to flooding which endows wetlands with the potential to be used as a nature based solution for improving the resilience of a river basin to flood risks the nrb as a concentrated distribution area of wetlands in china has an extensive distribution of wetlands i e accounting for 12 of the basin area if wetlands and reservoirs can be considered synergistically and optimally designed in the future the flood risk in the nrb will be significantly reduced 5 2 the efficiency of the reservoir in mitigating hydrological drought risks in the previous findings we analyzed the regulation of drought by reservoirs on downstream river runoff the reservoirs performed well in regulating hydrological drought overall the main manifestation is the weakening of extreme hydrological drought events followed by reducing the number of hydrological droughts the findings are somewhat similar to the work conducted by other scholars in the yangtze and yellow rivers where reservoirs can better withstand hydrological droughts with a joint recurrence period of fewer than two years while the hydrological drought resistance is weaker when the joint recurrence period exceeds six years wang et al 2019 yu et al 2019 future hydrological drought events in the nrb will increase and their severity will increase for example the hydrological drought intensity of ssp370 even exceeded 238 of the historical one thus although reservoirs can mitigate the historical stage they cannot fully relieve hydrological drought risks under future climate change the hydrological drought at the dalai station is slightly more severe compared with the fulaerji station which may attribute to a large amount of water extraction for farmland irrigation between the two hydrological stations ma et al 2021 thus causing more severe droughts at the further downstream the lower reaches of the nengjiang river are important commercial grain bases in china with its agriculture still expanding wang et al 2015 li et al 2019b under future climate change the risks of hydrological drought in the lower nrb will be further exacerbated by the increasing water demand for irrigation due to the rising agricultural expansion the results suggest an urgent need for basin scale optimal water resource scheduling to achieve healthy water demand for agricultural development and riverine ecosystems 5 3 limitations and recommendations for future research there are some uncertainties in the definition of drought events in this study the hydrological drought event screening method used in the previous paper can combine and eliminate drought events and ignore some hydrological drought events with short duration and low severity however for the selection of thresholds ρ c and r ds the human subjective consciousness will affect the final screening results the result is because the method requires the artificial selection of ρ c and r ds with the first significant change as thresholds which different people may get different conclusions for this study hydrological drought thresholds were tentatively investigated when the thresholds were chosen to be larger especially ρ c fewer drought events would be screened but the average duration of hydrological drought events would greatly increase conversely when p c is taken as a lower value hydrological drought events are more dispersed in between this uncertainty in this study to ensure the accuracy of the research results the same screening criteria were kept as much as possible when selecting the threshold value for the treatment of drought events in the same period or the same station this method can avoid errors caused by human factors to a certain extent further since we mainly focus on the effects of the nierji reservoir on flood and drought in the nrb we did not present improved reservoir operation rules that may efficiently mitigate extreme floods and droughts caused by future climate change we will conduct this research in the next step to improve the basin resilience hydrological to hydrological extremes 6 conclusion we coupled reservoirs into the hydrological model in this study to investigate the effects of reservoir regulation on floods and droughts in the nrb under historical and future climate change the results showed that coupling reservoir operations into the basin hydrology simulation can effectively improve the model s ability to capture flood and hydrologic drought characteristics this is shown by the presence of the reservoir where kge can reach 0 78 which is 20 0 and 124 1 increase for cc and nse respectively and 73 0 and 70 6 decrease for rmse and pbias respectively nierji reservoir contributes largely to mitigating flood and drought risks in the nrb two floods exceeding 10 000 m3s 1 can be mitigated to one 8000 m3s 1 during 2002 2018 at the same time the duration of droughts can be reduced by 15 7 and the degree of drought by 18 3 while the mitigation capacity will be weakened under future hydrological extremes for example there will be a flood event with a storage volume of 153 108 m3 and a duration of 42 days under the ssp370 scenario which is much more severe than the historical period therefore it is necessary to further optimize the design of the reservoir scheduling rules and consider a combination of nature based solutions e g wetland mitigation services for floods and droughts to reduce flood and drought risks across the nrb to the greatest extent these findings highlight that there is still a large potential risk of extreme disasters in the nrb under future climate change and accurate prediction and effective planning are necessary to protect the water security of the nrb better credit authorship contribution statement jingxuan sun writing original draft visualization

7623,study region lancang river basin lrb study focus previous studies provided different results in terms of the roles played by climate change and human activities leaving a knowledge gap in the complex streamflow variability and its physical causes in lrb in the study a budyko framework aided analytical approach was applied to explore the streamflow decrease in lrb and its physical causes by especially clarifying the different performances of eight budyko equations and the influences of diverse baseline periods new hydrological insights for the region results revealed that the four parametric budyko equations can provide proper parameters to reflect changes in catchment characteristics including human activities and their influences and thus they performed better than the four non parametric budyko equations it was further found that more reasonable attribution results of streamflow change were obtained when a longer baseline period at least 20 years was used results also indicated that human activities accounting for 158 9 dominated the streamflow decrease during the transition period 1986 2004 by offsetting the positive effects of climate change accounting for 58 9 during the impact period 2005 2015 human activities accounting for 65 6 still dominated the streamflow decrease and climate change accounting for 34 4 further aggravated the streamflow decrease in lrb

of water resources at regional scales oki and kanae 2006 cayan et al 2010 piao et al 2010 sang et al 2016b xie et al 2018 specifically climate change significantly impacts the variability of precipitation and the glacier and snowmelt processes sang et al 2020 thus altering the water cycle human activities including reservoir operations li et al 2017 agricultural irrigation jaramillo and destouni 2015 as well as land use changes arrigoni et al 2010 further change the water cycle thus clarification of the influences of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes is necessary for the sustainable exploration of water resources loucks and van beek 2017 pedro monzonís et al 2015 however the attribution of streamflow changes is challenging due to the complex variability of runoff processes liu et al 2017 there are two types of approaches to determine this attribution the first type is based on hydrological modeling that is hydrological models are calibrated using hydrometeorological and watershed properties data in the selected baseline period then the input data for the evaluation periods are as new inputs of the calibrated model and the modeling results are compared to the observations during the baseline period to achieve the attribution of streamflow changes wang et al 2009 however this type of approach has high requirements of accuracy and quantity of data resulting in complex calculations difficult determination of model parameters and uncertainty of model results nash and gleick 1991 the other type is budyko framework based approaches which take physical hydrological mechanisms into account do not require large historical observations and parameters are easy to calculate previous studies reviewed the developments of different budyko equations and their wide applications in different fields gerrits et al 2009 wang et al 2016 comparing the attribution results of other methods i e hydrological modeling the reliability of attribution results using different budyko equations based on budyko framework methods has been tested in many case studies han et al 2019 zheng et al 2009 luan et al 2021 jiang et al 2015 the climate elasticity analysis method waggoner 1990 and the decomposition method wang and hejazi 2011 are two representative budyko framework based approaches however these two methods have limitations when applying the climate elasticity analysis method the changes in annual streamflow caused by human activities are completely limited by the availability of streamflow observations ma et al 2008 regarding the decomposition method the climate drying index is taken as an integral indicator causing the inability to obtain the contribution of different climatic variables wang and hejazi 2011 to overcome the above limitations tang and wang 2021 integrated the long term water balance with the budyko framework for considering different effects of major water balance components which thus has the ability of dividing the climate change induced effects into precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow changes and further applying an analytical derivation to estimate human induced changes of mean annual streamflow at the basin scale the lancang river as the upper reach of the mekong river provides abundant freshwater for sustainable socio economic development in the basin and downstream areas over the last few decades climate change has accelerated glacier snow melting in the origin region of the basin barnett et al 2005 leading to complex variability in streamflow moreover human activities including water withdrawal and hydropower resources development through the construction of cascade reservoirs have dramatically changed the natural variability of streamflow in the lancang river basin lrb aiming to ensure the sustainable management of water resources in lrb previous studies have explored streamflow changes and their physical mechanisms in the basin several representative studies are described in table 1 tang et al 2014 applied an artificial neural network model to evaluate the influences of climate change accounting for 45 4 and human activities accounting for 54 6 on the streamflow changes in lrb during 1986 2008 with a baseline period of 1956 1985 in addition the whole evaluation period was divided into a single dam period 1986 1995 and a cascade dam period 1996 2008 climate change and human activities caused a 13 6 and 86 4 change in streamflow in the cascade dam period respectively han et al 2019 identified the abrupt change points of streamflow based on the historical records of dam construction and employed the turc pike equation and the climate elasticity analysis method with a baseline period of 1980 1986 to attribute streamflow changes to climate change accounting for 64 4 and human activities accounting for 36 6 during 1987 2007 compared to 1 4 and 98 6 in the impact period 2008 2014 liu et al 2020 employed the choudhury yang equation and the elastic coefficient method with a baseline period of 1961 2004 and they reported that climate change and human activities caused a 64 4 and 36 6 change in streamflow during 2005 2015 respectively table 1 presents that due to the uses of diverse methods or different data periods especially the choices of different baseline periods the attribution results of streamflow changes in lrb are obviously different among previous studies this difference causes confusion in understanding the complex changes in the streamflow process of the lancang river and its physical causes therefore a more detailed quantitative assessment is required to verify and clarify the influences of methods and data periods especially the baseline period on the attribution of streamflow changes in lrb therefore the objective of this article is to explore streamflow changes in lrb and clarify the influences of climate change and human activities by especially exploring the influences of different budyko equations and different baseline periods to accomplish this we collected hydroclimatic data and streamflow data for 1960 2015 and used a budyko framework based analytical approach to clarify the influences of precipitation potential evapotranspiration as well as human activities on streamflow changes in lrb the specific objectives are to 1 evaluate the performances of eight budyko equations for the streamflow attribution 2 investigate the impacts of different baseline periods on the attribution results and 3 clarify the dominating drivers of streamflow changes in lrb 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the lancang river originates in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau with an altitude above 4000 m above sea level and it flows out of yunnan province in southwestern china shi et al 2013 the lrb 93 48 101 51 e 21 06 33 48 n fig 1 has a drainage area of about 167 000 km2 and the drainage area controlled and monitored by the yunjinghong hydrological station is about 142 000 km2 owing to the monsoon climate conditions sang et al 2016a the precipitation regime in the basin exhibits strong seasonality and can be divided into wet and dry seasons for each year the wet season is generally from june to november accounting for 70 of annual rainfall the dry season december to may has a small amount of precipitation shi et al 2013 jacobs 2002 the abundant but uneven distribution of water resources make the basin sensitive to global climate change pokhrel et al 2018 ma et al 2018 yun et al 2020 besides the vast drop between upstream and downstream has created abundant hydropower resources and 14 cascade hydropower dams have been designed and constructed along the major river channel since the 1980 s zhao et al 2012 the operations of cascade reservoirs can regulate the streamflow variability in the downstream countries throughout the year therefore how to explore the water resources and hydropower resources in the basin has attracted much attention yun et al 2020 the cascade dams on the mainstream and their potential influences on variability of streamflow were investigated in this study and detailed information including the dead storage capacity and total storage capacity is presented in fig 2 2 2 data the observed monthly streamflow data at the yunjinghong hydrological station at the outlet of the basin fig 1 during 1960 2015 fig 2 were collected for this study these data were obtained from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china the monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data covering the whole study area during 1960 2015 were obtained from the climate research unit gridded time series cru ts dataset https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 based on which their areal average annual magnitudes were estimated the dam data including construction period dead storage capacity total storage capacity river closure time and operation time were obtained from the water land and ecosystems research program https wle mekong cgiar org dams data and decisions the land use data for the basin in 1980 2005 and 2015 with a 1 km spatial resolution were collected from the resource and environmental science and data center the water withdrawal data for 1998 2015 were obtained from the yangtze river basin and southwest rivers water resources bulletin which contains the total annual water withdrawal data for the basin the water withdrawal data before 1998 were obtained through linear regression analysis all these data were employed to investigate the physical causes of streamflow changes in lrb 3 methods 3 1 identiﬁcation of breakpoints in streamﬂow the mann kendall mk nonparametric test sang et al 2018 xie et al 2019 was applied to detect the breakpoint in the annual streamflow time series at the yunjinghong hydrological station during 1960 2015 actually accurately identifying breakpoints in streamflow is difficult since there are complex interactions between climate change and human activities particularly the existing dams significantly influenced the variation in streamflow of the lancang river therefore historical records such as periods of dam construction and river closure can provide valuable explanations for the physical causes of the breakpoints identified in the streamflow time series dey and mishra 2017 3 2 budyko framework and eight budyko equations the concept of water balance provides a basic framework for studying the hydrological behavior of a basin theoretically the total precipitation in a basin is described as the sum of actual evapotranspiration streamflow and water storage change at interannual i e 5 10 years or even larger timescales it is usually assumed that the water storage change at the basin scale can be negligible zhang et al 2001 and thus the mean annual actual evapotranspiration e can be estimated as 1 e p q where p is the mean annual precipitation and q is the mean annual streamflow budyko 1961 supposed that the partitioning of p was initially controlled by the ratio of the potential evapotranspiration denoted as e 0 to p aridity index i e e 0 p furthermore budyko 1974 developed a function to characterize the observed relationship between e 0 p and the evapotranspiration ratio e p subsequently several budyko equations were developed and improved to enhance this function eight budyko equations that are extensively used in the attribution of streamflow change were applied in this study to clarify their different efficiencies and to further enhance the accuracy of the attribution results their detailed information is briefly described in table 2 the first four equations are non parametric and the other four are parametric equations wang et al 2016a carmona et al 2014 mianabadi et al 2020 wang et al 2016b sposito 2017 renner et al 2012 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 3 3 analytical attribution of streamflow changes the changes in average streamflow dq can be described by eq 10 10 dq dp de where dp is the change in the average precipitation and de is the change in the average evapotranspiration if eqs 2 9 in table 2 are denoted as e f p e 0 parameter par the differential form of eis 11 de f p dp f e 0 d e 0 f par dpar by substituting eq 11 into eq 10 we obtain 12 dq d q p d q e 0 dpar where 13 d q p 1 f p dp 14 d q e 0 f e 0 d e 0 and 15 d q par f par dpar in eqs 12 15 d q p and d q e 0 are the changes of streamflow calculated by changes of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively both of them are taken as climate induced streamflow change i e d q c d q p d q e 0 in these equations the human induced streamflow changes can be represented by changes of parameter values and thus d q par reflects the human activity caused changes in streamflow for the non parametric equations i e eqs 2 5 the mean annual precipitation potential evaporation and streamflow observation data for the different periods were input in eq 12 and their influences on streamflow changes were estimated without considering the changes in parameters for the four parametric equations i e eqs 6 9 the parameters during the different periods were estimated according to observed data and then they were input in eq 12 to calculate the streamflow changes induced by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and human activities note that the eight equations in table 2 provide different attribution results when using eq 12 since they use different methods to calculate dq dp dq d e 0 and dq dpar table a1 the three factors in eq 12 can contribute positively i e increasing or negatively i e decreasing to streamflow variation for comparison their relative contributions are estimated as 16 i q c d q c d q c d q par 100 17 i q par d q par d q c d q par 100 18 i q p d q p d q p d q e 0 i q c 100 19 i q e 0 d q e 0 d q p d q e 0 i q c 100 where i q p i q e 0 i q c and i q par are the relative contributions of precipitation change potential evapotranspiration change climate change and human activities to the total streamflow changes respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 abrupt changes in annual streamflow the breakpoint in the streamflow time series at the yunjinghong hydrological station was detected by the mk test results fig 2 suggested that breakpoint occurred in 2005 when the first large reservoir i e xiaowan dam was constructed and the river channel was intercepted according to the identification results and the dam construction records fig 2 the entire streamflow time series was separated into three parts 1 a baseline period 1960 1985 without dams construction 2 a transition period change period i 1986 2004 with small dams construction and weak changes in streamflow and 3 an impact period change period ii 2005 2015 with large dams construction and notable changes in the streamflow occurred 4 2 performances of eight budyko equations to compare the performances of the eight budyko equations in table 2 observed data including precipitation potential evapotranspiration and streamflow as well the estimated parameters for the three different periods were input in the equations detailed information about these data are presented in table 3 which shows that precipitation and potential evaporation conditions among the three periods were not significantly different however the observed streamflow significantly decreased in the impact period compared to the first two periods implying that human activities exerted a significant influence the mean annual streamflow in the transition period and the impact period decreased by 6 2 mm 1 5 and 79 7 mm 18 2 respectively compared to the observed streamflow in the baseline period fig 3 presents the results of contribution to streamflow changes in lrb the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow change yellow column in fig 3 was negative in both the transition period and the impact period because the potential evapotranspiration was larger than that in the baseline period comparatively the precipitation induced streamflow change red column in fig 3 was positive during the transition period while its effect was negative in the impact period the human activity induced change in streamflow green column in fig 3 was negative in both the transition period and the impact period thus human activities were the major cause of streamflow decrease during these two periods moreover fig 3 indicates that the results by using the four non parametric equations were similar and they differed from those of the four parametric equations specifically during the transition period period i a positive dqobs was estimated using the non parametric equations except for the turc pike equation while the observed streamflow decreased by 6 2 mm black dotted line in the top panel in fig 3 the qobs values estimated by using the non parametric equations during the impact period period ii ranged from 28 7 mm schreiber to 12 4 mm turc pike while they underestimated the decrease in the observed streamflow with a decrease of 79 7 mm red dotted line in the bottom panel in fig 3 this was mainly due to the disadvantages of non parametric equations that is they do not use proper parameters to represent the role of human activities based on the parametric equations the estimated qobs ranged from 7 0 mm m c y to 5 0 mm fu during the transition period which is similar to the observed streamflow decrease of 6 2 mm the results obtained using eqs 8 and 9 were slightly better than those using the other two parametric equations during the impact period the estimated qobs ranged from 85 9 mm m c y to 71 2 mm fu which is also similar to the observed streamflow decrease of 79 7 mm results showed that the parametric budyko equations performed better than did the non parametric budyko equations for the attribution of streamflow changes in lrb and the m c y s and wang and tang s budyko equations performed better than the other six equations table 4 presents the relative contributions to the streamflow change evaluated using the parametric budyko equations obviously the streamflow decrease is primarily attributable to human activities both in the transition period and the impact period followed by precipitation precipitation and human activities during the impact period had less influence on streamflow decrease than during the transition period while the influence of potential evapotranspiration become bigger during the impact period 4 3 influence of baseline period on quantitative results based on the above results the m c y budyko equation performed well and thus it was used to further investigate the influence of different baseline periods on the attribution results of streamflow change note that similar results are provided by using the other parametric equations fig 4 shows the attribution of streamflow change for five different baseline periods for the transition period left panel in fig 4 when the baseline period of 1960 1985 or 1965 1985 was used climate change played a positive role for the streamflow decrease while human activities had the opposite effect and were the dominant factor results for the baseline periods of 1970 1985 and 1975 1985 showed that both climate change and human activities positively caused an increase in streamflow in the transition period which is different from the results obtained from the first two baseline periods in addition the streamflow change was primarily controlled by the human activities when the baseline period of 1970 1985 was used while climate change was the dominant factor when 1975 1985 was selected as the baseline period when using a short baseline period of only six years 1980 1985 results indicated that both climate change and human activities played a negative role in the streamflow decrease during the impact period right panel in fig 4 similar results were obtained when using the five baseline periods that is both climate change and human activities caused the decrease in streamflow and the latter was the dominant factor overall it was found that the attribution results of streamflow decrease for the transition period varied considerably when different baseline periods were used but similar results were obtained for the impact period this implies a large influence of the choice of baseline periods on the attribution of streamflow change in lrb regarding different influences of baseline periods between the transition period and the impact period it may be due to the obviously different variability of streamflow in the two periods during the transition period the variability of streamflow was similar as that in the baseline period see fig 2 and the construction of small dams caused weak changes in streamflow whose attribution would be sensitive to the choice of baseline periods however streamflow during the impact period obviously differed from that in the former two sub periods and significantly decreased also see fig 2 and the effects of construction of large dams as the dominant driver of streamflow decrease was much stronger than the climate change effects causing its insensitivity of attribution to the choice of baseline periods 4 4 discussion attribution of streamflow changes is the key to understanding the complex variability of streamflow and to providing useful guidance for the prediction and management of freshwater resources berghuijs et al 2017 yaseen et al 2019 yang et al 2014 anand et al 2018 results of this study revealed that when employing the budyko framework based analytical approach the attribution results of streamflow change in lrb were influenced by the choice of the budyko equation used and were even more strongly influenced by the selection of an appropriate baseline period that is the length of the baseline period applied here the measured data from the study area including data on water withdrawal dam construction and land use variations were collected to verify the plausibility of human activity induced streamflow changes these results also provide an evidence for judging the reasonability of a suitable baseline period table 5 shows the land use types and their changes water withdrawal and dead reservoir storage during the three periods compared to the baseline period land use during the transition period and the impact period changed by 0 6 and 0 7 respectively which was derived from the cumulative sum of area changes for each land use type this result coincides with the findings of li et al 2017 who reported that the land use change was only 0 57 during 2000 2010 in the mekong river basin meanwhile water withdrawal increased by about 2 5 mm and 4 1 mm in the transition and the impact period respectively compared to the situation in the baseline period furthermore the dead reservoir storage increased to 16 3 mm and 172 7 mm during the transition and the impact period respectively fig 2 consequently it is concluded that the construction of reservoirs had a negative effect on the streamflow change and was the dominant driver causing the streamflow decrease in lrb based on the above results it was known that human activities played a negative role in the streamflow change in the transition period and thus the positive attribution obtained using baseline periods of 1970 1985 and 1975 1985 is unreasonable the baseline period of 1980 1985 was too short to guarantee the credibility of the attribution results comparatively the attribution results based on the baseline periods of 1960 1985 and 1965 1985 could be more reasonable and feasible meanwhile some unreasonable attributions of the streamflow change in lrb reported in previous studies table 1 can be explained for example tang et al 2014 chose 1956 1985 as the baseline period which should be reasonable however they only used the streamflow data before 2008 based on which the influences of xiaowan completed in 2010 and nuozhadu completed in 2014 reservoirs were not considered this resulted in an overestimation of the climate change effects but an underestimation of human activities results of han et al 2019 with 1980 1986 as the baseline period are little different from the results based on 1980 1985 in fig 4 but they may underestimate the negative effects of human activities during the transition period these biased results were mainly caused by the use of a short baseline period as discussed above both liu et al 2020 and yu et al 2019 chose 1961 2004 as the baseline period and they reported that climate change played a leading role in the streamflow decrease during the evaluation period however it should be noted that the construction of dams began in 1986 and thus the choice of 1961 2014 as the baseline period was not reliable leading to an inevitable bias in the attribution of streamflow decrease in lrb finally it is pointed out that we focused on separating the precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human activity induced streamflow changes in the lancang river basin where water withdrawal and construction of cascade reservoirs were the major types of human activities however we did not consider the potential interactions between climate change and human activities for example the landcover changes could be caused by both climate change and human activities and their interactions which would be difficult to clarify in the lancang river basin the landcover changes were much weaker over the last three decades see table 5 which could not influence the reliability of the results in table 4 obtained in this study in the future the development of hydrological models that consider climatic change and anthropogenic interactions and their feedbacks within the framework of the earth system model is suggested to further clarify the effects of dominating drivers to streamflow changes in lrb 5 conclusions in this article we used the budyko framework based analytical approach with eight budyko equations to investigate the influences of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and human activities on the streamflow decrease in lrb during 1960 2015 results showed that the parametric budyko equations performed better than did the non parametric budyko equations because the former use proper parameters to reflect the changes in catchment characteristics including human activities and their influences among the eight budyko equations m c y s and wang and tang s budyko equations had greater accuracy than had the others moreover the results of attribution of streamflow changes were more reasonable when a longer baseline period at least 20 years was used it was found that human activities played a dominant role accounting for 158 9 in the streamflow decrease in the transition period 1986 2004 although climate change had a smaller offsetting effect accounting for 58 9 during the impact period 2005 2015 human activities still played a dominant role accounting for 65 6 in the streamflow decrease and climate change accounting for 34 4 further aggravated the streamflow decrease in lrb finally it should be noted that budyko framework based approach can only be used to attribute streamflow changes at the interannual scale however the attribution of seasonal and monthly streamflow changes should be further explored in future studies in addition hydrological models can also be used as a reference to verify the reasonability of the results in this study although the model results may have large biases and uncertainties in basins with strong human activities besides investigation of the baseline period and its influence on the streamflow attribution can be conducted in other basins to better understand streamflow variability under different human activities and geographical and climatic settings credit authorship contribution statement all the authors contributed extensively to the work presented in this article zhen huang conceptualization formal analysis methodology visualization

dam period 1986 1995 and a cascade dam period 1996 2008 climate change and human activities caused a 13 6 and 86 4 change in streamflow in the cascade dam period respectively han et al 2019 identified the abrupt change points of streamflow based on the historical records of dam construction and employed the turc pike equation and the climate elasticity analysis method with a baseline period of 1980 1986 to attribute streamflow changes to climate change accounting for 64 4 and human activities accounting for 36 6 during 1987 2007 compared to 1 4 and 98 6 in the impact period 2008 2014 liu et al 2020 employed the choudhury yang equation and the elastic coefficient method with a baseline period of 1961 2004 and they reported that climate change and human activities caused a 64 4 and 36 6 change in streamflow during 2005 2015 respectively table 1 presents that due to the uses of diverse methods or different data periods especially the choices of different baseline periods the attribution results of streamflow changes in lrb are obviously different among previous studies this difference causes confusion in understanding the complex changes in the streamflow process of the lancang river and its physical causes therefore a more detailed quantitative assessment is required to verify and clarify the influences of methods and data periods especially the baseline period on the attribution of streamflow changes in lrb therefore the objective of this article is to explore streamflow changes in lrb and clarify the influences of climate change and human activities by especially exploring the influences of different budyko equations and different baseline periods to accomplish this we collected hydroclimatic data and streamflow data for 1960 2015 and used a budyko framework based analytical approach to clarify the influences of precipitation potential evapotranspiration as well as human activities on streamflow changes in lrb the specific objectives are to 1 evaluate the performances of eight budyko equations for the streamflow attribution 2 investigate the impacts of different baseline periods on the attribution results and 3 clarify the dominating drivers of streamflow changes in lrb 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the lancang river originates in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau with an altitude above 4000 m above sea level and it flows out of yunnan province in southwestern china shi et al 2013 the lrb 93 48 101 51 e 21 06 33 48 n fig 1 has a drainage area of about 167 000 km2 and the drainage area controlled and monitored by the yunjinghong hydrological station is about 142 000 km2 owing to the monsoon climate conditions sang et al 2016a the precipitation regime in the basin exhibits strong seasonality and can be divided into wet and dry seasons for each year the wet season is generally from june to november accounting for 70 of annual rainfall the dry season december to may has a small amount of precipitation shi et al 2013 jacobs 2002 the abundant but uneven distribution of water resources make the basin sensitive to global climate change pokhrel et al 2018 ma et al 2018 yun et al 2020 besides the vast drop between upstream and downstream has created abundant hydropower resources and 14 cascade hydropower dams have been designed and constructed along the major river channel since the 1980 s zhao et al 2012 the operations of cascade reservoirs can regulate the streamflow variability in the downstream countries throughout the year therefore how to explore the water resources and hydropower resources in the basin has attracted much attention yun et al 2020 the cascade dams on the mainstream and their potential influences on variability of streamflow were investigated in this study and detailed information including the dead storage capacity and total storage capacity is presented in fig 2 2 2 data the observed monthly streamflow data at the yunjinghong hydrological station at the outlet of the basin fig 1 during 1960 2015 fig 2 were collected for this study these data were obtained from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china the monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data covering the whole study area during 1960 2015 were obtained from the climate research unit gridded time series cru ts dataset https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 based on which their areal average annual magnitudes were estimated the dam data including construction period dead storage capacity total storage capacity river closure time and operation time were obtained from the water land and ecosystems research program https wle mekong cgiar org dams data and decisions the land use data for the basin in 1980 2005 and 2015 with a 1 km spatial resolution were collected from the resource and environmental science and data center the water withdrawal data for 1998 2015 were obtained from the yangtze river basin and southwest rivers water resources bulletin which contains the total annual water withdrawal data for the basin the water withdrawal data before 1998 were obtained through linear regression analysis all these data were employed to investigate the physical causes of streamflow changes in lrb 3 methods 3 1 identiﬁcation of breakpoints in streamﬂow the mann kendall mk nonparametric test sang et al 2018 xie et al 2019 was applied to detect the breakpoint in the annual streamflow time series at the yunjinghong hydrological station during 1960 2015 actually accurately identifying breakpoints in streamflow is difficult since there are complex interactions between climate change and human activities particularly the existing dams significantly influenced the variation in streamflow of the lancang river therefore historical records such as periods of dam construction and river closure can provide valuable explanations for the physical causes of the breakpoints identified in the streamflow time series dey and mishra 2017 3 2 budyko framework and eight budyko equations the concept of water balance provides a basic framework for studying the hydrological behavior of a basin theoretically the total precipitation in a basin is described as the sum of actual evapotranspiration streamflow and water storage change at interannual i e 5 10 years or even larger timescales it is usually assumed that the water storage change at the basin scale can be negligible zhang et al 2001 and thus the mean annual actual evapotranspiration e can be estimated as 1 e p q where p is the mean annual precipitation and q is the mean annual streamflow budyko 1961 supposed that the partitioning of p was initially controlled by the ratio of the potential evapotranspiration denoted as e 0 to p aridity index i e e 0 p furthermore budyko 1974 developed a function to characterize the observed relationship between e 0 p and the evapotranspiration ratio e p subsequently several budyko equations were developed and improved to enhance this function eight budyko equations that are extensively used in the attribution of streamflow change were applied in this study to clarify their different efficiencies and to further enhance the accuracy of the attribution results their detailed information is briefly described in table 2 the first four equations are non parametric and the other four are parametric equations wang et al 2016a carmona et al 2014 mianabadi et al 2020 wang et al 2016b sposito 2017 renner et al 2012 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 3 3 analytical attribution of streamflow changes the changes in average streamflow dq can be described by eq 10 10 dq dp de where dp is the change in the average precipitation and de is the change in the average evapotranspiration if eqs 2 9 in table 2 are denoted as e f p e 0 parameter par the differential form of eis 11 de f p dp f e 0 d e 0 f par dpar by substituting eq 11 into eq 10 we obtain 12 dq d q p d q e 0 dpar where 13 d q p 1 f p dp 14 d q e 0 f e 0 d e 0 and 15 d q par f par dpar in eqs 12 15 d q p and d q e 0 are the changes of streamflow calculated by changes of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively both of them are taken as climate induced streamflow change i e d q c d q p d q e 0 in these equations the human induced streamflow changes can be represented by changes of parameter values and thus d q par reflects the human activity caused changes in streamflow for the non parametric equations i e eqs 2 5 the mean annual precipitation potential evaporation and streamflow observation data for the different periods were input in eq 12 and their influences on streamflow changes were estimated without considering the changes in parameters for the four parametric equations i e eqs 6 9 the parameters during the different periods were estimated according to observed data and then they were input in eq 12 to calculate the streamflow changes induced by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and human activities note that the eight equations in table 2 provide different attribution results when using eq 12 since they use different methods to calculate dq dp dq d e 0 and dq dpar table a1 the three factors in eq 12 can contribute positively i e increasing or negatively i e decreasing to streamflow variation for comparison their relative contributions are estimated as 16 i q c d q c d q c d q par 100 17 i q par d q par d q c d q par 100 18 i q p d q p d q p d q e 0 i q c 100 19 i q e 0 d q e 0 d q p d q e 0 i q c 100 where i q p i q e 0 i q c and i q par are the relative contributions of precipitation change potential evapotranspiration change climate change and human activities to the total streamflow changes respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 abrupt changes in annual streamflow the breakpoint in the streamflow time series at the yunjinghong hydrological station was detected by the mk test results fig 2 suggested that breakpoint occurred in 2005 when the first large reservoir i e xiaowan dam was constructed and the river channel was intercepted according to the identification results and the dam construction records fig 2 the entire streamflow time series was separated into three parts 1 a baseline period 1960 1985 without dams construction 2 a transition period change period i 1986 2004 with small dams construction and weak changes in streamflow and 3 an impact period change period ii 2005 2015 with large dams construction and notable changes in the streamflow occurred 4 2 performances of eight budyko equations to compare the performances of the eight budyko equations in table 2 observed data including precipitation potential evapotranspiration and streamflow as well the estimated parameters for the three different periods were input in the equations detailed information about these data are presented in table 3 which shows that precipitation and potential evaporation conditions among the three periods were not significantly different however the observed streamflow significantly decreased in the impact period compared to the first two periods implying that human activities exerted a significant influence the mean annual streamflow in the transition period and the impact period decreased by 6 2 mm 1 5 and 79 7 mm 18 2 respectively compared to the observed streamflow in the baseline period fig 3 presents the results of contribution to streamflow changes in lrb the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow change yellow column in fig 3 was negative in both the transition period and the impact period because the potential evapotranspiration was larger than that in the baseline period comparatively the precipitation induced streamflow change red column in fig 3 was positive during the transition period while its effect was negative in the impact period the human activity induced change in streamflow green column in fig 3 was negative in both the transition period and the impact period thus human activities were the major cause of streamflow decrease during these two periods moreover fig 3 indicates that the results by using the four non parametric equations were similar and they differed from those of the four parametric equations specifically during the transition period period i a positive dqobs was estimated using the non parametric equations except for the turc pike equation while the observed streamflow decreased by 6 2 mm black dotted line in the top panel in fig 3 the qobs values estimated by using the non parametric equations during the impact period period ii ranged from 28 7 mm schreiber to 12 4 mm turc pike while they underestimated the decrease in the observed streamflow with a decrease of 79 7 mm red dotted line in the bottom panel in fig 3 this was mainly due to the disadvantages of non parametric equations that is they do not use proper parameters to represent the role of human activities based on the parametric equations the estimated qobs ranged from 7 0 mm m c y to 5 0 mm fu during the transition period which is similar to the observed streamflow decrease of 6 2 mm the results obtained using eqs 8 and 9 were slightly better than those using the other two parametric equations during the impact period the estimated qobs ranged from 85 9 mm m c y to 71 2 mm fu which is also similar to the observed streamflow decrease of 79 7 mm results showed that the parametric budyko equations performed better than did the non parametric budyko equations for the attribution of streamflow changes in lrb and the m c y s and wang and tang s budyko equations performed better than the other six equations table 4 presents the relative contributions to the streamflow change evaluated using the parametric budyko equations obviously the streamflow decrease is primarily attributable to human activities both in the transition period and the impact period followed by precipitation precipitation and human activities during the impact period had less influence on streamflow decrease than during the transition period while the influence of potential evapotranspiration become bigger during the impact period 4 3 influence of baseline period on quantitative results based on the above results the m c y budyko equation performed well and thus it was used to further investigate the influence of different baseline periods on the attribution results of streamflow change note that similar results are provided by using the other parametric equations fig 4 shows the attribution of streamflow change for five different baseline periods for the transition period left panel in fig 4 when the baseline period of 1960 1985 or 1965 1985 was used climate change played a positive role for the streamflow decrease while human activities had the opposite effect and were the dominant factor results for the baseline periods of 1970 1985 and 1975 1985 showed that both climate change and human activities positively caused an increase in streamflow in the transition period which is different from the results obtained from the first two baseline periods in addition the streamflow change was primarily controlled by the human activities when the baseline period of 1970 1985 was used while climate change was the dominant factor when 1975 1985 was selected as the baseline period when using a short baseline period of only six years 1980 1985 results indicated that both climate change and human activities played a negative role in the streamflow decrease during the impact period right panel in fig 4 similar results were obtained when using the five baseline periods that is both climate change and human activities caused the decrease in streamflow and the latter was the dominant factor overall it was found that the attribution results of streamflow decrease for the transition period varied considerably when different baseline periods were used but similar results were obtained for the impact period this implies a large influence of the choice of baseline periods on the attribution of streamflow change in lrb regarding different influences of baseline periods between the transition period and the impact period it may be due to the obviously different variability of streamflow in the two periods during the transition period the variability of streamflow was similar as that in the baseline period see fig 2 and the construction of small dams caused weak changes in streamflow whose attribution would be sensitive to the choice of baseline periods however streamflow during the impact period obviously differed from that in the former two sub periods and significantly decreased also see fig 2 and the effects of construction of large dams as the dominant driver of streamflow decrease was much stronger than the climate change effects causing its insensitivity of attribution to the choice of baseline periods 4 4 discussion attribution of streamflow changes is the key to understanding the complex variability of streamflow and to providing useful guidance for the prediction and management of freshwater resources berghuijs et al 2017 yaseen et al 2019 yang et al 2014 anand et al 2018 results of this study revealed that when employing the budyko framework based analytical approach the attribution results of streamflow change in lrb were influenced by the choice of the budyko equation used and were even more strongly influenced by the selection of an appropriate baseline period that is the length of the baseline period applied here the measured data from the study area including data on water withdrawal dam construction and land use variations were collected to verify the plausibility of human activity induced streamflow changes these results also provide an evidence for judging the reasonability of a suitable baseline period table 5 shows the land use types and their changes water withdrawal and dead reservoir storage during the three periods compared to the baseline period land use during the transition period and the impact period changed by 0 6 and 0 7 respectively which was derived from the cumulative sum of area changes for each land use type this result coincides with the findings of li et al 2017 who reported that the land use change was only 0 57 during 2000 2010 in the mekong river basin meanwhile water withdrawal increased by about 2 5 mm and 4 1 mm in the transition and the impact period respectively compared to the situation in the baseline period furthermore the dead reservoir storage increased to 16 3 mm and 172 7 mm during the transition and the impact period respectively fig 2 consequently it is concluded that the construction of reservoirs had a negative effect on the streamflow change and was the dominant driver causing the streamflow decrease in lrb based on the above results it was known that human activities played a negative role in the streamflow change in the transition period and thus the positive attribution obtained using baseline periods of 1970 1985 and 1975 1985 is unreasonable the baseline period of 1980 1985 was too short to guarantee the credibility of the attribution results comparatively the attribution results based on the baseline periods of 1960 1985 and 1965 1985 could be more reasonable and feasible meanwhile some unreasonable attributions of the streamflow change in lrb reported in previous studies table 1 can be explained for example tang et al 2014 chose 1956 1985 as the baseline period which should be reasonable however they only used the streamflow data before 2008 based on which the influences of xiaowan completed in 2010 and nuozhadu completed in 2014 reservoirs were not considered this resulted in an overestimation of the climate change effects but an underestimation of human activities results of han et al 2019 with 1980 1986 as the baseline period are little different from the results based on 1980 1985 in fig 4 but they may underestimate the negative effects of human activities during the transition period these biased results were mainly caused by the use of a short baseline period as discussed above both liu et al 2020 and yu et al 2019 chose 1961 2004 as the baseline period and they reported that climate change played a leading role in the streamflow decrease during the evaluation period however it should be noted that the construction of dams began in 1986 and thus the choice of 1961 2014 as the baseline period was not reliable leading to an inevitable bias in the attribution of streamflow decrease in lrb finally it is pointed out that we focused on separating the precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human activity induced streamflow changes in the lancang river basin where water withdrawal and construction of cascade reservoirs were the major types of human activities however we did not consider the potential interactions between climate change and human activities for example the landcover changes could be caused by both climate change and human activities and their interactions which would be difficult to clarify in the lancang river basin the landcover changes were much weaker over the last three decades see table 5 which could not influence the reliability of the results in table 4 obtained in this study in the future the development of hydrological models that consider climatic change and anthropogenic interactions and their feedbacks within the framework of the earth system model is suggested to further clarify the effects of dominating drivers to streamflow changes in lrb 5 conclusions in this article we used the budyko framework based analytical approach with eight budyko equations to investigate the influences of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and human activities on the streamflow decrease in lrb during 1960 2015 results showed that the parametric budyko equations performed better than did the non parametric budyko equations because the former use proper parameters to reflect the changes in catchment characteristics including human activities and their influences among the eight budyko equations m c y s and wang and tang s budyko equations had greater accuracy than had the others moreover the results of attribution of streamflow changes were more reasonable when a longer baseline period at least 20 years was used it was found that human activities played a dominant role accounting for 158 9 in the streamflow decrease in the transition period 1986 2004 although climate change had a smaller offsetting effect accounting for 58 9 during the impact period 2005 2015 human activities still played a dominant role accounting for 65 6 in the streamflow decrease and climate change accounting for 34 4 further aggravated the streamflow decrease in lrb finally it should be noted that budyko framework based approach can only be used to attribute streamflow changes at the interannual scale however the attribution of seasonal and monthly streamflow changes should be further explored in future studies in addition hydrological models can also be used as a reference to verify the reasonability of the results in this study although the model results may have large biases and uncertainties in basins with strong human activities besides investigation of the baseline period and its influence on the streamflow attribution can be conducted in other basins to better understand streamflow variability under different human activities and geographical and climatic settings credit authorship contribution statement all the authors contributed extensively to the work presented in this article zhen huang conceptualization formal analysis methodology visualization

7624,study region the yiluo river basin between the sanmenxia dam and the huayuankou station of the yellow river basin study focus the current research is designed to spatially identify different driving factors contributions to natural runoff variation the water and energy transfer process model was used to simulate the runoff of 2044 sub basins based on this trends of runoff variation were analyzed and then the mutation year of runoff variation in each sub basin was detected moreover the contribution rate of climatic variation and anthropogenic factors on runoff change in each sub basin was quantified new hydrological insights for the region the annual natural runoff in 90 66 of sub basins and the flood season may to october natural runoff in 45 99 of sub basins showed declining trends and the mutation year of runoff change mostly occurred in the 1970 s and 1980 s the natural runoff change was primarily affected by climatic variation the contribution rate of climate to the annual and flood season natural runoff was 69 32 and 71 51 respectively while the contribution of man made activities to the annual and the flood season natural runoff was 30 68 and 28 49 respectively and the high impact areas were largely distributed downstream the research provides scientific support for developing and regulating water and land resources in the yiluo river basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords water and energy transfer process model climate change land use change contribution mutation diagnosis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under the confounding impacts of climatic variation and anthropogenic activities the terrestrial water cycle is changing dramatically bringing great threats to exploiting and utilizing water resources gbohoui et al 2021 liu et al 2020a setti et al 2020 abhishek and kinouchi 2022 climate variation gives rise to changes in the key water cycle processes including precipitation and evapotranspiration which fundamentally affect the quantity composition and spatio temporal distribution of regional water resources grantham et al 2018 yang et al 2019 anthropogenic activities have altered the water cycle processes through the underlying surface construction then affected the process of water yield and consumption guo et al 2020 khand and senay 2021 zhang and yu 2021 in recent years runoff in major basins worldwide has shown a decreasing trend which will continue in the coming years weiland et al 2011 tang and lettenmaier 2012 for example xiong et al quantified the annual runoff coefficient variability during 1985 2014 in 433 major global river basins and discussed their drivers xiong et al 2022 similarly abhishek et al highlighted the importance of human activities reservoir management and groundwater irrigation in the chao phraya river basin which is highly vulnerable to droughts and more importantly floods abhishek sayama 2021 in the context of climate warming and intensified activities of humankind it has instructive meanings to identify the influences of different factors on runoff for developing watershed water and land resources the common methods of contribution separation on runoff variation include the empirical statistics method q zhang et al 2017 h zhang et al 2017 shaukat et al 2020 the elastic method yang et al 2014 bissenbayeva et al 2021 and the hydrological model method farsi and mahjouri 2019 wu et al 2020 xue et al based on the mann kendall m k test and the dual mass curve model noted that man made activities contributed 88 72 to the streamflow reduction in shiyang river basin during 1960 2018 while climate change contributed only 11 28 xue et al 2021 liu et al adopted the budyko framework believed that the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration contributed 45 64 and 13 91 to the streamflow fluctuation in the lancang river basin during 1961 2015 and human activities contributed 40 45 liu et al 2020b compared to the previous two methods the hydrological model with physical mechanism had obvious superiorities it can better simulate the influence of different factors on runoff wu et al 2017 zhai tao 2017 yang et al employed the water and energy transfer process wep model discussed that climate change contributed 71 5 81 7 to the streamflow variation in the nagqu river basin and man made activities contributed 18 3 28 5 yang et al 2020 concerning the attribution identification method on runoff by the hydrological model it s crucial to detect the mutation year different hydrological unit showed runoff variation diversity however previous studies used the areal precipitation or the runoff of a single hydrological station to detect the mutation year rather than using different computational units treating the whole basin as a single unit of analysis may not reflect the spatial heterogeneity the innovations of our study are 1 sub basin generating by the precise river network was used as the fundamental computational units and the runoff of each sub basin was simulated by the wep model 2 we also consider features of each sub basin to determine runoff variation detect their mutation year and attribute the causes behind the runoff changes the yellow river is the second largest river in china and the natural runoff of the basin has decreased by about 20 in the past 60 years yang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 scholars have conducted extensive studies to quantitatively separate the contributions of climatic variation and human activities on runoff of the yellow river basin and its sub basins wu et al 2017 q zhang et al 2017 h zhang et al 2017 ji et al 2022 wang et al 2020 studies have shown that the change in the underlying surface caused by human activities was the leading cause of runoff change in the yellow river basin the contribution rate of such anthropogenic activities accounted for 62 9 88 7 in the basin ni et al 2022b however the runoff change showed great spatial heterogeneity in the yellow river basin the runoff variation in the headstream of the basin was mainly induced by climatic variability su et al 2021 chu et al 2019 yan et al 2020 human activities were the dominant factors of the streamflow reduction in the middle and lower reaches such as the wuding river basin wei river basin and yanhe river basin yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 ni et al 2022a nevertheless few studies conducted the spatially attribution identification of natural runoff change at present stage our research focused on the yiluo river basin being the largest tributary with relatively rich water resources in the middle yellow river basin between the sanmenxia dam and the huayuankou station the basin is located in the transition zone of the yangtze river basin the huaihe river basin and the yellow river basin and it is extremely sensitive to climate change the upstream area of the basin is covered with forests the mid stream consists of a loess plateau with sparse vegetation and areas with serious soil erosion plain areas dominate the downstream area with high urbanization and flood risk due to climate variation vegetation rehabilitation and construction expansion in recent years the natural runoff of the basin is changing dramatically liu et al 2009 wang et al 2019 the current research aims to spatially analyze the tendency of natural runoff variation and identify the contributions of climatic variation and anthropogenic activities on natural streamflow in the yiluo river basin 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yiluo river basin 109 43 113 10 e and 33 39 34 54 n occupies approximately 18 874 63 km2 and involves more than 20 counties of henan and shaanxi province fig 1 the main stream of the luo river originates from shaanxi province with a whole length of 446 9 km the multi year average natural runoff is 51 53 m3 s baimasi station in recent 60 years of which 16 27 m3 s lingkou station is in shaanxi province the yi river originates in henan province with a whole length of 264 8 km and the multi year average natural runoff is 26 82 m3 s longmenzhen station below yangcun luoyang city is the yiluo river which enters the yellow river at gongyi city and the multi year average natural runoff is 82 84 m3 s heishiguan station the yiluo river basin pertains to the continental monsoon climate being cold with little rain in winter and hot with a lot of rain in summer the annual average temperature is 13 09 and the annual average rainfall is 688 1 mm the rainfall is mainly concentrated in the may to october season contributing more than 80 of the annual precipitation 2 2 data the collected data in this study covers the meteorological and hydrological data the underlying surface data the river network data and the socioeconomic data of the yiluo river basin table 1 2 3 methods the research workflow of this article includes model simulation trend analysis mutation diagnosis and attribution identification fig 2 firstly the wep model was constructed based on the hydro meteorological data the underlying surface data and the river network data then the proposed model was calibrated and validated and the annual and the flood season natural runoff of 2044 sub basins were simulated from 1961 to 2020 secondly the m k method was applied to recognize the annual and the flood season natural runoff fluctuation in each sub basin meanwhile the m k test and the sliding t test were incorporated to detect the mutation point of natural streamflow in each sub basin thirdly the contributions of climate variation and man made activities to the annual and the flood season natural runoff in each sub basin were quantified by the attribution identification method 1 wep model our study applied the wep model to simulate the natural streamflow in the yiluo river basin the model was a terrestrial hydrological model with unified physical mechanism which combined modeling of the energy transfer and the hydrological process the wep model was developed by professor yangwen jia jia et al 2001 which has been widely applied in japan south korea the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin in china jia et al 2006 liu et al 2020c zhou et al 2018 the small sub basin was employed as the fundamental computational units which were obtained by the dem after setting the river network threshold to less than 5 km2 then the yiluo river basin was separated into 2044 sub watersheds with spatial topological relation fig 3 in addition we used land use data for the periods of 1980 2000 and 2020 the land use data of 1980 was used to represent the times before 1980 the periods between 1981 and 2000 and 2000 2020 were represented by the land use datasets of 2000 and 2020 respectively 2 trend analysis the m k test is a non parametric test method which is a powerful model to estimate the tendency of meteorological and hydrological data tian et al 2017 nie et al 2019 in this article the m k trend test was applied to analyze the trends of natural runoff variation we used a 30 year moving window to eliminate the influence of random fluctuation of selected periods the window slides annually and accumulates 31 data periods in 1961 2020 based on this the trends of the natural runoff variation were carried out and most of the trend intensity types in the results were taken as the trend values in general the trends of natural runoff variation were determined by different statistical significance levels strongly significant tendency p 0 05 significant tendency 0 05 p 0 1 and insignificant tendency p 0 1 the p value is the significance level 3 mutation diagnosis in the present study the m k test and the sliding t test were combined to detect the rainfall and streamflow mutation year the sliding t test diagnosed the mutation year by examining whether the average discrepancies between two groups samples were significant which can identify the effective mutation points more accurately hu et al 2020 for the purpose of improving the credibility and validity of the calculation results the two techniques were incorporated to identify the mutation year of precipitation and streamflow in the yiluo river basin during 1961 2020 all the results of mutation diagnosis met the statistical significance levels of p 0 1 and the results including five cases 1 if the m k test detected multiple mutation points the same value of the m k test and the sliding t test result was defined as the effective mutation point 2 if the m k test detected multiple mutation points and there was no identical value between the m k test and the sliding t test result the latter result was used as the effective mutation point 3 if the m k test detected only one mutation point and the results was inconsistent with the sliding t test the m k test result was used as the effective mutation point 4 if the m k test detected no mutation point while the sliding t test detected one the sliding t test result was used as the effective mutation point 5 if neither the m k test nor the sliding t test had a mutation point it meant that there was no mutation of runoff 4 attribution identification in order to quantitatively identify the impacts of different driving factors on natural runoff the research stage was divided into the reference phase and the variation phase by the mutation year then the wep model was used to separate the contribution proportion of climate variation and man made activities on natural streamflow by inputting the data in different periods the specific steps are 1 the natural streamflow in the reference phase was obtained by inputting the meteorological and underlying surface data in the reference phase 2 the natural streamflow affected by climate change was obtained by inputting the meteorological data in the variation phase and the land use data in the reference phase 3 the natural streamflow in the variation phase was obtained by inputting the meteorological and land use data in the variation phase the method of attribution identification is calculated as below sun et al 2019 gao et al 2020 1 η h r hc r c r hc r c r c r n 2 η c r c r n r hc r c r c r n where r c stands for the natural runoff affected by climate change r n stands for the natural streamflow in the reference phase r hc stands for the natural streamflow in the variation phase η h and η c refer to the contributions of climatic variation and man made activities to natural streamflow 3 results 3 1 wep model calibration and verification the m k and sliding t test were applied to detect the abrupt change year of average annual precipitation in the yiluo river basin the year 1985 was selected as the mutation year consequently 1961 1985 was chosen as the model calibration phase and 1986 2020 was set as the model validation phase the evaluation criteria were the r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative error re a simulation is better when r2 and nse values approach 1 and re approach 0 the wep model was used to simulate monthly natural streamflow in the basin four stations named lingkou baimasi longmenzhen and heishiguan were selected for calibration and verification in addition the model parameters were adjusted to achieve better simulation table 2 shows the optimized parameters of the wep model for the considered hydrological stations the soil surface thickness stomatal resistance and depression storage were the most sensitive parameters the natural runoff simulation results indicated that the r2 exceeded 0 86 the nse exceeded 0 72 and the re was between 1 13 5 87 in the calibration period during the verification period the r2 exceeded 0 8 the nse exceeded 0 65 and the re was between 8 28 0 80 table 3 fig 4 our study further verified the evaporation simulation effects being realized by comparing the wep model simulation evaporation with the gldas evaporation the results showed that the r2 exceeded 0 75 the nse exceeded 0 55 and the re was between 10 83 1 49 in the calibration period and during the verification period the r2 exceeded 0 77 the nse exceeded 0 52 and the re was between 15 75 8 02 table 3 fig 5 it can be seen that the proposed model in the yiluo river basin has better simulation effects and can be used for further calculation 3 2 trends of the water balance components variation the m k method was applied to analyze the spatial variation of the annual and flood season water balance components in the 2044 sub basins we found that the annual natural runoff in 90 02 of sub basins presented downward trends of which the strongly significant significant and insignificant downward trends accounted for 32 63 0 39 and 57 respectively approximately 9 98 of the sub basins showed insignificant upward trends fig 6a regarding precipitation 85 47 and 14 53 of the sub basins showed insignificant decreasing and increasing trends respectively fig 6b the evaporation in 98 73 of the sub basins showed a significant increasing trend fig 6c and the groundwater reserve in 46 53 and 52 5 of the sub basins showed a decreasing and an insignificant increasing trend respectively fig 6d in terms of the flood season water balance components the natural runoff in 45 99 of sub basins showed declining trends of which the strongly significant and the insignificant declining trends accounted for 0 54 and 45 45 respectively moreover about 54 01 of sub basins showed upward trends of runoff of which the strongly significant and the insignificant upward trends accounted for 0 15 and 53 86 respectively fig 7a regarding the other water balance components the precipitation of 60 76 of sub basins showed an insignificant decreasing trend and 39 24 showed an insignificant increasing trend fig 7b the evaporation in 80 92 of the sub basins showed a significant increasing trend fig 7c the groundwater reserve in 41 68 and 58 32 of the sub basins showed a decreasing and an increasing trend respectively fig 7d 3 3 identification of mutation year the mutation diagnosis of the annual and the flood season natural runoff in 2044 sub basins from 1961 to 2020 was analyzed by the m k test and the sliding t test the results showed that the annual natural runoff in 21 48 of sub basins had no available mutation points p 0 1 were mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of yihe river the mutation year of 32 78 and 21 72 of sub basins occurred in the 1970 s and the 1980 s respectively and mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the basin the others occurred after the 1990 s were mainly distributed in the upper reaches of the basin fig 8a in terms of the flood season natural runoff about 5 82 of sub basins had no available mutation points were scattered in the lower reaches of the basin the mutation year mainly occurred in the 1970 s 42 91 and the 1980 s 30 63 and few occurred after the 1990 s fig 8b based on this the baseline period was defined before the abrupt change year and the variation period was after the abrupt change year a specific analysis will not be carried out below for the sub basins without any available mutation points 3 4 attribution identification based on the attribution identification method we analyzed the contribution of climate variation and man made activities to annual and flood season natural streamflow in 2044 sub basins the results indicated that the average contribution of climate variation to the annual and flood season natural runoff change is 69 32 and 71 51 respectively climate change contributed more than 75 to the annual runoff change in 51 46 of sub basins it also contributed 50 75 of the annual runoff change in 23 3 sub basins less than 50 of climate contribution is observed in 25 24 of sub basins fig 9a during the flood season climate change contributed more than 75 in 54 44 of sub basins 50 75 in 24 47 of sub basins and less than 50 in 21 09 of sub basins fig 9b the average contribution of man made activities to the annual and flood season natural runoff was 30 68 and 28 49 respectively man made activities contributed more than 75 to the annual runoff change in 9 16 sub basins they also contributed 50 75 of the annual runoff change in 16 51 sub basins less than 50 of human related activity contribution is observed in 74 33 of sub basins fig 9c in terms of the flood season natural runoff man made activities contributed more than 75 in 7 53 of sub basins 50 75 in 13 66 of sub basins and less than 50 in 78 81 of sub basins fig 9d 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climatic variation on natural streamflow during the study period the average contribution proportion of climatic variation to the annual and the flood season natural streamflow in the yiluo river basin was 69 32 and 71 51 respectively in the upstream of the watershed the contribution of climatic variation exceeded 75 previous research mainly focused on the contribution identification of the measured runoff we regrouped its contribution rate and found that our research findings were consistent with the previous studies in similar regions the contribution rate of climate change on natural runoff variation in huayuankou station yanhe watershed and jinhe watershed was 73 9 54 1 and 74 26 85 7 respectively wang et al 2022 wu et al 2017 gao et al 2020 our innovation lied in further revealing the spatial heterogeneity of the contribution rate studies have shown that the precipitation intensity and frequency changes directly affect the spatio temporal distribution of natural streamflow liu et al 2013 yuan et al 2018 we further analyzed the consistency of the mutation year of the precipitation runoff the results showed that the mutation years of the annual and flood season precipitation runoff were consistent in 19 23 and 33 61 of the sub basins the annual and flood season precipitation runoff had no mutation points in 4 6 and 1 66 of the sub basins fig 10 the discrepancy of mutation year in these sub basins may be due to precipitation change for instance the respective annual and flood season precipitation decreases by 9 86 and 4 14 mm 10a in the yiluo river basin the annual precipitation in 79 5 of sub basins showed downward trends fig 11a the flood season precipitation in 47 69 of sub basins showed a decreasing trend mainly distributed in the upstream and downstream fig 11b the trend of precipitation was consistent with that of runoff in 40 of the sub basins concurrently more precipitation is allocated to evapotranspiration rather than the streamflow due to climate warming which results in streamflow reduction liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 the spatio temporal discrepancy of temperature change may be another reason for the runoff variability and mutation year heterogeneity the annual and flood season temperatures in the yiluo river basin increased by 0 17 and 0 07 c 10a compared to the reference stage the annual and flood season temperatures increased by 3 48 and 0 49 in the variation period spatially the annual temperature of the whole watershed presented an increasing tendency fig 11c the flood season temperature in 46 55 of sub basins in the middle reaches showed a decreasing trend fig 11d in addition climate warming has led to the frequent occurrence of extreme events in the yiluo river basin resulting in the changes of runoff coefficient and further exacerbating the runoff variation tian et al 2018 bian et al 2020 4 2 impacts of man made activities on natural streamflow our study used the land use change to represent the impacts of human activities the influence of human activities determined the degree of land use change in each sub basin then led to the runoff variation luo et al 2020 ren et al 2022 the research findings showed that the average contribution proportion of man made activities to the annual and the flood season natural streamflow was 30 68 and 28 49 respectively mainly distributed min downstream of the yiluo river basin the research findings were consistent with the previous studies human activities such as vegetation rehabilitation and construction expansion have had significant impacts on runoff in the loess plateau with a contribution rate between 25 8 and 39 7 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2021 and this impact will continue and expand in the coming years yu et al 2021 yu et al 2022 during 1980 2000 the construction area increased by 16 84 forestland and grassland areas decreased by 0 55 and 1 68 in the yiluo river basin fig 12a during this period the main focus was on economic development and vegetation protection was ignored the development led to the transformation of many forests and grasslands into cultivated and constructed lands after 2000 the land use of the basin changed dramatically compared to the previous period in this period the annual growth rate of watershed population and gdp were 71 14 thousand people and 4 44 billion dollars respectively with the rapid economic development and population growth the construction area increased by 57 39 meanwhile with the execution of the forest rehabilitation project public awareness of forest resource protection has increased and deforestation has decreased resulting in an increase of 0 39 and 1 32 in forestland and grassland respectively fig 12b the expansion of construction area primarily comes from cultivated land fig 13 in the downstream of the yiluo river basin due to the expansion of construction area a large amount of impervious area bred leading to a reduction in infiltration and an increment in streamflow zang et al 2019 the vegetation increased mainly in the midstream of the yiluo river basin with the expansion of vegetation area the interception by the stems the leaves and the litter increased leading to the increase of evapotranspiration and decrease of runoff yield yan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 meanwhile vegetation roots will affect the soil porosity and structure as well as the soil water groundwater conversion process then affecting the flux of water cycle process brown et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 the mutation year and change trend of climate runoff was inconsistent in the yiluo river basin which may be due to the great change of land use in the middle and lower reaches of the basin offsetting the impacts of climate change 4 3 limitations and uncertainties our study has taken some techniques to improve the reliability of the research findings the natural runoff in the yiluo river basin was simulated by the wep model and the simulation effect of natural runoff and evaporation were verified with a good simulation accuracy the m k trend test with a 30 year moving window was applied to analyze trends of the water balance components variation eliminating the influence of random fluctuation of selected periods for the mutation year identification the runoff mutation in each sub basin was detected by the incorporated m k test and sliding t test however there were still some uncertainties in the research which were mainly caused by the model input data the resolution of land use data was 1 1 km which may identify the impact of underlying surface changes incompletely meanwhile soil and water conservation measures such as terraces and check dams affected the retention of depression storage were not considered these may be the reasons for the discrepancy between the simulated runoff peak and the observed runoff peak wu et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition the inconsistent data time series of the socioeconomic and the land use was also one of the limitations of our research in spite of the uncertainties of simulated runoff the runoff variation characteristics of each computing unit can be well reflected spatially in the following work the dynamic mutual feeding mechanism of water and land resources combined with more refined data will be analyzed 5 conclusion the yiluo river basin was chosen as the region of interest in this study the trends of natural runoff variation were analyzed in addition the contribution rate of climatic variation and man made activities to natural streamflow were calculated the main conclusions are 1 using the wep model the monthly natural streamflow and evaporation in the yiluo river basin were simulated with good simulation accuracy we further analyzed the simulated natural runoff variation and its drivers 2 the natural runoff variation in the yiluo river basin showed obvious spatial heterogeneity the annual and flood season natural runoff in 90 02 and 45 99 of the sub basins presented downward trends and in 9 98 and 54 01 of the sub basins showed upward trends respectively the spatial variation of precipitation and evaporation as well as the vegetation rehabilitation and constructive expansion were the main driving factors 3 in terms of attribution identification the natural runoff was mainly affected by climate change in the upstream of the yiluo river basin and the contribution rate exceeded 75 in most sub basins the sub basins with high contribution rate of land use change mainly scattered in the mid lower reaches of the watershed funding this research was

abstract ga1 keywords water and energy transfer process model climate change land use change contribution mutation diagnosis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under the confounding impacts of climatic variation and anthropogenic activities the terrestrial water cycle is changing dramatically bringing great threats to exploiting and utilizing water resources gbohoui et al 2021 liu et al 2020a setti et al 2020 abhishek and kinouchi 2022 climate variation gives rise to changes in the key water cycle processes including precipitation and evapotranspiration which fundamentally affect the quantity composition and spatio temporal distribution of regional water resources grantham et al 2018 yang et al 2019 anthropogenic activities have altered the water cycle processes through the underlying surface construction then affected the process of water yield and consumption guo et al 2020 khand and senay 2021 zhang and yu 2021 in recent years runoff in major basins worldwide has shown a decreasing trend which will continue in the coming years weiland et al 2011 tang and lettenmaier 2012 for example xiong et al quantified the annual runoff coefficient variability during 1985 2014 in 433 major global river basins and discussed their drivers xiong et al 2022 similarly abhishek et al highlighted the importance of human activities reservoir management and groundwater irrigation in the chao phraya river basin which is highly vulnerable to droughts and more importantly floods abhishek sayama 2021 in the context of climate warming and intensified activities of humankind it has instructive meanings to identify the influences of different factors on runoff for developing watershed water and land resources the common methods of contribution separation on runoff variation include the empirical statistics method q zhang et al 2017 h zhang et al 2017 shaukat et al 2020 the elastic method yang et al 2014 bissenbayeva et al 2021 and the hydrological model method farsi and mahjouri 2019 wu et al 2020 xue et al based on the mann kendall m k test and the dual mass curve model noted that man made activities contributed 88 72 to the streamflow reduction in shiyang river basin during 1960 2018 while climate change contributed only 11 28 xue et al 2021 liu et al adopted the budyko framework believed that the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration contributed 45 64 and 13 91 to the streamflow fluctuation in the lancang river basin during 1961 2015 and human activities contributed 40 45 liu et al 2020b compared to the previous two methods the hydrological model with physical mechanism had obvious superiorities it can better simulate the influence of different factors on runoff wu et al 2017 zhai tao 2017 yang et al employed the water and energy transfer process wep model discussed that climate change contributed 71 5 81 7 to the streamflow variation in the nagqu river basin and man made activities contributed 18 3 28 5 yang et al 2020 concerning the attribution identification method on runoff by the hydrological model it s crucial to detect the mutation year different hydrological unit showed runoff variation diversity however previous studies used the areal precipitation or the runoff of a single hydrological station to detect the mutation year rather than using different computational units treating the whole basin as a single unit of analysis may not reflect the spatial heterogeneity the innovations of our study are 1 sub basin generating by the precise river network was used as the fundamental computational units and the runoff of each sub basin was simulated by the wep model 2 we also consider features of each sub basin to determine runoff variation detect their mutation year and attribute the causes behind the runoff changes the yellow river is the second largest river in china and the natural runoff of the basin has decreased by about 20 in the past 60 years yang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 scholars have conducted extensive studies to quantitatively separate the contributions of climatic variation and human activities on runoff of the yellow river basin and its sub basins wu et al 2017 q zhang et al 2017 h zhang et al 2017 ji et al 2022 wang et al 2020 studies have shown that the change in the underlying surface caused by human activities was the leading cause of runoff change in the yellow river basin the contribution rate of such anthropogenic activities accounted for 62 9 88 7 in the basin ni et al 2022b however the runoff change showed great spatial heterogeneity in the yellow river basin the runoff variation in the headstream of the basin was mainly induced by climatic variability su et al 2021 chu et al 2019 yan et al 2020 human activities were the dominant factors of the streamflow reduction in the middle and lower reaches such as the wuding river basin wei river basin and yanhe river basin yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 ni et al 2022a nevertheless few studies conducted the spatially attribution identification of natural runoff change at present stage our research focused on the yiluo river basin being the largest tributary with relatively rich water resources in the middle yellow river basin between the sanmenxia dam and the huayuankou station the basin is located in the transition zone of the yangtze river basin the huaihe river basin and the yellow river basin and it is extremely sensitive to climate change the upstream area of the basin is covered with forests the mid stream consists of a loess plateau with sparse vegetation and areas with serious soil erosion plain areas dominate the downstream area with high urbanization and flood risk due to climate variation vegetation rehabilitation and construction expansion in recent years the natural runoff of the basin is changing dramatically liu et al 2009 wang et al 2019 the current research aims to spatially analyze the tendency of natural runoff variation and identify the contributions of climatic variation and anthropogenic activities on natural streamflow in the yiluo river basin 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yiluo river basin 109 43 113 10 e and 33 39 34 54 n occupies approximately 18 874 63 km2 and involves more than 20 counties of henan and shaanxi province fig 1 the main stream of the luo river originates from shaanxi province with a whole length of 446 9 km the multi year average natural runoff is 51 53 m3 s baimasi station in recent 60 years of which 16 27 m3 s lingkou station is in shaanxi province the

season contributing more than 80 of the annual precipitation 2 2 data the collected data in this study covers the meteorological and hydrological data the underlying surface data the river network data and the socioeconomic data of the yiluo river basin table 1 2 3 methods the research workflow of this article includes model simulation trend analysis mutation diagnosis and attribution identification fig 2 firstly the wep model was constructed based on the hydro meteorological data the underlying surface data and the river network data then the proposed model was calibrated and validated and the annual and the flood season natural runoff of 2044 sub basins were simulated from 1961 to 2020 secondly the m k method was applied to recognize the annual and the flood season natural runoff fluctuation in each sub basin meanwhile the m k test and the sliding t test were incorporated to detect the mutation point of natural streamflow in each sub basin thirdly the contributions of climate variation and man made activities to the annual and the flood season natural runoff in each sub basin were quantified by the attribution identification method 1 wep model our study applied the wep model to simulate the natural streamflow in the yiluo river basin the model was a terrestrial hydrological model with unified physical mechanism which combined modeling of the energy transfer and the hydrological process the wep model was developed by professor yangwen jia jia et al 2001 which has been widely applied in japan south korea the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin in china jia et al 2006 liu et al 2020c zhou et al 2018 the small sub basin was employed as the fundamental computational units which were obtained by the dem after setting the river network threshold to less than 5 km2 then the yiluo river basin was separated into 2044 sub watersheds with spatial topological relation fig 3 in addition we used land use data for the periods of 1980 2000 and 2020 the land use data of 1980 was used to represent the times before 1980 the periods between 1981 and 2000 and 2000 2020 were represented by the land use datasets of 2000 and 2020 respectively 2 trend analysis the m k test is a non parametric test method which is a powerful model to estimate the tendency of meteorological and hydrological data tian et al 2017 nie et al 2019 in this article the m k trend test was applied to analyze the trends of natural runoff variation we used a 30 year moving window to eliminate the influence of random fluctuation of selected periods the window slides annually and accumulates 31 data periods in 1961 2020 based on this the trends of the natural runoff variation were carried out and most of the trend intensity types in the results were taken as the trend values in general the trends of natural runoff variation were determined by different statistical significance levels strongly significant tendency p 0 05 significant tendency 0 05 p 0 1 and insignificant tendency p 0 1 the p value is the significance level 3 mutation diagnosis in the present study the m k test and the sliding t test were combined to detect the rainfall and streamflow mutation year the sliding t test diagnosed the mutation year by examining whether the average discrepancies between two groups samples were significant which can identify the effective mutation points more accurately hu et al 2020 for the purpose of improving the credibility and validity of the calculation results the two techniques were incorporated to identify the mutation year of precipitation and streamflow in the yiluo river basin during 1961 2020 all the results of mutation diagnosis met the statistical significance levels of p 0 1 and the results including five cases 1 if the m k test detected multiple mutation points the same value of the m k test and the sliding t test result was defined as the effective mutation point 2 if the m k test detected multiple mutation points and there was no identical value between the m k test and the sliding t test result the latter result was used as the effective mutation point 3 if the m k test detected only one mutation point and the results was inconsistent with the sliding t test the m k test result was used as the effective mutation point 4 if the m k test detected no mutation point while the sliding t test detected one the sliding t test result was used as the effective mutation point 5 if neither the m k test nor the sliding t test had a mutation point it meant that there was no mutation of runoff 4 attribution identification in order to quantitatively identify the impacts of different driving factors on natural runoff the research stage was divided into the reference phase and the variation phase by the mutation year then the wep model was used to separate the contribution proportion of climate variation and man made activities on natural streamflow by inputting the data in different periods the specific steps are 1 the natural streamflow in the reference phase was obtained by inputting the meteorological and underlying surface data in the reference phase 2 the natural streamflow affected by climate change was obtained by inputting the meteorological data in the variation phase and the land use data in the reference phase 3 the natural streamflow in the variation phase was obtained by inputting the meteorological and land use data in the variation phase the method of attribution identification is calculated as below sun et al 2019 gao et al 2020 1 η h r hc r c r hc r c r c r n 2 η c r c r n r hc r c r c r n where r c stands for the natural runoff affected by climate change r n stands for the natural streamflow in the reference phase r hc stands for the natural streamflow in the variation phase η h and η c refer to the contributions of climatic variation and man made activities to natural streamflow 3 results 3 1 wep model calibration and verification the m k and sliding t test were applied to detect the abrupt change year of average annual precipitation in the yiluo river basin the year 1985 was selected as the mutation year consequently 1961 1985 was chosen as the model calibration phase and 1986 2020 was set as the model validation phase the evaluation criteria were the r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative error re a simulation is better when r2 and nse values approach 1 and re approach 0 the wep model was used to simulate monthly natural streamflow in the basin four stations named lingkou baimasi longmenzhen and heishiguan were selected for calibration and verification in addition the model parameters were adjusted to achieve better simulation table 2 shows the optimized parameters of the wep model for the considered hydrological stations the soil surface thickness stomatal resistance and depression storage were the most sensitive parameters the natural runoff simulation results indicated that the r2 exceeded 0 86 the nse exceeded 0 72 and the re was between 1 13 5 87 in the calibration period during the verification period the r2 exceeded 0 8 the nse exceeded 0 65 and the re was between 8 28 0 80 table 3 fig 4 our study further verified the evaporation simulation effects being realized by comparing the wep model simulation evaporation with the gldas evaporation the results showed that the r2 exceeded 0 75 the nse exceeded 0 55 and the re was between 10 83 1 49 in the calibration period and during the verification period the r2 exceeded 0 77 the nse exceeded 0 52 and the re was between 15 75 8 02 table 3 fig 5 it can be seen that the proposed model in the yiluo river basin has better simulation effects and can be used for further calculation 3 2 trends of the water balance components variation the m k method was applied to analyze the spatial variation of the annual and flood season water balance components in the 2044 sub basins we found that the annual natural runoff in 90 02 of sub basins presented downward trends of which the strongly significant significant and insignificant downward trends accounted for 32 63 0 39 and 57 respectively approximately 9 98 of the sub basins showed insignificant upward trends fig 6a regarding precipitation 85 47 and 14 53 of the sub basins showed insignificant decreasing and increasing trends respectively fig 6b the evaporation in 98 73 of the sub basins showed a significant increasing trend fig 6c and the groundwater reserve in 46 53 and 52 5 of the sub basins showed a decreasing and an insignificant increasing trend respectively fig 6d in terms of the flood season water balance components the natural runoff in 45 99 of sub basins showed declining trends of which the strongly significant and the insignificant declining trends accounted for 0 54 and 45 45 respectively moreover about 54 01 of sub basins showed upward trends of runoff of which the strongly significant and the insignificant upward trends accounted for 0 15 and 53 86 respectively fig 7a regarding the other water balance components the precipitation of 60 76 of sub basins showed an insignificant decreasing trend and 39 24 showed an insignificant increasing trend fig 7b the evaporation in 80 92 of the sub basins showed a significant increasing trend fig 7c the groundwater reserve in 41 68 and 58 32 of the sub basins showed a decreasing and an increasing trend respectively fig 7d 3 3 identification of mutation year the mutation diagnosis of the annual and the flood season natural runoff in 2044 sub basins from 1961 to 2020 was analyzed by the m k test and the sliding t test the results showed that the annual natural runoff in 21 48 of sub basins had no available mutation points p 0 1 were mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of yihe river the mutation year of 32 78 and 21 72 of sub basins occurred in the 1970 s and the 1980 s respectively and mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the basin the others occurred after the 1990 s were mainly distributed in the upper reaches of the basin fig 8a in terms of the flood season natural runoff about 5 82 of sub basins had no available mutation points were scattered in the lower reaches of the basin the mutation year mainly occurred in the 1970 s 42 91 and the 1980 s 30 63 and few occurred after the 1990 s fig 8b based on this the baseline period was defined before the abrupt change year and the variation period was after the abrupt change year a specific analysis will not be carried out below for the sub basins without any available mutation points 3 4 attribution identification based on the attribution identification method we analyzed the contribution of climate variation and man made activities to annual and flood season natural streamflow in 2044 sub basins the results indicated that the average contribution of climate variation to the annual and flood season natural runoff change is 69 32 and 71 51 respectively climate change contributed more than 75 to the annual runoff change in 51 46 of sub basins it also contributed 50 75 of the annual runoff change in 23 3 sub basins less than 50 of climate contribution is observed in 25 24 of sub basins fig 9a during the flood season climate change contributed more than 75 in 54 44 of sub basins 50 75 in 24 47 of sub basins and less than 50 in 21 09 of sub basins fig 9b the average contribution of man made activities to the annual and flood season natural runoff was 30 68 and 28 49 respectively man made activities contributed more than 75 to the annual runoff change in 9 16 sub basins they also contributed 50 75 of the annual runoff change in 16 51 sub basins less than 50 of human related activity contribution is observed in 74 33 of sub basins fig 9c in terms of the flood season natural runoff man made activities contributed more than 75 in 7 53 of sub basins 50 75 in 13 66 of sub basins and less than 50 in 78 81 of sub basins fig 9d 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climatic variation on natural streamflow during the study period the average contribution proportion of climatic variation to the annual and the flood season natural streamflow in the yiluo river basin was 69 32 and 71 51 respectively in the upstream of the watershed the contribution of climatic variation exceeded 75 previous research mainly focused on the contribution identification of the measured runoff we regrouped its contribution rate and found that our research findings were consistent with the previous studies in similar regions the contribution rate of climate change on natural runoff variation in huayuankou station yanhe watershed and jinhe watershed was 73 9 54 1 and 74 26 85 7 respectively wang et al 2022 wu et al 2017 gao et al 2020 our innovation lied in further revealing the spatial heterogeneity of the contribution rate studies have shown that the precipitation intensity and frequency changes directly affect the spatio temporal distribution of natural streamflow liu et al 2013 yuan et al 2018 we further analyzed the consistency of the mutation year of the precipitation runoff the results showed that the mutation years of the annual and flood season precipitation runoff were consistent in 19 23 and 33 61 of the sub basins the annual and flood season precipitation runoff had no mutation points in 4 6 and 1 66 of the sub basins fig 10 the discrepancy of mutation year in these sub basins may be due to precipitation change for instance the respective annual and flood season precipitation decreases by 9 86 and 4 14 mm 10a in the yiluo river basin the annual precipitation in 79 5 of sub basins showed downward trends fig 11a the flood season precipitation in 47 69 of sub basins showed a decreasing trend mainly distributed in the upstream and downstream fig 11b the trend of precipitation was consistent with that of runoff in 40 of the sub basins concurrently more precipitation is allocated to evapotranspiration rather than the streamflow due to climate warming which results in streamflow reduction liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 the spatio temporal discrepancy of temperature change may be another reason for the runoff variability and mutation year heterogeneity the annual and flood season temperatures in the yiluo river basin increased by 0 17 and 0 07 c 10a compared to the reference stage the annual and flood season temperatures increased by 3 48 and 0 49 in the variation period spatially the annual temperature of the whole watershed presented an increasing tendency fig 11c the flood season temperature in 46 55 of sub basins in the middle reaches showed a decreasing trend fig 11d in addition climate warming has led to the frequent occurrence of extreme events in the yiluo river basin resulting in the changes of runoff coefficient and further exacerbating the runoff variation tian et al 2018 bian et al 2020 4 2 impacts of man made activities on natural streamflow our study used the land use change to represent the impacts of human activities the influence of human activities determined the degree of land use change in each sub basin then led to the runoff variation luo et al 2020 ren et al 2022 the research findings showed that the average contribution proportion of man made activities to the annual and the flood season natural streamflow was 30 68 and 28 49 respectively mainly distributed min downstream of the yiluo river basin the research findings were consistent with the previous studies human activities such as vegetation rehabilitation and construction expansion have had significant impacts on runoff in the loess plateau with a contribution rate between 25 8 and 39 7 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2021 and this impact will continue and expand in the coming years yu et al 2021 yu et al 2022 during 1980 2000 the construction area increased by 16 84 forestland and grassland areas decreased by 0 55 and 1 68 in the yiluo river basin fig 12a during this period the main focus was on economic development and vegetation protection was ignored the development led to the transformation of many forests and grasslands into cultivated and constructed lands after 2000 the land use of the basin changed dramatically compared to the previous period in this period the annual growth rate of watershed population and gdp were 71 14 thousand people and 4 44 billion dollars respectively with the rapid economic development and population growth the construction area increased by 57 39 meanwhile with the execution of the forest rehabilitation project public awareness of forest resource protection has increased and deforestation has decreased resulting in an increase of 0 39 and 1 32 in forestland and grassland respectively fig 12b the expansion of construction area primarily comes from cultivated land fig 13 in the downstream of the yiluo river basin due to the expansion of construction area a large amount of impervious area bred leading to a reduction in infiltration and an increment in streamflow zang et al 2019 the vegetation increased mainly in the midstream of the yiluo river basin with the expansion of vegetation area the interception by the stems the leaves and the litter increased leading to the increase of evapotranspiration and decrease of runoff yield yan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 meanwhile vegetation roots will affect the soil porosity and structure as well as the soil water groundwater conversion process then affecting the flux of water cycle process brown et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 the mutation year and change trend of climate runoff was inconsistent in the yiluo river basin which may be due to the great change of land use in the middle and lower reaches of the basin offsetting the impacts of climate change 4 3 limitations and uncertainties our study has taken some techniques to improve the reliability of the research findings the natural runoff in the yiluo river basin was simulated by the wep model and the simulation effect of natural runoff and evaporation were verified with a good simulation accuracy the m k trend test with a 30 year moving window was applied to analyze trends of the water balance components variation eliminating the influence of random fluctuation of selected periods for the mutation year identification the runoff mutation in each sub basin was detected by the incorporated m k test and sliding t test however there were still some uncertainties in the research which were mainly caused by the model input data the resolution of land use data was 1 1 km which may identify the impact of underlying surface changes incompletely meanwhile soil and water conservation measures such as terraces and check dams affected the retention of depression storage were not considered these may be the reasons for the discrepancy between the simulated runoff peak and the observed runoff peak wu et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition the inconsistent data time series of the socioeconomic and the land use was also one of the limitations of our research in spite of the uncertainties of simulated runoff the runoff variation characteristics of each computing unit can be well reflected spatially in the following work the dynamic mutual feeding mechanism of water and land resources combined with more refined data will be analyzed 5 conclusion the yiluo river basin was chosen as the region of interest in this study the trends of natural runoff variation were analyzed in addition the contribution rate of climatic variation and man made activities to natural streamflow were calculated the main conclusions are 1 using the wep model the monthly natural streamflow and evaporation in the yiluo river basin were simulated with good simulation accuracy we further analyzed the simulated natural runoff variation and its drivers 2 the natural runoff variation in the yiluo river basin showed obvious spatial heterogeneity the annual and flood season natural runoff in 90 02 and 45 99 of the sub basins presented downward trends and in 9 98 and 54 01 of the sub basins showed upward trends respectively the spatial variation of precipitation and evaporation as well as the vegetation rehabilitation and constructive expansion were the main driving factors 3 in terms of attribution identification the natural runoff was mainly affected by climate change in the upstream of the yiluo river basin and the contribution rate exceeded 75 in most sub basins the sub basins with high contribution rate of land use change mainly scattered in the mid lower reaches of the watershed funding this research was
