14015,this study investigated the alginate extraction residue from brown seaweed sargassum filipendula for cadmium removal by biosorption in a fixed bed system this residue is frequently thrown into the sea causing pollution concerns the condition selected for the study of biosorption desorption cycles was flow rate of 0 5 ml min and inlet concentration of 1 5 mmol l two biosorption desorption cycles were performed using cacl2 as the eluent however the mtz length increased substantially after the first cycle indicating decreased column efficiency the yan model was the most descriptive for the experimental data the ftir analysis indicated the involvement of sulfurous amine and carboxylic groups sem edx results suggested the participation of an ion exchange mechanism and revealed a homogeneous deposition of metal ions on the biosorbent surface the cost estimation showed that the employment of the dealginated residue is economically beneficial similarly to bagasse fly ash compared to commercial activated carbon keywords biosorption cadmium sargassum filipendula residue fixed bed 1 introduction the growing demand for cutting edge technologies and products has been acting as a driving force for the inappropriate disposal of toxic metal ions which may cause serious damages to the environment and to living beings in general due to their nonbiodegradability and bioaccumulative effect being a result of the increase in mining pigments batteries and electroplating industrial activities cadmium contamination is considered an eminent problem worldwide since it is one of the most hazardous toxic metals presenting carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks to human health 1 3 several treatment methods may be employed to remove toxic metals from industrial wastewater before their disposal into the environment such as chemical precipitation adsorption on activated carbon membrane technologies and biosorption 4 the latter stands out because of some advantages over the others including low cost high efficiency even for low metal concentrations less generation of sludge less energy and reagent demand and specially the possibility of using inactive and dead biological materials as biosorbents 5 microorganisms agricultural 6 and industrial 7 wastes and algae 8 are some examples characterized by being low value products or waste available in enough amounts nonhazardous and easy to obtain 9 among the many available biomass seaweed and their derivatives have been extensively investigated for toxic metal uptake 10 11 extremely common in the brazilian coastline because of the seawater features brown algae of the species sargassum filipendula are considered promising biosorbents by the presence and composition of their cell wall alginic salts fucoidan and cellulose mainly compose their cell wall providing hydroxyl carboxylic and sulfonic functional groups for the biomass 8 industrially sargassum seaweeds are used for alginate extraction since alginate is a biopolymer widely employed by the pharmaceutical and food industries in the alginate extraction process a leftover pulp is generated containing the fibrous structure of the seaweed this fibrous residue is often returned to the sea resulting in an additional organic load to the ecosystem or rarely used as fertilizer biofuel production is another possible destination for alginate industry waste 12 13 although alginate is considered the main responsible for the seaweed sorption capacity costa et al 14 verified that even after the alginate extraction process there are still functional groups in the leftover pulp which could result in a residual sorption capacity based on this some researchers have been verifying the affinity of this dealginated waste for several toxic metals whether in batch or in continuous mode including chromium 15 nickel 16 17 zinc 18 19 and copper 20 despite this to the best of our knowledge there are no studies addressing the continuous cadmium removal using this biosorbent in this context this study aimed to evaluate the use the fibrous residue generated by alginate extraction from brazilian sargassum filipendula named residue or res for cadmium removal by biosorption in a fixed bed system this approach may contribute to establish a new usage for res and consequently to reduce the organic load disposed into the sea moreover the dynamic parameters obtained in this study allow the scale up of the process to the industrial level where continuous systems of sorption desorption with column regeneration are commonly employed the dealginated biomass was also characterized to assess the residue reusability in biosorption desorption systems for this purpose the morphology and elemental composition were analyzed by sem edx the involved functional groups were determined by ftir and the densities real and apparent were obtained by mercury porosimetry and helium picnometry additionally the costs of three different adsorbents for cadmium sorption commercial activated carbon bagasse fly ash and dealginated residue were estimated and compared to understand whether the use of waste materials would be economically advantageous 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of biosorbent collected at cigarras beach são sebastião sp the biomass of sargassum filipendula was transported to the laboratory under refrigeration for approximately 6 hours and afterwards it was washed with distilled water and oven dried for 24 h at 60 c for the alginate extraction the dried material was sieved into fractions of 0 737 mm after the biomass preparation mchugh s method was employed for alginate extraction 21 in the procedure 15 g of dried seaweed were stirred with 500 ml of formaldehyde 0 4 v v during 30 min and then the algae were rinsed and stirred with 500 ml of hydrochloric acid solution 0 1 mol l for 2 h these steps aimed to remove phenolic compounds and to clarify the biomass next the seaweed was stirred with 350 ml of aqueous sodium carbonate 2 wt v for 5 h at 60 c at this stage the alginate present in the cell wall is dissolved in the aqueous phase 22 and can be separated from the fibrous residue by vacuum filtration the dealginated residue was exhaustively rinsed with distilled water while the alginate dissolved in the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol 1 1 v v both residue and precipitated alginate were dried as aforementioned for the raw seaweed and the dried residue was sieved into fractions of 0 737 mm 2 2 adsorbate solutions cadmium solutions were prepared by dissolving analytical cadmium nitrate cd no3 2 in deionized water although speciation analysis reveals that cd2 ions are dominant up to ph 8 fig s1 the sorption assays were conducted at ph 3 5 since low ph values 2 4 are typical for real wastewater for adjusting and controlling the ph nitric acid 0 1 mol l was used 23 atomic absorption spectrophotometry aa 7000 shimadzu was employed for determining the residual cd2 concentration 2 3 sorption assays in fixed bed column based on previous studies already successfully performed using res 18 24 a glass column 0 6 cm of inner diameter and 7 cm of height was used for the sorption assays for the tests the column was firstly filled with 3 g of res sealed with glass fiber at both extremities to prevent dragging of biosorbent particles and then coupled to a system composed by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa and an automatic fraction collector fc203 gilson before being introduced into the glass column the biosorbent was previously hydrated for 12 h with deionized water the system was fed with the metal solution at ph 3 5 in an upwards flow while samples were taken at specific time intervals for the construction of the breakthrough curves c t c0 versus t all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 2 c fig 1 shows a schematic illustration of the setup used for the fixed bed experiments 2 3 1 effect of flow rate and initial concentration the effects of flow rate and initial concentration were investigated by varying the parameter under study and analyzing the breakthrough curves obtained for analyzing the inlet flow rate the cadmium concentration was firstly set at 1 0 mmol l and three different flow rates were explored 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 ml min for the case of a scale up process the flow rates employed in this study may be more adequately expressed as 720 cm³ day 1152 cm³ day and 1440 cm³ day once the most suitable flow rate was defined the initial concentration effect was also evaluated for this purpose the flow rate determined in the previous step 0 5 ml min was kept constant and three different cadmium concentrations were investigated 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mmol l the best conditions of flow rate and cadmium concentration were defined based on the removal efficiency parameters described in section 2 5 and then employed for the study of biosorbent reusability by the biosorption desorption cycles 2 3 2 biosorption desorption cycles once the investigation on flow rate and inlet concentration effects was finished the best condition was chosen for analyzing the biosorbent regeneration and reusability by biosorption desorption cycles calcium chloride cacl2 0 5 mmol l was employed as eluent since it has been effective for the systems res zn and res ni in previous studies 18 24 samples were taken at specific time intervals for the breakthrough curves c t c0 versus t construction after column saturation eluent was fed into the fixed bed also in an upwards flow at 0 5 ml min subsequently the biosorbent was washed with ultrapure water approximately 50 ml and another biosorption cycle was then started the regeneration capacity was evaluated based on the efficiency parameters section 2 5 which includes useful and total biosorption capacity qu and qt removal percentages remu and remt mass transfer zone length mtz and saturation time mathematical models also described in section 2 5 were employed for breakthrough curves description origin 8 maple 17 and matlab 7 were used for modeling 2 4 biosorbent characterization a scanning electron microscope sem leo 440i equipped with an energy dispersive x ray analysis system sem edx was employed for analyzing samples morphology and cadmium ions distribution on res surface besides determining their chemical composition the investigation was conducted with 1500x magnification 800 pa and 15 kv before the scanning a gold film 200 å was deposited on the samples surface fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed to identify the functional groups involved on cadmium uptake by res for this purpose a nicolet 6700 thermo scientific spectrometer was used encompassing the region 4000 650 cm 1 with resolution 4 cm 1 real density ρ r g cm³ was determined by helium pycnometry using a micromeritics accupyc 1330 pycnometer while the apparent density ρ a p g cm³ was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry in a micromeritics 9500 porosimeter afterwards biosorbent porosity ε p was calculated by eq 1 1 ε p 1 ρ a p ρ r 2 5 fixed bed biosorption process analysis and modeling 2 5 1 mass transfer parameters in this study the breakthrough and saturation points were considered to be the points in which the outlet cadmium concentration corresponded to 5 and 95 respectively of the inlet concentration 25 hence the biosorbent useful removal capacity qu up to the breakthrough point and the total removal capacity qt up to the saturation point can be calculated by eqs 2 and 3 respectively where c0 mmol l is the inlet concentration q l min is the flow rate m g is the biosorbent mass and tb and ts min are the breakthrough and saturation times respectively the

transfer zone is defined as the area of the column where the adsorption is more intense reflecting in a pronounced change in concentration during the process the mtz moves through the bed accompanying

mathematical models are useful for the description of adsorption behavior based on this the adsorption column models of bohart adams clark thomas yan and yoon nelson were adjusted to the experimental data the bohart adams model eq 7 assumes that the biosorption rate is proportional to the solute concentration and to the residual capacity of the biosorbent 27 28 within eq 7 c is the cd outlet

it was developed to minimize errors commonly found in the initial and final parts of breakthrough curves when the bohart adams and thomas models are employed the model is described by eq 10 where ky l

the mean error me and the sum square error sse are expressed by eqs 12 and 13 where n represents the number of experimental points and the superscripts exp and calc refer to the experimental and

breakthrough curves obtained for cd2 bioremoval using the different flow rates evaluated 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 ml min while table 1 summarizes the mass transfer parameters determined according to the theory described in section 2 5 it is possible to verify that all three curves showed a similar shape that is close to a step function when this desirable situation occurs the system presents less mass transfer resistance and hence shorter mtz lengths may be obtained 35 it is also clear that the residence time of cadmium ions inside the column was strongly influenced by the solution flow rate increase since the breakthrough time tb was reached within 100 min for the slower one while only 36 min were enough for the faster one the same relation was observed for saturation time ts useful biosorption capacity qu useful removal percentage remu and total removal percentage remt given that the increased flow rate caused a reduction in these parameters in turn the reynolds number re revealed an opposite trend with higher values as the flow rate increased with the observed range 0 22 re 0 43 indicating laminar flow 36 these results agree with reports from others studies involving biosorption 37 38 these results suggest that the bioremoval rate of cd2 ions by res was strongly controlled by a slow diffusion of the metal ions toward the available binding sites on the biosorbent surface thus the residence time provided by the faster flow rate was not suitable for the complete interaction of cd2 ions with all functional groups and the interaction occurred only with the functions of highest affinity and availability therefore the res cd system did not attain the complete equilibrium causing an inefficient use of the column sorption capacity bulgariu and bulgariu 11 39 reported the same behavior for cd2 and pd2 biosorption using an algae waste biomass the flow rate of 0 5 ml min resulted in a shorter mtz length compared to the faster one 1 0 ml min this indicates the occurrence of less mass transfer resistance in this condition resulting in a greater efficiency in the use of the column sorption capacity and hence in a greater removal efficiency although the breakthrough curves ascribed to 0 5 and 0 8 ml min resulted in similar parameters and behavior the highest efficiency was obtained at 0 5 ml min therefore the slowest flow rate was employed in the subsequent studies providing an estimate regarding the volume of metal solution treated per area in a specific period of time the hydraulic loading rate hlr can be calculated for the flow rates used in this study when considering the experimental saturation times presented in table 1 based on the column specifications described in section 2 3 an area of 13 76 cm² was considered for the calculations thus approximately 52 84 and 105 cm³ day cm² or cm day of cadmium solution could be treated when 720 1152 and 1440 cm³ day were respectively employed as flow rate 3 2 effect of inlet concentration once the flow rate evaluation was finished fixed bed sorption assays were conducted by employing the most suitable condition 0 5 ml min while the inlet cd2 concentration varied from 1 0 to 2 0 mmol l the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3 and table 2 presents the mass transfer parameters the breakthrough curves indicate that the higher the inlet concentration the faster the breakthrough and saturation points therefore reducing the operation time and the treatment capacity the solution concentration influence was not as pronounced as the flow rate effect regarding the mass transfer parameters however it can be seen that the column adsorption capacity increased as the inlet concentration rose based on the adsorption isotherm assumptions this behavior was expected since the sorption level actually increases as the initial concentration rises because of the greater distance from thermodynamic adsorption equilibrium until the adsorbent reaches its saturation 25 on the other hand the two lower initial concentrations resulted in slightly higher removal percentages than the one observed at 2 mmol l this behavior is similar to the obtained by lim and aris 40 wherein a calcareous skeleton fixed bed exhibited greater sorption capacities at higher inlet concentrations but the total percentage did not follow the same trend nevertheless the reported cadmium uptake capacity 0 18 mmol g and removal of 36 7 for an inlet concentration of 0 89 mmol cd l and a flow rate of 10 ml min was similar to that verified in this study regarding the mtz value the three curves presented similar results with a minimum at 1 5 mmol l thus 0 5 ml min and 1 5 mmol l were employed as the optimal condition for the adsorption desorption cycles study 3 3 biosorption desorption cycles fig 4 presents the breakthrough curves obtained during the two biosorption desorption cycles the operating condition was previously defined as flow rate of 0 5 ml min and inlet concentration of 1 5 mmol l the mass transfer parameters are summarized in table 3 in fig 4 a the breakthrough curve related to the first biosorption cycle showed a similar shape of that obtained in former experiments with the same operating condition however the second cycle curve presented a broader interval between breakthrough and saturation points which results in a higher mtz length 6 73 cm consequently the column efficiency decreased expressively presenting a useful sorption efficiency qu 18 times lower than the first cycle similarly the total removal percentage decreased from 50 78 to 38 24 this behavior may be caused by the interaction between the biosorbent sites and the eluent cacl2 41 the decrease in the removal efficiency may also be related to an irreversible sorption of part of the cd2 ions 11 in batch mode nishikawa et al 42 verified that cadmium biosorption on a dealginated residue from s filipendula may be described by the pseudo first order kinetic model however the pseudo second order model also adjusts the kinetic data reasonably well suggesting that chemical and irreversible adsorption may also be present in the second cycle the column breakthrough occurred within a few minutes approximately four minutes indicating that a third cycle would not be favorable although the removal percentages remu and remt have not changed significantly it is worth emphasizing that besides having low cost and being an easily accessible biosorbent the alginate extraction residue used in this study is supposed to have sufficient mechanical stability to support the operation since the formation of preferential paths or clogging was not observed 3 4 mathematical modeling the adjustable parameters provided by the bohart adams clark thomas yan and yoon nelson models for the flow rate and initial concentration studies as well as for the first biosorption cycle are summarized in tables s1 s3 see supplementary material it was not possible to fit the models in the second biosorption desorption cycle because the breakthrough point had already been reached in the first experimental point 4 min table 3 therefore the adjustable parameters were not obtained for the flow rate analysis table s1 all the models would be able to describe the breakthrough curves because of their high r² values however the lower values of mean error me and sum square error sse obtained for yan indicate lower discrepancies between experimental and predicted c c0 values making it the most predictive as previously mentioned in section 2 5 2 the yan model was developed to minimize the limitations found in predictions such as thomas especially for the initial and final operation times and thus the yan fits stand out compared to the others 31 concerning the adjustable parameters both the yan model coefficient qy and bohart adams constant k increased with the inlet flow rate the behavior observed for k suggests that the external mass transfer was predominant 43 despite the lack of fit the τ values of the yoon nelson model decreased as the inlet flow rate increased this behavior was expected since a larger volume of contaminated solution may be treated when high flows are employed within the same period of time leading to faster biosorbent saturation concerning the study of inlet cadmium concentrations and the constants related to the sorption rate k kth ky and kyn presented in table s2 the highest values were obtained with the intermediary concentration 1 5 mmol l in turn the parameters related to sorption capacity q0 qth and qy increased along with the increase in the initial metal concentration as observed for the flow rate adjustments the τ values of the yoon nelson model decreased at increased inlet concentrations indicating the faster saturation of the column in general the yan model resulted in higher r 2 values and lower me and sse values thus this model also better described the results similar conclusions can be made regarding the breakthrough curves obtained for the regeneration study since the yan model was also more descriptive table s3 presenting higher r² values and lower deviations between experimental and predicted data 3 5 biosorbent characterization fig 5 a b presents the micrographs obtained for the biosorbent before res and after cadmium bioremoval res cd while fig 5 c shows the metal ions distribution on the biosorbent surface in which the gray dots represent the cadmium ions adsorbed meanwhile table 4 summarizes the chemical compositions which refer to an average of five measurements as the chemical composition of res had already been reported in a previous study conducted by costa et al 14 this measurement was not performed again in fig 5 a b irregularities on the biosorbent surface can be noticed before and after cd bioremoval which give a considerable roughness to the biomaterial the observed empty spaces white circles are due to the partial removal of diatoms during the alginate extraction process the occurrence of these organisms in seaweeds and their derivatives is quite common given that they are widely disseminated in aquatic environments acting as natural regulators of the concentration of some elements such as silicon iron and aluminum 44 based on this the presence of al fe s and si may be related to diatom shells investigating the same algae derivative as biosorbent for chromium bioremoval bertagnolli et al 15 observed that the presence of diatoms on the res surface did not affect the metal sorption table 4 also shows the presence of the light metals ca mg na and k in res composition wherein the content of ca and na stands out among the others this detection was expected since light metals are naturally present in the seawater and hence are found in brown seaweeds linked to the carboxylate groups coo 8 after the contact with the metal solution an expressive decrease in their content could be observed while cd ions have appeared suggesting the occurrence of an ion exchange mechanism with a relevant involvement of carboxylic functions the white arrow highlights the deposition of calcium compounds e g cao caco3 etc on the res surface and their disappearance indicates a slight leaching 45 employing the same biosorbent for removing several toxic metal ions cardoso et al 46 investigated the ion exchange kinetic profile and verified a great involvement of the mechanism on cd bioremoval by res with major involvement of na ions hackbarth et al 47 investigated the bioremoval of cadmium and lead by pelvetia canaliculata and observed that metal ions uptake was also accompanied by the release of light cations cechinel et al 10 and bhatnagar et al 48 verified the same behavior for ascophyllum nodosum and for modified pelvetia canaliculata in toxic metals biosorption concerning the metal ions mapping fig 5 c shows a homogeneous distribution of cadmium ions on the biosorbent surface indicating no preference of metal ions for specific regions of the biosorbent as aforementioned for the chemical composition analysis the ftir spectrum related to the uncontaminated biosorbent had already been reported by costa et al 14 and thus it was not presented again despite that the observed stretching frequencies are summarized in table 5 to facilitate the understanding and comparison between uncontaminated res and metal loaded res cd samples allowing the identification of the involved functional groups the ftir spectrum related to the res cd sample can be found on the supplementary material fig s2 considering that the broad band in the region 3000 3600 cm 1 corresponds to the oh and nh bonds the slight shift from 3287 to 3260 cm 1 after cd sorption suggests the involvement of these functions 49 50 in uncontaminated biosorbent the bands at 1607 and 1537 cm 1 were respectively attributed to the presence of carboxylate and amino groups 50 51 after the sorption process these bands overlap each other at 1584 cm 1 indicating the contribution of both acid functions the observed shift from 1237 to 1310 cm 1 also highlights the occurrence of carboxylic metal complexes since wavenumbers at this region correspond to c o bonds of carboxylic acids 48 the subtle shift from 808 cm 1 to 811 cm 1 may suggest the presence of fucoidan and the respective involvement of sulfonate groups 52 the bands at 1052 and 1032 cm 1 in res account for mannuronic and guluronic units of alginate respectively 53 revealing that there is still alginate in res even after the extraction process in the contaminated sample these bands slightly shifted to respectively 1083 and 1025 cm 1 indicating interaction between the remaining alginate and cadmium ions during the biosorption the results agree with the review previously reported by davis et al 22 which states the importance of alginate for the high sorption capacity of seaweeds and the relevant role of fucoidan in metal biosorption at lower ph real and apparent densities were determined for the uncontaminated biosorbent as respectively 1 547 and 1 086 g cm3 and for the metal loaded biosorbent as 1 544 and 1 203 g cm3 respectively thus the porosity εp calculated by eq 1 resulted in 29 80 and 22 11 before res and after cadmium binding res cd respectively this result was expected since it indicates pore filling by cd ions 54 3 6 cost estimation table 6 presents the cost estimation and comparison of three adsorbent materials commercial activated carbon cac bagasse fly ash bfa and the dealginated residue investigated by this study res it is important to emphasize that this section aims to estimate the costs since the exact values are difficult to obtain considering that two adsorbents are wastes and the prices of commercial activated carbon varies notably 55 in the study reported by kavand et al 55 the authors verified that activated carbon could be regenerated up to three times with hno3 without losing its adsorption capacity for the waste materials just one adsorption cycle was considered because of the lack of data for bfa and because the second adsorption cycle evaluated in this study was not favorable for res although being wastes without costs associated with production or acquisition an estimated cost of usd 0 02 per kg was reported for both biomaterials because of handling and transportation for the activated carbon the unit costs reported in the literature are quite variable and thus the cost of the adsorbent used for cadmium removal was calculated and presented as a range of values even with these simplifications and assumptions the residual materials resulted in lower costs for the same amount of cadmium removal from wastewater thus the employment of industrial waste would be beneficial not only from environmental but also from financial perspectives 4 conclusion during the fixed bed sorption assays the most suitable condition was defined as 0 5 mol min and 1 5 mmol l for flow rate and cadmium concentration respectively after the first biosorption desorption cycle with cacl2 the efficiency of the column decreased as denoted by the increase in the mtz length from 2 42 to 6 73 cm thus the column could be used for up to two cycles of the adsorption desorption process the mathematical modeling indicated the yan model is the most descriptive because of its main characteristics for improving the adjustments at the initial and final parts of the breakthrough curves the biosorbent characterization confirmed that the functional groups responsible for the seaweed biosorption capacity remain in the dealginated residue of which sulfurous amine and carboxylic groups are involved in cadmium uptake finally the adsorbent cost estimation resulted in values for the alternative materials bagasse fly ash and dealginated residue from 65 to 82 5 lower compared to the commercial product activated carbon therefore the employment of industrial waste would be beneficial not only from environmental but also from financial perspectives declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

14015,this study investigated the alginate extraction residue from brown seaweed sargassum filipendula for cadmium removal by biosorption in a fixed bed system this residue is frequently thrown into the sea causing pollution concerns the condition selected for the study of biosorption desorption cycles was flow rate of 0 5 ml min and inlet concentration of 1 5 mmol l two biosorption desorption

metals whether in batch or in continuous mode including chromium 15 nickel 16 17 zinc 18 19 and copper 20 despite this to the best of our knowledge there are no studies addressing the continuous cadmium removal using this biosorbent in this context this study aimed to evaluate the use the fibrous residue generated by alginate extraction from brazilian sargassum filipendula named residue or res for cadmium removal by biosorption in a fixed bed system this approach may contribute to establish a new usage for res and consequently to reduce the organic load disposed into the sea moreover the dynamic parameters obtained in this study allow the scale up of the process to the industrial level where continuous systems of sorption desorption with column regeneration are commonly employed

adsorbents for cadmium sorption commercial activated carbon bagasse fly ash and dealginated residue were estimated and compared to understand whether the use of waste materials would be economically advantageous 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of biosorbent collected at cigarras beach são sebastião sp the biomass of sargassum filipendula was transported to the laboratory under refrigeration for approximately 6 hours and afterwards it was washed with distilled water and oven dried for 24 h at 60 c for the alginate extraction the dried material was sieved into fractions of 0 737 mm after the biomass preparation mchugh s method was employed for alginate extraction 21 in the procedure 15 g of dried seaweed were stirred with 500 ml of formaldehyde 0 4 v v during 30 min and then the algae were rinsed and stirred with 500 ml of hydrochloric acid solution 0 1 mol l for 2 h these steps aimed to remove phenolic compounds and to clarify the biomass next the seaweed was stirred with 350 ml of aqueous sodium carbonate 2 wt v for 5 h at 60 c at this stage the alginate present in the cell wall is dissolved in the aqueous phase 22 and can be separated from the fibrous residue by vacuum filtration the dealginated residue was exhaustively rinsed with distilled water while the alginate dissolved in the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol 1 1 v v both residue and precipitated alginate were dried as aforementioned for the raw seaweed and the dried residue was sieved into fractions of 0 737 mm 2 2 adsorbate solutions cadmium solutions were prepared by dissolving analytical cadmium nitrate cd no3 2 in deionized water although speciation analysis reveals that cd2 ions are dominant up to ph 8 fig s1 the sorption assays were conducted at ph 3 5 since low ph values 2 4 are typical for real wastewater for adjusting and controlling the ph nitric acid 0 1 mol l was used 23 atomic absorption spectrophotometry aa 7000 shimadzu was employed for determining the residual cd2 concentration 2 3 sorption assays in fixed bed column based on previous studies already successfully performed using res 18 24 a glass column 0 6 cm of inner diameter and 7 cm of height was used for the sorption assays for the tests the column was firstly filled with 3 g of res sealed with glass fiber at both extremities to prevent dragging of biosorbent particles and then coupled to a system composed by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa and an automatic fraction collector fc203 gilson before being introduced into the glass column the biosorbent was previously hydrated for 12 h with deionized water the system was fed with the metal solution at ph 3 5 in an upwards flow while samples were taken at specific time intervals for the construction of the breakthrough curves c t c0 versus t all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 2 c fig 1 shows a schematic illustration of the setup used for the fixed bed experiments 2 3 1 effect of flow rate and initial concentration the effects of flow rate and initial concentration were investigated by varying the parameter under study and analyzing the breakthrough curves obtained for analyzing the inlet flow rate the cadmium concentration was firstly set at 1 0 mmol l and three different flow rates were explored 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 ml min for the case of a scale up process the flow rates employed in this study may be more adequately expressed as 720 cm³ day 1152 cm³ day and 1440 cm³ day once the most suitable flow rate was defined the initial concentration effect was also evaluated for this purpose the flow rate determined in the previous step 0 5 ml min was kept constant and three different cadmium concentrations were investigated 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mmol l the best conditions of flow rate and cadmium concentration were defined based on the removal efficiency parameters described in section 2 5 and then employed for the study of biosorbent reusability by the biosorption desorption cycles 2 3 2 biosorption desorption cycles once the investigation on flow rate and inlet concentration effects was finished the best condition was chosen for analyzing the biosorbent regeneration and reusability by biosorption desorption cycles calcium chloride cacl2 0 5 mmol l was employed as eluent since it has been effective for the systems res zn and res ni in previous studies 18 24 samples were taken at specific time intervals for the breakthrough curves c t c0 versus t construction after column saturation eluent was fed into the fixed bed also in an upwards flow at 0 5 ml min subsequently the biosorbent was washed with ultrapure water approximately 50 ml and another biosorption cycle was then started the regeneration capacity was evaluated based on the efficiency parameters section 2 5 which includes useful and total biosorption capacity qu and qt removal percentages remu and remt mass transfer zone length mtz and saturation time mathematical models also described in section 2 5 were employed for breakthrough curves description origin 8 maple 17 and matlab 7 were used for modeling 2 4 biosorbent characterization a scanning electron microscope sem leo 440i equipped with an energy dispersive x ray analysis system sem edx was employed for analyzing samples morphology and cadmium ions distribution on res surface besides determining their chemical composition the investigation was conducted with 1500x magnification 800 pa and 15 kv before the scanning a gold film 200 å was deposited on the samples surface fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed to identify the functional groups involved on cadmium uptake by res for this purpose a nicolet 6700 thermo scientific spectrometer was used encompassing the region 4000 650 cm 1 with resolution 4 cm 1 real density ρ r g cm³ was determined by helium pycnometry using a micromeritics accupyc 1330 pycnometer while the apparent density ρ a p g cm³ was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry in a micromeritics 9500 porosimeter afterwards biosorbent porosity ε p was calculated by eq 1 1 ε p 1 ρ a p ρ r 2 5 fixed bed biosorption process analysis and modeling 2 5 1 mass transfer parameters in this study the breakthrough and saturation points were considered to be the points in which the outlet cadmium concentration corresponded to 5 and 95 respectively of the inlet concentration 25 hence the biosorbent useful removal capacity qu up to the breakthrough point and the total removal capacity qt up to the saturation point can be calculated by eqs 2 and 3 respectively where c0 mmol l is the inlet concentration q l min is the flow rate m g is the biosorbent mass and tb and ts min are the breakthrough and saturation times respectively the

mathematical models are useful for the description of adsorption behavior based on this the adsorption column models of bohart adams clark thomas yan and yoon nelson were adjusted to the experimental data the bohart adams model eq 7 assumes that the biosorption rate is proportional to the solute concentration and to the residual capacity of the biosorbent 27 28 within eq 7 c is the cd outlet

breakthrough curves obtained for cd2 bioremoval using the different flow rates evaluated 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 ml min while table 1 summarizes the mass transfer parameters determined according to the theory described in section 2 5 it is possible to verify that all three curves showed a similar shape that is close to a step function when this desirable situation occurs the system presents less mass transfer resistance and hence shorter mtz lengths may be obtained 35 it is also clear that the residence time of cadmium ions inside the column was strongly influenced by the solution flow rate increase since the breakthrough time tb was reached within 100 min for the slower one while only 36 min were enough for the faster one the same relation was observed for saturation time ts useful biosorption capacity qu useful removal percentage remu and total removal percentage remt given that the increased flow rate caused a reduction in these parameters in turn the reynolds number re revealed an opposite trend with higher values as the flow rate increased with the observed range 0 22 re 0 43 indicating laminar flow 36 these results agree with reports from others studies involving biosorption 37 38 these results suggest that the bioremoval rate of cd2 ions by res was strongly controlled by a slow diffusion of the metal ions toward the available binding sites on the biosorbent surface thus the residence time provided by the faster flow rate was not suitable for the complete interaction of cd2 ions with all functional groups and the interaction occurred only with the functions of highest affinity and availability therefore the res cd system did not attain the complete equilibrium causing an inefficient use of the column sorption capacity bulgariu and bulgariu 11 39 reported the same behavior for cd2 and pd2 biosorption using an algae waste biomass the flow rate of 0 5 ml min resulted in a shorter mtz length compared to the faster one 1 0 ml min this indicates the occurrence of less mass transfer resistance in this condition resulting in a greater efficiency in the use of the column sorption capacity and hence in a greater removal efficiency although the breakthrough curves ascribed to 0 5 and 0 8 ml min resulted in similar parameters and behavior the highest efficiency was obtained at 0 5 ml min therefore the slowest flow rate was employed in the subsequent studies providing an estimate regarding the volume of metal solution treated per area in a specific period of time the hydraulic loading rate hlr can be calculated for the flow rates used in this study when considering the experimental saturation times presented in table 1 based on the column specifications described in section 2 3 an area of 13 76 cm² was considered for the calculations thus approximately 52 84 and 105 cm³ day cm² or cm day of cadmium solution could be treated when 720 1152 and 1440 cm³ day were respectively employed as flow rate 3 2 effect of inlet concentration once the flow rate evaluation was finished fixed bed sorption assays were conducted by employing the most suitable condition 0 5 ml min while the inlet cd2 concentration varied from 1 0 to 2 0 mmol l the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3 and table 2 presents the mass transfer parameters the breakthrough curves indicate that the higher the inlet concentration the faster the breakthrough and saturation points therefore reducing the operation time and the treatment capacity the solution concentration influence was not as pronounced as the flow rate effect regarding the mass transfer parameters however it can be seen that the column adsorption capacity increased as the inlet concentration rose based on the adsorption isotherm assumptions this behavior was expected since the sorption level actually increases as the initial concentration rises because of the greater distance from thermodynamic adsorption equilibrium until the adsorbent reaches its saturation 25 on the other hand the two lower initial concentrations resulted in slightly higher removal percentages than the one observed at 2 mmol l this behavior is similar to the obtained by lim and aris 40 wherein a calcareous skeleton fixed bed exhibited greater sorption capacities at higher inlet concentrations but the total percentage did not follow the same trend nevertheless the reported cadmium uptake capacity 0 18 mmol g and removal of 36 7 for an inlet concentration of 0 89 mmol cd l and a flow rate of 10 ml min was similar to that verified in this study regarding the mtz value the three curves presented similar results with a minimum at 1 5 mmol l thus 0 5 ml min and 1 5 mmol l were employed as the optimal condition for the adsorption desorption cycles study 3 3 biosorption desorption cycles fig 4 presents the breakthrough curves obtained during the two biosorption desorption cycles the operating condition was previously defined as flow rate of 0 5 ml min and inlet concentration of 1 5 mmol l the mass transfer parameters are summarized in table 3 in fig 4 a the breakthrough curve related to the first biosorption cycle showed a similar shape of that obtained in former experiments with the same operating condition however the second cycle curve presented a broader interval between breakthrough and saturation points which results in a higher mtz length 6 73 cm consequently the column efficiency decreased expressively presenting a useful sorption efficiency qu 18 times lower than the first cycle similarly the total removal percentage decreased from 50 78 to 38 24 this behavior may be caused by the interaction between the biosorbent sites and the eluent cacl2 41 the decrease in the removal efficiency may also be related to an irreversible sorption of part of the cd2 ions 11 in batch mode nishikawa et al 42 verified that cadmium biosorption on a dealginated residue from s filipendula may be described by the pseudo first order kinetic model however the pseudo second order model also adjusts the kinetic data reasonably well suggesting that chemical and irreversible adsorption may also be present in the second cycle the column breakthrough occurred within a few minutes approximately four minutes indicating that a third cycle would not be favorable although the removal percentages remu and remt have not changed significantly it is worth emphasizing that besides having low cost and being an easily accessible biosorbent the alginate extraction residue used in this study is supposed to have sufficient mechanical stability to support the operation since the formation of preferential paths or clogging was not observed 3 4 mathematical modeling the adjustable parameters provided by the bohart adams clark thomas yan and yoon nelson models for the flow rate and initial concentration studies as well as for the first biosorption cycle are summarized in tables s1 s3 see supplementary material it was not possible to fit the models in the second biosorption desorption cycle because the breakthrough point had already been reached in the first experimental point 4 min table 3 therefore the adjustable parameters were not obtained for the flow rate analysis table s1 all the models would be able to describe the breakthrough curves because of their high r² values however the lower values of mean error me and sum square error sse obtained for yan indicate lower discrepancies between experimental and predicted c c0 values making it the most predictive as previously mentioned in section 2 5 2 the yan model was developed to minimize the limitations found in predictions such as thomas especially for the initial and final operation times and thus the yan fits stand out compared to the others 31 concerning the adjustable parameters both the yan model coefficient qy and bohart adams constant k increased with the inlet flow rate the behavior observed for k suggests that the external mass transfer was predominant 43 despite the lack of fit the τ values of the yoon nelson model decreased as the inlet flow rate increased this behavior was expected since a larger volume of contaminated solution may be treated when high flows are employed within the same period of time leading to faster biosorbent saturation concerning the study of inlet cadmium concentrations and the constants related to the sorption rate k kth ky and kyn presented in table s2 the highest values were obtained with the intermediary concentration 1 5 mmol l in turn the parameters related to sorption capacity q0 qth and qy increased along with the increase in the initial metal concentration as observed for the flow rate adjustments the τ values of the yoon nelson model decreased at increased inlet concentrations indicating the faster saturation of the column in general the yan model resulted in higher r 2 values and lower me and sse values thus this model also better described the results similar conclusions can be made regarding the breakthrough curves obtained for the regeneration study since the yan model was also more descriptive table s3 presenting higher r² values and lower deviations between experimental and predicted data 3 5 biosorbent characterization fig 5 a b presents the micrographs obtained for the biosorbent before res and after cadmium bioremoval res cd while fig 5 c shows the metal ions distribution on the biosorbent surface in which the gray dots represent the cadmium ions adsorbed meanwhile table 4 summarizes the chemical compositions which refer to an average of five measurements as the chemical composition of res had already been reported in a previous study conducted by costa et al 14 this measurement was not performed again in fig 5 a b irregularities on the biosorbent surface can be noticed before and after cd bioremoval which give a considerable roughness to the biomaterial the observed empty spaces white circles are due to the partial removal of diatoms during the alginate extraction process the occurrence of these organisms in seaweeds and their derivatives is quite common given that they are widely disseminated in aquatic environments acting as natural regulators of the concentration of some elements such as silicon iron and aluminum 44 based on this the presence of al fe s and si may be related to diatom shells investigating the same algae derivative as biosorbent for chromium bioremoval bertagnolli et al 15 observed that the presence of diatoms on the res surface did not affect the metal sorption table 4 also shows the presence of the light metals ca mg na and k in res composition wherein the content of ca and na stands out among the others this detection was expected since light metals are naturally present in the seawater and hence are found in brown seaweeds linked to the carboxylate groups coo 8 after the contact with the metal solution an expressive decrease in their content could be observed while cd ions have appeared suggesting the occurrence of an ion exchange mechanism with a relevant involvement of carboxylic functions the white arrow highlights the deposition of calcium compounds e g cao caco3 etc on the res surface and their disappearance indicates a slight leaching 45 employing the same biosorbent for removing several toxic metal ions cardoso et al 46 investigated the ion exchange kinetic profile and verified a great involvement of the mechanism on cd bioremoval by res with major involvement of na ions hackbarth et al 47 investigated the bioremoval of cadmium and lead by pelvetia canaliculata and observed that metal ions uptake was also accompanied by the release of light cations cechinel et al 10 and bhatnagar et al 48 verified the same behavior for ascophyllum nodosum and for modified pelvetia canaliculata in toxic metals biosorption concerning the metal ions mapping fig 5 c shows a homogeneous distribution of cadmium ions on the biosorbent surface indicating no preference of metal ions for specific regions of the biosorbent as aforementioned for the chemical composition analysis the ftir spectrum related to the uncontaminated biosorbent had already been reported by costa et al 14 and thus it was not presented again despite that the observed stretching frequencies are summarized in table 5 to facilitate the understanding and comparison between uncontaminated res and metal loaded res cd samples allowing the identification of the involved functional groups the ftir spectrum related to the res cd sample can be found on the supplementary material fig s2 considering that the broad band in the region 3000 3600 cm 1 corresponds to the oh and nh bonds the slight shift from 3287 to 3260 cm 1 after cd sorption suggests the involvement of these functions 49 50 in uncontaminated biosorbent the bands at 1607 and 1537 cm 1 were respectively attributed to the presence of carboxylate and amino groups 50 51 after the sorption process these bands overlap each other at 1584 cm 1 indicating the contribution of both acid functions the observed shift from 1237 to 1310 cm 1 also highlights the occurrence of carboxylic metal complexes since wavenumbers at this region correspond to c o bonds of carboxylic acids 48 the subtle shift from 808 cm 1 to 811 cm 1 may suggest the presence of fucoidan and the respective involvement of sulfonate groups 52 the bands at 1052 and 1032 cm 1 in res account for mannuronic and guluronic units of alginate respectively 53 revealing that there is still alginate in res even after the extraction process in the contaminated sample these bands slightly shifted to respectively 1083 and 1025 cm 1 indicating interaction between the remaining alginate and cadmium ions during the biosorption the results agree with the review previously reported by davis et al 22 which states the importance of alginate for the high sorption capacity of seaweeds and the relevant role of fucoidan in metal biosorption at lower ph real and apparent densities were determined for the uncontaminated biosorbent as respectively 1 547 and 1 086 g cm3 and for the metal loaded biosorbent as 1 544 and 1 203 g cm3 respectively thus the porosity εp calculated by eq 1 resulted in 29 80 and 22 11 before res and after cadmium binding res cd respectively this result was expected since it indicates pore filling by cd ions 54 3 6 cost estimation table 6 presents the cost estimation and comparison of three adsorbent materials commercial activated carbon cac bagasse fly ash bfa and the dealginated residue investigated by this study res it is important to emphasize that this section aims to estimate the costs since the exact values are difficult to obtain considering that two adsorbents are wastes and the prices of commercial activated carbon varies notably 55 in the study reported by kavand et al 55 the authors verified that activated carbon could be regenerated up to three times with hno3 without losing its adsorption capacity for the waste materials just one adsorption cycle was considered because of the lack of data for bfa and because the second adsorption cycle evaluated in this study was not favorable for res although being wastes without costs associated with production or acquisition an estimated cost of usd 0 02 per kg was reported for both biomaterials because of handling and transportation for the activated carbon the unit costs reported in the literature are quite variable and thus the cost of the adsorbent used for cadmium removal was calculated and presented as a range of values even with these simplifications and assumptions the residual materials resulted in lower costs for the same amount of cadmium removal from wastewater thus the employment of industrial waste would be beneficial not only from environmental but also from financial perspectives 4 conclusion during the fixed bed sorption assays the most suitable condition was defined as 0 5 mol min and 1 5 mmol l for flow rate and cadmium concentration respectively after the first biosorption desorption cycle with cacl2 the efficiency of the column decreased as denoted by the increase in the mtz length from 2 42 to 6 73 cm thus the column could be used for up to two cycles of the adsorption desorption process the mathematical modeling indicated the yan model is the most descriptive because of its main characteristics for improving the adjustments at the initial and final parts of the breakthrough curves the biosorbent characterization confirmed that the functional groups responsible for the seaweed biosorption capacity remain in the dealginated residue of which sulfurous amine and carboxylic groups are involved in cadmium uptake finally the adsorbent cost estimation resulted in values for the alternative materials bagasse fly ash and dealginated residue from 65 to 82 5 lower compared to the commercial product activated carbon therefore the employment of industrial waste would be beneficial not only from environmental but also from financial perspectives declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

14016,activation of persulfate in the presence of nitric acid treated granular activated carbon was studied in order to investigate the degradation of metronidazole from aqueous medium in the continuous up flow fixed bed reactor a tubular glass reactor with internal diameter of 2 cm and height of 15 cm was filled with desirable mass of rod shaped activated carbon with diameter of 4 mm and height of 6 mm the synthetic wastewater containing persulfate and metronidazole was entered into the reactor in up flow operation at steady state condition and under the optimum values of operating parameters about 88 of influent persulfate was decomposed and decreased to 73 after 7 h under this condition the metronidazole removal reached to 93 and gradually decreased to 74 at the end of process due to the saturation of the catalyst and occupation of available active sites for sulfate radical production the results indicated promising performance of sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process in continuous fixed bed reactor for degradation of resistant pollutants from aqueous medium keywords metronidazole granular activated carbon persulfate fixed bed reactor continuous operation 1 introduction pharmaceuticals are beneficial compounds utilized for both humans and animals because of widespread usage these materials and their metabolites are continuously being entered into the aquatic environment through the disposal of humans sewage or meat production factories effluents 1 4 metronidazole mtz is one of the five nitroimidazole derivatives which is bactericidal to microaerophilic and anaerobic microorganisms 5 this compound considered to be pseudo persistent compounds due to the high solubility 9 5 g l 1 low biodegradability and carcinogenic potential that can be accumulated in living organisms also mtz detected in concentrations of 0 011 to 0 055 μm in hospital effluent wastewaters 6 wastewater treatment is the incorporation of biological and chemical processes to remove any harmful constituents from raw wastewater prior to discharge to receiving resources 7 in recent years resistant pollutants have attracted more attention because of the poor performance of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove these constituents 8 9 over time various oxidation processes have been established for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents containing mtz such as uv fenton photo fenton electro fenton ozonation and hybrid processes 5 10 13 in the recent decay sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes showed promising outlook for the treatment of resistant pollutants due to the high redox potential of sulfate radical 2 5 3 1 ev vs nhe as well as long lifetime compared to hydroxyl radical t1 2 so4 30 40 μs and t1 2 ho 1 μs 1 14 sulfate radicals are generated via activation of peroxymonosulfate hso5 pms or persulfate s2o8 2 ps through various activation methods including uv heat and transition metals 15 18 catalytic metal activation is more economic less complex in reactor configuration and has low activation energy demands compared to energy based activation however secondary pollutants in the final waste accompanied turbidity limited the use of metallic catalysts as it was demonstrated in the work of ghauch and coworkers 19 21 newly activated carbon ac has been shown an ideal alternative for free radical generation in the ac h2o2 system due to the high porosity high specific surface area low cost environmentally friendly and abundant of oxygen functional groups on the surface 22 24 according to the symmetric structure of ps and h2o2 liang and coworkers 25 proposed the mechanisms of so4 generation over ac as follows 1 acsurface ooh s2o8 2 so4 acsurface oo hso4 2 acsurface oh s2o8 2 so4 acsurface o hso4 many researchers focused on the ac ps or ac pms processes to decompose resistant pollutants from water and wastewater 26 30 in the sulfate radical based process complete mineralization of mtz

and removal of mtz in aqueous media in a batch reactor in our recent research work 31 modification of activated carbon using nitric acid was studied in order to investigate the role of acidic oxygen functional groups on the transformation of ps to free sulfate radicals for mtz removal from an aqueous medium the results showed that nitric acid treated of ac introduces large quantity of acidic functional groups on the surface which are effective in the transformation of ps to free sulfate radicals to the best of our knowledge the studies on the heterogeneous catalytic ps activation are limited to the batch systems for practical applications continuous flow reactor systems should be studied to develop scale up methods therefore in the current study the performance of ps activation over granular activated carbon modified with nitric acid was investigated for degradation of mtz in the continuous up flow fixed bed reactor 2 experimental 2 1 materials mtz 99 purity was supplied by the shahid ghazi pharmaceutical company iran rod form of granular activated carbon with a particle size of 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height was purchased from chem lab nv belgium nitric acid hno3

carbonate na2co3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 were provided by merck germany 2 2 surface modification of granular activated carbon prior to usage fresh granular activated carbon denoted as fac was washed with 10 dilute hcl and deionized water several times to remove any surface impurities and then dried at 105 c for 24 h nitric acid modification of granular activated carbon was carried out according to the method described in the previous study 31 a certain amount of washed and dried ac was immersed in concentrated hno3 at the ratio of 1 g solid 10 ml acid and heated at 90 c for 5 h under continuous reflux and stirring at 100 rpm afterward the sample was filtered and washed several times with deionized water until no change in the ph of washing water could be detected nitric acid treated sample was dried at 105 c for 24 h and denoted as nac 2 3 continuous fixed bed setup the continuous oxidation experiments were performed in a bench scale system a schematic flowchart of the experimental setup is outlined in fig 1 as demonstrated the experimental setup has consisted of a glass column with an internal diameter of 2 cm and a total height of 15 cm the influent aqueous solution of mtz and ps was fed to the reactor in up flow operation using a peristaltic pump for better liquid distribution the catalyst was packed between two inert glass beads with the diameter of 5 mm in order to determine the optimal operating conditions batch screening tests were carried out in a series of 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml solution with different initial mtz and ps concentration nac dosage and ph values 1 31 in the continuous operations initial mtz and ph values were kept at 100 mg l 1 0 58 mm and 3 9 respectively according to the derivative results of batch experiments

out each experimental run was continued up to 7 h and the effluent was sampled every 30 min all experiments were performed under constant temperature and pressure 25 c and 1 atm the liquid residence time tr in the packed bed reactor was calculated as 4 t r v l q l ε l v b e d q l where vl and ql are the volume and volumetric flow rate of the liquid phase respectively εl is liquid holdup and vbed is the catalyst bed volume the liquid holdup has been calculated from the following equation 5 ε l ε β l in this equation ε is the mean voidage and could be determined according to the relation between internal reactor diameter dr and particle diameter dp 32 6 ε 0 373 1 703 d r d p 0 611 2 also βl is the external liquid saturation that was calculated using the excel worksheet simulator for the flooded bed reactor available at http www gch ulaval ca taking into account the physical properties of liquid and gas phase catalyst and reactor geometries and operating conditions it should be noted that the co2 released by the mineralization of mtz eq 3 was considered as the gas phase for simulation all necessary parameters for evaluation of residence time are given in table 1 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 textural characterization the textural properties of samples were determined by the nitrogen adsorption desorption experiment using a belsorp mini instrument the specific surface area sbet was determined by bet brunauer emmet teller equation the total pore volume vtot was calculated from the adsorbed volume of gas near the saturation point micro pore vmicro and meso pore vmeso volumes were determined by the t plot and bjh barrett joyner and halenda method respectively 2 4 2 boehm technique boehm titration technique was applied to determine the surface functional

neutralizes carboxyls na2co3 neutralizes carboxyls and lactones and naoh neutralizes carboxyls lactones and phenolic groups the number of basic sites was calculated based on the amount of hcl that reacted with carbon 2 4 3 ph of zero point charge the point of zero charge phpzc of fac and nac was evaluated by the mass titration method 34 three glass bottles containing 40 ml of 0 1 m nacl in deionized water with solid weight percent of 10 15 and 20 were sealed and placed at a constant temperature the phpzc is the ultimate ph of suspensions after 48 h of contact time the time that ph equilibrium is reached 2 4 4 operational parameter the degradation of mtz was calculated by measuring maximum absorbance at the wavelength of 319 nm residual ps in the solution was analyzed by iodometric titration of ps with potassium iodide at the wavelength of 352 nm 35 a uv vis spectrophotometer unico 2100 usa was utilized to measure the concentrations of mtz and ps the conversion rate of ps and removal of mtz were calculated by 7 x m m 0 m t m 0 100 m r e p r e s e n t e d m t z o r p s where m 0 mg l 1 and m t mg l 1 denote the concentrations at influent and effluent respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the granular activated carbons textural properties boehm titration and phpzc determination the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of fac and nac at 77 k are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively according to the iupac classification the nitrogen adsorption isotherms for both samples can be classified as types i 36 the sharp increase at low relative pressures indicating the micro porosity structure of samples with an average pore width smaller than 2 nm table 2 summarized the textural properties including specific surface area total pore micro pore and meso pore volumes it can be seen that the transformation of micro pores to meso pores and macro pores caused decrease in specific surface area by 36 after nitric acid modification due to the formation of oxygen functional groups or humic substances that are direct oxidation products 37 similar results published by researchers in terms of surface area and micro pore volume reduction after nitric acid treatment due to the erosion of the surface 38 40 the chemical properties of samples as a result of phpzc determination and boehm titration are summarized in table 3 after the modification process the reduction in phpzc from 9 9 to 3 7 indicated successful acidification of ac surface table 3 also shows the results of boehm titration for fac and nac after nitric acid modification the total number of acidic surface groups increased significantly which is in agreement with phpzc of nac the oxidation reaction of surface and nitric acid leads to the formation of considerable carboxylic groups compared with lactonic and phenolic groups this result is consistent with that obtained by gokce and coworker 41 they concluded that hno3 utilization has a dominant effect on the generation of carboxylic groups more than lactonic and phenolic groups 3 2 determination of operational parameters in our previous studies in the batch system 1 31 fac and nac were used as ps activators and the results showed that fac has a good ability to catalyze ps toward oxidation of mtz however the rate of ps degradation and mtz removal increased significantly when nac was used as an activator therefore nac was utilized in the fixed bed reactor in order to investigate the performance of the nac ps system in continuous operation also the best performance in the batch system was achieved in the acidic medium as stated in the literature 11 42 acidic by products such as oxalic acid and acetic acid were identified during the oxidation of mtz which are responsible for the acidification of the bulk solution considering acidic by product final product formation during the oxidation process as well as the acidic nature of ps the experiments were performed at the initial ph of solution 3 9 without any adjustment our results in the batch system also showed that simultaneous adsorption and oxidation processes induced mtz removal in the fac ps and nac ps systems as well as the oxidation process was taken place on the surface or in the boundary layer around the catalyst 3 3 continuous fixed bed operations the continuous experiments were conducted at constant ph and initial mtz concentration of 3 9 and 100 mg l 1 and the effect of influent ps loading 5 8 11 6 29 and 58 mm equivalent to the ps mtz molar ratio of 10 1 20 1 50 1 and 100 1 respectively catalyst bed height 3 5 and 5 0 cm equivalent to the 5 and 8 g nac and volumetric flow rate 1 68 and 2 40 cm3 min 1 were investigated on the performance of process 3 3 1 effect of influent ps concentration on mtz removal to evaluate the effect of ps concentration on the mtz removal in the continuous system 5 0 g nac was placed in the reactor and the wastewater with constant flow rate of 2 40 cm3 min 1 was pumped as indicated in table 1 the residence time equivalent to these bed height and influent flow rate is 1 9 min the obtained results in fig 4 shows that the steady state condition has arrived less than 30 min after the injection of wastewater without any ps adsorption curve the mtz removal was only due to the adsorption process and gradually decreased from 66 to 52 in the oxidation process the mtz removal increased to 68 73 82 and 85 for ps mtz molar ratios of 10 1 20 1 50 1 and 100 1 respectively due to the simultaneous adsorption and oxidation process and decreased gradually to the final values of 63 72 78 and 79 at the end of process the results of 50 1 and 100 1 molar ratios are very close probably due to the inadequate decomposition of ps as a result of low residence time or inadequate catalyst active sites the advantage of continuous operation over the batch system is the transportation of unreacted reactants and by products away from the reactor that decreases deactivation rate of catalyst and increases process lifetime catalyst deactivation is well represented both in the adsorption and oxidation processes however the rate of deactivation in the oxidation process is less than the adsorption process lower catalyst deactivation rate indicated in situ catalyst regeneration during the oxidation process that was observed in batch experiments too 1 some researchers also reported in situ catalyst regeneration during the oxidation process due to the decomposition of surface adsorbed compounds 30 43 3 3 2 effect of influent ps concentration on ps degradation the ps decomposition rates proportional to the influent values of 5 8 11 6 29 and 58 mm are presented in fig 5 as it is illustrated a considerable amount of ps was discharged in all ratios without any decomposition the effluent amount of ps in 10 1 molar ratio was low and this value increases significantly when ps loading raised up to 58 mm insufficient ps decomposition in high influent ps concentration can be due to the limitation in the active surface of catalyst or residence time from fig 4 the mtz removal in 20 1 molar ratio which is close to the stoichiometric molar ratio of ps to mtz 21 1 according to reaction 3 is relatively acceptable while only about half of the influent ps has been degraded according to the fig 5 taking into account the contribution of the adsorption process for mtz removal it is possible to achieve higher mtz removal with influent ps concentration lower than stoichiometry value if operating conditions change to increase the rate of ps degradation with respect to the economic and operating efficiency of the process the decomposition of influent ps as high as possible is necessary and inevitable increasing the residence time is one of the ways to enhance the rate of ps decomposition in the reactor which can be done in two ways first increasing the bed height at constant inlet flow rate and second decreasing the flow rate at constant bed height both modes have been investigated for the ps mtz molar ratio of 20 1 and the results have been reported 3 3 3 effect of residence time on ps degradation and mtz removal the change in the liquid flow rate and catalytic bed volume and their effects on residence time are given in table 1 as shown a decrease in liquid flow rate to 1 68 cm3 min 1 at constant bed volume or increase in bed volume to 15 7 cm3 at a fixed flow rate led to raising up the residence time to 2 8 min the effect of residence time change on the ps degradation and mtz removal at constant influent ps mtz molar ratio of 20 1 are depicted in figs 6 and 7 respectively fig 6 reveals the effect of residence time on ps decomposition as shown a significant increase in the rate of ps decomposition has been observed in both modes the ps degradation increased to 78 and 88 when bed volume and volumetric flow rate changed to 15 7 cm3 and 1 68 cm3 min 1 respectively and gradually decreased to final values of 70 and 73 as was shown the superficial liquid velocity is more important than bed volume to enhance the decomposition rate of ps from fig 7 an increase in residence time by bed volume increase could not change significantly the rate of mtz removal both in adsorption and oxidation processes in the next mode reduction in liquid flow rate to 1 68 cm3 min 1 significantly increased the mtz removal to 78 and 93 in the adsorption and oxidation processes respectively however the deactivation rate of catalyst increased strictly especially in the adsorption process more decrement in the volumetric flow rate leads to enhance catalyst deactivation rate therefore the results show that superficial velocity is more important than active surface sites which should be optimized to achieve good pollutant removal as well as low catalyst deactivation rate as inferred from the comparison of the results in figs 6 and 7 the ps degradation increased significantly when bed volume increased to 15 7 cm3 however mtz removal was not increased remarkably as mentioned previously the most of oxidation reaction takes place on the surface of catalyst or in the boundary layer around the surface therefore sufficient contact time is necessary to overcome mass transfer resistance considering the phpzc of nac 3 9 pka of mtz 2 55 and anionic form of oxidant partial positive surface charge developed on the surface of the catalyst in acidic medium the partial charge leads to the electrostatic attractive force between the surface and ps and repulsive force between the surface and mtz 1 the pathway of the oxidation reaction is shown in fig 8 at first the oxidizing agent must be reached from the bulk to the outer layer of the boundary pass through the thickness of the boundary layer and interact with the surface afterward the generated radicals should return toward the bulk and react with the contaminant molecules in around the boundary due to the low radical s lifetime as well as high superficial liquid velocity it seems that inadequate contact time between the radicals and mtz molecules is the main factor that influences the rate of mtz removal as a result sufficient active site is available for decomposition of ps however high superficial liquid velocity limited the contact time and mtz removal efficiency many researchers focused on the wet peroxide oxidation process in the fixed bed reactor based on the simultaneous thermal and catalyst activation of hydrogen peroxide 44 48 kronholm and coworkers 49 51 used potassium persulfate in a continuous flow operation to remove phenolic compounds from pressurized hot supercritical water as the best of our knowledge no study was found using metal free catalysts for sulfate radical generation in the continuous fixed bed reactor therefore the comparison of the results of this study with the wet oxidation process is not possible because of the difference in the type of process however the results obtained in this study indicated that the sulfate radical catalyzed by granular activated carbon in the continuous fixed bed reactor has good potential to remove resistant contaminants from aqueous medium the continuous fixed bed operation has many advantages over batch system including no need for the separation of catalyst in situ catalyst regeneration flexibility against fluctuations in the influent wastewater good ability against the treatment of a large volume of wastewater low operation cost and high process time 4 conclusions in this study activation of ps in the presence of granular activated carbon modified with nitric acid was investigated for the degradation of mtz in the continuous up flow fixed bed reactor due to the good catalytic activity and stability during long periods of time the activated carbon showed promising for continuous treatment considering simultaneous adsorption and oxidation processes good activity of the catalyst is related to the non accumulation of by products final products in the reactor the partial catalyst deactivation seems to be associated with the poisoning by acidic byproducts also raise up the residence time due to the liquid superficial velocity decrement was more effective than bed volume enhancement for the degradation of ps and removal of mtz therefore it is proposed that future studies should be developed on the deactivated mechanism and regeneration

14016,activation of persulfate in the presence of nitric acid treated granular activated carbon was studied in order to investigate the degradation of metronidazole from aqueous medium in the continuous up flow fixed bed reactor a tubular glass reactor with internal diameter of 2 cm and height of 15 cm was filled with desirable mass of rod shaped activated carbon with diameter of 4 mm and height of 6 mm the synthetic wastewater containing persulfate and metronidazole was entered into the reactor in up flow operation at steady state condition and under the optimum values of operating parameters about 88 of influent persulfate was decomposed and decreased to 73 after 7 h under this condition the metronidazole removal reached to 93 and gradually decreased to 74 at the end of process due to the saturation of the catalyst and occupation of available active sites for sulfate radical production the results indicated promising performance of sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process in continuous fixed bed reactor for degradation of resistant pollutants from aqueous medium keywords metronidazole granular activated carbon persulfate fixed bed reactor continuous operation 1 introduction pharmaceuticals are beneficial compounds utilized for both humans and animals because of widespread usage these materials and their metabolites are continuously being entered into the aquatic environment through the disposal of humans sewage or meat production factories effluents 1 4 metronidazole mtz is one of the five nitroimidazole derivatives which is bactericidal to microaerophilic and anaerobic microorganisms 5 this compound considered to be pseudo persistent compounds due to the high solubility 9 5 g l 1 low biodegradability and carcinogenic potential that can be accumulated in living organisms also mtz detected in concentrations of 0 011 to 0 055 μm in hospital effluent wastewaters 6 wastewater treatment is the incorporation of biological and chemical processes to remove any harmful constituents from raw wastewater prior to discharge to receiving resources 7 in recent years resistant pollutants have attracted more attention because of the poor performance of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove these constituents 8 9 over time various oxidation processes have been established for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents containing mtz such as uv fenton photo fenton electro fenton ozonation and hybrid processes 5 10 13 in the recent decay sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes showed promising outlook for the treatment of resistant pollutants due to the high redox potential of sulfate radical 2 5 3 1 ev vs nhe as well as long lifetime compared to hydroxyl radical t1 2 so4 30 40 μs and t1 2 ho 1 μs 1 14 sulfate radicals are generated via activation of peroxymonosulfate hso5 pms or persulfate s2o8 2 ps through various activation methods including uv heat and transition metals 15 18 catalytic metal activation is more economic less complex in reactor configuration and has low activation energy demands compared to energy based activation however secondary pollutants in the final waste accompanied turbidity limited the use of metallic catalysts as it was demonstrated in the work of ghauch and coworkers 19 21 newly activated carbon ac has been shown an ideal alternative for free radical generation in the ac h2o2 system due to the high porosity high specific surface area low cost environmentally friendly and abundant of oxygen functional groups on the surface 22 24 according to the symmetric structure of ps and h2o2 liang and coworkers 25 proposed the mechanisms of so4 generation over ac as follows 1 acsurface ooh s2o8 2 so4 acsurface oo hso4 2 acsurface oh s2o8 2 so4 acsurface o hso4 many researchers focused on the ac ps or ac pms processes to decompose resistant pollutants from water and wastewater 26 30 in the sulfate radical based process complete mineralization of mtz

and removal of mtz in aqueous media in a batch reactor in our recent research work 31 modification of activated carbon using nitric acid was studied in order to investigate the role of acidic oxygen functional groups on the transformation of ps to free sulfate radicals for mtz removal from an aqueous medium the results showed that nitric acid treated of ac introduces large quantity of acidic functional groups on the surface which are effective in the transformation of ps to free sulfate radicals to the best of our knowledge the studies on the heterogeneous catalytic ps activation are limited to the batch systems for practical applications continuous flow reactor systems should be studied to develop scale up methods therefore in the current study the performance of ps activation over granular activated carbon modified with nitric acid was investigated for degradation of mtz in the continuous up flow fixed bed reactor 2 experimental 2 1 materials mtz 99 purity was supplied by

according to the method described in the previous study 31 a certain amount of washed and dried ac was immersed in concentrated hno3 at the ratio of 1 g solid 10 ml acid and heated at 90 c for 5 h under continuous reflux and stirring at 100 rpm afterward the sample was filtered and washed several times with deionized water until no change in the ph of washing water could be detected nitric acid treated sample was dried at 105 c for 24 h and denoted as nac 2 3 continuous fixed bed setup the continuous oxidation experiments were performed in a bench scale system a schematic flowchart of the experimental setup is outlined in fig 1 as demonstrated the experimental setup has consisted of a glass column with an internal diameter of 2 cm and a total height of 15 cm the influent aqueous solution of mtz and ps was fed to the reactor in up flow operation using a peristaltic pump for better liquid distribution the catalyst was packed between two inert glass beads with the diameter of 5 mm in order to determine the optimal operating conditions batch screening tests were carried out in a series of 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml solution with different initial mtz and ps concentration nac dosage and ph values 1 31 in the continuous operations initial mtz and ph values were kept at 100 mg l 1 0 58 mm and 3 9 respectively according to the derivative results of batch experiments however several experiments at different ps concentrations 5 8 11 6 29 and 58 mm nac bed heights 3 5 and 5 0 cm proportional to 5 and 8 g nac and liquid flow rates 1 68 and 2 40 cm3 min 1 were carried

is the catalyst bed volume the liquid holdup has been calculated from the following equation 5 ε l ε β l in this equation ε is the mean voidage and could be determined according to the relation between internal reactor diameter dr and particle diameter dp 32 6 ε 0 373 1 703 d r d p 0 611 2 also βl is the external liquid saturation that was calculated using the excel worksheet simulator for the flooded bed reactor available at http www gch ulaval ca taking into account the physical properties of liquid and gas phase catalyst and reactor geometries and operating conditions it should be noted that the co2 released by the mineralization of mtz eq 3 was considered as the gas phase for simulation all necessary parameters for evaluation of residence time are given in table 1 2 4

surface area sbet was determined by bet brunauer emmet teller equation the total pore volume vtot was calculated from the adsorbed volume of gas near the saturation point micro pore vmicro and meso pore vmeso volumes were determined by the t plot and bjh barrett joyner and halenda method respectively 2 4 2 boehm technique boehm titration technique was applied to determine the surface functional groups of both modified and unmodified activated carbons 33 a certain amount of ac 1 5 g was added to a series of 50 ml of 0 05 m naoh hcl na2co3 and nahco3 solutions and agitated by shaking at room temperature for 24 h after filtration of solutions 10 ml of each sample was back titrated with a 0 05 m hcl or naoh the number of acidic groups was evaluated based on these assumptions that nahco3 neutralizes carboxyls na2co3 neutralizes carboxyls and lactones and naoh neutralizes carboxyls lactones and phenolic groups the number of basic sites was calculated based on the amount of hcl that reacted with carbon 2 4 3 ph of zero point charge the point of zero charge phpzc of fac and nac was evaluated by the mass titration method 34 three glass bottles containing 40 ml of 0 1 m nacl in deionized water with solid weight percent of 10 15 and 20 were sealed and placed at a constant temperature the phpzc is the ultimate ph of suspensions after 48 h of contact time the time that ph equilibrium is reached 2 4 4 operational parameter the degradation of mtz was calculated by measuring maximum absorbance at the wavelength of 319 nm residual ps in the solution was analyzed by iodometric titration of ps with potassium iodide at the wavelength of 352 nm 35 a uv vis spectrophotometer unico 2100 usa was utilized to measure the concentrations of mtz and ps the conversion rate

3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the granular activated carbons textural properties boehm titration and phpzc determination the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of fac and nac at 77 k are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively according to the iupac classification the nitrogen adsorption isotherms for both samples can be classified as types i 36 the sharp increase at low relative pressures indicating the micro porosity structure of samples with an average pore width smaller than 2 nm table 2 summarized the textural properties including specific surface area total pore micro pore and meso pore volumes it can be seen that the transformation of micro pores to meso pores and macro pores caused decrease in specific surface area by 36 after nitric acid modification due to the formation of oxygen functional groups or humic substances that are direct oxidation products 37 similar results published by researchers in terms of surface area and micro pore volume reduction after nitric acid treatment due to the erosion of the surface 38 40 the chemical properties of samples as a result of phpzc determination and boehm titration are summarized in table 3 after the modification process the reduction in phpzc from 9 9 to 3 7 indicated successful acidification of ac surface table 3 also shows the results of boehm titration for fac and nac after nitric acid modification the total number of acidic surface groups increased significantly which is in agreement with phpzc of nac the oxidation reaction of surface and nitric acid leads to the formation of considerable carboxylic groups compared with lactonic and phenolic groups this result is consistent with that obtained by gokce and coworker 41 they concluded that hno3 utilization has a dominant effect on the generation of carboxylic groups more than lactonic and phenolic groups 3 2 determination of operational parameters in our previous studies in the batch system 1 31 fac and nac were used as ps activators and the results showed that fac has a good ability to catalyze ps toward oxidation of mtz however the rate of ps degradation and mtz removal increased significantly when nac was used as an activator therefore nac was utilized in the fixed bed reactor in order to investigate the performance of the nac ps system in continuous operation also the best performance in the batch system was achieved in the acidic medium as stated in the literature 11 42 acidic by products such as oxalic acid and acetic acid were identified during the oxidation of mtz which are responsible for the acidification of the bulk solution considering acidic by product final product formation during the oxidation process as well as the acidic nature of ps the experiments were performed at the initial ph of solution 3 9 without any adjustment our results in the batch system also showed that simultaneous adsorption and oxidation processes induced mtz removal in the fac ps and nac ps systems as well as the oxidation process was taken place on the surface or in the boundary layer around the catalyst 3 3 continuous fixed bed operations the continuous experiments were conducted at constant ph and initial mtz concentration of 3 9 and 100 mg l 1 and the effect of influent ps loading 5 8 11 6 29 and 58 mm equivalent to the ps mtz molar ratio of 10 1 20 1 50 1 and 100 1 respectively catalyst bed height 3 5 and 5 0 cm equivalent to the 5 and 8 g nac and volumetric flow rate 1 68 and 2 40 cm3 min 1 were investigated on the performance of process 3 3 1 effect of influent ps concentration on mtz removal to evaluate the effect of ps concentration on the mtz removal in the continuous system 5 0 g nac was placed in the reactor and the wastewater with constant flow rate of 2 40 cm3 min 1 was pumped as indicated in table 1 the residence time equivalent to these bed height and influent flow rate is 1 9 min the obtained results in fig 4 shows that the steady state condition has arrived less than 30 min after the injection of wastewater without any ps adsorption curve the mtz removal was only due to the adsorption process and gradually decreased from 66 to 52 in the oxidation process the mtz removal increased to 68 73 82 and 85 for ps mtz molar ratios of 10 1 20 1 50 1 and 100 1 respectively due to the simultaneous adsorption and oxidation process and decreased gradually to the final values of 63 72 78 and 79 at the end of process the results of 50 1 and 100 1 molar ratios are very close probably due to the inadequate decomposition of ps as a result of low residence time or inadequate catalyst active sites the advantage of continuous operation over the batch system is the transportation of unreacted reactants and by products away from the reactor that decreases deactivation rate of catalyst and increases process lifetime catalyst deactivation is well represented both in the adsorption and oxidation processes however the rate of deactivation in the oxidation process is less than the adsorption process lower catalyst deactivation rate indicated in situ catalyst regeneration during the oxidation process that was observed in batch experiments too 1 some researchers also reported in situ catalyst regeneration during the oxidation process due to the decomposition of surface adsorbed compounds 30 43 3 3 2 effect of influent ps concentration on ps degradation the ps decomposition rates proportional to the influent values of 5 8 11 6 29 and 58 mm are presented in fig 5 as it is illustrated a considerable amount of ps was discharged in all ratios without any decomposition the effluent amount of ps in 10 1 molar ratio was low and this value increases significantly when ps loading raised up to 58 mm insufficient ps decomposition in high influent ps concentration can be due to the limitation in the active surface of catalyst or residence time from fig 4 the mtz removal in 20 1 molar ratio which is close to the stoichiometric molar ratio of ps to mtz 21 1 according to reaction 3 is relatively acceptable while only about half of the influent ps has been degraded according to the fig 5 taking into account the contribution of the adsorption process for mtz removal it is possible to achieve higher mtz removal with influent ps concentration lower than stoichiometry value if operating conditions change to increase the rate of ps degradation with respect to the economic and operating efficiency of the process the decomposition of influent ps as high as possible is necessary and inevitable increasing the residence time is one of the ways to enhance the rate of ps decomposition in the reactor which can be done in two ways first increasing the bed height at constant inlet flow rate and second decreasing the flow rate at constant bed height both modes have been investigated for the ps mtz molar ratio of 20 1 and the results have been reported 3 3 3 effect of residence time on ps degradation and mtz removal the change in the liquid flow rate and catalytic bed volume and their effects on residence time are given in table 1 as shown a decrease in liquid flow rate to 1 68 cm3 min 1 at constant bed volume or increase in bed volume to 15 7 cm3 at a fixed flow rate led to raising up the residence time to 2 8 min the effect of residence time change on the ps degradation and mtz removal at constant influent ps mtz molar ratio of 20 1 are depicted in figs 6 and 7 respectively fig 6 reveals the effect of residence time on ps decomposition as shown a significant increase in the rate of ps decomposition has been observed in both modes the ps degradation increased to 78 and 88 when bed volume and volumetric flow rate changed to 15 7 cm3 and 1 68 cm3 min 1 respectively and gradually decreased to final values of 70 and 73 as was shown the superficial liquid velocity is more important than bed volume to enhance the decomposition rate of ps from fig 7 an increase in residence time by bed volume increase could not change significantly the rate of mtz removal both in adsorption and oxidation processes in the next mode reduction in liquid flow rate to 1 68 cm3 min 1 significantly increased the mtz removal to 78 and 93 in the adsorption and oxidation processes respectively however the deactivation rate of catalyst increased strictly especially in the adsorption process more decrement in the volumetric flow rate leads to enhance catalyst deactivation rate therefore the results show that superficial velocity is more important than active surface sites which should be optimized to achieve good pollutant removal as well as low catalyst deactivation rate as inferred from the comparison of the results in figs 6 and 7 the ps degradation increased significantly when bed volume increased to 15 7 cm3 however mtz removal was not increased remarkably as mentioned previously the most of oxidation reaction takes place on the surface of catalyst or in the boundary layer around the surface therefore sufficient contact time is necessary to overcome mass transfer resistance considering the phpzc of nac 3 9 pka of mtz 2 55 and anionic form of oxidant partial positive surface charge developed on the surface of the catalyst in acidic medium the partial charge leads to the electrostatic attractive force between the surface and ps and repulsive force between the surface and mtz 1 the pathway of the oxidation reaction is shown in fig 8 at first the oxidizing agent must be reached from the bulk to the outer layer of the boundary pass through the thickness of the boundary layer and interact with the surface afterward the generated radicals should return toward the bulk and react with the contaminant molecules in around the boundary due to the low radical s lifetime as well as high superficial liquid velocity it seems that inadequate contact time between the radicals and mtz molecules is the main factor that influences the rate of mtz removal as a result sufficient active site is available for decomposition of ps however high superficial liquid velocity limited the contact time and mtz removal efficiency many researchers focused on the wet peroxide oxidation process in the fixed bed reactor based on the simultaneous thermal and catalyst activation of hydrogen peroxide 44 48 kronholm and coworkers 49 51 used potassium persulfate in a continuous flow operation to remove phenolic compounds from pressurized hot supercritical water as the best of our knowledge no study was found using metal free catalysts for sulfate radical generation in the continuous fixed bed reactor therefore the comparison of the results of this study with the wet oxidation process is not possible because of the difference in the type of process however the results obtained in this study indicated that the sulfate radical catalyzed by granular activated carbon in the continuous fixed bed reactor has good potential to remove resistant contaminants from aqueous medium the continuous fixed bed operation has many advantages over batch system including no need for the separation of catalyst in situ catalyst regeneration flexibility against fluctuations in the influent wastewater good ability against the treatment of a large volume of wastewater low operation cost and high process time 4 conclusions in this study activation of ps in the presence of granular activated carbon modified with nitric acid was investigated for the degradation of mtz in the continuous up flow fixed bed reactor due to the good catalytic activity and stability during long periods of time the activated carbon showed promising for continuous treatment considering simultaneous adsorption and oxidation processes good activity of the catalyst is related to the non accumulation of by products final products in the reactor the partial catalyst deactivation seems to be associated with the poisoning by acidic byproducts also raise up the residence time due to the liquid superficial velocity decrement was more effective than bed volume enhancement for the degradation of ps and removal of mtz therefore it is proposed that future studies should be developed on the deactivated mechanism and regeneration

maximum value of 87 lm 2h 1bar 1 the highest value reported so far the panel switching mechanism helps to enhance the system throughput by allowing two sided membrane panel with intermittently bubbling in the expense of mechanical switching energy the estimation of energy consumption of the system has been estimated at 0 247 kwhm 3 corresponding to 0 3 of total electricity generated from anaerobic treatment of pome very attractive for full scale implementation keywords palm oil mill effluent anaerobic membrane bioreactor membrane fouling control biogas bubbling membrane filtration 1 introduction palm oil and its related industries have long been a significant part of malaysian economy asides of indonesia malaysia is among the largest palm oil contributors producing 19 92 million tonnes and exporting 16 56 million tonnes of palm oil in 2017 1 2 for each tonne of crude palm oil produced it requires 5 7 5 tonnes of water and more than 50 of the water turns as the palm oil mill effluent pome 3 there were around 60 88 million tonnes of pome produced in malaysia in the year of 2015 4 pome poses undesirable properties such as high in viscosity temperature chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand suspended solids and it also contains grease makes it compulsory to be treated before discharge 1 otherwise it induces detrimental impacts including oxygen depletion in aquatic habitats death of marine life and changes in the physicochemical properties of soil 5 on the other hand the appropriate treatment of pome might yield many valuable by products such as methane biohydrogen and fertilizers 6 7 thus decent pome treatment is both necessary to protect the environment and beneficial as additional resources most palm oil mills use anaerobic digestion ad for the primary treatment followed by the ponding system for pome treatment due to its low capital and operating costs 8 disadvantages of this system include its high foot print due to long retention time 30 60 days recently membrane processes have been widely explored and proven to be an effective method to separate biomass that can be returned to the digester to form a hybrid anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr 9 the ability of an anmbr to decouple biomass and hydraulic retention time enhances the decomposition of particulate matter 10 on top of that it also allows a shorter period of treatment process a smaller footprint and produces high permeate quality which lowers the burden of the further treatment units as well as offers recovery of chemicals undesirable properties wu et al 11 reported an effective recovery of protein and carbohydrate from pome using ultrafiltration of polysulfone membrane research on anmbrs show the effectiveness of the system to provide satisfying biological performance 12 17 however membrane fouling significantly hinders anmbrs implementation for pome treatment one study on the application of a lab scale anmbrs to treat simulated pome could only offer permeability of 5 20 lm 2h 1bar 1 attributed to severe organic foulant 12 after two cycles of chemical cleanings the permeability dropped from 20 to 5 within 15 days in another study the use of cross flow ultrafiltration to treat anmbr sludge pome yielded permeability of merely 1 2 lm 2h 1bar 1 11 some other attempts on controlling membrane fouling in anmbr treating pome have also been reported intermittent ultrasonic application has been applied for membrane fouling control but still reported the membrane fouling issue 14 the use of relaxation and nitrogen gas bubbling have also been reported and could only sustain the filtration for about 10 days in which the permeability dropped from 120 to 18 lm 2h 1bar 1 14 filtration of the supernatant of ad sludge treating pome pre treated with a microbial fuel cell at a constant flux of 22 lm 2h 1 could only maintain the permeability of 55 lm 2h 1bar 1 with one hour 16 those reports suggest the highly fouling tendency of anmbr treating pome and the necessity to discover technique for effective membrane fouling control biogas recirculation sparging is one of the most common approach for membrane fouling control in submerged anmbr 18 19 in comparison to particle sparging and rotation membrane system and has been assessed in nine out of eleven pilot scale systems reports in literature 19 in biogas sparging systems the uprising gas bubbles introduced at the downside of membrane module create turbulence in the liquid which scours membrane surface by increasing back transport of foulants from the membrane surface studies show that biogas bubbling is an effective and common strategy used to control membrane fouling for anmbr process 20 22 recently zhang et al 23 performed a study to find the optimal biogas sparging strategy the result reveals that the critical constant sparging rate is at 6 lmin 1 at a flux of 26 lm 2h 1 and a 150 of membrane fouling rate is reduced with alter 3 5 3 lmin 1 for 30 s alternating with 5 lmin 1 for 30 s strategy compared to a constant rate of 4 lmin 1 on top of gas sparging at gas demand of 0 15 1 22 nm3m 2h 1 most pilot scale gas sparging also applied sludge recirculation at crossflow velocity of 9 7 94 mh 1 in the membrane tank to provide additional turbulence on membrane surface and better mixing which account for as low as 0 03 of the energy associated for membrane fouling control 19 rigorous analysis of the energy consumption on the pilot scale performance data showed that the energy demand associated with gas sparging was at a range of 1 28 1 35 kwhm 3 for the flat sheet membrane 24 which is a way higher than the hollow fibre membrane of 0 21 0 13 kwhm 3 the high energy demand for the flat sheet membrane was attributed to the high gas sparging intensity coupled with a low flux of about 7 lm 2h 1 the pilot scale based energy consumption estimation data are much improved than the one obtained from the lab scale biogas sparging values of 0 69 5 68 kwhm 3 25 calculation of the energy balance of anmbr reveal that from the pilot scale performance data the membrane fouling control contributed to 78 1 1 6 of the total electrical energy generated by the produced biogas 19 suggesting an ominous prospect of full implementation of anmbr the attempt to further lower the energy associated for membrane fouling control is thus imperative the key factor that inflates the energy consumption of biogas sparging in anmbr is a low achievable flux due to high membrane fouling propensity of the sludge a recently developed tilted panel filtration system has been proven to be effective and energy efficient for membrane fouling control in microalgae and can reach maximum flux for treating activated sludge 26 28 nawi et al 29 also employed a tilted panel system to maximize the impact of air bubbling to mitigate fouling for microalgae harvesting besides osman et al 30 applied a patterned membrane in an aerated tilted panel for an energy efficient filtration system for activated sludge treatment it is thus hypothesized that such system can improve the filterability of anmbr sludge treating pome which can then support the widespread implementation of anmbr process in this context the aeration used in the tilted system can be replaced with biogas bubbling recirculated in an enclosed system within the bioreactor this study investigates the impact of bubbling in limiting membrane fouling for filtration of anmbr sludge treating pome using tilted panel filtration system the effect of operational parameters including tilting angle bubbling rate and switching period on membrane fouling control are evaluated and optimized later the energy consumption of the most optimum parameters is also estimated to gauge the feasibility of this system 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic digestion sludge properties the pome sample was collected from the ad unit treating pome bubbling tank of a nearest full scale anaerobic wastewater treatment plant tian siang oil mill malaysia the ad sludge had the following properties cod of 3 5 gl 1 mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of 33 g l and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of 28 g l the characterization of the feed sample was performed and it was found that the feed has low 3 6 gl 1 of cod 0 19 gl 1 of total nitrogen and 0 21 gl 1 of total phosphorus the quality of the ad effluent was still too poor for direct discharge and was then sent to the ponding system the feed was refreshed daily to avoid biomass physiological stress and to maintain its condition for prolonged usage the full anmbr mode was not tested because the study was aimed to access the system filterability in treating ad pome sludge detailed analysis on the permeate quality was not performed since the membrane was applied here for biomass separation and was not expected to retain the organics 2 2 membrane fabrication and characteristics polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf sigma aldrich and dimethylacetamide dmac sigma aldrich were used as polymer and solvent respectively to fabricate the flat sheet membrane a dope solution of 15 wt of pvdf in dmac was stirred and degasses to form a homogeneously bubble free dope solution it was then cast using a casting knife at a wet casting thickness of 0 22 mm atop of a non woven support novatexx 2471 freudenberg filter germany to provide mechanical support to the membrane film 31 the cast film immediately immersed in a water bath containing deionized water and was kept wet until usage the characteristics of the fabricated membrane were as follow thickness of 0 18 mm contact angle of 75 mean flow pore size of 0 16 μm and clean water permeability of 906 10 lm 2h 1bar 1 2 3 filtration set up membrane sheets were assembled into two types of filtration panel one sided surface with an effective area of 0 012 m2 of 1 side x 0 10 0 12 m and two sided surface of 2 sides x 0 10 0 12 m the membrane filterability performance was evaluated using a submerged system under a constant trans membrane pressure δp of 0 1 bar fig 1 due to technical limitations the biogas bubbling via gas recirculation applied in the actual system was replaced by aeration in this study under the testing conditions low temperature and pressure no significant difference in gas properties is expected 2 4 filtration test for all tests the filtration cycle consists of 10 min of filtration followed by 0 5 min of relaxation the permeate was collected and its volume was measured during the relaxation period subsequently it was returned to the tank to maintain the feed condition and level the effect of the tilting angle was first tested by tilting the membrane panel at 0 vertical 5 10 15 and 20 and the bubbling was set constant at 1 5 lmin 1 the effect of the bubbling rate was evaluated by fixing the bubbling rate at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 lmin 1 with a constant inclination of the panel at 20 the effect of switching period was studied under the on off cycles of 1 1 2 2 2 5 2 5 5 5 and 10 10 min min with a constant bubbling rate of 1 5 lmin 1and tilting angle of 20 the three parameters tilting angle bubbling rate and intermittent bubbling were done using one sided panel the effect of panel switching on the filtration performance was performed to assess the feasibility of operating the system under switching mode and enhance the throughput as suggested elsewhere 28 it is noted that when a panel is tilted only one side is fully exposed to bubbling thus the effect of the switching period was assessed to represent the impact of tilting two sided membranes mounted in a panel the switching periods were run at 0 1 2 2 5 5 and 10 min corresponds to the frequency of 60 30 24 12 and 6 switches per hour respectively using a constant bubbling rate of 1 5 lmin 1and a tilting angle of 20 the filtration flux and permeability of the membrane was determined using eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 j v a t 2 l j δ p where j represents the water flux lm 2h 1 v volume of permeate l a the effective membrane area m2 t the effective filtration time h l the permeability lm 2h 1bar 1 and δ p the trans membrane pressure bar physical cleaning was performed after every filtration test by scrubbing the foulant using sponge and flushing with tap water in addition chemical cleaning was performed after each test by soaking the membrane into a 1 sodium hypochlorite cloroc solution in di water at 60 c for at least 2 h to ensure the recovery of at least 95 of the pristine permeability value 2 5 estimation of energy consumption the performance of the tilted panel was estimated using a basis of a fullscale mbr detailed elsewhere 32 the energy analysis assumed a similar energy consumption and treatment capacity of the equivalent unit to yield a sensible comparison as also adopted by others 33 however changes in the item tilting and bubbling energy and values of each factor were considered to accommodate the operation of the tilted panel besides the method applied by eliseus et al 27 was also used for estimation of energy consumption of the switching panel system w s and gas bubbling a r r the energy model is simplified in eq 3 and 4 3 w s f s s s p η 4 a r r 0 23 s a d m s s a d m r l r l s where fs is the resultant force experienced by the submerged panel s is panel switching displacement sp is switching period sadm s is sadm of simulated data sadm r is sadm of reference data lr is permeability of reference data and ls is permeability of simulated data the switching energy efficiency was assumed at η 60 based on the general guidelines for common mechanical and electrical installation 34 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tilting angle fig 2 shows the positive impact of panel tilting to enhance permeability in which the impact is more prominent at higher angles the tests were run up to 20 due to practical limitation of the set up and the impact should react optimum value at an angle of θ 45 with maximum flux before it decreases as the angle further increased as reported by cheng et al 36 and offer maximum impact forces with minimum energy consumption as suggested by eliseus et al 27 the sudden drop of permeability after the initial reading just before reaching a quasi steady state value fig 2a indicates that the membranes suffer from fouling and significant loss of permeability of 90 occurs due to the fouling in the initial stage of the filtration which reduces their permeability it proves that the presence of bubbling as fouling control mechanism could not prevent but only reduce the extent of the membrane fouling however tilting the panel significantly enhances its permeability and limits the fouling effect increasing tilting angle up to 20 gives the highest steady state permeability of 86 7 2 89 lm 2h 1bar 1 corresponds to an increase of 129 of the one aligned vertically of 35 0 lm 2h 1bar 1 the results demonstrate a similar trend with a study reported by cheng 36 whereas module inclination effectively improves the filterability performance of ultrafiltration at slug flow regime due to enhanced disturbance of concentration polarization layer on the membrane surface theoretically the bubbles supplied possess similar a value of buoyance force fb for all tests in fig 2 since the bubbling rate was fixed at 1 5 l min 1 however in the case of the tilting panel the upwards trajectory of the bubbles is obstructed by the panel as illustrated in fig 3 which initiates the exertion of impact force fi and drag force fd with fi fb sin θ as reported elsewhere 26 when the panel is tilted to higher angles the contact between bubbles and the panel is more intense represented by higher impact force which maximizes the impact of bubbles shear rate to scour off the deposited foulant in contrast the bubbles in the vertical panel tend to move centrally in the space between the adjacent panels hence reduces the scouring impact and lowers the permeability however without bubbling tilting alone does not give any impact on permeability since it does not offer any scouring forces from the bubbles eliseus et al 26 also confirmed that increasing the drag force would improve the ability of bubbles to remove deposited foulant on the membrane surface in microalgae broth filtration they managed to improve permeability by 20 by tilting the panel to 20 besides cheng and lin 38 reported an optimum tilting angle of 180 horizontal placement in another study by cheng 36 inclination at an angle of 50 was considered as optimum for a tubular membrane based on these studies it can be postulated that the optimum angle varies depending on several factors including feed type membrane type and filtration system a more holistic theory explaining the impact of panel tilting is thus required fig 2b shows that the increment of the tilting angle 0 to 20 gradually improves the permeability from 35 to 86 7 lm 2h 1bar 1 the typical permeability of 60 lm 2h 1bar 1 reported that permeability for filtration of anaerobic sludge is relatively low due to the high membrane fouling propensity of the feed 39 the attempt to enhance permeability even by a sophisticated vibration device could only led to permeability of 60 lm 2h 1bar 1 40 in a study conducted by ahmad et al 41 the highest permeability achieved in pome treatment of a membrane pilot plant was 35 lm 2h 1bar 1 while sulaiman and chea 42 recorded 63 3 lm 2h 1bar 1 by comparing these results it is clear that the tilted panel system has great potential to achieve a significantly higher permeability than conventional filtration setup it is also expected that higher permeability could be achieved by increasing the panel tilting angle up to 45 however due to setup limitation 20 is the maximum tilting angle we could attain despite high permeability a larger footprint consumed by the system with a higher panel tilting angle should be considered 3 2 effect of bubbling rate the permeability increases gradually with an increase of bubbling rate as demonstrated in fig 4 this is expected since higher bubbling rates provide more intense contact of the bubbles with the membrane surface thus enhances the effectiveness of scouring 43 in this study the highest permeability was 86 7 lm 2h 1bar 1 obtained when 1 5 lmin 1 of bubbling rate was provided which is 3 times higher than without bubbling in addition even at a relatively low bubbling rate 0 3 l min 1 the permeability increases by 50 compared to non bubbled system 30 0 lm 2h 1bar 1 this finding proves that bubbling is one of the effective fouling control mechanisms for a submerged filtration system the findings also suggest that more bubbles with larger sizes were released at a higher bubbling rate thus remarkably delay the fouling effect and lengthen the effective membrane filtration this can be confirmed by a cfd simulation developed by ndinisa et al 44 where a higher degree of bubbles meandering is noticed at higher bubbling rates it has been reported that as soon as the air bubble leaves the diffuser it moves towards the edges of the column as it rises with two main streams that flow upwards these two main plumes of gas move up in meandering manner where the degree of a meandering is much higher at higher gas flow rate 44 besides kuwagi et al 45 also found that the gas bubbles start to move in a zigzag manner only when the gas flow is increased else they move upwards in a straight line manner in a stagnant liquid consequently the higher degree of bubble meandering enhances the average shear stress onto the membrane 44 theoretically larger bubbles have higher buoyancy force and contribute to a greater impact force of bubbles onto the membrane surface 26 suggesting better foulant removal nonetheless the trend of the permeability increment suggests that the impact will reach an optimum where the scouring impact reaches a peak as also reported by others 28 46 47 3 3 bubbling efficiency for fouling mitigation tilting angle and bubbling rate have a synergistic effect in enhancing permeability the drag fd and impact forces fi of the bubbles exerted was estimated fig 5 by assuming fd fb cos θ and fi fb sin θ respectively the finding verifies that the tilting angle and bubbling rates remarkably affect the total forces exerted by the bubbles the bubbles exerted minimal drag force from bubbles bouncing to the membrane surface without any impact force for the vertical alignment this also means that cleaning in a vertical panel relies solely on the tangential shear rates produced from the drag force and secondary flow of liquid induced by the upward movement of the bubbles ignoring the potential for bubbles to bounce multiple times only first contact of bubbles to the membrane surface considered it follows that most of the cleaning mechanism is affected by the drag force the impact of tilting angles and bubbling rates can be further explained by the difference in the number of effective bubbles coming into contact with the membrane surface in which cleaning is more efficient at a higher number of effective bubbles to estimate the number of effective bubbles an assumption was made that 80 of the bubbles were in direct contact at θ 20 and the rests do not come into contact due to parallel flow bouncing off etc based on the differences in the permeability and assuming equal sized bubbles of d 3 mm the effective number of bubbles were estimated to be 5500 8250 11000 16 500 and 22 000 bubbles per minute at a bubbling rate of 1 5 lmin 1 at different tilting angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 corresponds to 20 30 40 60 and 80 of effective bubbles respectively the estimation was based on a report by eliseus et al 28 and a study by ndinisa et al 44 in which the number size and volume of the bubbles increase with an increase in bubble flow rate they suggested that increasing the tilting angle improves the percentage of effective bubbles however it should be noted that this is only a rough estimation since accurate calculation is difficult due to various factors i e bubbles travelling path velocity of bubbles bubble size dynamics and liquid phase dynamics wang et al 48 also stated that on top of the number of bubbles several factors such as size and velocity of bubbles could affect fouling mitigation 3 4 effect of intermittent aeration and panel switching a high bubbling rate leads to higher compressor energy and can undermine the feasibility of bubbling for membrane fouling control therefore intermittent bubbling was tested in this study for the one sided panel fig 6 moreover despite showing significant permeability improvements section 3 1 3 3 the tilted panel faces a new challenge in which the bubbling limited to only one side of panel which limits the membrane productivity to a half therefore switching mechanism to intermittently bubble both sides of the panel was introduced the switch functions in bubbling the membrane panel on the first side for a specific duration before turns to another side alternatingly in this case a trade off between panel productivity and switching energy as well as physical and mechanical constrains must be considered in order to attain optimal filtration conditions for the one sided panel intermittent aeration of 10 min represents an alternating condition of bubbling on and bubbling off each for 10 min period for the two sided membrane panel it means that each side was bubbled for 10 min alternatingly tests with switching intermittent periods beyond 10 min were deemed unnecessary because it has been proven that foulant on the membrane surface could not be adequately removed under prolonged idle time eliseus et al also showed that for activated sludge 28 and microalgae 26 filtration the side without bubbling is more exposed to irreversible fouling at longer switching period generally for all tested periods of intermittent bubbling or switching permeability shows an almost similar trend as a function of time which show a drastic drop and reaches almost constant permeability after 20 min of filtration until the end interestingly the permeability fluctuates for the one sided panel fig 6 since this only can be observed on one sided panel it proves that bubbling helps to scour off the deposited foulant when under bubbling and foulant accumulates on the membrane surface during the bubbling idle mode fig 7 illustrates the mechanism of the panel switching including foulant removal on the aerated side and foulant deposition on the idle side for both one and two sided panels the intermittent bubbling period of 10 min provides ample time for foulant accumulation on the idle side and foulant elimination on the bubbled side to remarkably affect the profile of permeability as shown by permeability fluctuation in fig 6 the permeability increases under bubbling and slightly drops in the absent of bubbling suggesting that the membrane is easily fouled in the absence of bubbling for the two sided panel there is no obvious permeability fluctuation since the permeability is the average of both the bubbled and the idle sides fig 8 a shows the steady state permeability as a function of intermittent bubbling period for the one sided panel and switching period for the two sided panel the permeability decreases at a longer period and it is more obvious for the one sided panel intermittent bubbling for the one sided panel intermittent bubbling periods of less than 2 min demonstrate almost similar result to the one with continuous bubbling switching period of 0 min beyond 2 5 min of intermittent bubbling periods increasing the periods show a slight decrease of steady state permeability these results indicate that the cleaning is more effective at shorter intermittent bubbling periods due to less time provided for the foulant to accumulate on the membrane surface when it is not under bubbling in contrast the effect of the switching period is less prominent on two sided panels as illustrated in fig 7 for the two sided panel while bubbling one side of the membrane the foulant keeps accumulating on the idle side since all effective membrane areas both sides need to be considered in calculating permeability the larger area of two sided panel is a disadvantage in terms of permeability despite of lower permeability the two sided membrane panel shows better panel productivity compared to the one sided panel as shown in fig 8 b the dashed line indicates the productivity of the one sided panel placed in vertical alignment with the bubbling of 1 5 l min 1 as the benchmark the productivity differences between the one and the two sided membrane panels are more obvious for switching intermittent bubbling periods of 2 5 min 45 8 43 6 and 42 1 for 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 min period respectively 3 5 energy consumption by using the energy model simulated by eliseus et al 27 the estimated total energy used for the filtration system is summarized in fig 9 we assumed that the system to operate at the same treatment capacity with referenced mbr with similar energy consumption of 0 16 kwhm 3 including influent and permeate pumping cleaning in place and air compression 32 37 according to fenu et al 32 a full scale mbr system has total energy consumption of 0 64 kwhm 3 in this study the energy estimation was performed for a tilted system involving switching at a constant specific bubbling demand of 0 12 m3m 2h 1 at switching frequencies of 6 12 24 30 and 60 h 1 it shows that high switching frequencies increase the overall energy mainly for switching on the other hand the bubbling energy decreases because of high permeability associated with high switching frequency the low bubbling energy originated from a lower membrane area required for producing a specific amount of permeate higher switching frequencies require more mechanical energy for switching and thus must be optimized reducing switching frequency will reduce the total energy consumption but operating switching frequency at lower than 6 h 1 might cause concentration polarization and formation of the fouling layer during the idle time 49 in this system the lowest energy was achieved at a switching frequency of 6 h 1 corresponding to the energy consumption of 0 247 kwhm 3 the estimated total energy consumption for switching frequency of 60 h 1 switching period of 1 min is 0 263 kwhm 3 which is 9 6 higher than the frequency of 6 h 1 the increment of total energy for higher switching frequency is a result of a slight decrease of bubbling energy but overwhelmed by the more prominence increment of switching energy the energy estimation results confirm the potential of the tilted panel system for fouling control in anaerobic sludge filtration this filtration is suitable to be applied as energy efficient method in anmbr in which the air can be replaced by biogas recirculation as often reported 19 50 51 the results of the energy consumption associated with membrane fouling control shown in fig 9 of of 0 247 0 263 kwhm 3 is very encouraging when compared with literature data these values are much improved compared to the ones reported for lab scale biogas sparging anmbrs of 0 69 5 68 kwhm 3 with average value of 0 8 kwhm 3 25 it is still much lower compared to the energy consumption for pilot scale anmbrs equipped with flat sheet membrane of 1 28 1 35 kwhm 3 and is slightly above the energy consumption for pilot scale anmbrs equipped with hollow fibre membrane of 0 21 0 13 kwhm 3 19 when the energy balance of pome treatment using anmbr was evaluated the energy consumption associated with membrane fouling control using gas bubbling contributed to 3 of the total electrical energy generated from the biogas the electrical energy of the biogas was estimated using the basis of methane yield of 500 l ch4kg 1 of volatile solid vs in which the typical vs content of pome is 6 wt 52 by taking the combustion energy of methane of 50 mjkg 1 and conversion efficiency of generator to produce electricity from methane combustion of 33 53 the net electricity yield of anmbr treating pome is 98 kwhm 3 the high vs content corresponding to the cod of 97 1 gkg 1 inflates the total energy generation of pome treatment in comparison with the reference pilot scale anmbrs that treat feed with cod in a range of 0 4 1 5 gkg 1 19 the low energy input of the anmbr compensate the energy required for further tretment unit for final step treatment of the effluent using appropriate processes such as the integrated fixed film activated sludge process 54 4 conclusion the effectiveness of bubbling for membrane fouling control in ad sludge treating pome has been demonstrated the tilted panel with bubbling offers up to three times higher permeability than the vertical non bubbling system and more than twice of the vertical bubbled system the presence of appropriate fouling control manages to prolong the effective membrane filtration and enhance its performance the system throughput can be enhanced by the panel switching mechanism to ensure that both sides of the membrane panel are intermittently bubbled thus a trade off between switching energy and panel productivity was prudently considered which resulted in the optimum energy consumption of 0 247 kwhm 3 much lower than the ones reported in reference energy audit reveals that the energy associated with membrane fouling control using the proposed system is merely 0 3 of the total electricity generated from the produced biogas a very attractive value for full scale implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

14017,application of anaerobic membrane bioreactor is strictly limited by the membrane fouling because of the fouling prone nature of the feed this study evaluates a method to enhance the effectiveness of a bubbling system for fouling control in filtration of anaerobic digestion sludge treating palm oil mill effluent using a tilted panel system such system is expected to enhance the

energy consumption for applying such system was also estimated results show that the tilted panel with bubbling remarkably enhance permeability by more than double of the vertical system to reach a maximum value of 87 lm 2h 1bar 1 the highest value reported so far the panel switching mechanism helps to enhance the system throughput by allowing two sided membrane panel with intermittently bubbling in the expense of mechanical switching energy the estimation of energy consumption of the system has been estimated at 0 247 kwhm 3 corresponding to 0 3 of total electricity generated from

sparging strategy the result reveals that the critical constant sparging rate is at 6 lmin 1 at a flux of 26 lm 2h 1 and a 150 of membrane fouling rate is reduced with alter 3 5 3 lmin 1 for 30 s alternating with 5 lmin 1 for 30 s strategy compared to a constant rate of 4 lmin 1 on top of gas sparging at gas demand of 0 15 1 22 nm3m 2h 1 most pilot scale gas sparging also applied sludge recirculation at crossflow velocity of 9 7 94 mh 1 in the membrane tank to provide additional turbulence on membrane surface and better mixing which account for as low as 0 03 of the energy associated for membrane fouling control 19 rigorous analysis of the energy consumption on the pilot scale performance data showed that the energy demand associated with gas sparging was at a range of 1 28 1 35 kwhm 3 for the flat sheet membrane 24 which is a way higher than the hollow fibre membrane of 0 21 0 13 kwhm 3 the high energy demand for the flat sheet membrane was attributed to the high gas sparging intensity coupled with a low flux of about 7 lm 2h 1 the pilot scale based energy consumption estimation data are much improved than the one obtained from the lab scale biogas sparging values of 0 69 5 68 kwhm 3 25 calculation of the energy balance of anmbr reveal that from the pilot scale performance data the membrane fouling control contributed to 78 1 1 6 of the total electrical energy generated by the produced biogas 19 suggesting an ominous prospect of full implementation of anmbr the attempt to further lower the energy associated for membrane fouling control is thus imperative the key factor that inflates the energy consumption of biogas sparging in anmbr is a low achievable flux due to high membrane fouling propensity of the sludge a recently developed tilted panel filtration system has been proven to be effective and energy efficient for membrane fouling control in microalgae and can reach maximum flux for treating activated sludge 26 28 nawi et al 29 also employed a tilted panel system to maximize the impact of air bubbling to mitigate fouling for microalgae harvesting besides osman et al 30 applied a patterned membrane in an aerated tilted panel for an energy efficient filtration system for activated sludge treatment it is thus hypothesized that such system can improve the filterability of anmbr sludge treating pome which can then support the widespread implementation of anmbr process in this context the aeration used in the tilted system can be replaced with biogas bubbling recirculated in an enclosed system within the bioreactor this study investigates the impact of bubbling in limiting membrane fouling for filtration of anmbr sludge treating pome using tilted panel filtration system the effect of operational parameters including tilting angle bubbling rate and switching period on membrane fouling control are evaluated and optimized later the energy consumption of the most optimum parameters is also estimated to gauge the feasibility of this system 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic digestion sludge properties the pome sample was collected from the ad unit treating pome bubbling tank of a nearest full scale anaerobic wastewater treatment plant tian siang oil mill malaysia the ad sludge had the following properties cod of 3 5 gl 1 mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of 33 g l and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of 28 g l the characterization of the feed sample was performed and it was found that the feed has low 3 6 gl 1 of cod 0 19 gl 1 of total nitrogen and 0 21 gl 1 of total phosphorus the quality of the ad effluent was still too poor for direct discharge and was then sent to the ponding system the feed was refreshed daily to avoid biomass physiological stress and to maintain its condition for prolonged usage the full anmbr mode was not tested because the study was aimed to access the system filterability in treating ad pome sludge detailed analysis on the permeate quality was not performed since the membrane was applied here for biomass separation and was not expected to retain the organics 2 2 membrane fabrication and characteristics polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf sigma aldrich and dimethylacetamide dmac sigma aldrich were used as polymer and solvent respectively to fabricate the flat sheet membrane a dope solution of 15 wt of pvdf in dmac was stirred and degasses to form a homogeneously bubble free dope solution it was then cast using a casting knife at a wet casting thickness of 0 22 mm atop of a non woven support novatexx 2471 freudenberg filter germany to provide mechanical support to the membrane film 31 the cast film immediately immersed in a water bath containing deionized water and was kept wet until usage the characteristics of the fabricated membrane were as follow thickness of 0 18 mm contact angle of 75 mean flow pore size of 0 16 μm and clean water permeability of 906 10 lm 2h 1bar 1 2 3 filtration set up membrane sheets were assembled into two types of filtration panel one sided surface with an effective area of 0 012 m2 of 1 side x 0 10 0 12 m and two sided surface of 2 sides x 0 10 0 12 m the membrane filterability performance was evaluated using a submerged system under a constant trans membrane pressure δp of 0 1 bar fig 1 due to technical limitations the biogas bubbling via gas recirculation applied in the actual system was replaced by aeration in this study under the testing conditions low temperature and pressure no significant difference in gas properties is expected 2 4 filtration test for all tests the filtration cycle consists of 10 min of filtration followed by 0 5 min of relaxation the permeate was collected and its volume was measured during the relaxation period subsequently it was returned to the tank to maintain the feed condition and level the effect of the tilting angle was first tested by tilting the membrane panel at 0 vertical 5 10 15 and 20 and the bubbling was set constant at 1 5 lmin 1 the effect of the bubbling rate was evaluated by fixing the bubbling rate at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 lmin 1 with a constant inclination of the panel at 20 the effect of switching period was studied under the on off cycles of 1 1 2 2 2 5 2 5 5 5 and 10 10 min min with a constant bubbling rate of 1 5 lmin 1and tilting angle of 20 the three parameters tilting angle bubbling rate and intermittent bubbling were done using one sided panel the effect of panel switching on the filtration performance was performed to assess the feasibility of operating the system under switching mode and enhance the throughput as suggested elsewhere 28 it is noted that when a panel is tilted only one side is fully exposed to bubbling thus the effect of the switching period was assessed to represent the impact of tilting two sided membranes mounted in a panel the switching periods were run at 0 1 2 2 5 5 and 10 min corresponds to the frequency of 60 30 24 12 and 6 switches per hour respectively using a constant bubbling rate of 1 5 lmin 1and a tilting angle of 20 the filtration flux and permeability of the membrane was determined using eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 j v a t 2 l j δ p where j represents the water flux lm 2h 1 v volume of permeate l a the effective membrane area m2 t the effective filtration time h l the permeability lm 2h 1bar 1 and δ p the trans membrane pressure bar physical cleaning was performed after every filtration test by scrubbing the foulant using sponge and flushing with tap water in addition chemical cleaning was performed after each test by soaking the membrane into a 1 sodium hypochlorite cloroc solution in di water at 60 c for at least 2 h to ensure the recovery of at least 95 of the pristine permeability value 2 5 estimation of energy consumption the performance of the tilted panel was estimated using a basis of a fullscale mbr detailed elsewhere 32 the energy analysis assumed a similar energy consumption and treatment capacity of the equivalent unit to yield a sensible comparison as also adopted by others 33 however changes in the item tilting and bubbling energy and values of each factor were considered to accommodate the operation of the tilted panel besides the method applied by eliseus et al 27 was also used for estimation of energy consumption of the switching panel system w s and gas bubbling a r r the energy model is simplified in eq 3 and 4 3 w s f s s s p η 4 a r r 0 23 s a d m s s a d m r l r l s where fs is the resultant force experienced by the submerged panel s is panel switching displacement sp is switching period sadm s is sadm of simulated data sadm r is sadm of reference data lr is permeability of reference data and ls is permeability of simulated data the switching energy efficiency was assumed at η 60 based on the general guidelines for common mechanical and electrical installation 34 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tilting angle fig 2 shows the positive impact of panel tilting to enhance permeability in which the impact is more prominent at higher angles the tests were run up to 20 due to practical limitation of the set up and the impact should react optimum value at an angle of θ 45 with maximum flux before it decreases as the angle further increased as reported by cheng et al 36 and offer maximum impact forces with minimum energy consumption as suggested by eliseus et al 27 the sudden drop of permeability after the initial reading just before reaching a quasi steady state value fig 2a indicates that the membranes suffer from fouling and significant loss of permeability of 90 occurs due to the fouling in the initial stage of the filtration which reduces their permeability it proves that the presence of bubbling as fouling control mechanism could not prevent but only reduce the extent of the membrane fouling however tilting the panel significantly enhances its permeability and limits the fouling effect increasing tilting angle up to 20 gives the highest steady state permeability of 86 7 2 89 lm 2h 1bar 1 corresponds to an increase of 129 of the one aligned vertically of 35 0 lm 2h 1bar 1 the results demonstrate a similar trend with a study reported by cheng 36 whereas module inclination effectively improves the filterability performance of ultrafiltration at slug flow regime due to enhanced disturbance of concentration polarization layer on the membrane surface theoretically the bubbles supplied possess similar a value of buoyance force fb for all tests in fig 2 since the bubbling rate was fixed at 1 5 l min 1 however in the case of the tilting panel the upwards trajectory of the bubbles is obstructed by the panel as illustrated in fig 3 which initiates the exertion of impact force fi and drag force fd with fi fb sin θ as reported elsewhere 26 when the panel is tilted to higher angles the contact between bubbles and the panel is more intense represented by higher impact force which maximizes the impact of bubbles shear rate to scour off the deposited foulant in contrast the bubbles in the vertical panel tend to move centrally in the space between the adjacent panels hence reduces the scouring impact and lowers the permeability however without bubbling tilting alone does not give any impact on permeability since it does not offer any scouring forces from the bubbles eliseus et al 26 also confirmed that increasing the drag force would improve the ability of bubbles to remove deposited foulant on the membrane surface in microalgae broth filtration they managed to improve permeability by 20 by tilting the panel to 20 besides cheng and lin 38 reported an optimum tilting angle of 180 horizontal placement in another study by cheng 36 inclination at an angle of 50 was considered as optimum for a tubular membrane based on these studies it can be postulated that the optimum angle varies depending on several factors including feed type membrane type and filtration system a more holistic theory explaining the impact of panel tilting is thus required fig 2b shows that the increment of the tilting angle 0 to 20 gradually improves the permeability from 35 to 86 7 lm 2h 1bar 1 the typical permeability of 60 lm 2h 1bar 1 reported that permeability for filtration of anaerobic sludge is relatively low due to the high membrane fouling propensity of the feed 39 the attempt to enhance permeability even by a sophisticated vibration device could only led to permeability of 60 lm 2h 1bar 1 40 in a study conducted by ahmad et al 41 the highest permeability achieved in pome treatment of a membrane pilot plant was 35 lm 2h 1bar 1 while sulaiman and chea 42 recorded 63 3 lm 2h 1bar 1 by comparing these results it is clear that the tilted panel system has great potential to achieve a significantly higher permeability than conventional filtration setup it is also expected that higher permeability could be achieved by increasing the panel tilting angle up to 45 however due to setup limitation 20 is the maximum tilting angle we could attain despite high permeability a larger footprint consumed by the system with a higher panel tilting angle should be considered 3 2 effect of bubbling rate the permeability increases gradually with an increase of bubbling rate as demonstrated in fig 4 this is expected since higher bubbling rates provide more intense contact of the bubbles with the membrane surface thus enhances the effectiveness of scouring 43 in this study the highest permeability was 86 7 lm 2h 1bar 1 obtained when 1 5 lmin 1 of bubbling rate was provided which is 3 times higher than without bubbling in addition even at a relatively low bubbling rate 0 3 l min 1 the permeability increases by 50 compared to non bubbled system 30 0 lm 2h 1bar 1 this finding proves that bubbling is one of the effective fouling control mechanisms for a submerged filtration system the findings also suggest that more bubbles with larger sizes were released at a higher bubbling rate thus remarkably delay the fouling effect and lengthen the effective membrane filtration this can be confirmed by a cfd simulation developed by ndinisa et al 44 where a higher degree of bubbles meandering is noticed at higher bubbling rates it has been reported that as soon as the air bubble leaves the diffuser it moves towards the edges of the column as it rises with two main streams that flow upwards these two main plumes of gas move up in meandering manner where the degree of a meandering is much higher at higher gas flow rate 44 besides kuwagi et al 45 also found that the gas bubbles start to move in a zigzag manner only when the gas flow is increased else they move upwards in a straight line manner in a stagnant liquid consequently the higher degree of bubble meandering enhances the average shear stress onto the membrane 44 theoretically larger bubbles have higher buoyancy force and contribute to a greater impact force of bubbles onto the membrane surface 26 suggesting better foulant removal nonetheless the trend of the permeability increment suggests that the impact will reach an optimum where the scouring impact reaches a peak as also reported by others 28 46 47 3 3 bubbling efficiency for fouling mitigation tilting angle and bubbling rate have a synergistic effect in enhancing permeability the drag fd and impact forces fi of the bubbles exerted was estimated fig 5 by assuming fd fb cos θ and fi fb sin θ respectively the finding verifies that the tilting angle and bubbling rates remarkably affect the total forces exerted by the bubbles the bubbles exerted minimal drag force from bubbles bouncing to the membrane surface without any impact force for the vertical alignment this also means that cleaning in a vertical panel relies solely on the tangential shear rates produced from the drag force and secondary flow of liquid induced by the upward movement of the bubbles ignoring the potential for bubbles to bounce multiple times only first contact of bubbles to the membrane surface considered it follows that most of the cleaning mechanism is affected by the drag force the impact of tilting angles and bubbling rates can be further explained by the difference in the number of effective bubbles coming into contact with the membrane surface in which cleaning is more efficient at a higher number of effective bubbles to estimate the number of effective bubbles an assumption was made that 80 of the bubbles were in direct contact at θ 20 and the rests do not come into contact due to parallel flow bouncing off etc based on the differences in the permeability and assuming equal sized bubbles of d 3 mm the effective number of bubbles were estimated to be 5500 8250 11000 16 500 and 22 000 bubbles per minute at a bubbling rate of 1 5 lmin 1 at different tilting angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 corresponds to 20 30 40 60 and 80 of effective bubbles respectively the estimation was based on a report by eliseus et al 28 and a study by ndinisa et al 44 in which the number size and volume of the bubbles increase with an increase in bubble flow rate they suggested that increasing the tilting angle improves the percentage of effective bubbles however it should be noted that this is only a rough estimation since accurate calculation is difficult due to various factors i e bubbles travelling path velocity of bubbles bubble size dynamics and liquid phase dynamics wang et al 48 also stated that on top of the number of bubbles several factors such as size and velocity of bubbles could affect fouling mitigation 3 4 effect of intermittent aeration and panel switching a high bubbling rate leads to higher compressor energy and can undermine the feasibility of bubbling for membrane fouling control therefore intermittent bubbling was tested in this study for the one sided panel fig 6 moreover despite showing significant permeability improvements section 3 1 3 3 the tilted panel faces a new challenge in which the bubbling limited to only one side of panel which limits the membrane productivity to a half therefore switching mechanism to intermittently bubble both sides of the panel was introduced the switch functions in bubbling the membrane panel on the first side for a specific duration before turns to another side alternatingly in this case a trade off between panel productivity and switching energy as well as physical and mechanical constrains must be considered in order to attain optimal filtration conditions for the one sided panel intermittent aeration of 10 min represents an alternating condition of bubbling on and bubbling off each for 10 min period for the two sided membrane panel it means that each side was bubbled for 10 min alternatingly tests with switching intermittent periods beyond 10 min were deemed unnecessary because it has been proven that foulant on the membrane surface could not be adequately removed under prolonged idle time eliseus et al also showed that for activated sludge 28 and microalgae 26 filtration the side without bubbling is more exposed to irreversible fouling at longer switching period generally for all tested periods of intermittent bubbling or switching permeability shows an almost similar trend as a function of time which show a drastic drop and reaches almost constant permeability after 20 min of filtration until the end interestingly the permeability fluctuates for the one sided panel fig 6 since this only can be observed on one sided panel it proves that bubbling helps to scour off the deposited foulant when under bubbling and foulant accumulates on the membrane surface during the bubbling idle mode fig 7 illustrates the mechanism of the panel switching including foulant removal on the aerated side and foulant deposition on the idle side for both one and two sided panels the intermittent bubbling period of 10 min provides ample time for foulant accumulation on the idle side and foulant elimination on the bubbled side to remarkably affect the profile of permeability as shown by permeability fluctuation in fig 6 the permeability increases under bubbling and slightly drops in the absent of bubbling suggesting that the membrane is easily fouled in the absence of bubbling for the two sided panel there is no obvious permeability fluctuation since the permeability is the average of both the bubbled and the idle sides fig 8 a shows the steady state permeability as a function of intermittent bubbling period for the one sided panel and switching period for the two sided panel the permeability decreases at a longer period and it is more obvious for the one sided panel intermittent bubbling for the one sided panel intermittent bubbling periods of less than 2 min demonstrate almost similar result to the one with continuous bubbling switching period of 0 min beyond 2 5 min of intermittent bubbling periods increasing the periods show a slight decrease of steady state permeability these results indicate that the cleaning is more effective at shorter intermittent bubbling periods due to less time provided for the foulant to accumulate on the membrane surface when it is not under bubbling in contrast the effect of the switching period is less prominent on two sided panels as illustrated in fig 7 for the two sided panel while bubbling one side of the membrane the foulant keeps accumulating on the idle side since all effective membrane areas both sides need to be considered in calculating permeability the larger area of two sided panel is a disadvantage in terms of permeability despite of lower permeability the two sided membrane panel shows better panel productivity compared to the one sided panel as shown in fig 8 b the dashed line indicates the productivity of the one sided panel placed in vertical alignment with the bubbling of 1 5 l min 1 as the benchmark the productivity differences between the one and the two sided membrane panels are more obvious for switching intermittent bubbling periods of 2 5 min 45 8 43 6 and 42 1 for 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 min period respectively 3 5 energy consumption by using the energy model simulated by eliseus et al 27 the estimated total energy used for the filtration system is summarized in fig 9 we assumed that the system to operate at the same treatment capacity with referenced mbr with similar energy consumption of 0 16 kwhm 3 including influent and permeate pumping cleaning in place and air compression 32 37 according to fenu et al 32 a full scale mbr system has total energy consumption of 0 64 kwhm 3 in this study the energy estimation was performed for a tilted system involving switching at a constant specific bubbling demand of 0 12 m3m 2h 1 at switching frequencies of 6 12 24 30 and 60 h 1 it shows that high switching frequencies increase the overall energy mainly for switching on the other hand the bubbling energy decreases because of high permeability associated with high switching frequency the low bubbling energy originated from a lower membrane area required for producing a specific amount of permeate higher switching frequencies require more mechanical energy for switching and thus must be optimized reducing switching frequency will reduce the total energy consumption but operating switching frequency at lower than 6 h 1 might cause concentration polarization and formation of the fouling layer during the idle time 49 in this system the lowest energy was achieved at a switching frequency of 6 h 1 corresponding to the energy consumption of 0 247 kwhm 3 the estimated total energy consumption for switching frequency of 60 h 1 switching period of 1 min is 0 263 kwhm 3 which is 9 6 higher than the frequency of 6 h 1 the increment of total energy for higher switching frequency is a result of a slight decrease of bubbling energy but overwhelmed by the more prominence increment of switching energy the energy estimation results confirm the potential of the tilted panel system for fouling control in anaerobic sludge filtration this filtration is suitable to be applied as energy efficient method in anmbr in which the air can be replaced by biogas recirculation as often reported 19 50 51 the results of the energy consumption associated with membrane fouling control shown in fig 9 of of 0 247 0 263 kwhm 3 is very encouraging when compared with literature data these values are much improved compared to the ones reported for lab scale biogas sparging anmbrs of 0 69 5 68 kwhm 3 with average value of 0 8 kwhm 3 25 it is still much lower compared to the energy consumption for pilot scale anmbrs equipped with flat sheet membrane of 1 28 1 35 kwhm 3 and is slightly above the energy consumption for pilot scale anmbrs equipped with hollow fibre membrane of 0 21 0 13 kwhm 3 19 when the energy balance of pome treatment using anmbr was evaluated the energy consumption associated with membrane fouling control using gas bubbling contributed to 3 of the total electrical energy generated from the biogas the electrical energy of the biogas was estimated using the basis of methane yield of 500 l ch4kg 1 of volatile solid vs in which the typical vs content of pome is 6 wt 52 by taking the combustion energy of methane of 50 mjkg 1 and conversion efficiency of generator to produce electricity from methane combustion of 33 53 the net electricity yield of anmbr treating pome is 98 kwhm 3 the high vs content corresponding to the cod of 97 1 gkg 1 inflates the total energy generation of pome treatment in comparison with the reference pilot scale anmbrs that treat feed with cod in a range of 0 4 1 5 gkg 1 19 the low energy input of the anmbr compensate the energy required for further tretment unit for final step treatment of the effluent using appropriate processes such as the integrated fixed film activated sludge process 54 4 conclusion the effectiveness of bubbling for membrane fouling control in ad sludge treating pome has been demonstrated the tilted panel with bubbling offers up to three times higher permeability than the vertical non bubbling system and more than twice of the vertical bubbled system the presence of appropriate fouling control manages to prolong the effective membrane filtration and enhance its performance the system throughput can be enhanced by the panel switching mechanism to ensure that both sides of the membrane panel are intermittently bubbled thus a trade off between switching energy and panel productivity was prudently considered which resulted in the optimum energy consumption of 0 247 kwhm 3 much lower than the ones reported in reference energy audit reveals that the energy associated with membrane fouling control using the proposed system is merely 0 3 of the total electricity generated from the produced biogas a very attractive value for full scale implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

14018,in this work steel slag was shown to be a successful filter material for the removal of lead and cadmium from natural waters with a removal efficiency of 95 even under acidic conditions ph 3 5 overall precipitation was found to be the main removal mechanism over adsorption with a tight relationship with the final matrix ph batch experiments showed fast removal kinetics with 98 removal efficiency for lead and cadmium in 5 and 15 min respectively the removal kinetics followed a pseudo second order reaction r2 0 999 and the k2 was calculated to be 927 h 1 and 204 h 1 for lead and cadmium respectively a strong interference for the removal was observed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta but slightly with fulvic and humic acids and non significant with polymeric acid e g isosaccharinic acid in addition the column experiment showed spontaneous removal kinetics for lead and cadmium with a contact time of 3 6 36 seconds depending on loading flow rates column experiments at similar liquid to solid ratios showed a high removal capacity with gradient over isocratic solution loading the high removal efficiencies in combination with limited hazardous metals leaching led to the conclusion that slag is an appropriate filter material for treating contaminated waters moreover the slag treated solutions with alkaline conditions showed reacted efficiently with co2 in flue gas consequently the ph of the treated solution is neutralized making it easier to waste and this reaction may contribute to reducing co2 gas emissions keywords lead cadmium removal steel slag contaminated waters precipitation adsorption 1 introduction cadmium and lead contamination are considered serious threats to the environment and human health due to their high toxicity and persistent characteristics 1 they enter the food chain mainly through crop irrigation and soil contamination 2 according to the world health organization who inorganic lead and cadmium compounds have been placed in group 2a and are described as probable human carcinogens with a recommended maximum concentration of 10 μg l 1 and 3 μg l 1 in drinking water respectively 3 exceedingly high lead and cadmium exposure can cause bone degeneration liver damage lung insufficiency hypertension and renal dysfunction in humans human exposure is mainly through consuming contaminated food and drinking water 4 5 industrial activities such as mining electroplating pigment manufacturing metallurgy and agricultural activities increase the flux of heavy metals to local water bodies more attention has been paid to reduce the concentrations of the dissolved metals in sewage industrial and mining wastes 6 7 several removal approaches have been proposed among those adsorption and precipitation are considered to be the most suitable methods 8 11 costs for treating contaminated water by synthesized materials are typically high thus limiting their application on larger scales therefore a robust cheap and efficient method for removing the toxic metals is essential to mitigate the risk for society currently global crude steel production is around 1808 million tons per year 2018 estimate 12 steel slag a byproduct of steel manufacturing makes up approximately 15 by mass of the steel output giving approx 270 million tons produced per year 13 14 currently use of the slag is limited the majority is disposed of in landfills which occupy massive land areas and potentially pollute the environment 15 steel slag is mainly composed of the oxides of calcium silicon aluminum and iron giving it very strong alkaline properties as well as a high adsorption and precipitation capacity it has been reported that steel making slag can be used as adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals and various contaminants 16 19 few studies have reported the use of steel slag as adsorbent for treating lead and cadmium contamination 20 22 however steel slag is a complex system of oxides and typically has low specific surface area and poor pore structure caused by crystallization limiting its adsorption efficiency 21 a modified steel slag showed a sorption capacity for cadmium of 10 mg g 1 25 c 21 whereas other materials like iron oxide activated red mud was only 0 12 mg g 1 23 the reported sorption capacities of lead by iron oxide nanoparticles and iron coated filters were 36 mg g 1 24 and 1 2 mg g 1 25 respectively a study on the removal of copper in contaminated water by steel slag indicated that the removal is a result of both adsorption and precipitation 26 adsorbents were shown to be effective for treating wastewater containing a low heavy metal concentration while precipitation with lime cao has been found as one of the most effective method for treating extremely contaminated solutions 1000 mg l 1 27 in this study the in situ removal of lead and cadmium by slag filled filtration columns was examined in order to assess the efficiency of using slag as a filter material for contaminated water treatment the stainless steel slag in our study was obtained from scrap metal recycling which is considered environmentally friendly because it requires limited mining activities heavy metal removal efficiency by slag was tested under various conditions including ph competition of ligands and liquid to solid ratios and by the slag column with different solution loading flow rates isotherm and kinetics for the heavy metal removal were investigated with these tests and the contribution of adsorption and precipitation to the removal were examined a natural water sample spiked with lead and cadmium was used to test the application of the slag material in heavy metals filtration ultimately it was found that steel slag is a successful filter material for the removal of lead and cadmium from natural water with a removal efficiency of 95 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cadmium and lead stock solutions were prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 4h2o and pb no3 2 98 sigma aldrich in

slag was equilibrated with 10 ml solutions containing 10 mg l 1 of lead or cadmium with various initial ph phini feeding solution giving a liquid to solid l s ratio of 100 to avoid settling samples

prior to analysis final ph phfin after contacting with the slag of the solutions were also measured a slag extract solution was made in the same way as described above but without the addition of lead or cadmium to test for metal precipitation independent of the solid slag thereby excluding adsorption processes to focus on precipitation reactions this test was conducted by mixing the metals 25 μl

experiment this was done by agitating a test sample set of 0 1 0 005 g of the slag with 10 ml of 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium solution phini 3 5 for as little as 1 min and up to 8 h the sample reaction was halted at each time point by centrifugation 8228 g 3 min and filtration measured concentrations of lead and cadmium over time were fit to pseudo first order kinetics of adsorption eq 3 pseudo

as filled column with no compression pressure a mix solution of lead and cadmium 10 mg l 1 each phini 3 5 was used for the filled column experiment the solution loading flowrates were varied from 0 7 to 7 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump fluid metering inc usa 20 fractions 10 ml each were collected for chemicals and ph measurements the gradient flow rate began high at 10 ml min 1 and was then reduced according to real time phfin values monitored by a ph electrode targeted at 10 0 the slag treated contaminated water was alkaline post incubation with a ph 10 section 2 2 1 1 which does not fulfill the requirements ph 6 10 given by the swedish water and wastewater association 30 neutralization of the treated water was thus investigated by air and flue gas practically 1000 ml of the post column solution ph 10 6 was purged with air or flue gas at a flow rate of 300 ml min 1 using a gas pump with a built in a co2 meter cm 0054 co2 meter usa the percentage of co2 gas and ph of the solution were continuously monitored during the purging a proxy for flue gas was produced by burning a candle and collected through a glass funnel the measured percentage of co2 in air and in flue gas were 0 04 and 8 respectively 2 2 2 2 desorption the lead and cadmium absorbed onto 1 0 g of the slag in the filled column was washed by 10 ml of hcl acid solution with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 strength of the acid solution was varied from 0 1 to 2 a mass balance of lead and cadmium was determined by comparing the metal content in the loaded solution and the washed solution to determine the desorption capacity of the column 2 2 2 3 treatment for natural water samples the stream water sample was collected at lindesberg örebro sweden 59 26 21 4 n 15 19 05 1 e concentration of dissolved organic matter doc was measured to be 80 mg l 1 and major elements si ca na mg k and fe were 7 4 5 8 3 9 2 4 1 7 and 1 0 mg l 1 respectively original ph of the sample was 5 2 and adjusted to 3 5 by hcl acid to avoid the initial precipitation of spiked lead and cadmium 10 mg l 1 each the sample was equilibrated for 24 h allowing the spiked lead and cadmium to react with the sample matrix after that 100 ml of the sample was loaded through the slag filled column filled with 1 0 g of the slag with a gradient flow rate targeting a phfin of 10 0 and 10 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of the slag the slag has a bet specific surface area of 4 24 m2 g 1 micropore area 0 3448 m² g volume of pores between 1 7 nm and 300 nm diameter of 0 023289 cm³ g and a total void volume of 0 42 cm3 g 1 in the filled column without pressing the elemental composition of the slag is summarized in table 1 with calcium as the major component accounting for about 33 of the composition by weight followed by mg al and si about 4 each by recalculating calcium as its simplest oxide cao its weight contribution is about 46 the xrd spectra of the slag is shown in fig 1 and according to the processing software match 31 the main components for the slag are calcio olivine ca2sio4 32 and bredigite ba0 293ca13 467 mg1 81mn0 43o32si8 33 both mineral structures contain high abundance of cao and sio2 size and elemental composition of the slag was determined by sem and eds fig 2 the eds result showed a high signal intensity for o ca si al mg and a detectable signal for cr na ti s and f which is in a good agreement with the total elemental analysis table 1 and xrd results oxides are known to be formed during steelmaking and make up the composition of steel slags cao is generally the dominant oxide observed in steel slags produced during different steelmaking operations 34 feo is another common oxide produced during some steelmaking processes but the low occurrence of fe oxide observed in this study is most similar to ladle slags 34 it is also commonly found that slag leachates are highly alkaline due to the presence of cao and other oxides 35 36 leading us to believe that the slag used in this study is representative of a generic slag material and that the findings of this study would reciprocate to slags sourced from other factories or regions when the slag was dispersed in either a ph 3 5 or deionized water solution l s 100 4 h equilibration a strong alkaline solution with a ph of 11 3 was produced indicating a strong alkaline buffer capacity of the slag carbonate in the slag solution was measured to be 2 2 mg l 1 and dissolved elements concentrations are shown in table 1 with the highest concentration found for ca followed by al mg and si concentrations of heavier metals were not detected indicating that the slag is not a second contamination source of hazardous metals and therefore appropriate for contaminated water treatment 3 2 batch experiment 3 2 1 effects of ph ph is an important factor that governs removal efficiency of a material in this investigation the ph of solutions containing 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium were varied from 1 0 to 10 0 prior to slag addition phini and the corresponding ph values post slag addition were recorded phfin the slag has a high composition of cao giving it a strong alkaline buffer capacity therefore phfin increased from 3 7 to 11 4 and only phini below 1 5 could maintain phfin in acidic condition ph 6 fig 3 with phfin 6 phini 1 5 the removal efficiency for both lead and cadmium was minimal 10 fig 3 however when phfin varied between 6 0 to 9 0 phini between 1 5 and 2 0 the efficiency increased to 90 and 13 for lead and cadmium respectively when phfin 10 0 phini 2 2 the efficiency was 95 for both lead and cadmium with phini above 3 0 phfin were all 11 3 therefore the most efficient metal removal occurred with a phini 2 2 the most probable removal mechanism suggested by this study for pb and cd is precipitation as described in the following section lead and cadmium can react with hydroxide oh to form dissolved or solid species with stability constants log k of the complexes shown in reactions 1 to 6 37 1 pb2 oh pb oh aq log k 6 3 2 pb2 2oh pb oh 2 aq log k 10 9 3 pb2 2oh pb oh 2 s log k 19 9 4 cd2 oh cd oh aq log k 3 9 5 cd2 2oh cd oh 2 aq log k 7 65 6 cd2 2oh cd oh 2 s log k 14 4 as shown in fig 4 a dissolved species of lead dominate at ph below 6 4 mainly as dissolved pb2 aq while at higher ph levels pb oh 2 s the solid form is the main species a similar phenomenon was also observed for cadmium but with a higher breakthrough ph of 9 0 fig 4b the difference in the breakthrough ph between lead and cadmium is due to the difference in their solid form stability constants namely pb oh 2 s log k 19 9 and cd oh 2 s log k 14 4 higher for the former with phfin below 6 0 for lead and 8 8 for cadmium the sum of the dissolved species for each metal is higher than 99 9 fig 4 under these low ph conditions the removal of lead and cadmium by the slag if occurred would be a result of pb2 aq and cd2 aq adsorption but not precipitation the removal efficiencies were however insufficient 10 at the low phfin conditions indicating a weak adsorption of dissolved pb2 aq and cd2 aq species to the slag with a similar observation kim et al showed a low adsorption efficiency of 6 2 17 4 for copper by steel slags at phfin of 3 1 3 4 26 these results suggest that pb2 and cd2 are most efficiently removed from solution via precipitation reactions at higher reaction phs with phfin above 7 0 for lead and 10 for cadmium the concentration of the solid species calculated by thermodynamic model contribute 98 of the metals fig 4 at those phfin values the removal efficiency for both lead and cadmium was close to 100 indicating that the removal was mainly a result of the metal precipitation as pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s there is thus an excellent match in modeled concentration of lead and cadmium solid species fig 4 and their removal efficiencies fig 3 regression test p 0 001 in addition the removal efficiencies strongly related to phfin of the solutions with the correlation efficiency for lead and cadmium equal to an r2 of 0 96 and 0 89 p 0 001 respectively lead and cadmium can also precipitate with carbonate pb2 co3 2 pbco3 s log k 13 13 cd2 co3 2 cdco3 s log k 12 1 37 however the concentration of co3 2 was measured to be 2 2 mg l 1 which is much lower than the concentration of lead and cadmium added 10 mg l 1each and stability constants of the carbonate complexes are also lower than the hydroxide complexes in addition there was no loss of dissolved carbonate in the extracted solution phini 3 5 4 h equilibration with addition of 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium and the visial minteq also predicted an under saturation to form lead and cadmium solid species with carbonate therefore carbonate species are likely not contributing to the final metal speciation to further examine the precipitation and with excluding the possibility for adsorption 25 μl of 40 g l 1 lead or cadmium solution was added to 10 ml of one aqueous solution ph of 11 3 adjusted by ca oh 2 solution and another the slag extracted solutions giving 100 mg l 1 final concentration of lead and cadmium after equilibrating centrifugation and filtration a white pellet was observed for the test samples and the concentration of dissolved lead and cadmium was measured to be below 0 8 and 1 2 mg l 1 respectively for both aqueous and slag extract solutions furthermore there was no difference in calcium concentration in the slag extract solutions before and after the addition of lead and cadmium the result thus indicated that precipitation of lead and cadmium was through their oxide forms not a co precipitation with calcium or the carbonate complexes isotherm for the removal of lead and cadmium were examined with langmuir and freundlich equations by step wise varying the initial concentrations from 10 to 300 mg l 1 the simple assumption for a langmuir adsorption model is that the adsorbent surface is homogenous and the binding sites are all equivalent whereas the freundlich adsorption model is more appropriate for rough surfaces with multiple binding sites the results showed a poor fit to the langmuir and freundlich equations for both lead r2 0 003 and 0 28 respectively and cadmium r2 0 21 and 0 45 respectively further indicating that direct adsorption is not the key removal mechanism for the metals with the slag the solid form pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s can aggregate to form larger particles and these particulates can either heterogeneously adsorb onto the slag or dispense in the solution the langmuir and freundlich equations are appropriate to explain for homogenous adsorption but likely not for the heterogeneous adsorption of precipitates observed in this study explaining the poor fits 3 2 2 effects of ligands on the removal the divalent cation forms of lead pb2 and cadmium cd2 can form strong complexes with many ligands besides hydroxide all of which compete with the formation of solid hydroxide species natural water contains doc and other ligands that could interfere with the metal removal in the slag reactor to test their impact pb2 and cd2 were pre equilibrated with organic ligands with known binding strengths to pb2 and cd2 to represent more natural water column speciation condition prior to reacting with the slag binding strength of pb2 and cd2 to different ligands are illustrated below specifically for carboxylic thiol and edta reactions 7 12 37 the cations showed a weak binding strength with carboxylic groups but relatively strong for thiol and edta 7 pb2 2ch3coo pb ch3coo 2 log k 4 08 8 cd2 2ch3coo cd ch3coo 2 log k 2 86 9 pb2 2rs pb rs 2 log k 15 27 10 cd2 2rs cd rs 2 log k 16 53 11 pb2 edta pb edta log k 18 04 12 cd2 edta cd edta log k 16 46 sodium isosaccharinic isa a poly carboxylic acid represents a major carbon source within a geological disposal facility since it comprises 70 of cellulose degradation products as a result of alkaline hydrolysis 38 it s complexation with few metals and cadmium has been reported 39 41 the complexation of cd2 and isa at high ph is favored as cd2 2oh isa cd isa oh 2 aq log k 11 5 as shown in fig 3a isa did not affect the removal efficiency of the metals even up to highest concentration of 1000 mg l 1 this could be explained by a weak binding strength of isa to pb2 and cd2 as dissolved species and therefore does not compete with the more favorable formation of pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s in contrast edta largely interferes with the metal removal efficiencies fig 5 a with 10 mg l 1 of edta the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium reduced to 70 and with above 40 and 500 mg l 1 of edta the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium respectively were non sufficient 10 the effect of edta on cadmium removal was slightly higher than lead showing that with 40 mg l 1 of edta the removal efficiency for cadmium was only 7 while 32 for lead this can be explained by a higher stability constant of pb2 to hydroxide compared to cd2 and a higher molar concentration of cadmium 0 09 mm compared to lead 0 05 mm due to a lower molecular mass of cadmium m 112 g mol 1 than lead 207 g mol 1 it is noted that the phfin was slightly reduced from 11 3 edta 0 mg l 1 to 11 2 edta 20 mg l 1 due to the buffering capacity of edta this reduction is however small compared to 60 and 55 decrease in the efficiency of lead and cadmium edta 20 mg l 1 respectively implying that the interferences of edta to the removal were mainly through the competing complexation in addition there was a negative correlation between the removal efficiencies and modeled concentration of pbedta aq and cdedta aq by winsgw 42 further supporting this conclusion as shown in fig 5b fulvic and humic acids mildly interfere with the removal efficiencies with a typical concentration of fulvic and humic acids in natural water of 20 50 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium reduced from 100 only by 7 and 10 16 respectively with 100 mg l 1 of fulvic or humic acid the reduction was around 20 or 80 removal the interference of humic acid on the removal of lead and cadmium was similar while fulvic acid interfered with the removal of cadmium higher than lead fulvic and humic acids contain diverse functional groups including the thiol group which has a strong binding affinity to pb2 and cd2 reactions 9 10 fulvic and humic acids are two common components of dissolved organic matter doc with fulvic acid remaining in solution after removal of humic acid by acidification 43 the differences between them can be the carbon oxygen and or nitrogen contents as well as acidity degree of polymerization molecular weight and color 44 concentrations of thiol ligands in fulvic and humic acids however vary substantially among different doc sources a determination of reduced sulfur concentration in wetland porewater doc suggested a reduced sulfur concentration of 0 04 0 16 doc on mass basis for instance with 100 mg l 1 doc thiol concentration would be calculated of 0 04 0 16 mg l 1 or 1 25 5 μm 45 a 10 mg l 1 solution of lead and cadmium has molar concentrations of 48 and 89 μm respectively molar thiol concentrations thus equal 2 6 10 4 and 1 4 5 6 of the lead and cadmium added respectively therefore a decrease of 20 efficiency for lead and cadmium at 100 mg l 1 concentration of fulvic or humic is likely explained by a result of other functional groups associated with humic and fulvic acids such as amino phenolic hydroxyl it is worth noting that the phfin was slightly reduced from 11 3 fulvic humic acid 0 mg l 1 to 11 1 fulvic humic acid 100 mg l 1 due to its buffering capacity this could to some extent contribute to the decrease of the removal efficiencies in general the organic matter content of natural waters should be considered if steal slag is to be used for heavy metal removal 3 2 3 removal capacity it has been shown in section 3 2 1 that phfin is critical for the removal of lead and cadmium by the slag increasing l s ratios will decrease phfin due to the dilution of hydroxide therefore by examining effective l s ratios the removal capacity of the slag can be determined following the increase of l s ratios from 50 to 3000 l kg 1 phini 3 5 phfin decreased from 11 3 l s 50 to 7 8 l s 3000 fig 6 as aforementioned the removal of lead and cadmium was mainly the result of precipitation therefore increasing l s ratios result in decreased lead and cadmium precipitation with l s ratios below 1000 phfin 9 9 the removal of lead and cadmium were both close to 100 with the ratio of 2000 phfin 8 5 the efficiency of lead was still close to 100 but dramatically decreased for cadmium down to 19 when the l s ratio increased to 3000 phfin 7 8 the efficiencies for lead and cadmium were 78 and 2 respectively because the precipitation is largely controlled by the phfin conditions that maintain higher phfin conditions are optimal for metal removal but the final solution is more hazardous when phfin is more neutral the efficiency drops in both scenarios the initial metals concentrations do not impact removal the results implied that 1 0 g of the slag can treat at most 1000 ml and 2000 ml of contaminated water with phini 3 5 for cadmium and lead respectively regardless of initial metal concentration in the literature the reported phfin of steel slags ranging from 9 5 to 13 5 with cao content of 35 to 47 the phfin and cao content of the slag in this study are of 11 3 and 46 respectively which are in the high end range of the studied slags 20 46 47 3 2 4 kinetics the reaction over time visualized in fig 7 shows rapid reaction kinetics for the removal of lead and cadmium with 90 of lead and cadmium removed in 5 and 15 min respectively the kinetics of lead were somewhat faster than cadmium after 20 min the efficiencies were steady and close to 100 for both lead and cadmium kinetics of the removal strongly related to phfin with r2 of 0 86 and 0 95 p 0 001 for lead and cadmium respectively highlighting the importance of solution ph for the removal fitting measured concentrations of lead and cadmium to the theoretical kinetic equations showed a low r2 0 24 for the pseudo first order and the intra particle diffusion equations but close to 1 r2 0 999 for the pseudo second order kinetics for both lead and cadmium this indicates that lead and cadmium removal was not a single adsorption process but also involved chemical reactions in this case precipitation 48 the k2 of the pseudo second order was calculated to be 927 h 1 and 204 h 1 for lead and cadmium respectively the determined k2 in our study was much higher than the k2 k2 30 phini 3 4 reported by kim et al 26 for the removal of copper by steel slags higher k2 values indicate faster kinetics for the removal which implies that it is an appropriate approach to use steel slag to remove lead and cadmium from water with fast kinetics almost spontaneous the steel slag can be used for continuous treatment of contaminated water as filter material 3 3 column experiments 3 3 1 loading flowrates the removal of lead and cadmium by the slag filled column was examined with different solution loading flowrates from 0 7 to 7 ml min 1 for each test 20 fractions were collected with a total volume of 200 ml phfin values varied with different flow rates and reduced from the first to the twentieth fraction fig 8 a as shown in fig 8b lower flow rates are more efficient at dissolving alkaline oxides raising the phfin of the loaded solution the removal efficiency thus reduced following increase of the flow rates with the flow rates of 0 7 1 4 3 0 and 7 0 ml min 1 the treated volume capacity the efficiency 95 for lead and cadmium were 190 160 150 and 100 ml and 130 120 100 and 40 ml respectively with 1 g of the slag the highest treated volume capacity was thus achieved with the lowest flowrate of 0 7 ml min 1 even though with the highest treated volume capacity the l s ratios of 190 for lead and 130 for cadmium in the flow through system are much lower than the equilibrium values calculated from the batch experiments of 2000 and 1000 it can be seen in fig 8a black and red stars a phfin of above 9 9 is needed to precipitate 95 of lead and cadmium a low flow rate seems to be highly efficient for dissolving alkaline oxides in early fractions as shown by the average ph values of the first 3 fractions 30 ml 11 28 11 15 11 04 and 10 39 for flowrates of 0 7 1 4 3 0 and 7 0 ml min 1 respectively the phfin of the early fractions were substantially higher than 9 9 particularly for 0 7 ml min 1 and rapidly decreased for later fractions fig 8a active alkaline oxides on the surface of the material is not unlimited and therefore there is a max capacity for metal removal via precipitation when heavily dissolved in early fractions the later fractions will lack alkaline oxides for raising the phfin high enough for the precipitation of lead and cadmium gradient of loading flowrate is therefore an appropriate approach with high flowrates in the beginning then gradually reducing while maintaining the phfin always just above 10 0 by using this approach the treated capacity l s ratio of the slag was achieved to be above 500 close to the equilibrium value fig 8b it is important to know whether the precipitates pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s adsorbed to the slag s surface or presented as an amorphous solid in the solution that can pass through the filter membrane 0 2 μm a test of the unfiltered post column solution with different treatment order i acidification 1 hno3 acid then filtration and ii filtration then acidification showed a non significant difference in measured concentration of lead and cadmium this indicates that the majority of pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s adsorbed to the slag but not dispersed in the solution implying a practical use of the slag as filter material for the treatment of contaminated water 3 3 2 neutralization under optimal metal removal conditions the ph of the treated water had a range of 10 0 10 6 which is higher than the guidelines of swedish water and wastewater association 30 and must be reduced before release to the environment co2 gas can acidify water solutions or react with hydroxide to reduce ph of alkaline solution through the reaction oh co2 hco3 logk 6 typical content of co2 gas in air and flue gas is 0 04 and 7 15 respectively the results in fig 9 show that by purging with air the ph gradually decreased from initial ph of 10 6 to 8 0 in 340 min then stable at ph around 8 0 with further purging on the other hand ph of the solution decreased dramatically from 10 6 to 6 7 within 5 min when purged by flue gas 8 0 co2 gas after that ph gradually decreased from 6 7 to 6 1 ph units from 5 to 15 min and then stabilized at ph around 6 0 with further purging the difference between air and flue gas is likely the higher content of co2 in flue gas 200 times than in air giving a faster and stronger neutralization capacity for flue gas even so the results indicated that the ph of the treated water can be reduced by either air or flue gas depending on the availably and accessibility of flue gas from an environmental perspective this approach could also be a sink for co2 and contribute to the reduction of co2 gas levels in air or released from industries it is noted that dissolved calcium concentrations in the solution before and after purging with either air or flue gas remained unchanged indicating a non precipitation of caco3 s dissolved calcium concentration of 60 mg l 1 was likely under saturation to form precipitate with carbonate originated from co2 3 3 3 desorption the slag after using must be treated to recover the absorbed hazardous metals the removal was mainly a result of precipitation at a high ph therefore using a low ph solution is a reasonable approach for desorption of the adsorbed metals strength of washing solution was investigated from 0 1 to 2 hcl acid as shown in fig 10 the washing efficiency increased following acidic strength of the washing solution with 10 ml of 0 1 of hcl acid the washing efficiency was below 24 and 32 for lead and cadmium respectively but with 2 of hcl acid the washing efficiency was higher than 95 for both lead and cadmium the washed solution contains very high concentration of the metals that can be used for recycling of the metals or treated as hazardous waste the slag after removal of the adsorbed metals can be used in construction as base material or for other applications 49 3 4 treatment for contaminated natural water the results showed that with aimed phfin of 10 0 the removal efficiencies of metals spiked into natural waters were 80 and 70 for lead and cadmium respectively the lower achieved efficiency for natural water matrix compared to a distilled water matrix is explained by effects of doc in natural water indeed doc of the samples was 80 mg l 1 a concentration which has been shown to significantly interfere the removal efficiency of lead and cadmium in fig 5b to improve the removal efficiency phfin was set to a higher value of 10 5 with set phfin of 10 5 the removal efficiency for lead and cadmium increased to above 95 for the l s ratio of 100 this showed a successful treatment of the heavy metals contamination by using steel slag with a simple treatment design it is noted that two different applications can be considered for slag filters one being an industrial use and one for the treatment of natural waters in the former the organics in the system will likely be low and in the latter the organic concentration can be highly variable from system to system therefore the water being treated should be considered when establishing the use of slag for metal removal 4 conclusion a cheap and efficient method for the removal of lead and cadmium in water has been successfully established precipitation was the main process for the removal with an important role of phfin strong complexing ligands to lead and cadmium like edta strongly interfered with the removal while the affect is minor for weaker ligands such as isa fulvic and humic acids in batch experiments the removal capacity of lead and cadmium reach was most efficient at an l s ratio of 2000 in the column experiments the gradient solution loading induced a removal capacity of the slag to l s ratio 500 the treated solution with a high ph can act as sink for co2 gas in air or in flue gas consequently also reducing its alkaline strength to be directly release to the environment the column loading experiment showed instant kinetics for lead and cadmium removal and together with low leachability of hazardous elements the slag has been successfully applied for treating of natural water sample spiked with lead and cadmium this demonstrates the applicability of slag as a filter material for continuous treatment of contaminated waters e g heavily industrial contaminated

14018,in this work steel slag was shown to be a successful filter material for the removal of lead and cadmium from natural waters with a removal efficiency of 95 even under acidic conditions ph 3 5 overall precipitation was found to be the main removal mechanism over adsorption with a tight relationship with the final matrix ph batch experiments showed fast removal kinetics with 98 removal efficiency for lead and cadmium in 5 and 15 min respectively the removal kinetics followed a pseudo second order reaction r2 0 999 and the k2 was calculated to be 927 h 1 and 204 h 1 for lead and cadmium respectively a strong interference for the removal was observed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta but slightly with fulvic and humic acids and non significant with polymeric acid e g isosaccharinic acid in addition the column experiment showed spontaneous removal kinetics for lead and cadmium with a contact time of 3 6 36 seconds depending on loading flow rates column experiments at similar liquid to solid ratios showed a high removal capacity with gradient over isocratic solution loading the high removal efficiencies in combination with limited hazardous metals leaching led to the conclusion that slag is an appropriate filter material for treating contaminated waters moreover the slag treated solutions with alkaline conditions showed reacted efficiently with co2 in flue gas consequently the ph of the treated solution is neutralized making it easier to waste and this reaction may contribute to reducing co2 gas emissions keywords lead cadmium removal steel slag contaminated waters precipitation adsorption 1 introduction cadmium and lead contamination are considered serious threats to the environment and human health due to their high toxicity and persistent characteristics 1 they enter the food chain mainly through crop irrigation and soil contamination 2 according to the world health organization who inorganic lead and cadmium compounds have been placed in group 2a and are described as probable human carcinogens with a recommended maximum concentration of 10 μg l 1 and 3 μg l 1 in drinking water respectively 3 exceedingly high lead and cadmium exposure can cause bone degeneration liver damage lung insufficiency hypertension and renal dysfunction in humans human exposure is mainly through consuming contaminated food and drinking water 4 5 industrial activities such as mining electroplating pigment manufacturing metallurgy and agricultural activities increase the flux of heavy metals to local water bodies more attention has been paid to reduce the concentrations of the dissolved metals in sewage industrial and mining wastes 6 7 several removal approaches have been proposed among those adsorption and precipitation are considered to be the most suitable methods 8 11 costs for treating contaminated water by synthesized materials are typically high thus limiting their application on larger scales therefore a robust cheap and efficient method for removing the toxic metals is essential to mitigate the risk for society currently global crude steel production is around 1808 million tons per year 2018 estimate 12 steel slag a byproduct of steel manufacturing makes up approximately 15 by mass of the steel output giving approx 270 million tons produced per year 13 14 currently use of the slag is limited the majority is disposed of in landfills which occupy massive land areas and potentially pollute the environment 15 steel slag is mainly composed of the oxides of calcium silicon aluminum and iron giving it very strong alkaline properties as well as a high adsorption and precipitation capacity it has been reported that steel making slag can be used as adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals and various contaminants 16 19 few studies have reported the use of steel slag as adsorbent for treating lead and cadmium contamination 20 22 however steel slag is a complex system of oxides and typically has low specific surface area and poor pore structure caused by crystallization limiting its adsorption efficiency 21 a modified steel slag showed a sorption capacity for cadmium of 10 mg g 1 25 c 21 whereas other materials like iron oxide activated red mud was only 0 12 mg g 1 23 the reported sorption capacities of lead by iron oxide nanoparticles and iron coated filters were 36 mg g 1 24 and 1 2 mg g 1 25 respectively a study on the removal of copper in contaminated water by steel slag indicated that the removal is a result of both adsorption and precipitation 26 adsorbents were shown to be effective for treating wastewater containing a low heavy metal concentration while precipitation with lime cao has been found as one of the most effective method for treating extremely contaminated solutions 1000 mg l 1 27 in this study the in situ removal of lead and cadmium by slag filled filtration columns was examined in order to assess the efficiency of using slag as a filter material for contaminated water treatment the stainless steel slag in our study was obtained from scrap metal recycling which is considered environmentally friendly because it requires limited mining activities heavy metal removal efficiency by slag was tested under various conditions including ph competition of ligands and liquid to solid ratios and by the slag column with different solution loading flow rates isotherm and kinetics for the heavy metal removal were investigated with these tests and the contribution of adsorption and precipitation to the removal were examined a natural water sample spiked with lead and cadmium was used to test the application of the slag material in heavy metals filtration ultimately it was found that steel slag is a successful filter material for the removal of lead and cadmium from natural water with a removal efficiency of 95 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cadmium and lead stock solutions were prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 4h2o and pb no3 2 98 sigma aldrich in

previously isolated and characterized by pettersson 28 sodium isosaccharinic isa was prepared in our laboratory according to hagberg et al 29 the steel slag used was formed as a byproduct during stainless steel manufacturing via scrap metal recycling and provided by the stainless steel manufacturer outokumpu based in avesta sweden the process used silica as a reducing agent and only a single charge was used from the aod type argon oxygen decarburization the slag for the experiments in this study was within the size fraction of 0 25 0 9 mm but originated from a pool of dried 5 cm diameter

slag was equilibrated with 10 ml solutions containing 10 mg l 1 of lead or cadmium with various initial ph phini feeding solution giving a liquid to solid l s ratio of 100 to avoid settling samples were agitated at 15 rpm by an overhead shaker for 4 h followed by 5 min centrifugation at 8228 g the supernatant was then collected and filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter polypropylene vwr brand prior to analysis final ph phfin after contacting with the slag of the solutions were also measured a slag extract solution was made in the same way as described above but without the addition of lead or cadmium to test for metal precipitation independent of the solid slag thereby excluding adsorption processes to focus on precipitation reactions this test was conducted by mixing the metals 25 μl of 40 g l 1 with the filtered extract solution 10 ml under similar ph conditions as the metal plus slag tests described above 2 2 1 2 effects of ligands and liquid to solid ratios effects of speciation on metal removal efficiency by slag was tested by pre equilibrating 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium in 10 ml aliquots with different concentrations of fulvic acid humic acid sodium isosaccharinic isa and edta at phini 3 5 and agitating for 2 h 0 1 0 005 g of the slag was then added to each of the test solutions and agitated for another 4 h for investigating the effects of liquid to solid l s ratio the l s ratios were varied from 50 to 3000 by increasing the volume of lead or cadmium solution 10 mg l 1 phini 3 5 while keeping the mass of the slag constant at 0 1 g the phini was kept acidic at 3 5 to avoid any initial precipitation of lead and cadmium 2 2 1 3 isotherms 0 1 0 005 g of the slag was agitated with 10 ml of solutions containing various lead or cadmium concentrations from 10 to 300 mg l 1 phini 3 5 for 4 h equilibrium concentrations of lead and cadmium were measured and fit to the linear form of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms as presented in eqs 1 and 2

experiment this was done by agitating a test sample set of 0 1 0 005 g of the slag with 10 ml of 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium solution phini 3 5 for as little as 1 min and up to 8 h the sample reaction was halted at each time point by centrifugation 8228 g 3 min and filtration measured concentrations of lead and cadmium over time were fit to pseudo first order kinetics of adsorption eq 3 pseudo

as filled column with no compression pressure a mix solution of lead and cadmium 10 mg l 1 each phini 3 5 was used for the filled column experiment the solution loading flowrates were varied from 0 7 to 7 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump fluid metering inc usa 20 fractions 10 ml each were collected for chemicals and ph measurements the gradient flow rate began high at 10 ml min 1 and was then reduced according to real time phfin values monitored by a ph electrode targeted at 10 0 the slag treated contaminated water was alkaline post incubation with a ph 10 section 2 2 1 1 which does not fulfill the requirements ph 6 10 given by the swedish water and wastewater association 30 neutralization of the treated water was thus investigated by air and flue gas practically 1000 ml of the post column solution ph 10 6 was purged with air or flue gas at a flow rate of 300 ml min 1 using a gas pump with a built in a co2 meter cm 0054 co2 meter usa the percentage of co2 gas and ph of the solution were continuously monitored during the purging a proxy for flue gas was produced by burning a candle and collected through a glass funnel the measured percentage of co2 in air and in flue gas were 0 04 and 8 respectively 2 2 2 2 desorption the lead and cadmium absorbed onto 1 0 g of the slag in the filled column was washed by 10 ml of hcl acid solution with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 strength of the acid solution was varied from 0 1 to 2 a mass balance of lead and cadmium was determined by comparing the metal content in the loaded solution and the washed solution to determine the desorption capacity of the column 2 2 2 3 treatment for natural water samples the stream water sample was collected at lindesberg örebro sweden 59 26 21 4 n 15 19 05 1 e concentration of dissolved organic matter doc was measured to be 80 mg l 1 and major elements si ca na mg k and fe were 7 4 5 8 3 9 2 4 1 7 and 1 0 mg l 1 respectively original ph of the sample was 5 2 and adjusted to 3 5 by hcl acid to avoid the initial precipitation of spiked lead and cadmium 10 mg l 1 each the sample was equilibrated for 24 h allowing the spiked lead and cadmium to react with the sample matrix after that 100 ml of the sample was loaded through the slag filled column filled with 1 0 g of the slag with a gradient flow rate targeting a phfin of 10 0 and 10 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of the slag the slag has a bet specific surface area of 4 24 m2 g 1 micropore area 0 3448 m² g volume of pores between 1 7 nm and 300 nm diameter of 0 023289 cm³ g and a total void volume of 0 42 cm3 g 1 in the filled column without pressing the elemental composition of the slag is summarized in table 1 with calcium as the major component accounting for about 33 of the composition by weight followed by mg al and si about 4 each by recalculating calcium as its simplest oxide cao its weight contribution is about 46 the xrd spectra of the slag is shown in fig 1 and according to the processing software match 31 the main components for the slag are calcio olivine ca2sio4 32 and bredigite ba0 293ca13 467 mg1 81mn0 43o32si8 33 both mineral structures contain high abundance of cao and sio2 size and elemental composition of the slag was determined by sem and eds fig 2 the eds result showed a high signal intensity for o ca si al mg and a detectable signal for cr na ti s and f which is in a good agreement with the total elemental analysis table 1 and xrd results oxides are known to be formed during steelmaking and make up the composition of steel slags cao is generally the dominant oxide observed in steel slags produced during different steelmaking operations 34 feo is another common oxide produced during some steelmaking processes but the low occurrence of fe oxide observed in this study is most similar to ladle slags 34 it is also commonly found that slag leachates are highly alkaline due to the presence of cao and other oxides 35 36 leading us to believe that the slag used in this study is representative of a generic slag material and that the findings of this study would reciprocate to slags sourced from other factories or regions when the slag was dispersed in either a ph 3 5 or deionized water solution l s 100 4 h equilibration a strong alkaline solution with a ph of 11 3 was produced indicating a strong alkaline buffer capacity of the slag carbonate in the slag solution was measured to be 2 2 mg l 1 and dissolved elements concentrations are shown in table 1 with the highest concentration found for ca followed by al mg and si concentrations of heavier metals were not detected indicating that the slag is not a second contamination source of hazardous metals and therefore appropriate for contaminated water treatment 3 2 batch experiment 3 2 1 effects of ph ph is an important factor that governs removal efficiency of a material in this investigation the ph of solutions containing 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium were varied from 1 0 to 10 0 prior to slag addition phini and the corresponding ph values post slag addition were recorded phfin the slag has a high composition of cao giving it a strong alkaline buffer capacity therefore phfin increased from 3 7 to 11 4 and only phini below 1 5 could maintain phfin in acidic condition ph 6 fig 3 with phfin 6 phini 1 5 the removal efficiency for both lead and cadmium was minimal 10 fig 3 however when phfin varied between 6 0 to 9 0 phini between 1 5 and 2 0 the efficiency increased to 90 and 13 for lead and cadmium respectively when phfin 10 0 phini 2 2 the efficiency was 95 for both lead and cadmium with phini above 3 0 phfin were all 11 3 therefore the most efficient metal removal occurred with a phini 2 2 the most probable removal mechanism suggested by this study for pb and cd is precipitation as described in the following section lead and cadmium can react with hydroxide oh to form dissolved or solid species with stability constants log k of the complexes shown in reactions 1 to 6 37 1 pb2 oh pb oh aq log k 6 3 2 pb2 2oh pb oh 2 aq log k 10 9 3 pb2 2oh pb oh 2 s log k 19 9 4 cd2 oh cd oh aq log k 3 9 5 cd2 2oh cd oh 2 aq log k 7 65 6 cd2 2oh cd oh 2 s log k 14 4 as shown in fig 4 a dissolved species of lead dominate at ph below 6 4 mainly as dissolved pb2 aq while at higher ph levels pb oh 2 s the solid form is the main species a similar phenomenon was also observed for cadmium but with a higher breakthrough ph of 9 0 fig 4b the difference in the breakthrough ph between lead and cadmium is due to the difference in their solid form stability constants namely pb oh 2 s log k 19 9 and cd oh 2 s log k 14 4 higher for the former with phfin below 6 0 for lead and 8 8 for cadmium the sum of the dissolved species for each metal is higher than 99 9 fig 4 under these low ph conditions the removal of lead and cadmium by the slag if occurred would be a result of pb2 aq and cd2 aq adsorption but not precipitation the removal efficiencies were however insufficient 10 at the low phfin conditions indicating a weak adsorption of dissolved pb2 aq and cd2 aq species to the slag with a similar observation kim et al showed a low adsorption efficiency of 6 2 17 4 for copper by steel slags at phfin of 3 1 3 4 26 these results suggest that pb2 and cd2 are most efficiently removed from solution via precipitation reactions at higher reaction phs with phfin above 7 0 for lead and 10 for cadmium the concentration of the solid species calculated by thermodynamic model contribute 98 of the metals fig 4 at those phfin values the removal efficiency for both lead and cadmium was close to 100 indicating that the removal was mainly a result of the metal precipitation as pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s there is thus an excellent match in modeled concentration of lead and cadmium solid species fig 4 and their removal efficiencies fig 3 regression test p 0 001 in addition the removal efficiencies strongly related to phfin of the solutions with the correlation efficiency for lead and cadmium equal to an r2 of 0 96 and 0 89 p 0 001 respectively lead and cadmium can also precipitate with carbonate pb2 co3 2 pbco3 s log k 13 13 cd2 co3 2 cdco3 s log k 12 1 37 however the concentration of co3 2 was measured to be 2 2 mg l 1 which is much lower than the concentration of lead and cadmium added 10 mg l 1each and stability constants of the carbonate complexes are also lower than the hydroxide complexes in addition there was no loss of dissolved carbonate in the extracted solution phini 3 5 4 h equilibration with addition of 10 mg l 1 lead or cadmium and the visial minteq also predicted an under saturation to form lead and cadmium solid species with carbonate therefore carbonate species are likely not contributing to the final metal speciation to further examine the precipitation and with excluding the possibility for adsorption 25 μl of 40 g l 1 lead or cadmium solution was added to 10 ml of one aqueous solution ph of 11 3 adjusted by ca oh 2 solution and another the slag extracted solutions giving 100 mg l 1 final concentration of lead and cadmium after equilibrating centrifugation and filtration a white pellet was observed for the test samples and the concentration of dissolved lead and cadmium was measured to be below 0 8 and 1 2 mg l 1 respectively for both aqueous and slag extract solutions furthermore there was no difference in calcium concentration in the slag extract solutions before and after the addition of lead and cadmium the result thus indicated that precipitation of lead and cadmium was through their oxide forms not a co precipitation with calcium or the carbonate complexes isotherm for the removal of lead and cadmium were examined with langmuir and freundlich equations by step wise varying the initial concentrations from 10 to 300 mg l 1 the simple assumption for a langmuir adsorption model is that the adsorbent surface is homogenous and the binding sites are all equivalent whereas the freundlich adsorption model is more appropriate for rough surfaces with multiple binding sites the results showed a poor fit to the langmuir and freundlich equations for both lead r2 0 003 and 0 28 respectively and cadmium r2 0 21 and 0 45 respectively further indicating that direct adsorption is not the key removal mechanism for the metals with the slag the solid form pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s can aggregate to form larger particles and these particulates can either heterogeneously adsorb onto the slag or dispense in the solution the langmuir and freundlich equations are appropriate to explain for homogenous adsorption but likely not for the heterogeneous adsorption of precipitates observed in this study explaining the poor fits 3 2 2 effects of ligands on the removal the divalent cation forms of lead pb2 and cadmium cd2 can form strong complexes with many ligands besides hydroxide all of which compete with the formation of solid hydroxide species natural water contains doc and other ligands that could interfere with the metal removal in the slag reactor to test their impact pb2 and cd2 were pre equilibrated with organic ligands with known binding strengths to pb2 and cd2 to represent more natural water column speciation condition prior to reacting with the slag binding strength of pb2 and cd2 to different ligands are illustrated below specifically for carboxylic thiol and edta reactions 7 12 37 the cations showed a weak binding strength with carboxylic groups but relatively strong for thiol and edta 7 pb2 2ch3coo pb ch3coo 2 log k 4 08 8 cd2 2ch3coo cd ch3coo 2 log k 2 86 9 pb2 2rs pb rs 2 log k 15 27 10 cd2 2rs cd rs 2 log k 16 53 11 pb2 edta pb edta log k 18 04 12 cd2 edta cd edta log k 16 46 sodium isosaccharinic isa a poly carboxylic acid represents a major carbon source within a geological disposal facility since it comprises 70 of cellulose degradation products as a result of alkaline hydrolysis 38 it s complexation with few metals and cadmium has been reported 39 41 the complexation of cd2 and isa at high ph is favored as cd2 2oh isa cd isa oh 2 aq log k 11 5 as shown in fig 3a isa did not affect the removal efficiency of the metals even up to highest concentration of 1000 mg l 1 this could be explained by a weak binding strength of isa to pb2 and cd2 as dissolved species and therefore does not compete with the more favorable formation of pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s in contrast edta largely interferes with the metal removal efficiencies fig 5 a with 10 mg l 1 of edta the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium reduced to 70 and with above 40 and 500 mg l 1 of edta the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium respectively were non sufficient 10 the effect of edta on cadmium removal was slightly higher than lead showing that with 40 mg l 1 of edta the removal efficiency for cadmium was only 7 while 32 for lead this can be explained by a higher stability constant of pb2 to hydroxide compared to cd2 and a higher molar concentration of cadmium 0 09 mm compared to lead 0 05 mm due to a lower molecular mass of cadmium m 112 g mol 1 than lead 207 g mol 1 it is noted that the phfin was slightly reduced from 11 3 edta 0 mg l 1 to 11 2 edta 20 mg l 1 due to the buffering capacity of edta this reduction is however small compared to 60 and 55 decrease in the efficiency of lead and cadmium edta 20 mg l 1 respectively implying that the interferences of edta to the removal were mainly through the competing complexation in addition there was a negative correlation between the removal efficiencies and modeled concentration of pbedta aq and cdedta aq by winsgw 42 further supporting this conclusion as shown in fig 5b fulvic and humic acids mildly interfere with the removal efficiencies with a typical concentration of fulvic and humic acids in natural water of 20 50 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium reduced from 100 only by 7 and 10 16 respectively with 100 mg l 1 of fulvic or humic acid the reduction was around 20 or 80 removal the interference of humic acid on the removal of lead and cadmium was similar while fulvic acid interfered with the removal of cadmium higher than lead fulvic and humic acids contain diverse functional groups including the thiol group which has a strong binding affinity to pb2 and cd2 reactions 9 10 fulvic and humic acids are two common components of dissolved organic matter doc with fulvic acid remaining in solution after removal of humic acid by acidification 43 the differences between them can be the carbon oxygen and or nitrogen contents as well as acidity degree of polymerization molecular weight and color 44 concentrations of thiol ligands in fulvic and humic acids however vary substantially among different doc sources a determination of reduced sulfur concentration in wetland porewater doc suggested a reduced sulfur concentration of 0 04 0 16 doc on mass basis for instance with 100 mg l 1 doc thiol concentration would be calculated of 0 04 0 16 mg l 1 or 1 25 5 μm 45 a 10 mg l 1 solution of lead and cadmium has molar concentrations of 48 and 89 μm respectively molar thiol concentrations thus equal 2 6 10 4 and 1 4 5 6 of the lead and cadmium added respectively therefore a decrease of 20 efficiency for lead and cadmium at 100 mg l 1 concentration of fulvic or humic is likely explained by a result of other functional groups associated with humic and fulvic acids such as amino phenolic hydroxyl it is worth noting that the phfin was slightly reduced from 11 3 fulvic humic acid 0 mg l 1 to 11 1 fulvic humic acid 100 mg l 1 due to its buffering capacity this could to some extent contribute to the decrease of the removal efficiencies in general the organic matter content of natural waters should be considered if steal slag is to be used for heavy metal removal 3 2 3 removal capacity it has been shown in section 3 2 1 that phfin is critical for the removal of lead and cadmium by the slag increasing l s ratios will decrease phfin due to the dilution of hydroxide therefore by examining effective l s ratios the removal capacity of the slag can be determined following the increase of l s ratios from 50 to 3000 l kg 1 phini 3 5 phfin decreased from 11 3 l s 50 to 7 8 l s 3000 fig 6 as aforementioned the removal of lead and cadmium was mainly the result of precipitation therefore increasing l s ratios result in decreased lead and cadmium precipitation with l s ratios below 1000 phfin 9 9 the removal of lead and cadmium were both close to 100 with the ratio of 2000 phfin 8 5 the efficiency of lead was still close to 100 but dramatically decreased for cadmium down to 19 when the l s ratio increased to 3000 phfin 7 8 the efficiencies for lead and cadmium were 78 and 2 respectively because the precipitation is largely controlled by the phfin conditions that maintain higher phfin conditions are optimal for metal removal but the final solution is more hazardous when phfin is more neutral the efficiency drops in both scenarios the initial metals concentrations do not impact removal the results implied that 1 0 g of the slag can treat at most 1000 ml and 2000 ml of contaminated water with phini 3 5 for cadmium and lead respectively regardless of initial metal concentration in the literature the reported phfin of steel slags ranging from 9 5 to 13 5 with cao content of 35 to 47 the phfin and cao content of the slag in this study are of 11 3 and 46 respectively which are in the high end range of the studied slags 20 46 47 3 2 4 kinetics the reaction over time visualized in fig 7 shows rapid reaction kinetics for the removal of lead and cadmium with 90 of lead and cadmium removed in 5 and 15 min respectively the kinetics of lead were somewhat faster than cadmium after 20 min the efficiencies were steady and close to 100 for both lead and cadmium kinetics of the removal strongly related to phfin with r2 of 0 86 and 0 95 p 0 001 for lead and cadmium respectively highlighting the importance of solution ph for the removal fitting measured concentrations of lead and cadmium to the theoretical kinetic equations showed a low r2 0 24 for the pseudo first order and the intra particle diffusion equations but close to 1 r2 0 999 for the pseudo second order kinetics for both lead and cadmium this indicates that lead and cadmium removal was not a single adsorption process but also involved chemical reactions in this case precipitation 48 the k2 of the pseudo second order was calculated to be 927 h 1 and 204 h 1 for lead and cadmium respectively the determined k2 in our study was much higher than the k2 k2 30 phini 3 4 reported by kim et al 26 for the removal of copper by steel slags higher k2 values indicate faster kinetics for the removal which implies that it is an appropriate approach to use steel slag to remove lead and cadmium from water with fast kinetics almost spontaneous the steel slag can be used for continuous treatment of contaminated water as filter material 3 3 column experiments 3 3 1 loading flowrates the removal of lead and cadmium by the slag filled column was examined with different solution loading flowrates from 0 7 to 7 ml min 1 for each test 20 fractions were collected with a total volume of 200 ml phfin values varied with different flow rates and reduced from the first to the twentieth fraction fig 8 a as shown in fig 8b lower flow rates are more efficient at dissolving alkaline oxides raising the phfin of the loaded solution the removal efficiency thus reduced following increase of the flow rates with the flow rates of 0 7 1 4 3 0 and 7 0 ml min 1 the treated volume capacity the efficiency 95 for lead and cadmium were 190 160 150 and 100 ml and 130 120 100 and 40 ml respectively with 1 g of the slag the highest treated volume capacity was thus achieved with the lowest flowrate of 0 7 ml min 1 even though with the highest treated volume capacity the l s ratios of 190 for lead and 130 for cadmium in the flow through system are much lower than the equilibrium values calculated from the batch experiments of 2000 and 1000 it can be seen in fig 8a black and red stars a phfin of above 9 9 is needed to precipitate 95 of lead and cadmium a low flow rate seems to be highly efficient for dissolving alkaline oxides in early fractions as shown by the average ph values of the first 3 fractions 30 ml 11 28 11 15 11 04 and 10 39 for flowrates of 0 7 1 4 3 0 and 7 0 ml min 1 respectively the phfin of the early fractions were substantially higher than 9 9 particularly for 0 7 ml min 1 and rapidly decreased for later fractions fig 8a active alkaline oxides on the surface of the material is not unlimited and therefore there is a max capacity for metal removal via precipitation when heavily dissolved in early fractions the later fractions will lack alkaline oxides for raising the phfin high enough for the precipitation of lead and cadmium gradient of loading flowrate is therefore an appropriate approach with high flowrates in the beginning then gradually reducing while maintaining the phfin always just above 10 0 by using this approach the treated capacity l s ratio of the slag was achieved to be above 500 close to the equilibrium value fig 8b it is important to know whether the precipitates pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s adsorbed to the slag s surface or presented as an amorphous solid in the solution that can pass through the filter membrane 0 2 μm a test of the unfiltered post column solution with different treatment order i acidification 1 hno3 acid then filtration and ii filtration then acidification showed a non significant difference in measured concentration of lead and cadmium this indicates that the majority of pb oh 2 s and cd oh 2 s adsorbed to the slag but not dispersed in the solution implying a practical use of the slag as filter material for the treatment of contaminated water 3 3 2 neutralization under optimal metal removal conditions the ph of the treated water had a range of 10 0 10 6 which is higher than the guidelines of swedish water and wastewater association 30 and must be reduced before release to the environment co2 gas can acidify water solutions or react with hydroxide to reduce ph of alkaline solution through the reaction oh co2 hco3 logk 6 typical content of co2 gas in air and flue gas is 0 04 and 7 15 respectively the results in fig 9 show that by purging with air the ph gradually decreased from initial ph of 10 6 to 8 0 in 340 min then stable at ph around 8 0 with further purging on the other hand ph of the solution decreased dramatically from 10 6 to 6 7 within 5 min when purged by flue gas 8 0 co2 gas after that ph gradually decreased from 6 7 to 6 1 ph units from 5 to 15 min and then stabilized at ph around 6 0 with further purging the difference between air and flue gas is likely the higher content of co2 in flue gas 200 times than in air giving a faster and stronger neutralization capacity for flue gas even so the results indicated that the ph of the treated water can be reduced by either air or flue gas depending on the availably and accessibility of flue gas from an environmental perspective this approach could also be a sink for co2 and contribute to the reduction of co2 gas levels in air or released from industries it is noted that dissolved calcium concentrations in the solution before and after purging with either air or flue gas remained unchanged indicating a non precipitation of caco3 s dissolved calcium concentration of 60 mg l 1 was likely under saturation to form precipitate with carbonate originated from co2 3 3 3 desorption the slag after using must be treated to recover the absorbed hazardous metals the removal was mainly a result of precipitation at a high ph therefore using a low ph solution is a reasonable approach for desorption of the adsorbed metals strength of washing solution was investigated from 0 1 to 2 hcl acid as shown in fig 10 the washing efficiency increased following acidic strength of the washing solution with 10 ml of 0 1 of hcl acid the washing efficiency was below 24 and 32 for lead and cadmium respectively but with 2 of hcl acid the washing efficiency was higher than 95 for both lead and cadmium the washed solution contains very high concentration of the metals that can be used for recycling of the metals or treated as hazardous waste the slag after removal of the adsorbed metals can be used in construction as base material or for other applications 49 3 4 treatment for contaminated natural water the results showed that with aimed phfin of 10 0 the removal efficiencies of metals spiked into natural waters were 80 and 70 for lead and cadmium respectively the lower achieved efficiency for natural water matrix compared to a distilled water matrix is explained by effects of doc in natural water indeed doc of the samples was 80 mg l 1 a concentration which has been shown to significantly interfere the removal efficiency of lead and cadmium in fig 5b to improve the removal efficiency phfin was set to a higher value of 10 5 with set phfin of 10 5 the removal efficiency for lead and cadmium increased to above 95 for the l s ratio of 100 this showed a successful treatment of the heavy metals contamination by using steel slag with a simple treatment design it is noted that two different applications can be considered for slag filters one being an industrial use and one for the treatment of natural waters in the former the organics in the system will likely be low and in the latter the organic concentration can be highly variable from system to system therefore the water being treated should be considered when establishing the use of slag for metal removal 4 conclusion a cheap and efficient method for the removal of lead and cadmium in water has been successfully established precipitation was the main process for the removal with an important role of phfin strong complexing ligands to lead and cadmium like edta strongly interfered with the removal while the affect is minor for weaker ligands such as isa fulvic and humic acids in batch experiments the removal capacity of lead and cadmium reach was most efficient at an l s ratio of 2000 in the column experiments the gradient solution loading induced a removal capacity of the slag to l s ratio 500 the treated solution with a high ph can act as sink for co2 gas in air or in flue gas consequently also reducing its alkaline strength to be directly release to the environment

14019,vinasse is bioethanol liquid waste with high chemical oxygen demand cod content which is harmful to the environment it therefore requires treatment and one of the potential methods to treat is electrocoagulation ec this process involved some mechanisms such as electrode dissolution adsorption entrapment sedimentation and flotation furthermore the working volume during the process in reality was not constant as it reduced hence mechanistic models of ec were employed to have the detailed cod removal process in this study four mechanistic models were proposed and applied to simulate the cod removal process at voltage of 7 5 and 12 5 v the results showed that model 2 gave better prediction than the others due to its low sum of squares error sse which was 0 1189 0 2289 while the others showed sse of 0 1884 0 5792 the model assumed that settled sludge was formed from the adsorption and entrapment of cod on the coagulants while the floated sludge was formed from flotation of the settled sludge furthermore the model recorded higher kinetic constant values such as adsorption rate k a entrapment rate k e and flotation rate k f at 12 5 v compared with those at 7 5 v in conclusion the proposed model successfully figured out the details of cod removal mechanisms during the ec of vinasse and the kinetic constant values increased with increase in voltage it is expected that this model could be useful to predict the behavior of ec process with different conditions as well as to design ec system for industrial scales keywords electrocoagulation mechanistic models vinasse

bioethanol distillation with very low potential hydrogen ph level within a range of 3 75 4 5 1 2 and very high chemical oxygen demand cod level which is above 100 kg m3 3 4 this substance has a negative impact on the environment especially photosynthesis in water plants due to decrease in the penetration rate of sun light also the strong acidic nature of this substance results in remobilization of heavy metals in soil and its high cod content reduces the dissolved oxygen in water bodies thereby affecting the respiration of biota which leads to death 5 the high ratio between bioethanol which is the main product and vinasse is 1 8 15 v v this makes it constitute a serious problem for most industries 4 thus there is need to treat it before being discharged into the water bodies there are various methods for treating vinasse such as anaerobic digestion 6 7 aerobic treatment 8 fungal treatment 9 fenton 10 ozone 8 11 and electrocoagulation 12 chemical treatments like the use of fenton and ozone are not efficient due to the high operating cost similarly biological treatments like anaerobic digestion aerobic and fungal treatment are not effective due to the high cod concentration of vinasse which is toxic for biological activity however electrocoagulation ec has several advantages over the other methods which include 1 the use of simple equipments 2 low operating cost 3 short retention time 4 easy to operate 5 formation of less sludge compared with chemical coagulation 13 17 additionally it does not need chemical additives hence highly applicable in green technologies 16 18 19 currently in indonesia the bioethanol industries are treating vinasse through anaerobic digestion ad a previous study 6 reported that ad is an effective method for treating vinasse with cod level of approximately 75 kg m3 one of the processes involved in this method is dilution but it is not an efficient way of decreasing the cod level due to the high resultant waste volume the ec on the other hand has the potential of additionally employing ad in treating vinasse with very high level of pollutants hence a major concern of this study is to employ ec in reducing the cod of vinasse to approximately 75 kg m3 the ec method is similar to chemical coagulation but the former utilizes an electrical current to produce coagulants while the latter uses chemical agents such as fecl2 fecl3 fe2 so4 3 feso4 etc 16 19 in addition ec needs metals as anode and cathode which are immersed in the vinasse one of the metals commonly used as electrodes is iron fe due to the applied current during this process anode fe is oxidized to fez ion a process known as electrode dissolution while water is reduced to oh ion and h2 gas at cathode 20 thus the fez reacts with oh to form insoluble coagulant of fe oh z the coagulant and h2 gas formed are responsible for removing pollutants in the form of cod in the wastewater 16 21 the coagulants have the capacity of adsorbing the pollutants and then entrap the other pollutants while the h2 gas allows the pollutants to float on the solution surface 16 18 21 based on these ec utilizes three traditional treatments which are electrochemistry coagulation and flotation 16 the route of removing pollutants through the coordination between the coagulant and h2 gas during ec process has not been clearly reported prior to this research these are the four configuration steps for removing pollutants as proposed in this study configuration 1 the coagulant fe oh z adsorbs cod to form aggregates and through agitation entrap the other cod to form bigger aggregates these eventually go down as settled sludge also the h2 gas formed by water reduction coagulates and brings the other cod to the surface as floated sludge this phenomenon is called as flotation configuration 2 in a similar to configuration 1 the aggregates formed through adsorption and entrapment of cod on coagulant go down as settled sludge since the attractive force among settled sludge is low h2 gas breaks parts of it which are then brought to the surface as floated sludge configuration 3 this is in contrast to configuration 2 the aggregates formed through adsorption and entrapment of cod on coagulant go up as floated sludge and due to its size parts of it go down as settled sludge configuration 4 in this configuration the aggregates formed through adsorption and entrapment of cod on coagulant are removed in a way in which parts of it go up as floated sludge while the other parts settle go down it is assumed by many authors that the working volume is constant but in reality it decreases due to the reduction process of water in addition increase in temperature due to high current could increase the volume reduction process through evaporation hence the decrease in volume could not be ignored also different authors have used empirical models such as the first order second order langmuir elovich and fractional power models to predict pollutant removal by ec 22 24 however these models are not mathematically developed based on the mechanisms of the process thus the need for the development of mechanistic models useful in describing the mechanisms in various configuration steps for removing pollutants in the other water treatment fern a ndez et al 25 developed the kinetic model of soil bioremediation process however the new mechanistic models were proposed in this study which involved some complex mechanisms in ec which could be quantitatively figured therefore the aim of this study was to develop the mechanistic models based on different important configurations with the capacity of figuring out the detailed cod removal mechanisms during ec of vinasse at different voltage the complex models involved the decrease in cod concentration production of coagulant mass production of floated and settled sludge mass and the reduction in working volume meanwhile in empirical models the production of floated and settled sludge mass was not considered and then the working volume was assumed constant it is hoped that the proposed mechanistic models would describe the cod removal process during the ec of the other wastewaters especially for those with high level of pollutants additionally the comparison between the mechanistic and popular empirical models specifically first and second order kinetics was presented in this study also due to the variation of voltage the applied current was different and this helped in predicting the correlation between the charge loading and cod removal efficiency moreover this study presented some important information which could increase the knowledge in ec process of vinasse hence the novelty of this study could be summarized as follows investigation of cod removal in vinasse during ec at different voltage study of the decrease in working volume and production of floated and settled sludge mass development and application of the new mechanistic models which explain the cod removal mechanisms study of the comparison between the mechanistic and empirical models prediction of the correlation between charge loading and cod removal efficiency in ec of vinasse 2 mechanism of electrocoagulation process the configurations proposed were then explained in more detail in this section there were four configuration types with different assumptions for each configuration configuration 1 mechanism of ec process based on configuration 1 is shown in fig 1 all the processes were assumed to be irreversible also the working volume was not constant forced by electrical current the anode fe was dissolved to form fez ion as shown in eq 1 then at the cathode water was reduced to oh ion and h2 gas as shown in eq 2 21 1 f e k o f e z z e 2 z h 2 o z e k r z 2 h 2 z o h fez ion later reacted with oh to form insoluble coagulants of fe oh z as depicted in eq 3 3 f e z z o h h y d r o l y s i s f e o h z the coagulants neutralized and adsorbed the pollutants cod to form aggregates which went down as settled sludge as shown in eq 4 4 c o a g u l a n t c o d k a s e t t l e d s l u d g e due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of f e z to form the coagulants the rate determining step was generation of f e z ion electrolytically 26 thus eq 4 could be rewritten as 5 f e z c o d k a s e t t l e d s l u d g e during the formation of the settled sludge the aggregates dragged the other pollutants a phenomenon known as entrapment as shown in eq 6 6 c o d k e s e t t l e d s l u d g e furthermore cod was removed by flotation in which h2 gas pushed the pollutant to the surface as floated sludge as shown in eq 7 7 c o d k f f l o a t e d s l u d g e therefore the main processes in this configuration are shown by eqs 5 7 configuration 2 mechanism of ec process based on configuration 2 is depicted in fig 2 processes are expressed in eqs 5 and 6 also occur in configuration 2 however eq 7 is modified to eq 8 8 s e t t l e d s l u d g e

13 c o d k e f l o a t e d s l u d g e s e t t l e d s l u d g e 3 modeling based on the configurations described in section 2 the mathematical descriptions of the process were presented in this section the setting up of the mathematical equations was basically the applications of material balances 3 1 model 1 based on configuration 1 3 1 1 electrode consumption in ec process electrode anode was oxidized to fez ion the rate of the electrode consumption could be predicted through faraday s law as shown in eq 14 26 27 14 d m a n o d e d t i m w z f during the process volume of vinasse decreased due to the reduction and evaporation processes since the base surface of ec reactor was constant the vinasse surface level was observed to change during process hence based on fig 1 the value of x increased during the ec process as a consequent the active surface of electrode decreased since i j a e and a e 2 l e x w e 2 l e x t e w e t e eq 14 is modified to eq 15 15 d m a n o d e d t j m w 2 l e x w e 2 l e x t e w e t e z f the rate of increase in x value or decrease in surface level of working volume could be expressed with a simple eq 16a 16a d x d t b integration of eq 16a produces eq 16b 16b 0 x d x b 0 t d t x b t the value of b was obtained based on the observation of the surface levels at various times it was discussed in section 5 2 therefore substitution of eq 16b to eq 15 produces eq 17 17 d m a n o d e d t j m w 2 l e b t w e 2 l e b t t e w e t e z f 3 1 2 net rate of fez mass fez mass was produced through the oxidation of anode while it was consumed through the adsorption process net rate of fez mass is the difference between the production and consumption rates of fez mass thus net rate of fez mass during ec is shown in eq 18 18 d m f e d t j m w 2 l e

proposed mechanistic models some popular empirical models were also tried to quantitatively describe the measured data of cod concentration the empirical models assume that the working volume is

previous study 12 it had a ph value of 4 35 acidic contained cod of 100 16 kg m3 and total dissolved fe of 0 039 kg m3 4 2 experimental set up this study used the same experimental set up as a previous study 12 the electrocoagulation reactor was made with 1 l glass beaker cylindrical in shape it had a diameter of 0 11 m and height of 0 155 m with a working volume of 1000 ml 1 10 3 m3 the length width and thickness of electrodes used were 0 2 0 03 and 0 003 m respectively however the active dimension of both the anode and cathode was length width and thickness of 0 095 0 03 and 0 003 m respectively with active surface area ae0 of 0 00636 m2 also the distance d between the electrodes was kept constant at 0 055 m 30 the current was supplied through a power dc supply long wei series of lw k3010d 0 30 v 0 10 a and agitation speed was kept constant at 200 rpm 4 3 experimental design and procedures before used the electrodes were soaked in hcl 5 v v solution for 15 min and rinsed using aquadest and then weighted 12 31 the initial ph of vinasse was adjusted 6 0 through the addition of naoh technical grade the voltage was set at 7 5 and 12 5 v the ec process was conducted in batch mode for 60 min 3600 s in addition replication of the experiment was not conducted during process the current was recorded every 10 min 600 s the floated sludge on surface of vinasse was carefully and precisely taken using a plastic spoon this was then dried at temperature range of 105 110 c after which it was weighted the temperature of vinasse was then measured using a mercury thermometer with 0 100 c range while its ph was measured using a digital ph meter model atc 2011 furthermore 10 ml of the sample solution was placed in a reaction tube and allowed to settle down for 24 h 12 the sampling of 10 ml every 600 s during ec process was considered to have no effect on the cod removal mechanisms and volume reduction in other words the decrease in volume was assumed due to evaporation and reduction processes of water 4 4 analysis 4 4 1 the cod and total dissolved fe concentration analysis upon settling 5 ml of the supernatants were taken and diluted to 50 ml with aquadest dilution factor of 10 for the cod and total dissolved fe analysis the cod analysis was conducted through open reflux and titration method of sni 06 6989 15 2004 a method with capacity of measuring cod values in the range of 0 050 0 9 kg m3 hence there was need to dilute it again until the total dilution factor of 250 the chemicals used included potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 0 25 n sulfuric acid reagent ferrous ammonium sulfate fas 0 1 n and ferroin indicator the sulfuric acid reagent was prepared by dissolving 10 12 g ag2so4 in 1000 ml concentrated h2so4 the fas 0 1 n was prepared by dissolving 39 2 g fe nh4 2 so4 2 6h2o in aquadest after which 20 ml concentrated h2so4 was added to the solution and allowed to cool at room temperature then aquadest was added till the total volume was 1000 ml the procedure of cod analysis was as follows 1 10 ml of the sample was put into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask 2 0 2 g hgso4 5 ml k2cr2o7 0 25 n and 15 ml sulfuric acid reagent were added to it 3 the erlenmeyer flask was connected to a condenser after which it was heated on hot plate for 2 h 4 the sample was allowed to cool at room temperature and then the inside of the condenser was washed using approximately 50 ml aquadest 5 two to three drops of ferroin indicator were added to the sample 6 the sample was titrated using fas 0 1 n until the color changes to reddish brown and the volume of fas used was recorded step 1 until 6 were also conducted for aquadest as the blank sample and the cod concentration was calculated using eq 28a in addition the fas has to be standardized daily against k2cr2o7 0 25 n the fas standardization procedure was as follows 1 5 ml k2cr2o7 0 25 n was put into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask 2 it was diluted to about 50 ml with aquadest 3 15 ml concentrated h2so4 was added 4 two to three drops of ferroin indicator were added 5 it was titrated using fas 0 1 n until the color changes to reddish brown and the volume of fas used was recorded the normality of fas was calculated by using eq 28b 28a c o d v f a s f o r b l a n k t i t r a t i o n v f a s s a m p l e t i t r a t i o n n f a s 8000 t o t a l d i l u t i o n f a c t o r v s a m p l e 28b n o r m a l i t y o f f a s v p o t a s s i u m d i c h r o m a t e n p o t a s s i u m d i c h r o m a t e v f a s the total dissolved fe in the solution was measured through the analysis service in badan tenaga nuklir nasional batan using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas for preparation before aas analysis the sample was filtered using the whatman grade 42 filter paper 32 the total dissolved fe data from batan was multiplied with dilution factor of 10 the measured total dissolved fe was assumed that it represented the amount of total fez ions in the solution the appropriate z value was discussed in section 5 2 4 4 2 the weight loss in anode and mass measurement of floated sludge upon completing the ec process anode the sacrificial electrode was rinsed using distilled water and then dried within a temperature range of 105 110 c after which it was weighted similar to the explanation provided in section 4 3 the floated sludge was carefully and precisely taken using a plastic spoon from the surface of vinasse this was dried at a temperature range of 105 110 c and weighted 4 4 3 mass estimation of settled sludge the settled sludge mass was estimated using material balance as shown in eq 29a and the fe in total sludge sum of floated and settled sludge was estimated through eq 29b while the fe electrolytically produced was estimated with eq 29c in the vinasse the ratio of cod to total solid ts is close to one 4 33 since the ts is equal to sum of total dissolved solid tds and total suspended solid tss in other words the cod value was almost same with sum of total suspended solid tss and total dissolved solid tds it means that the vinasse dominantly contained organic pollutants the other pollutants which were inorganic materials not measured as cod were in little amount 5 hence this study assumed that the settled and floated sludge were formed mainly by the cod removal in vinasse and fe in total sludge 29a s e t t l e d s l u d g e m a s s r e m o v e d c o d m a s s

estimation the solution conductivity could be estimated using eq 30 34 since g 1 r r v i and k d a e eq 30 is modified to eq 31 meanwhile resistivity was estimated using eq 32 30 κ g k 31 κ 1 r d a e 32 ρ 1 κ 4 5 kinetic analysis the measured data during ec process were cod total dissolved fe in solution floated sludge and settled sludge at various times the adjustable parameters in model 1 and 2 were k a k e k f the ones in model 3 were k a k e k s while the ones in model 4 were k a k e α the values of these parameters were obtained through the minimization of sum of squares error sse the simultaneous ordinary differential equations were solved through ode15s and minimization of sse was through fminsearch with help of matlab software the sse was presented in eq 33 33 s s e i 1 n m e a s u r e d d a t a i p r e d i c t e d d a t a i m e a s u r e d d a t a i 2 furthermore curve fitting between the experimental data and calculated results was also conducted 5 results and discussions the ec was successfully conducted at voltage of 7 5 and 12 5 v this voltage difference had effects on the measured data such as current density ph temperature cod total dissolved fe and floated sludge during ec as presented in table 5 also the four proposed mechanistic models were applied to fit the measured data and the best one having the lowest sse value was compared with the empirical models mainly the first and second order kinetic models in fitting of the cod concentration during ec of vinasse furthermore the effect of charge loading on the cod removal efficiency was estimated the detailed results and discussions were presented in the section of 5 1 5 8 5 1 current density profile the change in current i during ec process of vinasse at voltage of 7 5 v and 12 5 v was recorded and shown in table 5 also the decrease in vinasse surface level x in ec reactor was measured and presented in table 5 the active surface of electrodes decreased due to the increase in x which was calculated per real time using the formula a e 2 l e x w e 2 l e x t e w e t e additionally the current density j was calculated using the formula i a e as shown in table 5 and the change in j as a function of time t is presented in fig 5 a based on the results the current density increased drastically at voltage of 12 5 v thus the higher the voltage the higher the current was supplied to solution thereby causing the production of fez ion in large amount the presence of these ions subsequently increased the solution conductivity thereby allowing the current to flow with ease however the current density increased slowly at 7 5 v leading to the generation of fez ion in low quantities also considering table 5 the solution conductivity at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v but the solution resistivity at 12 5 v was lower than that at 7 5 v 5 2 determining the z value during ec the anode fe was oxidized to be f e z ion based on the works of some authors 35 38 z was assigned 2 hence f e 2 ferrous was produced from oxidation of fe other authors 39 40 however assigned 3 to it resulting in f e 3 ferric to find the suitable z value the anode weight was measured before and after the process the weight after the process was also predicted using eq 17 with z 2 and 3 the value of b was obtained by making a plot between x m and t s as shown in fig 5 b where it at 7 5 and 12 5 v was 0 351 10 5 and 1 221 10 5 m s respectively then the anode weights after the process were 2 241 10 3 kg and 4 328 10 3 kg at 7 5 and 12 5 v respectively as shown in table 5 the error between measured and predicted anode weight loss at 7 5 and 12 5 v is shown in table 6 and also shows that z 2 was much better in predicting the anode weight loss than z 3 with error between 0 156 3 859 and 33 231 35 905 respectively therefore the f e 2 ferrous was generated through oxidation of iron during ec process and z 2 was used in the mechanistic model similarly lakshmanan et al 41 and sasson et al 42 arrived at the same conclusion that f e 2 was generated at the iron anode during ec not f e 3 the anode consumption at 12 5 v was 4 328 10 3 kg which was more than the 2 241 10 3 kg at 7 5 v this was due to the fact that higher voltage resulted in higher current density 5 3 temperature profile temperature of vinasse was measured per real time and profiled in table 5 it increased till the end which was caused by the continuous supply of current during process in addition the effect of increasing the temperature at 12 5 v was faster than that at 7 5 v energy was supplied in solution could be estimated through eq 34 34 q v i t therefore the higher the i and t the higher the q would be based on table 5 current value at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v relationship between q and δt is presented in eq 35 43 44 35 δ t q c p hence the higher the value of q the higher the increasing of temperature would be based on that increasing rate of temperature at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v 5 4 ph cod total dissolved fe profile based on the discussion in section 5 2 the appropriate value for z was 2 which resulted in the oxidation of iron into fe2 at the anode then the fe2 reacted with oh ion to form insoluble coagulant of fe oh 2 which adsorbed cod also the fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 and then hydrolyzed to be fe oh 3 45 46 however according to donneys victoria et al 47 the formation of fe3 and fe oh 3 occurs in ph range of 7 6 14 besides that the dissolved oxygen in solution could affect the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 as shown in eq 36 47 36 4 f e 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 8 o h 4 f e o h 3 however in this study the ph range was 6 0 7 7 as shown in table 5 and dissolved oxygen in the vinasse is very low 48 based on these conditions the dominant iron species in system during ec process might be fe2 and fe oh 2 furthermore the fe oh 2 formed was assumed to be settled and floated sludge completely hence total dissolved fe measured through aas was assumed as remaining total fe2 in solution during the ec the reduction of h2o resulted in the formation of oh ion and h2 gas at cathode however the oh was not completely involved in the formation of fe oh 2 and the excessive presence of oh increased the solution ph in this case the production of oh was higher than its consumption to produce coagulants based on the ph profile shown in table 5 the ph increased from 6 0 to 7 2 from the beginning to the end of the ec process at 7 5 v meanwhile at 12 5 v the ph increased from 6 0 to 7 7 at 0 to 2400 s then it was stable still at 7 7 from 2400 to 3000 s and finally decreased to 7 3 at 3600 s this decrease in ph is caused by two ways 1 the consumption rate of oh to produce hydroxo iron species fe oh 2 is higher than its production rate 46 49 and 2 the oh is consumed by the hydroxo iron species to produce anionic hydroxo iron species fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 45 46 50 51 the latter occurs at an alkaline ph because the fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 is formed at solution ph above 9 0 21 in this study the solution ph however decreased from 7 7 to 7 3 which was in the neutral range hence the decrease in ph was only as a result of the former this was consistent with the study of soeprijanto et al 49 in which the solution ph increased to7 43 and then decreased to 7 08 the amount of fe2 formed was a function of the current supplied to the solution hence voltage of 12 5 v produced larger amount of fe2 thereby producing more fe oh 2 and the cod mass removal was also higher than at voltage of 7 5 v as shown in table 5 thus the remaining total dissolved fe in solution at 12 5 v was lower than at 7 5 v as also shown in table 5 this means that more fe2 became coagulant at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v then in terms of ph the increasing rate of solution ph at 12 5 v was higher than at 7 5 v and the higher the ph the more fe2 became fe oh 2 at neutral ph gelatinous metal coagulant was released in large amount in solution 31 52 5 5 floated and settled sludge profile the floated sludge generated during the ec process is shown in table 5 and its appearance is shown in fig 6 a the production of floated sludge at 12 5 v was higher than at 7 5 v based on the explanation in section 5 4 h2 gas was produced by reduction of water at cathode and the amount produced depended on the current supplied to the system based on fig 5 a higher current density was supplied at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v therefore more h2 gas was produced at 12 5 v thereby allowing the pollutants to be easily separated by flotation at this higher voltage compared with 7 5 v the amount of hydrogen production was predicted using faraday s law as shown in eq 37 53 37 d n h 2 d t i f h j a e f h j 2 l e b t w e 2 l e b t t e w e t e f h the predicted production of h2 during ec of vinasse is shown in fig 5 c based on this more h2 gas was produced at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v the settled sludge produced was predicted using eq 29a and shown in fig 5 d then its appearance is shown in fig 6 b indicating more of settled sludge at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v as explanation in section 5 4 voltage of 12 5 resulted more coagulant of fe oh 2 than voltage 7 5 v the coagulant had correspondence to remove pollutants and then produced settled sludge 5 6 modeling the proposed mechanistic models were successfully applied to fit the measured data the fitting between the measured and predicted data obtained from the model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 is shown in figs 7 10 respectively the adjustable parameters in model 1 and model 2 are k a k e k f the ones in model 3 are k a k e k s while the ones in model 4 are k a k e α furthermore the kinetic parameters obtained from the four mechanistic models are presented in table 7 comparing the calculated results with the experimental data it was obvious that all the proposed models were suitable for describing the phenomena however model 2 mathematically and visually gave the best prediction this was due to its lower sse 0 1189 0 2289 compared with the others 0 1884 0 5792 these results showed that the mechanisms involved in pollutant removal in vinasse during ec process followed model 2 as shown in fig 2 the kinetic constant of b was obtained from fig 5 b representing the decreasing rate of vinasse surface level in other words the higher the b value the more the volume was removed voltage of 12 5 v 1 221 10 5 m s resulted the more value of b than voltage of 7 5 v 0 351 10 5 m s this was due to the high current density as well as the high temperature at 12 5 v in model 2 the k a presented the reaction rate of adsorption of cod on coagulants its value at 12 5 v was 3 64 10 5 m3 kg s but was 8 77 10 6 m3 kg s at 7 5 v as explanation in section 5 4 amount of coagulants fe oh 2 produced at the higher voltage was more leading to faster adsorption rate of cod compared with the lower voltage in addition the k e in this model presented the entrapment rate of cod in forming settled sludge it had a value of 1 84 10 4 s at 12 5 v but was 7 00 10 5 s at 7 5 v the fe2 reacted with oh to form coagulants which adsorbed the cod to form aggregates these in turn dragged the other cod to settle at the base together as settled sludge hence the more the aggregates in the system the easier the cod was entrapped more aggregates were formed at 12 5 v thereby resulting more settled sludge compared with 7 5 v finally the k f in this model presented the flotation rate during ec process with a value of 3 70 10 4 s at 12 5 v compared with 2 26 10 4 s at 7 5 v this was also caused by the higher current density at 12 5 v aiding the rapid formation of h2 which broke the settled sludge and pushed it to the surface as floated sludge 5 7 comparison between the mechanistic model 2 and the empirical models the first and second order kinetics which are the two most popular empirical models were also used to predict the cod concentration profile during ec the predicted cod data from the empirical models and the model 2 are shown in table 8 the plotting between the measured cod and predicted cod by these models is shown in fig 11 based on the results the first and second order kinetics gave good prediction with the almost same of mean absolute percentage error mape value which was 0 58 1 28 the mechanistic model 2 on the other hand had a mape value of 0 82 1 85 this value just obtained from cod concentration data the formula for calculating mape is shown in eq 38 despite the fact the cod profile predicted by the empirical models was more precise compared with that of mechanistic model 2 the latter was very acceptable due to its low mape which was still below 2 the maximum mape value in any modeling should not be more than 20 54 furthermore it could figure out detailed ec process with complete measured parameters including cod total fe floated sludge and settled sludge profile during ec process but the empirical models could not do that 38 m a p e 1 n i 1 n m e a s u r e d c o d i p r e d i c t e d c o d i m e a s u r e d c o d i 100 5 8 estimation of the effect of charge loading on cod removal efficiency in ec of vinasse the cod removal efficiency is mainly affected by the value of charge loading generally the charge loading shows the charges transferred in electrochemical reactions for a given amount of wastewater treated commonly it is calculated by eq 39 55 39 q i t v i n i t i a l j a e t v i n i t i a l in this section the results of many studies about ec of vinasse also is known as distillery spent wash including previous studies and this study were summarized to see the effect of the charge loading on the cod removal efficiency because of the difference of initial cod concentration in their experiment the eq 39 is modified to eq 40 by considering the initial cod concentration 40 q i t v i n i t i a l c c o d i n i t i a l j a e t v i n i t i a l c c o d i n i t i a l table 9 shows the summary of experimental data from ec of vinasse from previous studies 56 62 and this study for the purpose of simplifying the calculation an average current of 2 15 and 3 99 a was used for variable of 7 5 v and 12 5 v respectively the correlation between charge loading and cod removal efficiency is shown in fig 12 this showed that the increasing of charge loading from 0 to 18 105 c kg cod required increase in the cod removal efficiency from 0 to 92 5 however further increase in the charge loading reduced the cod removal efficiency it was noted that applying too high current was not good considering the fact it aided that excessive formation of hydrogen bubbles the coagulants fe oh 2 formed could easily be pushed to the surface of solution by the hydrogen bubbles before they adsorbed and entrapped the pollutants too high current could also increase the solution temperature thereby causing the re dissolution of the aggregates 63 the cod concentration of vinasse in this study could be reduced from 100 16 to 83 17 kg m3 but still higher than the target concentration suitable as a biogas feedstock which is around 75 kg m3 hence there is need to conduct research on the other parameters affecting the ec process so as to achieve the target cod concentration 6 conclusion this experiment research on ec of vinasse waste provided some information on the effect of voltage on current density temperature ph cod total dissolved fe floated and settled sludge during the process in addition the decrease in the working volume due to evaporation and reduction of water during ec was informed the four mechanistic models were proposed to simulate the ec process with the assumption that some mechanisms such as electrode dissolution adsorption entrapment sedimentation and flotation occurred in the system these proposed mechanistic models were successfully applied to fit the measured data with different sse values however model 2 had the lowest sse which means that cod removal mechanisms of this ec process for treating vinasse followed the model 2 in addition the kinetic constants in the model such as b decreasing rate of vinasse height level k a rate of adsorption k e rate of entrapment and k f rate of flotation at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v furthermore the model 2 was compared with the first and second order kinetic models and the predicted cod from these three models was almost similar with very low mape value below 2 however the model 2 was able to illustrate the cod removal mechanism in more details compared with the two empirical models the correlation between the charge loading and cod removal efficiency in ec of vinasse was also successfully predicted moreover there is need to conduct research on the other parameters affecting the cod removal from vinasse and then simulated using the model 2 so as to find the kinetic constant values important in designing the ec systems for industrial use declaration of competing interest there are no competing interests to declare acknowledgements the authors thank to lembaga pengelola dana pendidikan lpdp

14019,vinasse is bioethanol liquid waste with high chemical oxygen demand cod content which is harmful to the environment it therefore requires treatment and one of the potential methods to treat is electrocoagulation ec this process involved some mechanisms such as electrode dissolution adsorption entrapment sedimentation and flotation furthermore the working volume during the process in reality was not constant as it reduced hence mechanistic models of ec were employed to have the detailed cod removal process in this study four mechanistic models were proposed and applied to simulate the cod removal process at voltage of 7 5 and 12 5 v the results showed that model 2 gave better prediction than the others due to its low sum of squares error sse which was 0 1189 0 2289 while the others showed sse of 0 1884 0 5792 the model assumed that settled sludge was formed from the adsorption and entrapment of cod on the coagulants while the floated sludge was formed from flotation of the settled sludge furthermore the model recorded higher kinetic constant values such as adsorption rate k a entrapment rate k e and flotation rate k f at 12 5 v compared with those at 7 5 v in conclusion the proposed model successfully figured out the details of cod removal mechanisms during the ec of vinasse and the kinetic constant values increased with increase in voltage it is expected that this model could be useful to predict the behavior of ec process with different conditions as well as to design ec system for industrial scales keywords electrocoagulation mechanistic models vinasse

bioethanol distillation with very low potential hydrogen ph level within a range of 3 75 4 5 1 2 and very high chemical oxygen demand cod level which is above 100 kg m3 3 4 this substance has a negative impact on the environment especially photosynthesis in water plants due to decrease in the penetration rate of sun light also the strong acidic nature of this substance results in remobilization of heavy metals in soil and its high cod content reduces the dissolved oxygen in water bodies thereby affecting the respiration of biota which leads to death 5 the high ratio between bioethanol which is the main product and vinasse is 1 8 15 v v this makes it constitute a serious problem for most industries 4 thus there is need to treat it before being discharged into the water bodies there are various methods for treating vinasse such as anaerobic digestion 6 7 aerobic treatment 8 fungal treatment 9 fenton 10 ozone 8 11 and electrocoagulation 12 chemical treatments like the use of fenton and ozone are not efficient due to the high operating cost similarly biological treatments like anaerobic digestion aerobic and fungal treatment are not effective due to the high cod concentration of vinasse which is toxic for biological activity however electrocoagulation ec has several advantages over the other methods which include 1 the use of simple equipments 2 low operating cost 3 short retention time 4 easy to operate 5 formation of less sludge compared with chemical coagulation 13 17 additionally it does not need chemical additives hence highly applicable in green technologies 16 18 19 currently in indonesia the bioethanol industries are treating vinasse through anaerobic digestion ad a previous study 6 reported that ad is an effective method for treating vinasse with cod level of approximately 75 kg m3 one of the processes involved in this method is dilution but it is not an efficient way of decreasing the cod level due to the high resultant waste volume the ec on the other hand has the potential of additionally employing ad in treating vinasse with very high level of pollutants hence a major concern of this study is to employ ec in reducing the cod of vinasse to approximately 75 kg m3 the ec method is similar to chemical coagulation but the former utilizes an electrical current to produce coagulants while the latter uses chemical agents such as fecl2 fecl3 fe2 so4 3 feso4 etc 16 19 in addition ec needs metals as anode and cathode which are immersed in the vinasse one of the metals commonly used as electrodes is iron fe due to the applied current during this process anode fe is oxidized to fez ion a process known as electrode dissolution while water is reduced to oh ion and h2 gas at cathode 20 thus the fez reacts with oh to form insoluble coagulant of fe oh z the coagulant and h2 gas formed are responsible for removing pollutants in the form of cod in the wastewater 16 21 the coagulants have the capacity of adsorbing the pollutants and then entrap the other pollutants while the h2 gas allows the pollutants to float on the solution surface 16 18 21 based on these ec utilizes three traditional treatments which are electrochemistry coagulation and flotation 16 the route of removing pollutants through the coordination between the coagulant and h2 gas during ec process has not been clearly reported prior to this research these are the four configuration steps for removing pollutants as proposed in this study configuration 1 the coagulant fe oh z adsorbs cod to form aggregates and through agitation entrap the other cod to form bigger aggregates these eventually go down as settled sludge also the h2 gas formed by water reduction coagulates and brings the other cod to the surface as floated sludge this phenomenon is called as flotation configuration 2 in a similar to configuration 1 the aggregates formed through adsorption and entrapment of cod on coagulant go down as settled sludge since the attractive force among settled sludge is low h2 gas breaks parts of it which are then brought to the surface as floated sludge configuration 3 this is in contrast to configuration 2 the aggregates formed through adsorption and entrapment of cod on coagulant go up as floated sludge and due to its size parts of it go down as settled sludge configuration 4 in this configuration the aggregates formed through adsorption and entrapment of cod on coagulant are removed in a way in which parts of it go up as floated sludge while the other parts settle go down it is assumed by many authors that the working volume is constant but in reality it decreases due to the reduction process of water in addition increase in temperature due to high current could increase the volume reduction process through evaporation hence the decrease in volume could not be ignored also different authors have used empirical models such as the first order second order langmuir elovich and fractional power models to predict pollutant removal by ec 22 24 however these models are not mathematically developed based on the mechanisms of the process thus the need for the development of mechanistic models useful in describing the mechanisms in various configuration steps for removing pollutants in the other water treatment fern a ndez et al 25 developed the kinetic model of soil bioremediation process however the new mechanistic models were proposed in this study which involved some complex mechanisms in ec which could be quantitatively figured therefore the aim of this study was to develop the mechanistic models based on different important configurations with the capacity of figuring out the detailed cod removal mechanisms during ec of vinasse at different voltage the complex models involved the decrease in cod concentration production of coagulant mass production of floated and settled sludge mass and the reduction in working volume meanwhile in empirical models the production of floated and settled sludge mass was not considered and then the working volume was assumed constant it is hoped that the proposed mechanistic models would describe the cod removal process during the ec of the other wastewaters especially for those with high level of pollutants additionally the comparison between the mechanistic and popular empirical models specifically first and second order kinetics was presented in this study also due to the variation of voltage the applied current was different and this helped in predicting the correlation between the charge loading and cod removal efficiency moreover this study presented some important information which could increase the knowledge in ec process of vinasse hence the novelty of this study could be summarized as follows investigation of cod removal in vinasse during ec at different voltage study of the decrease in working volume and production of floated and settled sludge mass development and application of the new mechanistic models which explain the cod removal mechanisms study of the comparison between the mechanistic and empirical models prediction of the correlation between charge loading and cod removal efficiency in ec of vinasse 2 mechanism of electrocoagulation process the configurations proposed were then explained in more detail in this section there were four configuration types with different assumptions for each configuration configuration 1 mechanism of ec process based on configuration 1 is shown in fig 1 all the processes were assumed to be irreversible also the working volume was not constant forced by electrical current the anode fe was dissolved to form fez ion as shown in eq 1 then at the cathode water was reduced to oh ion and h2 gas as shown in eq 2 21 1 f e k o f e z z e 2 z h 2 o z e k r z 2 h 2 z o h fez ion later reacted with oh to form insoluble coagulants of fe oh z as depicted in eq 3 3 f e z z o h h y d r o l y s i s f e o h z the coagulants neutralized and adsorbed the pollutants cod to form aggregates which went down as settled sludge as shown in eq 4 4 c o a g u l a n t c o d k a s e t t l e d s l u d g e due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of f e z to form the coagulants the rate determining step was generation of f e z ion electrolytically 26 thus eq 4 could be rewritten as 5 f e z c o d k a s e t t l e d s l u d g e during the formation of the settled sludge the aggregates dragged the other pollutants a phenomenon known as entrapment as shown in eq 6 6 c o d k e s e t t l e d s l u d g e furthermore cod was removed by flotation in which h2 gas pushed the pollutant to the surface as floated sludge as shown in eq 7 7 c o d k f f l o a t e d s l u d g e therefore the main processes in this configuration are shown by eqs 5 7 configuration 2 mechanism of ec process based on configuration 2 is depicted in fig 2 processes are expressed in eqs 5 and 6 also occur in configuration 2 however eq 7 is modified to eq 8 8 s e t t l e d s l u d g e

13 c o d k e f l o a t e d s l u d g e s e t t l e d s l u d g e 3 modeling based on the configurations described in section 2 the mathematical descriptions of the process were presented in this section the setting up of the mathematical equations was basically the applications of material balances 3 1 model 1 based on configuration 1 3 1 1 electrode consumption in ec process electrode anode was oxidized to fez ion the rate of the electrode consumption could be predicted through faraday s law as shown in eq 14 26 27 14 d m a n o d e d t i m w z f during the process volume of vinasse decreased due to the reduction and evaporation processes since the base surface of ec reactor was constant the vinasse surface level was observed to change during process hence based on fig 1 the value of x increased during the ec process as a consequent the active surface of electrode decreased since i j a e and a e 2 l e x w e 2 l e x t e w e t e eq 14 is modified to eq 15 15 d m a n o d e d t j m w 2 l e x w e 2 l e x t e w e t e z f the rate of increase in x value or decrease in surface level of working volume could be expressed with a simple eq 16a 16a d x d t b integration of eq 16a produces eq 16b 16b 0 x d x b 0 t d t x b t the value of b was obtained based on the observation of the surface levels at various times it was discussed in section 5 2 therefore substitution of eq 16b

the adsorption process net rate of fez mass is the difference between the production and consumption rates of fez mass thus net rate of fez mass during ec is shown in eq 18 18 d m f e d t j m w 2 l e

proposed mechanistic models some popular empirical models were also tried to quantitatively describe the measured data of cod concentration the empirical models assume that the working volume is

previous study 12 it had a ph value of 4 35 acidic contained cod of 100 16 kg m3 and total dissolved fe of 0 039 kg m3 4 2 experimental set up this study used the same experimental set up as a previous study 12 the electrocoagulation reactor was made with 1 l glass beaker cylindrical in shape it had a diameter of 0 11 m and height of 0 155 m with a working volume of 1000 ml 1 10 3 m3 the length width and thickness of electrodes used were 0 2 0 03 and 0 003 m respectively however the active dimension of both the anode and cathode was length width and thickness of 0 095 0 03 and 0 003 m respectively with active surface area ae0 of 0 00636 m2 also the distance d between the electrodes was kept constant at 0 055 m 30 the current was supplied through a power dc supply long wei series of lw k3010d 0 30 v 0 10 a and agitation speed was kept constant at 200 rpm 4 3 experimental design and procedures before used the electrodes were soaked in hcl 5 v v solution for 15 min and rinsed using aquadest and then weighted 12 31 the initial ph of vinasse was adjusted 6 0 through the addition of naoh technical grade the voltage was set at 7 5 and 12 5 v the ec process was conducted in batch mode for 60 min 3600 s in addition replication of the experiment was not conducted during process the current was recorded every 10 min 600 s the floated sludge on surface of vinasse was carefully and precisely taken using a plastic spoon this was then dried at temperature range of 105 110 c after which it was weighted the temperature of vinasse was then measured using a mercury thermometer with 0 100 c range while its ph was measured using a digital ph meter model atc 2011 furthermore 10 ml of the sample solution was placed in a reaction tube and allowed to settle down for 24 h 12 the sampling of 10 ml every 600 s during ec process was considered to have no effect on the cod removal mechanisms and volume reduction in other words the decrease in volume was assumed due to evaporation and reduction processes of water 4 4 analysis 4 4 1 the cod and total dissolved fe concentration analysis upon settling 5 ml of the supernatants were taken and diluted to 50 ml with aquadest dilution factor of 10 for the cod and total dissolved fe analysis the cod analysis was conducted through open reflux and titration method of sni 06 6989 15 2004 a method with capacity of measuring cod values in the range of 0 050 0 9 kg m3 hence there was need to dilute it again until the total dilution factor of 250 the chemicals used included potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 0 25 n sulfuric acid reagent ferrous ammonium sulfate fas 0 1 n and ferroin indicator the sulfuric acid reagent was prepared by dissolving 10 12 g ag2so4 in 1000 ml concentrated h2so4 the fas 0 1 n was prepared by dissolving 39 2 g fe nh4 2 so4 2 6h2o in aquadest after which 20 ml concentrated h2so4 was added to the solution and allowed to cool at room temperature then aquadest was added till the total volume was 1000 ml the procedure of cod analysis was as follows 1 10 ml of the sample was put into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask 2 0 2 g hgso4 5 ml k2cr2o7 0 25 n and 15 ml sulfuric acid reagent were added to it 3 the erlenmeyer flask was connected to a condenser after which it was heated on hot plate for 2 h 4 the sample was allowed to cool at room temperature and then the inside of the condenser was washed using approximately 50 ml aquadest 5 two to three drops of ferroin indicator were added to the sample 6 the sample was titrated using fas 0 1 n until the color changes to reddish brown and the volume of fas used was recorded step 1 until 6 were also conducted for aquadest as the blank sample and the cod concentration was calculated using eq 28a in addition the fas has to be standardized daily against k2cr2o7 0 25 n the fas standardization procedure was as follows 1 5 ml k2cr2o7 0 25 n was put into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask 2 it was diluted to about 50 ml with aquadest 3 15 ml concentrated h2so4 was added 4 two to three drops of ferroin indicator were added 5 it was titrated using fas 0 1 n until the color changes to reddish brown and the volume of fas used was recorded the normality of fas was calculated by using eq 28b 28a c o d v f a s f o r b l a n k t i t r a t i o n v f a s s a m p l e t i t r a t i o n n f a s 8000 t o t a l d i l u t i o n f a c t o r v s a m p l e 28b n o r m a l i t y o f f a s v p o t a s s i u m d i c h r o m a t e n p o t a s s i u m d i c h r o m a t e v f a s the total dissolved fe in the solution was measured through the analysis service in badan tenaga nuklir nasional batan using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas for preparation before aas analysis the sample was filtered using the whatman grade 42 filter paper 32 the total dissolved fe data from batan was multiplied with dilution factor of 10 the measured total dissolved fe was assumed that it represented the amount of total fez ions in the solution the appropriate z value was discussed in section 5 2 4 4 2 the weight loss in anode and mass measurement of floated sludge upon completing the ec process anode the sacrificial electrode was rinsed using distilled water and then dried within a temperature range of 105 110 c after which it was weighted similar to the explanation provided in section 4 3 the floated sludge was carefully and precisely taken using a plastic spoon from the surface of vinasse this was dried at a temperature range of 105 110 c and weighted 4 4 3 mass estimation of settled sludge the settled sludge mass was estimated using material balance as shown in eq 29a and the fe in total sludge sum of floated and settled sludge was estimated through eq 29b while the fe electrolytically produced was estimated with eq 29c in the vinasse the ratio of cod to total solid ts is close to one 4 33 since the ts is equal to sum of total dissolved solid tds and total suspended solid tss in other words the cod value was almost same with sum of total suspended solid tss and total dissolved solid tds it means that the vinasse dominantly contained organic pollutants the other pollutants which were inorganic materials not measured as cod were in little amount 5 hence this study assumed that the settled and floated sludge were formed mainly by the cod removal in vinasse and fe in total sludge 29a s e t t l e d s l u d g e m a s s r e m o v e d c o d m a s s

estimation the solution conductivity could be estimated using eq 30 34 since g 1 r r v i and k d a e eq 30 is modified to eq 31 meanwhile resistivity was estimated using eq 32 30 κ g k 31 κ 1 r d a e 32 ρ 1 κ 4 5 kinetic analysis the measured data during ec process were cod total dissolved fe in solution floated sludge and settled sludge at various times the adjustable parameters in model 1 and 2 were k a k e k f the ones in model 3 were k a k e k s while the ones in model 4 were k a k e α the values of these parameters were obtained through the minimization of sum of squares error sse the simultaneous ordinary differential equations were solved through ode15s and minimization of sse was through fminsearch with help of matlab software the sse was presented in eq 33 33 s s e i 1 n m e a s u r e d d a t a i p r e d i c t e d d a t a i m e a s u r e d d a t a i 2 furthermore curve fitting between the experimental data and calculated results was also conducted 5 results and discussions the ec was successfully conducted at voltage of 7 5 and 12 5 v this voltage difference had effects on the measured data such as current density ph temperature cod total dissolved fe and floated sludge during ec as presented in table 5 also the four proposed mechanistic models were applied to fit the measured data and the best one having the lowest sse value was compared with the empirical models mainly the first and second order kinetic models in fitting of the cod concentration during ec of vinasse furthermore the effect of charge loading on the cod removal efficiency was estimated the detailed results and discussions were presented in the section of 5 1 5 8 5 1 current density profile the change in current i during ec process of vinasse at voltage of 7 5 v and 12 5 v was recorded and shown in table 5 also the decrease in vinasse surface level x in ec reactor was measured and presented in table 5 the active surface of electrodes decreased due to the increase in x which was calculated per real time using the formula a e 2 l e x w e 2 l e x t e w e t e additionally the current density j was calculated using the formula i a e as shown in table 5 and the change in j as a function of time t is presented in fig 5 a based on the results the current density increased drastically at voltage of 12 5 v thus the higher the voltage the higher the current was supplied to solution thereby causing the production of fez ion in large amount the presence of these ions subsequently increased the solution conductivity thereby allowing the current to flow with ease however the current density increased slowly at 7 5 v leading to the generation of fez ion in low quantities also considering table 5 the solution conductivity at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v but the solution resistivity at 12 5 v was lower than that at 7 5 v 5 2 determining the z value during ec the anode fe was oxidized to be f e z ion based on the works of some authors 35 38 z was assigned 2 hence f e 2 ferrous was produced from oxidation of fe other authors 39 40 however assigned 3 to it resulting in f e 3 ferric to find the suitable z value the anode weight was measured before and after the process the weight after the process was also predicted using eq 17 with z 2 and 3 the value of b was obtained by making a plot between x m and t s as shown in fig 5 b where it at 7 5 and 12 5 v was 0 351 10 5 and 1 221 10 5 m s respectively then the anode weights after the process were 2 241 10 3 kg and 4 328 10 3 kg at 7 5 and 12 5 v respectively as shown in table 5 the error between measured and predicted anode weight loss at 7 5 and 12 5 v is shown in table 6 and also shows that z 2 was much better in predicting the anode weight loss than z 3 with error between 0 156 3 859 and 33 231 35 905 respectively therefore the f e 2 ferrous was generated through oxidation of iron during ec process and z 2 was used in the mechanistic model similarly lakshmanan et al 41 and sasson et al 42 arrived at the same conclusion that f e 2 was generated at the iron anode during ec not f e 3 the anode consumption at 12 5 v was 4 328 10 3 kg which was more than the 2 241 10 3 kg at 7 5 v this was due to the fact that higher voltage resulted in higher current density 5 3 temperature profile temperature of vinasse was measured per real time and profiled in table 5 it increased till the end which was caused by the continuous supply of current during process in addition the effect of increasing the temperature at 12 5 v was faster than that at 7 5 v energy was supplied in solution could be estimated through eq 34 34 q v i t therefore the higher the i and t the higher the q would be based on table 5 current value at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v relationship between q and δt is presented in eq 35 43 44 35 δ t q c p hence the higher the value of q the higher the increasing of temperature would be based on that increasing rate of temperature at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v 5 4 ph cod total dissolved fe profile based on the discussion in section 5 2 the appropriate value for z was 2 which resulted in the oxidation of iron into fe2 at the anode then the fe2 reacted with oh ion to form insoluble coagulant of fe oh 2 which adsorbed cod also the fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 and then hydrolyzed to be fe oh 3 45 46 however according to donneys victoria et al 47 the formation of fe3 and fe oh 3 occurs in ph range of 7 6 14 besides that the dissolved oxygen in solution could affect the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 as shown in eq 36 47 36 4 f e 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 8 o h 4 f e o h 3 however in this study the ph range was 6 0 7 7 as shown in table 5 and dissolved oxygen in the vinasse is very low 48 based on these conditions the dominant iron species in system during ec process might be fe2 and fe oh 2 furthermore the fe oh 2 formed was assumed to be settled and floated sludge completely hence total dissolved fe measured through aas was assumed as remaining total fe2 in solution during the ec the reduction of h2o resulted in the formation of oh ion and h2 gas at cathode however the oh was not completely involved in the formation of fe oh 2 and the excessive presence of oh increased the solution ph in this case the production of oh was higher than its consumption to produce coagulants based on the ph profile shown in table 5 the ph increased from 6 0 to 7 2 from the beginning to the end of the ec process at 7 5 v meanwhile at 12 5 v the ph increased from 6 0 to 7 7 at 0 to 2400 s then it was stable still at 7 7 from 2400 to 3000 s and finally decreased to 7 3 at 3600 s this decrease in ph is caused by two ways 1 the consumption rate of oh to produce hydroxo iron species fe oh 2 is higher than its production rate 46 49 and 2 the oh is consumed by the hydroxo iron species to produce anionic hydroxo iron species fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 45 46 50 51 the latter occurs at an alkaline ph because the fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 is formed at solution ph above 9 0 21 in this study the solution ph however decreased from 7 7 to 7 3 which was in the neutral range hence the decrease in ph was only as a result of the former this was consistent with the study of soeprijanto et al 49 in which the solution ph increased to7 43 and then decreased to 7 08 the amount of fe2 formed was a function of the current supplied to the solution hence voltage of 12 5 v produced larger amount of fe2 thereby producing more fe oh 2 and the cod mass removal was also higher than at voltage of 7 5 v as shown in table 5 thus the remaining total dissolved fe in solution at 12 5 v was lower than at 7 5 v as also shown in table 5 this means that more fe2 became coagulant at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v then in terms of ph the increasing rate of solution ph at 12 5 v was higher than at 7 5 v and the higher the ph the more fe2 became fe oh 2 at neutral ph gelatinous metal coagulant was released in large amount in solution 31 52 5 5 floated and settled sludge profile the floated sludge generated during the ec process is shown in table 5 and its appearance is shown in fig 6 a the production of floated sludge at 12 5 v was higher than at 7 5 v based on the explanation in section 5 4 h2 gas was produced by reduction of water at cathode and the amount produced depended on the current supplied to the system based on fig 5 a higher current density was supplied at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v therefore more h2 gas was produced at 12 5 v thereby allowing the pollutants to be easily separated by flotation at this higher voltage compared with 7 5 v the amount of hydrogen production was predicted using faraday s law as shown in eq 37 53 37 d n h 2 d t i f h j a e f h j 2 l e b t w e 2 l e b t t e w e t e f h the predicted production of h2 during ec of vinasse is shown in fig 5 c based on this more h2 gas was produced at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v the settled sludge produced was predicted using eq 29a and shown in fig 5 d then its appearance is shown in fig 6 b indicating more of settled sludge at 12 5 v than at 7 5 v as explanation in section 5 4 voltage of 12 5 resulted more coagulant of fe oh 2 than voltage 7 5 v the coagulant had correspondence to remove pollutants and then produced settled sludge 5 6 modeling the proposed mechanistic models were successfully applied to fit the measured data the fitting between the measured and predicted data obtained from the model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 is shown in figs 7 10 respectively the adjustable parameters in model 1 and model 2 are k a k e k f the ones in model 3 are k a k e k s while the ones in model 4 are k a k e α furthermore the kinetic parameters obtained from the four mechanistic models are presented in table 7 comparing the calculated results with the experimental data it was obvious that all the proposed models were suitable for describing the phenomena however model 2 mathematically and visually gave the best prediction this was due to its lower sse 0 1189 0 2289 compared with the others 0 1884 0 5792 these results showed that the mechanisms involved in pollutant removal in vinasse during ec process followed model 2 as shown in fig 2 the kinetic constant of b was obtained from fig 5 b representing the decreasing rate of vinasse surface level in other words the higher the b value the more the volume was removed voltage of 12 5 v 1 221 10 5 m s resulted the more value of b than voltage of 7 5 v 0 351 10 5 m s this was due to the high current density as well as the high temperature at 12 5 v in model 2 the k a presented the reaction rate of adsorption of cod on coagulants its value at 12 5 v was 3 64 10 5 m3 kg s but was 8 77 10 6 m3 kg s at 7 5 v as explanation in section 5 4 amount of coagulants fe oh 2 produced at the higher voltage was more leading to faster adsorption rate of cod compared with the lower voltage in addition the k e in this model presented the entrapment rate of cod in forming settled sludge it had a value of 1 84 10 4 s at 12 5 v but was 7 00 10 5 s at 7 5 v the fe2 reacted with oh to form coagulants which adsorbed the cod to form aggregates these in turn dragged the other cod to settle at the base together as settled sludge hence the more the aggregates in the system the easier the cod was entrapped more aggregates were formed at 12 5 v thereby resulting more settled sludge compared with 7 5 v finally the k f in this model presented the flotation rate during ec process with a value of 3 70 10 4 s at 12 5 v compared with 2 26 10 4 s at 7 5 v this was also caused by the higher current density at 12 5 v aiding the rapid formation of h2 which broke the settled sludge and pushed it to the surface as floated sludge 5 7 comparison between the mechanistic model 2 and the empirical models the first and second order kinetics which are the two most popular empirical models were also used to predict the cod concentration profile during ec the predicted cod data from the empirical models and the model 2 are shown in table 8 the plotting between the measured cod and predicted cod by these models is shown in fig 11 based on the results the first and second order kinetics gave good prediction with the almost same of mean absolute percentage error mape value which was 0 58 1 28 the mechanistic model 2 on the other hand had a mape value of 0 82 1 85 this value just obtained from cod concentration data the formula for calculating mape is shown in eq 38 despite the fact the cod profile predicted by the empirical models was more precise compared with that of mechanistic model 2 the latter was very acceptable due to its low mape which was still below 2 the maximum mape value in any modeling should not be more than 20 54 furthermore it could figure out detailed ec process with complete measured parameters including cod total fe floated sludge and settled sludge profile during ec process but the empirical models could not do that 38 m a p e 1 n i 1 n m e a s u r e d c o d i p r e d i c t e d c o d i m e a s u r e d c o d i 100 5 8 estimation of the effect of charge loading on cod removal efficiency in ec of vinasse the cod removal efficiency is mainly affected by the value of charge loading generally the charge loading shows the charges transferred in electrochemical reactions for a given amount of wastewater treated commonly it is calculated by eq 39 55 39 q i t v i n i t i a l j a e t v i n i t i a l in this section the results of many studies about ec of vinasse also is known as distillery spent wash including previous studies and this study were summarized to see the effect of the charge loading on the cod removal efficiency because of the difference of initial cod concentration in their experiment the eq 39 is modified to eq 40 by considering the initial cod concentration 40 q i t v i n i t i a l c c o d i n i t i a l j a e t v i n i t i a l c c o d i n i t i a l table 9 shows the summary of experimental data from ec of vinasse from previous studies 56 62 and this study for the purpose of simplifying the calculation an average current of 2 15 and 3 99 a was used for variable of 7 5 v and 12 5 v respectively the correlation between charge loading and cod removal efficiency is shown in fig 12 this showed that the increasing of charge loading from 0 to 18 105 c kg cod required increase in the cod removal efficiency from 0 to 92 5 however further increase in the charge loading reduced the cod removal efficiency it was noted that applying too high current was not good considering the fact it aided that excessive formation of hydrogen bubbles the coagulants fe oh 2 formed could easily be pushed to the surface of solution by the hydrogen bubbles before they adsorbed and entrapped the pollutants too high current could also increase the solution temperature thereby causing the re dissolution of the aggregates 63 the cod concentration of vinasse in this study could be reduced from 100 16 to 83 17 kg m3 but still higher than the target concentration suitable as a biogas feedstock which is around 75 kg m3 hence there is need to conduct research on the other parameters affecting the ec process so as to achieve the target cod concentration 6 conclusion this experiment research on ec of vinasse waste provided some information on the effect of voltage on current density temperature ph cod total dissolved fe floated and settled sludge during the process in addition the decrease in the working volume due to evaporation and reduction of water during ec was informed the four mechanistic models were proposed to simulate the ec process with the assumption that some mechanisms such as electrode dissolution adsorption entrapment sedimentation and flotation occurred in the system these proposed mechanistic models were successfully applied to fit the measured data with different sse values however model 2 had the lowest sse which means that cod removal mechanisms of this ec process for treating vinasse followed the model 2 in addition the kinetic constants in the model such as b decreasing rate of vinasse height level k a rate of adsorption k e rate of entrapment and k f rate of flotation at 12 5 v was higher than that at 7 5 v furthermore the model 2 was compared with the first and second order kinetic models and the predicted cod from these three models was almost similar with very low mape value below 2 however the model 2 was able to illustrate the cod removal mechanism in more details compared with the two empirical models the correlation between the charge loading and cod removal efficiency in ec of vinasse was also successfully predicted moreover there is need to conduct research on the other parameters affecting the cod removal from vinasse and then simulated using the model 2 so as to find the kinetic constant values important in
