8630,while ongoing climate change requires effective adaptation strategies decision making on the scale timing and location of adaptation measures remains challenging as the extent and pace of climate change is uncertain in particular uncertainty surrounds the success of mitigation strategies and economic and demographic developments while grey measures such as dikes and pumping have been the dominant form of adaptation in the past against inland flooding nature based solutions are receiving more attention however evidence on their cost effectiveness compared to grey alternatives is still limited in this article we develop a real options model that integrates climate change uncertainty as well as flexibility of the timing of investment we expect that the uncertainty falls over time due to an increase in climate data that becomes available to the decision maker the decision maker learns about climate change from two types of events inland flooding and meteorological drought the model is calibrated with data from the oldambt eemskanaal dollardboezem water system in the dutch province of groningen our results show the potential for nature based solutions to become a viable alternative to dike heightening and pumping in addressing both extreme events moreover we observe that the cost effectiveness of nature based solutions depends on the maturing time of the ecosystem the value of land on which the measure is being implemented and the type of information considered in the investment decision we show that maturing times of up to nine years make a nature based solution the preferred measure to invest in even under strong beliefs of severe climate change when maturing times exceed nine years the option takes too long to become effective and pumping is preferred furthermore our results show that an increase in the value of land on which a nature based solution is being constructed may substantially reduce its cost effectiveness finally decision making flexibility becomes valuable if expected damages from floods and droughts are sufficiently low and the decision maker learns quickly about climate change jel classification d81 h54 q54 keywords nature based solutions drought flood real options analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recent decades have seen a change in the scale and frequency of extreme precipitation events including inland floods and meteorological droughts 1 being among the most expensive natural disasters today 2 inland floods are expected to further increase in frequency and severity due to climate change 3 4 dramatic examples are the 2021 flood events in western europe that have claimed more than 180 lives in germany alone and caused billions of euros of flood damages 1 1 https www bundesregierung de in addition to flooding water scarcity is identified as a key risk in europe in the recent ipcc wgii 6th assessment report drought risk has expanded from southern to western central europe and is expected to intensify with higher global warming levels 5 6 for example the drought of 2018 in the netherlands has resulted in up to 2 billion of drought related damages 7 as global warming is expected to continue largely unabated effective climate change adaptation strategies are required to address both inland flood and meteorological drought risks 8 however decision making on the scale timing and location of adaptation measures remains challenging as the extent and pace of climate change is still uncertain 9 uncertainty stems from epistemic and knowledge uncertainties regarding the success of mitigation strategies economic and demographic developments various adaptation measures are available to reduce water related risks so far the dominant form of climate change adaptation have been grey measures for example the construction of dikes aims at reducing future coastal and inland flood risks 10 yet recent years have seen an increase in the implementation of green adaptation measures such as nature based solutions nbs as an alternative nbs integrate natural and ecosystem dynamics into their design in order to increase the coping potential of landscapes and urban areas with emerging environmental economic and societal challenges furthermore they are able to simultaneously provide benefits to both society and nature 11 13 the implementation of nbs has received increasing academic attention 14 a growing body of evidence shows positive ecological outcomes of nbs such as an increase in biodiversity 15 and their inherent potential to successfully adapt to changing environmental conditions 16 in contrast the small but growing literature on the cost effectiveness of nbs to address inland flood risk relative to grey alternatives show mixed results for example 17 and 18 show that storm water retention areas may turn out to be cost effective in contrast 19 find that only after careful spatial planning may the implementation of nature based flood risk management become cost effective even if implementation costs initially exceed the amount of expected avoided flood damages in our study we measure cost effectiveness as the costs of adaptation measures that are to be taken to reach a legal flood and or drought safety standard the small number of studies on the cost effectiveness of nbs particularly when compared to grey alternatives has been identified as a major research gap for the evaluation and successful implementation of nature based adaptation measures 20 22 and has been regarded as a significant challenge for their widespread use 13 23 24 in this paper we therefore compare the cost effectiveness of nbs to grey measures that address both inland flood and meteorological drought risk we investigate the implementation of flood and drought risk adaptation measures by a local water authority in the oldambt eemskanaal dollardboezem oed water system in the dutch province of groningen as the decision maker 25 the local water authority may decide to invest in the implementation of retention areas where former wetland and peat land ecosystems are revitalised in order to alleviate inland flood risk retention areas may either retain flood waters within the catchment area or create additional space for water storage in the floodplain 26 28 retention areas that integrate wetland and peat land ecosystems provide effective protection against inland floods and meteorological droughts through their ability to enhance water storage to reduce surface runoff to slow down water flow or to secure water supplies as well as to increase the water percolation capacity of soils 29 31 alternatively the decision maker may prefer to invest in one of two grey measures namely selectively heightening the dikes around economically valuable locations or to increase the pumping capacity of sea pumps however although the netherlands have invested billions of euros into coastal and inland flood protection measures in recent years 32 33 grey measures alone may not provide sufficient protection of the northeastern area of the oed against low frequency high impact flood events furthermore a recent increase in the frequency and scale of exceptionally dry summers have raised attention for the potential effectiveness of retention areas to reduce drought impacts to address future drought risk the local water authority has the additional option to invest in retention areas that have an integrated reservoir during summer this measure is able to address both inland flooding and meteorological drought risk the decision maker will invest in the measure with the lowest present value of all future costs the local water authority faces uncertainties about the scale and frequency of extreme precipitation events in the oed which may lead to under or over adaptation to flood and drought risk learning about future climate change has shown to raise awareness of climate impacts among decision makers thereby fostering the successful uptake of adaptation measures 34 to delay investment or to invest partially now and retain the option to invest further in the future may be valuable if the decision maker is uncertain about future climate change but expects uncertainty to decrease for example due to advancements in climate forecasting and observation of weather data 35 37 the decision to defer investment is optimal as long as the present value of cost savings is less than the required capital expenditure plus the value of the delay option that is destroyed when we invest 38 39 observe that overall investment costs of nbs can be substantially lowered if the decision maker is able to learn about climate change the value of the deferral option increases with the speed of learning as the period needed to receive new information about climate change is short however only a limited number of studies have explicitly integrated flexibility and climate change uncertainty into investment decision making of adaptation measures these studies include the application of the adaptation pathway approach 40 41 robust decision making 42 or real options analysis roa 38 43 44 while the approach of adaptation pathways allows for the inclusion of adaptive capacity and future options are kept open in economic analysis its application becomes challenging if multiple risks act together and if thresholds are difficult to identify where probabilistic information is lacking i e under deep uncertainty robust decision making has been recommended the approach is able to identify robust strategies today i e strategies that perform well over a large number of scenarios however it requires a large amount of quantitative information computing power and expert resources instead we apply a roa approach which has become an established tool to evaluate investment decisions of adaptation measures under uncertainty and learning 37 45 46 in contrast to adaptation pathways and robust decision making roa allows decision makers to quantify the benefits of decision making flexibility under uncertainty including decision making flexibility helps us to improve decision making about the timing and scale of the implementation of adaptation measures flexibility becomes valuable when we expect to receive updated climate information in the future 38 the ability to defer investment and to learn about climate change may turn out to be a valuable benefit to investment planning if the speed of learning about climate change is fast 47 furthermore investing in a small measure now and keeping the option open for potential future investment to scale up an adaptation measure may become beneficial for the decision maker rather than designing the measure to respond to current impacts or near term risks we apply a modified quadrinomial lattice model where new observations of inland flooding and meteorological drought events allow for gradual learning using a bayesian updating process 38 initially decision makers are uncertain about the climate change scenario they need to adapt to gradually though they reduce this uncertainty by observing the frequency of inland floods and meteorological drought events decision makers can update their climate change beliefs roa is especially useful for analysing major investment decisions in light of an existing adaptation deficit i e sunk costs and potential future lock ins furthermore roa can be applied when those investment decisions are irreversible and uncertainty is expected to be partially resolved through waiting for new information on the success of investment 47 as nbs require time for the proper provision of flood and drought safety wetland and peat land ecosystems need time to develop 48 nbs are frequently perceived as more risky by practitioners and the public especially during the first years following their implementation 49 in contrast grey measures such as dike heightening can address flood risks effectively right after completion yet they fail to provide other co benefits such as a reduction of drought related damages as a result enhanced insights into the cost effectiveness of nbs could facilitate their implementation 50 we contribute to the literature on nbs by first comparing the cost effectiveness of nbs to that of grey alternatives in a riverine landscape grey measures include the selective heightening of dikes that protect the main locations of economic activity as well as an increase in the discharge capacity of two sea pumps that regulate the water levels in our study area nbs consist of measures with and without an integrated reservoir a reservoir is integrated in order to mitigate drought risk while simultaneously protecting against inland flooding we explicitly take climate uncertainty as well as project flexibility into account the second contribution of the paper is the analysis of the conditions under which nbs become cost effective besides avoided flood damages which has been assessed in the existing literature 19 51 we investigate how the following factors determine the cost effectiveness of a nbs 1 its maturing time the time that integrated wetland and peat land ecosystems need to develop to provide proper flood protection 2 its ability to address multiple types of weather extremes or the amount of information that a decision maker has on inland flooding and meteorological droughts and 3 the value of property on which a nbs is being constructed regarding the maturing time of a nbs integrated ecosystems require a certain time before flood or drought risks are effectively lowered the restoration of formerly degraded wet and peat lands leads to an improvement in downstream flood safety within one to four years by reducing river peak discharges and flow velocity 48 52 next nbs are able to simultaneously address inland flood and meteorological drought risk while adaptation primarily addresses flood risk water scarcity is expected to intensify with higher global warming levels however analyses including multiple sources of climate related risks remain limited 53 55 we find that the decision maker prefers nbs over grey alternatives this is because nbs are able to perform better in reducing drought risk by increasing the water retention and flow capacity of wetlands and floodplains along with the restoration and enhancement of ecosystem services furthermore nbs have been shown to promote socio economic development 54 finally the value of land on which a nbs is being constructed may become a crucial factor in determining its cost effectiveness depending on the underlying land use and the size of the adaptation measure investing may be less attractive if property values are high 19 in this paper we find that the nbs with large land requirements such as a retention area with integrated reservoir becomes unattractive to invest in if property prices are high this is because the local water authority needs to purchase the land on which such measures are being constructed instead the decision maker prefers to invest in a measure that solely addresses inland flood risk as the expected damages from droughts are still smaller than the higher property prices the paper proceeds as follows section 2 gives a detailed description of the real options model that we apply as well as our study area 2 2 we introduce project flexibility in our appendix c an overview on the data requirements and model calibration is provided in section 3 the results of the study are presented in section 4 in section 5 we discuss our findings and implications to policy making while section 6 provides a conclusion 2 real options model we implement a real options roa model with an integrated bayesian updating process to allow for future learning about climate change uncertainties during investment decision making a real option is the right but not the obligation to adapt projects to changing conditions in the future or to wait with their implementation until uncertainty is partially resolved while uncertainty will never be fully resolved waiting for updated information over time will increase the knowledge on climate change impacts our roa model includes a decrease in uncertainty by assuming there are multiple climate change regimes with a different distribution of inland flood and meteorological drought events the decision maker does not know the exact climate regime but she reduces uncertainty by updating her beliefs through observing the frequency of occurring inland floods and meteorological droughts the decision maker will increase the probability she assigns to a severe climate change regime and lower the probability she assigns to a benign climate change regime if she frequently observes inland floods and or meteorological droughts as a result the perceived probability of a climate change regime fluctuates with the number of observed extreme precipitation events which is the source of volatility in the investment payoff 38 if the decision maker observes an inland flood or meteorological drought the probability she attaches to the severe climate change regime increases which as a result raises the expected investment payoff if she fails to observe an extreme event she lowers her beliefs which decreases expected investment payoff this variation in probability of extreme weather events is different from the majority of approaches that integrate investment flexibility which assume a constant probability our model is an expansion and an application of the roa model introduced by 38 we expand the model to incorporate two types of risk namely inland flood and meteorological drought risk additionally we apply the model to a real world case where the local water authority chooses to invest in a nbs selective dike heightening or an increase in pumping capacity those measures differ in their effectiveness to reduce the flood and drought damages in the area damage costs are incurred each time an inland flood and or meteorological drought event occurs as the decision maker is initially uncertain about the severity of future climate change she is also uncertain about the scale and timing of the required adaptation measure however she anticipates the acquisition of updated information about the severity of climate change in the future when making her investment decision the decision maker chooses the option with the lowest expected present value of costs following the established literature 36 39 we build and solve the model in three consecutive steps in section 2 1 we construct the quadrinomial lattice for the stochastic process that the uncertain parameters i e the number of inland floods and meteorological droughts follows over time over time the decision maker observes the number of floods and droughts to update her beliefs about whether a severe climate change scenario applies next section 2 2 provides the specification of six adaptation options that the local water authority considers to implement in order to address flood and drought risks in the oed the landscape is predominantly rural and characterised by small rivers and streams finally we formulate the optimisation objective of selecting the investment option with the lowest expected present value of costs taking future information gains of climate change into account this is followed by solving the model through backward induction section 2 3 we apply our model to a case in the netherlands where flood events in the provinces of groningen and drenthe in 1998 triggered the implementation of large scale flood risk management measures fig 1 although the local water authority prefers the implementation of retention areas expected increases in the scale and frequency of inland floods and meteorological droughts by 2100 requires the evaluation of alternative strategies such strategies need to able to provide immediate flood protection such as selectively rising dikes and increasing pumping capacity 25 56 2 1 specification of the quadrinomial lattice 2 1 1 conditional probabilities in roa uncertainty is included by specifying the probabilities of several outcomes and choosing those policies that maximise a project s expected value of net benefits typical assumptions of studies that apply roa are that the decision maker knows with certainty the model s underlying parameters and the stochastic process that determines future outcomes only random events that occur in the future are unknown for example 39 observe that incorporating learning about future climate change into the model decreases overall investment costs of climate change adaptation measures they derive the underlying distribution from the ukcp09 climate change data alternatively climate change uncertain may be modelled using continuous time stochastic processes such as geometric brownian motion for example 57 show that integrating future learning into the model reduces adaptation costs considerably compared to a situation where no learning and adaptation occur in contrast to our model the two studies assume a constant volatility of the state variable over time which greatly simplifies the analysis however this assumption does not apply in a world where we observe the actual weather to learn about the state of climate change therefore we implement a bayesian updating process to derive probabilities for the benign and the severe climate change scenario we use the observations of extreme precipitation events number of droughts and or floods as our stochastic exogenous state variable and the source of the option value whose volatility is allowed to change over time furthermore and in contrast to previous studies that apply roa our study allows for uncertainty about the model s underlying parameters we assume that there are two possible climate regimes or states of the world that is the climate can either be in state l the low damage cost ldc or benign scenario or in state h the hdc or severe scenario extreme weather events such as inland floods and meteorological droughts may occur in both states however in the ldc scenario such an event is less likely than in the hdc scenario let p l and p h be the annual inland flood probabilities i e return periods in the ldc and in the hdc scenario respectively and p l p h similarly let q l q h be the annual meteorological drought probabilities in the ldc and in the hdc scenario respectively and q l q h the decision maker holds an initial belief to be in the hdc scenario denoted by α 0 she makes two observations in each period first whether there is a drought or not second whether there is a flood or not in the current period 3 3 note that for our ultimate posterior belief it is irrelevant in which order the events occur for example suppose we have observed both a flood and a drought in the current year we can show that our posterior belief is independent of whether the flood or the drought occurs first in other words we know that the sequence of events does not matter for our posterior belief it is this feature that allows us to simply count the number of flood and drought years in a given number of years a sequence no flood drought gives the same posterior as drought no flood we update this probability each period after observing whether or not a flood and or drought has occurred in that period that is the decision maker updates her beliefs about being in the hdc scenario based on the number of inland floods and meteorological droughts she observes in each period therefore the true regime does not change in our model as time passes but the probabilities that we attach to each regime change over time according to bayes s law 38 we construct a quadrinomial lattice along which the beliefs about the climate regime evolve see fig 2 for a schematic example for two periods t 1 and t 2 each node represents a potential climate change belief that is an expected number of extreme precipitation events for different climate futures the colours indicate the number of inland flood years i and meteorological drought years j 4 4 we say flood and drought years since there may be an issue with having more than one flood or drought a year we allow for it but count it as one flood and one drought light green indicates being on a benign climate path with few or no extreme precipitation events in contrast dark grey indicates a frequent occurrence thereof node i j t corresponds to a period t when an inland flood event has occurred in i periods and a meteorological drought event has occurred in j periods of all periods 1 t therefore we simply count the occurrence of each event and we write the posterior belief after t years as α i j t where i counts the number flood years and j counts the number of drought years after t periods we have t 1 2 possible states of beliefs i e nodes of the tree that can be reached let α i j t denote the conditional probability that the hdc scenario applies if a flood and a drought occur in the next period we use bayes s law to update the probability that the hdc scenario applies and we have α i 1 j 1 t 1 if neither of these two events occurs in the next period the updated probability equals α i j t 1 when in the next period a drought occurs but no flood the probability that the hdc scenario applies becomes α i j 1 t 1 finally when we observe a flood event in the next period but no drought the probability that the hdc scenario applies becomes α i 1 j t 1 in order to derive a general formula for α i j t note that the odds of a posterior belief are the product of the odds of the prior belief and the ratio of the conditional probabilities of the event 5 5 for example if a flood and a drought occur in the first period we have α 1 f d 1 α 1 f d α 0 1 α 0 p h p l q h q l that is in each period if a flood and a drought occur the odds that we are in the hdc scenario increase by a factor p h p l q h q l and decrease by 1 p h 1 p l 1 q h 1 q l each time a flood and a drought do not occur if we believe that the hdc scenario applies with initial conditional probability of α 0 and if i and j of the next t periods witness a flood or drought respectively we will have revised this probability to the number α i j t defined implicitly according to bayes s law by 1 α i j t 1 1 1 α 0 1 α 0 p h p l i 1 p h 1 p l t i q h q l j 1 q h 1 q l t j if the decision maker observes a flood and or a drought in period t the probability that the hdc scenario applies increases and we move upwards on the lattice the belief that the hdc scenario applies falls if the decision maker observes a year without any extreme event leading us to move down the lattice our decision tree has decision points in every year 2 1 2 subjective probabilities given conditional probability α i j t we build a quadrinomial lattice for the perceived probability that inland flood or meteorological drought events occur next period i e subjective flood and drought probabilities p i j t and q i j t respectively the subjective probabilities i e the beliefs acquired at t of observing a flood or a drought in period t 1 are respectively 2 p i j t α i j t p h 1 α i j t p l and 3 q i j t α i j t q h 1 α i j t q l our assumptions that p l p h and q l q h imply that each period where both events occur we increase the probability attached to the hdc scenario and the flood and drought probabilities rise each period that both events do not occur we decrease the probability attached to the hdc scenario and the flood and drought probabilities decrease thus p i j t and q i j t are the stochastic exogenous state variables that are the source of option value in this model if we observe floods and droughts occurring with a relatively high frequency then p i j t and q i j t will approach p h and q h the actual return periods respectively in contrast if we observe them occurring with a rather low frequency then p i j t and q i j t will approach p l and q l respectively as time passes more information on future climate change is acquired thereby decreasing the volatility of the flood and drought probabilities 38 2 2 specification of the adaptation options adaptation measures are required to protect the oed against inland floods with a return period of 1 in 100 years in rural areas and of 1 in 1000 years in densely populated urban areas 58 6 6 a flood or drought return period is a flood or drought safety standard defined by the dutch government as the average time or an estimated average time between flood and drought events in our study flood return periods range between 1 in 100 years 1 annual exceedance probability and 1 in 1000 years 0 1 annual exceedance probability return periods for droughts have not been defined inland flood events occur primarily between october and march while meteorological droughts occur in the drier months between april and september therefore our numerical analysis differentiates between expected flood damages of a 1 in a 100 year flood event and a 1 in a 1000 year flood event with corresponding subjective flood probabilities denoted by p 100 i j t and p 1000 i j t respectively our six adaptation measures differ in their capabilities to partially protect against such flood events besides floods the last decade has seen an increase in the number of droughts in the study area so far drought related damages have been mitigated by diverting water from the ijsselmeer a large freshwater body 100 km to the west of our study area into the oed water system however an increase in the number of drought events is expected to require the implementation of additional measures in order to reduce drought related damages 59 one of such measures is the construction of a nbs with an integrated reservoir which stores water during the summer months the decision maker chooses the option with the lowest expected present value of costs denoted by c i j t each of these options comprises a separate project state with its own quadrinomial lattice we introduce b for baseline h for selective dike heightening p u for increasing pumping capacity n for the nbs without an integrated reservoir in summer n r for the nbs with an integrated reservoir which can release water during the summer months and n f for the small flexible nbs as long as state b prevails options h p u n n r and n f can be chosen once one of these options is implemented no further choices are to be made we discount all expected cash flows using the constant discount rate r in our initial state b one has not invested in flood protection yet but keeps the option open to invest in the future at each terminal node i j t of the quadrinomial lattice the decision maker chooses one of the following six options 1 maintaining dikes baseline dikes are already in place along streams and rivers of the oed however they need to be maintained and repaired existing dikes provide protection against inland flood events of a 1 in 100 year return period each occurrence of an inland flood or a meteorological drought event causes society to incur event related costs of f b and d b respectively where b stands for baseline there are no investment costs associated with the baseline while ongoing maintenance costs are m b without learning about future climate change i e under current beliefs about flood and drought probabilities maintaining the dikes must be sufficient to meet a predefined legal safety standard but it may not be optimal beliefs may change in the future which makes simple dike maintenance insufficient the expected event related costs in period t equal p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b if we decide to simply strengthen repair existing dikes in every future period the expected present value of costs at each node is 4 c i j t b p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b r c i j t b consists of costs incurred in year 0 as well as the discounted expected costs under an infinite time horizon postponing the decision to invest until new information about future climate change becomes available entails that the local water authority will not implement further climate change adaptation measures in a given period 2 selective dike heightening alternatively the decision maker may prefer to selectively heighten river dikes in order to provide protection against inland flood events with a 1 in 1000 year return period protected areas lie predominantly around the city of groningen where a large amount of economic activity takes place the remaining river dikes will not be heightened and effectively protect solely against a 1 in a 100 year inland flood event 25 selective dike heightening requires capital expenditure i h causing event related costs to fall to p 1000 i j t f h q i j t d h m h at each node where superscripts h and b stand for heightening and baseline respectively we assume that dike heightening takes one period such that enhanced flood protection is realised from period t 1 onward the expected present value of all future costs after investing in dike heightening in period t therefore consists of the expected baseline damage costs in period t 5 c i j t h p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b i h p 1000 i j t f h q i j t d h m h r 3 increasing pumping capacity the decision maker may also decide to increase pumping capacity in order to prevent water levels related to a 1 in a 1000 year inland flood event increasing pumping capacity requires investment costs of i p u and decreases event related costs to p 1000 i j t f p u q i j t d p u m p u at each node we assume that installing larger pumps takes one period such that enhanced flood protection is realised from period t 1 onward the expected present value of all future costs after investing in large pumps in period t therefore consists of the expected baseline

retention areas without an integrated reservoir during the summer months offers protection against extreme events with a probability of 1 in 1000 per year the nbs is used solely to retain water during an extreme weather event while the water is being gradually released to the streams and rivers immediately thereafter the size of the retention areas varies between 330 ha and 690 ha with a total wetland area of 1 820 ha water storage capacity of the nbs varies between 4 1 million m 3 and 8 2 million m 3 with a total storage capacity of 25 million m 3 25 if we decide to implement the nbs without integrated reservoir function in summer n b s n capital expenditures are i n event related costs fall subsequently to p 1000 i j t f n q i j t d n m n at each node we assume that constructing the nbs will take t years to mature the expected present value of all future costs after investing in the nbs therefore equals 7 c i j t n i n κ t 1 κ 1 κ t p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b p 1000 i j

is no further flexibility and eqs 5 8 as well as the flexible nbs apply 2 3 optimisation objective and backward induction our objective is to minimise the expected present value of all future costs

solving the optimisation problem through backward induction to identify the cost effective climate adaptation measure 7 7 we thank g guthrie for providing the mathematica code from 38 that inspired our own coding we evaluate our options over a time span of 85 years which corresponds to the time span of projections of daily precipitation between 2016 2100 see chapter 3 1 we measure cost effectiveness as the costs of adaptation measures that are to be taken to reach a legal flood and or drought safety standard we use a risk free discount rate of 1 6 recommended by the dutch ministry of finance for projects characterised by fixed and sunk costs 60 to calculate expected present value of costs of each of the six options considered in this study 8 8 in a sensitivity analysis we increase the discount rate to 2 a value recommended by the dutch government as a higher bound for cost benefit analyses on projects that are characterised by fixed and a sunk cost 60 we compare the results to a situation where the discount rate is decreased to 1 2 the lower bound recommended by the dutch ministry of finance see appendix d 3 data the following section describes the data required in order to calibrate the model first in section 3 1 we derive the return periods of inland floods and meteorological droughts section 3 2 describes the estimations of flood and drought damages as well as investment maintenance and operation costs of each of our six climate change adaptation measures 3 1 climate data inland flood events in order to estimate the effects of climate change on the oed we use projections of daily precipitation over a period of 85 years 2016 2100 for 15 weather stations that are located in our study area these projections correspond to the dutch knmi 14 g l and w h climate change scenarios and represent the ldc and hdc scenarios in our study respectively the knmi 14 climate scenarios estimate the potential range of future climate change for the netherlands according to the ipcc 61 the climate scenarios differ in the amount of global temperature increase and potential changes in air circulation patterns we thank knmi for their kind provision of the projected precipitation data 9 9 we thank knmi for their kind provision of the projected precipitation data a detailed description of the scenarios is provided in 62 the six adaptation measures considered in this study are designed to protect the oed against inland flood events of a 1 in a 100 year and or a 1 in a 1000 year return period inland floods in the oed predominantly occur if northwesterly storms reduce the discharge capacity of the two sea pumps and major precipitation events take place simultaneously in the region inland flood events with a return period of 1 in 100 years occur when water levels in the oed exceed 1 25 m above mean sea level this corresponds to 1 total precipitation amounts exceeding 53 mm over a four day period at each of the fifteen weather stations and 2 discharge capacities of the two sea pumps being reduced for at least four days a 1 in a 1000 year flood event occurs when 1 total precipitation amounts exceed 70 mm over a four day period at each of the fifteen weather stations in our study area and 2 discharge capacities of the two sea pumps are reduced for at least four days this in turn corresponds to a water level of 1 50 m above mean sea level in our study area future changes in discharge capacity of the two sea pumps is driven by sea level rise and the frequency and severity of north westerly storms however we lack data on regional projections of such storms still past observations have shown a positive correlation between major precipitation events and such storms 58 we therefore assume that future precipitation events exceeding the respective precipitation thresholds of 53 mm and 70 mm are accompanied by at least four days of reduced discharge capacities of the two sea pumps 58 meteorological drought events next we calculate the return periods of meteorological droughts according to the knmi we use the maximum potential precipitation deficit as a measure for meteorological drought 10 10 see https www knmi nl kennis en datacentrum uitleg droogte for a description of how meteorological droughts are being determined in the netherlands in dutch the annual potential precipitation deficit is defined as the annual sum of daily differences in precipitation and potential evaporation and is calculated as 11 δ t s d 1 t p d s e v d s where δ is the potential precipitation deficit mm p is the amount of precipitation mm and e v is the amount of potential evaporation mm the subscripts t d and s stand for year day and weather station respectively a meteorological drought occurs if the annual potential precipitation deficit exceeds a value of 230 mm the threshold corresponds to the maximum amount of potential precipitation deficit that is exceeded once every ten years 62 over the 85 year period that our model covers until 2100 the incidence of such an event is expected to increase by 3 5 in the g l and by 40 in the w h knmi 14 climate scenarios we acquired projected daily evaporation for fourteen weather stations four of which are located in or close to the oed 11 11 projected values of daily potential precipitation deficit can be accessed under https www knmi nl nederland nu knmi14 klimaatscenarios transformatieprogramma we assume that a drought occurs in the oed if summer precipitation falls short of 230 mm at least at three of the four weather stations we expect fourteen 1 in 100 year inland flood events to occur over an 85 year period in the ldc scenario in the hdc scenario twenty two 1 in 100 year inland flood events are projected to take place additionally we expect five 1 in 1000 year inland flood events to take place in the ldc scenario and eleven such events in the hdc scenario table a1 in appendix a summarises the return periods for floods and droughts for each climate change scenario finally we project four meteorological drought events to occur in the hdc scenario and none in the ldc scenario 3 2 economic data 3 2 1 flood damages we have used expected inland flood damages in the oed from 56 who derived inland flood damages using the hydrological so called bakjes model developed by 63 the model derives the inundation depth of an inland flood by estimating the amount of water entering an area and the topography of the flood plain in a first step the authors used topographic maps and the ahn actueel hoogtebestand nederland digital elevation model with a resolution of 100 100 m to identify dike rings flooding zones and dike segments that are most likely to fail during a flood event the model identifies the weakest dike segment or point of failure as the lowest point of the flood plain behind a dike ring where flood damages are expected to be highest next the bakjes model was used to estimate the volume of water that enters a dike ring the water volume depends on the size of the catchment the location of the point of failure of the dike ring and the ground level of the adjacent flood zone and the topography of the dike ring expected soil subsidence due to local gas and salt extraction as well as peat oxidation have been included subsequently 56 used the estimates of the water volume to derive water levels in each dike ring by deriving water level volume curves the final output of the bakjes model was the inundation depth of a flood event across the dike rings for a given water level and topographic profile 12 12 56 used a water level related to a 1 in a 100 year inland flood event they expect a similar water level for a flood with a 1 in a 1000 year return period if retention areas are activated finally flood damages were derived using the his ssm model flood information system damages and casualties model the gis based module uses inundation depth as inputs which was derived by the bakjes model as well as the type of land use in each dike ring in order to derive damage functions for various land use types and infrastructure categories including agriculture pumping stations transportation and railway lines gas and drinking water pipes communication systems companies as well as damages to low rise medium rise and high rise buildings the his ssm model has been applied in academic studies of investment decision making under flood risk 64 to assess the effect of damage reducing flood risk management measures 65 to derive probabilistic preventive evacuation criteria 66 and to evaluate location specific robust insurance policies 67 for more details on the flood damage module see 68 we assume that an inland flood will affect all assets located in a dike ring but that the number of affected dike rings differs by the implemented measure the dike rings are regional or secondary defences that protect the land against inland water from canals smaller rivers and lakes 56 included expected economic developments in their estimates of expected flood damages for 2025 and 2050 based on these estimates we derive an annual average economic growth rate of 0 88 for the oed flood damages that occur if one of our six options is in place are shown in table 1 column 2 fig 3 maps the dike rings that are affected by a flood for each adaptation measure table a2 in appendix a lists the dike rings that are affected by flooding depending on the implemented measure 3 2 2 drought damages we calculate drought damages in our study area by using results that were published in the climate damage estimator report 2020 klimaatschadeschatter rapportage 2020 by the national knowledge and innovation program climate and water 59 13 13 the climate damage estimations underlying the report were developed by the nkwk as a response to the severe 2018 and 2019 meteorological droughts to help gain insights into future climate damages in dutch municipalities and provinces the applied method waterwijzer landbouw determines the effect of changing hydrological variables precipitation and evapotranspiration among others on agricultural production due to climate change or water management our ldc scenario corresponds to the nkwk s current climate with irrigation scenario it assumes that agricultural land use activities will not change until 2050 in contrast the nkwk s warm without irrigation scenario which corresponds to our hdc scenario anticipates a 3 decline in agricultural activities during that period detailed information is available under https media deltares nl deltascenarios deltascenarios actualisering2017 hoofdrapport pdf table 1 column 3 shows the expected drought damages that occur for each of the six options currently the local water authority diverts 65 million m 3 water from the ijsselmeer towards the oldambt eemskanaal dollardboezem water system during extended drought periods this amount is supposed to be sufficient in the ldc scenario in contrast the hdc scenario is assumed to require additional measures to mitigate expected drought damages as water levels in the ijsselmeer are expected to be too low to pump sufficient water into our study area using retention areas as a water reservoir during the dryer summer months instead can provide 47 million m 3 of water or 71 of the water volume normally derived from the ijsselmeer we therefore assume a 71 reduction of drought related damages to 508 million if retention areas are being used as reservoirs 59 3 2 3 investment maintenance and operation costs investment maintenance and operation costs of each of the six options were provided by the regional water authority 25 investment costs are incurred once at the beginning of the project while maintenance and operation costs are incurred annually table 1 columns 4 and 5 investment costs for the n b s r are calculated as the investment costs of the n b s n plus the land bought from the farmers within the nbs using a land price of 6 m 2 investment and maintenance costs comprise total costs across the whole size of wetlands in our study area for both types of nbs 14 14 accessible under https edepot wur nl 446327 maintenance costs include the expenses of diverting water from the ijsselmeer into the oed 15 15 see https www hunzeenaas nl wat we doen voldoende water droogte and https www veld post nl artikel 144899 extreem zomerweer kost hunze en aas bijna vijf ton as well as compensation paid to the farmers by the local water authority if retention areas are flooded as land use functions will not be substantially changed in most water retention areas the local water board compensates farmers and municipalities for flood damages to crop yields and infrastructure following the activation of those retention areas regarding wetland maintenance local water authorities predominantly manage the density of trees and shrubs to create channels where water can flow freely across the floodplain 25 4 results in the following subsections we present the results of our analysis a detailed description of the results of changes in the discount rate can be found in appendix d in section 4 1 we analyse the sensitivity of our results to changes in the maturing time of the retention areas as a form of nbs various studies have shown that wetland and peat land ecosystems integrated into retention areas require one to nine years of development to provide proper flood protection 48 52 69 if no complementary measures are being taken a longer maturing time may translate into higher expected flood damages in section 4 2 we investigate how the cost effective investment option may change if the decision maker observes the number of flood events over time while ignoring the occurrence of meteorological droughts various studies on retention areas have highlighted their ability to provide a wide range of co benefits for example addressing both flood and drought risk simultaneously 2 53 however the large majority of assessments of the cost effectiveness of retention areas takes floods as the sole weather related risk into account 39 70 finally in section 4 3 we analyse the effects of an increase in property values on the cost effectiveness of the nbs namely if the price of land increases due to the option to develop the land for residential or commercial use 19 show how the value of land can affect the cost effectiveness of a nbs the authors find that the costs of preserving an area that would have otherwise been developed are higher than the benefits of reduced flood damage however designating the land for water retention purposes might be cost effective only if high benefit low cost parcels are being preserved 4 1 results of the real options model fig 4 a plots the expected present values of costs for the cost effective investment options if the decision maker is initially uncertain which climate change scenario will hold i e assuming α 0 0 5 at maturing times of one to seven years a retention area with an integrated reservoir n b s r is the cost effective option to the left of the vertical grey line in fig 4 a at higher maturing times increasing pumping capacity becomes most attractive to invest in fig 4 c shows the expected present value of costs for the cost effective investment options if the beliefs of the decision maker evolve over time and the maturing time of the nbs is fixed at three years we observe that under a low belief in the hdc α 0 lies between 0 and 0 3 the n b s n becomes the cost effective option to invest in if the beliefs in the hdc increase the decision maker switches to the n b s r this is because drought risk becomes prominent in the hdc and the decision maker decides to install a reservoir and use it during the summer table a3 in appendix b presents our results if we change both the maturing time and α 0 if initial beliefs that the hdc applies range between 0 and 20 and maturing times lie between one and six years a retention area without an integrated reservoir n b s n becomes cost effective as drought damages are projected to be negligible the additional costs of using the nbs as a reservoir in summer outweigh its benefits of providing additional water for irrigation purposes in the future furthermore as flood damages are expected to be substantial in the ldc scenario as well increased pumping capacity becomes cost effective if its maturing time of the n b s n exceeds six years if the belief that the hdc scenario applies exceeds 20 and maturing times range between one and nine years the n b s r becomes the cost effective option we observe that the threshold value for the maturing time of the n b s r increases with an increase in the belief that the hdc scenario applies this is because the n b s r has the potential to substantially reduce expected flood and drought damages a feature that the alternative options lack our results reflect those reported by 38 who has shown in his model that the cost effectiveness of an adaptation measure depends on the beliefs of the decision maker that a specific climate change scenario applies the options of selective dike heightening and deferring investment fail to become cost effective in any situation selective dike heightening in particular fails to become cost effective due to its high expected flood damages compared to retention areas and increased pumping capacity the measure protects dike rings of high economic significance against 1 1000 flood events while the majority of the study area remains exposed to such extreme flood events additionally selective dike heightening fails to address drought risk which becomes a concern particularly in the hdc scenario we now investigate how the value of flexibility is affected by the speed of learning about future climate change in our case study deferring investment always fails to be a cost effective option due to the considerable expected costs of waiting and the fact that learning about climate change is rather slow in this exercise we show a situation where delaying investment can be cost effective if we lower the flood and drought damages to 250 million and 200 million respectively and leave the other parameters as described in section 3 we let the speed of learning slow down as we move down the table the results are shown in table 2 initially the ldc and the hdc scenarios are believed to be equally likely columns 1 and 2 show the combinations of the probabilities of a flood in the low damage cost scenario ldc and the high damage cost scenario hdc respectively the present values of costs for our adaptation measures are shown in columns 3 to 7 similar to 38 we observe that the option to delay investment becomes attractive with increasing speed of learning as costs are lowered substantially i e increasing the differences between the two climate change scenarios as we move down the table the gap between the two climate change scenarios decreases thereby lowering the speed of learning at a very slow rate of learning the option to delay investment becomes worthless in such a situation the expectation to receive information in the near future is low while the period of waiting for this updated information is long this is associated with substantial waiting costs instead the decision maker prefers to immediately invest in a nbs without reservoir showing that the additional flexibility has lost its value this is shown by the equal values in columns 3 and 4 costs can be reduced however when the rate of learning is fast the intuition behind these results is that the flood probability changes when we learn about future flood risk under a decreasing flood probability the decision maker is able to avoid unnecessary costs if she defers investment into the future she can still invest in an adaptation measure if the flood probability increases in contrast the flood probability becomes more volatile if the difference between the two climate scenarios increases and learning occurs fast the expected benefits of investing in an adaptation measure increase with an increasing flood probability on the other hand a higher volatility in the flood probability will also cause a larger speed of learning in which case a decision maker would not invest this means that the upside risk of deferring investment is increased without affecting the downside risk 38 4 2 partial information next we observe that if the decision maker only updates her beliefs based on the observed occurrence of an inland flood event she might invest in a sub optimal adaptation measure compared to updating beliefs based on information from both floods and droughts specifically the option to construct a n b s r fails to become cost effective if the hdc scenario is more likely to apply the high investment and maintenance costs of the nbs appear to outweigh its benefits of drought alleviation fig 4 b plots the cost effective adaptation option if we keep the belief of being in the hdc scenario fixed at α 0 0 5 if wetland ecosystems require one to five years to develop the n b s n is the most cost effective option to the left of the grey vertical line however maturing times of six years or higher make increasing pumping capacity more attractive both of these measures fail to address meteorological drought risk fig 4 d shows the expected present value of costs for the cost effective investment options if the beliefs of the decision maker regarding the occurrence of flood events evolve over time and the maturing time of the nbs is fixed at three years we observe that the decision to invest in a n b s n is not affected by a change in beliefs of being in the hdc scenario changing both the maturing time and α 0 we show in table a4 in appendix b a decrease in the maturing time under which the n b s n becomes cost effective in the hdc scenario a measure with a short maturing time becomes cost effective as the decision maker expects flood related damages to be considerably higher in the hdc scenario the additional benefit of mitigating future meteorological droughts as we saw in section 4 1 and which would compensate for a longer maturing time becomes irrelevant if drought risk is being ignored therefore the additional ability to mitigate future drought damages can extend the tolerated maturing time to make a nbs cost effective 4 3 increasing property values the implementation of nbs requires land land use in the oed is predominantly agricultural while agricultural activities are allowed to take place within a n b s n the local water authority needs to purchase the land if retention areas are being used as a reservoir during the summer months in this subsection we assume that competition for land is fierce in the province of groningen agricultural land located in potential retention areas is assumed to be suitable for building these changes in land use correspond to a steep increase in property prices from 5 9 m 2 to 200 m 2 16 16 in 2013 prices for residential areas were 200 m 2 in the province of groningen https watismijnhuiswaard com grondprijzen nederland we observe that the n b s n with a maturing time between four and six years becomes the cost effective option to invest in see table a3 in appendix b at higher maturing times increasing pumping capacity becomes cost effective while the n b s n is negatively affected by higher property prices as well the amount of land which this measure requires for constructing surrounding embankments is much lower compared to the n b s r therefore increasing property prices by a factor of approximately forty leads to the n b s r to fail to become cost effective the price for land that needs to be paid upfront is higher than the future expected benefits of mitigating flood and drought damages 5 discussion 5 1 conditions of cost effectiveness hurdles to the successful implementation of nbs such as retention areas often include the lack of scientific studies on their cost effectiveness compared to grey alternatives 13 20 22 additionally while several studies have compared the cost effectiveness of retention areas to grey alternatives in the context of coastal flood risk 71 72 research on the cost effectiveness of nbs implemented along rivers and streams is still understudied in this article we analyse the cost effectiveness of retention areas as a form of nbs compared to grey alternatives under climate change uncertainty furthermore we investigate three conditions that influence their cost effectiveness 1 the maturing time of the wetland ecosystems integrated into retention areas 2 the amount of climate information used by the decision maker and 3 the value of land required to install such measures below we elaborate on each of the three conditions our results suggest that nbs in form of water retention areas can be a cost effective option to address flood and drought risks compared to grey measures of selective dike heightening and increased pumping capacity results are consistent with other studies on retention areas that show the cost effectiveness of such measures 29 31 comparing expected flood damages of two flood events 29 show that using retention areas for flood protection can turn out to be highly cost effective similarly 31 show how the ability of retention areas to increase water availability for irrigation and to improve river water quality and quantity can be cost effective under different climate change scenarios decision making can profit from delaying investment if the decision maker expects to learn more about the true climate in the future as the construction of an adaptation measure is assumed to be irreversible there is value in waiting for more information about which climate change scenario applies if she decides to wait with the implementation of an adaptation option she needs to weigh the benefits of updated information becoming available during waiting and the costs of being unprepared for extreme weather events however having the option to wait with investing is not attractive for the decision maker in this study delaying investment leaves the oed exposed to both drought and severe 1 in 1000 year flood events in the hdc and ldc scenarios the costs of waiting in form of expected flood and drought damages are therefore considerably higher than the expected benefits of receiving updated climate information in the future besides the expected costs of waiting the speed of learning determines the value of the delay option 38 if the characteristics of the ldc and hdc scenarios are rather different and the decision maker only requires a short period to learn which climate scenario applies being able to delay investment can reduce costs considerably 38 5 1 1 maturing time we observe that the maturing time is a crucial determinant of the cost effectiveness of retention areas we define the maturing time as the time that wetland and peat land ecosystems that have been integrated into retention areas require to develop and provide proper flood protection the range of the maturing time under which retention areas become the cost effective option changes with the beliefs of the decision maker to be in the hdc scenario specifically maturing times of up to nine years make the n b s r the preferred measure to invest in even under strong beliefs that the hdc scenario applies this result reflects the ability of the n b s r to considerably reduce future drought risks thereby compensating for potential flood and drought damages during its maturing time additionally investment and operation costs of retention areas are lower than its grey alternatives of selective dike heightening and pumping capacity however if maturing times exceed nine years the decision maker would prefer to invest in increased pumping capacity of the two sea pumps in the oed our results regarding the maturing time are comparable to the slowly emerging research conducted on peat re wetting and wetland restoration the restoration of a previously abundant natural habitat at the site generally depends on the current geo morphological and environmental conditions as well as the type of ecosystem peat land tidal zone wetland forest regarding coastal salt marshes as a form of coastal flood protection measure pioneer habitats of coastal salt marshes can develop fast under lee conditions and abundant sediment 73 found that typical salt marsh vegetation cover was restored within 10 to 20 years of constructing a flood defence several studies on the restoration of formerly degraded peat lands in the uk and finland found that peat re wetting leads to an improvement in downstream flood safety within one to four years by reducing river peak discharges and flow velocity as well as by delaying flood peaks 48 52 peat land restoration is aimed predominantly at increasing surface roughness in addition various studies point at the potential of woodlands to slow down flood peak speed and to increase temporary flood storage forests older than 9 years in particular have a higher impact on river hydrology 74 75 taking into account the dynamic nature of the impact of woodland on runoff 39 assume that 15 of the flood related benefits are realised in the first year of planting and increase at the same rate until they are fully realised in year 15 given our results decision makers may need to temporarily complement nbs that have extended maturing times such as wetland reforestation 17 17 https www rijksoverheid nl with grey measures such as selective dike heightening in order to mitigate extreme events while retention areas develop 5 1 2 partial information if the decision maker solely uses observations of flood events to update her beliefs about climate change the length of the maturing time of retention areas to be cost effective decreases with an increase in her belief to be in the hdc scenario in this study the decision maker would falsely prefer to invest in a n b s n if its maturing time ranges between four and six years depending on her initial belief that the hdc scenario applies furthermore if the information from drought events is ignored the n b s r fails to become cost effective her investment decision may therefore not be optimal in protecting an area against meteorological droughts if the decision maker holds strong beliefs to be in the hdc scenario increasing pumping capacity becomes the preferred investment option whenever maturing times of retention areas exceed four years while increased pumping capacity provides immediate flood protection it will be inefficient in mitigating the increased occurrence of drought related damages therefore a decision maker s investment decisions may be misguided 5 1 3 increasing property values finally we show that if we assume that the land use of the area in which the n b s r are being constructed changes from agricultural to residential the n b s r fails to become cost effective retention areas thus may fail to become cost effective if property prices are high for example if land use is being changed from agricultural to residential the price for land that needs to be paid upfront may be higher than the future expected benefits of mitigating flood and drought damages our results are similar to 19 51 19 find that the benefits of preserving land for water retention purposes may be lower than forgone opportunity costs if the land located in the designated floodplain would have otherwise been developed in the future instead they advise decision makers to target investments based on the costs of preservation and expected flood damages to reduce costs and increase net benefits similarly 51 show that the benefits of preserving a floodplain can be increased through careful spatial targeting more specifically the authors observe that the opportunity costs of retaining land for the implementation of nbs may partially offset their benefits of avoided flood damages they furthermore highlight the importance of nbs to provide various co benefits including recreational opportunities and aesthetics value especially if property values are considerably high 5 2 reliability of nbs implementing retention areas as a form of nbs is inherently complex 76 however if properly designed constructed and managed retention areas offer the potential to provide cost effective mitigation and adaptation against climate change while providing various benefits to nature and society 21 77 78 however extreme events may adversely affect nbs themselves 79 nbs are dynamic systems that rely on the ability of species and ecosystem processes to adapt to a wide range of climate change impacts 80 if nbs such as retention areas are frequently disturbed by extreme events before the system has sufficiently recovered the ecosystems ecological function and adaptive capacity may substantially decrease 81 in the oed a frequent occurrence of droughts may enhance the severity of consecutive floods if wetland ecosystems are damaged 8 82 active management of the nbs such as reducing pollution or invasive species plays therefore a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events and in enhancing ecological adaptation 81 83 the implementation of retention areas also presupposes an in depth understanding of how the integrated ecosystems provide adaptive capacity against climate change 84 however management and maintenance of nbs may be hampered if decision making is ill informed or cooperation across local regional and national scales is lacking 85 leading to a reduction of their adaptation potential in order to enhance the reliability of nbs an increasing number of studies promote the integration of green and grey adaptation measures 16 86 combining both types of measures has the potential to reduce the impacts of various climate change impacts on the integrated ecosystems to facilitate implementation and management over longer periods and to increase the provisioning of ecosystem services 13 5 3 caveats and limitations several data constraints limit our analysis the estimation of the expected present value of costs do not include socioeconomic uncertainties during the investment decision making process as expected flood and drought damages are determined by the exposure of both urban and rural areas in the oed water system to extreme events we expect changes in land use to affect our results for example agricultural activities may decline while cities are expanding or vice versa we therefore recommend future research to integrate socioeconomic uncertainties into the model to further improve the evaluation of retention areas as a form of nbs that are being implemented in densely populated urban areas in particular furthermore we do not take non market flood damages fatalities and injuries as well as displacement costs into account our study would also benefit from allowing the probabilities of floods and droughts to change over time we expect those probabilities to change in the future based on an increase in weather observations and an improvement in climate modelling while the decision maker receives updated information when waiting with investing into an adaptation measure the underlying climate change scenarios may change as well for example the ipcc updates its climate change scenarios approximately every five years which also implies an update in flood and drought probabilities a possibility to integrate changes in underlying climate scenarios into our model is the inclusion of a transition matrix to determine the probability of changes between climate scenarios 38 using a combination of a transition matrix and the observed frequency of floods and droughts the decision maker is then able to update the flood and drought probabilities as well as changes in the underlying climate scenarios finally we acknowledge that we have solely considered co benefits generated by retention areas in form of the reduction of drought risk and drought related damages as drought risk measures in our case study area solely comprise retention areas with an integrated water reservoir selective dike heightening and the increase in pumping capacity fail to address drought risk in the area however we encourage research comparing retention areas with grey alternatives that both deliver drought benefits related to this is the consideration of co benefits other than a reduction in flood and drought damages such as recreation or the enhancement of wetland ecosystems including a broader range of co benefits generated by nature based adaptation measures in particular may turn a nbs into a more favourable choice to invest in even under longer maturing times or higher property prices for example 39 observe that the share of flood regulation benefits depends on the planting location of a forest where flood regulation related co benefits are of greater importance for wetland forests compared to forests restored on hill slopes almost 99 of co benefits generated by the latter comprise carbon sequestration water quality improvement recreation aesthetic appeal and education 6 conclusion climate change requires the implementation of effective adaptation measures that simultaneously address flood and drought risks however because the extent and pace of climate change is still uncertain decision making on the timing and location of adaptation measures remains challenging especially as such adaptation measures are frequently characterised by long lead and lifetimes recent years have seen an increase in the implementation of green adaptation and of nature based solutions nbs in particular as alternatives to grey measures such as dike heightening and increased pumping capacity in contrast to grey adaptation measures nbs have the inherent potential to successfully adapt to changing environmental conditions however the implementation of nbs is frequently met with concern especially the small number of studies on the cost effectiveness of nbs has been identified as a major research gap on the evaluation and successful implementation of green adaptation measures the goal of this paper was to compare the cost effectiveness of retention areas as a form of nbs to grey adaptation and to identify the conditions under which such measures become cost effective under uncertain climate change the defining parameters in our study under which retention areas become cost effectiveness are 1 their maturing time 2 the availability of only partial climate information and 3 the property value of land on which retention areas are being constructed we find that the implementation of retention areas with an integrated reservoir to mitigate meteorological droughts is the cost effective option to invest in if its maturing time does not exceed nine years this is because the expected benefits following the implementation of such a nbs are higher than the costs of waiting until it provides proper flood protection nbs with maturing times up to nine years include peat re wetting and wetland restoration which has been integrated into retention areas in the oed regarding nbs with long maturing times of nine years or more such as wetland reforestation decision makers may need to complement the nbs with the implementation of grey measures such as selective dike heightening in order to mitigate extreme events while the nbs matures particularly if inland flood risk and meteorological droughts are expected to increase in the future the literature on the effect of the maturing time on flood and drought risk is only starting to emerge we therefore encourage further research into this area moreover we find that the choice of adaptation measure depends upon the beliefs about the severity of climate change and hence upon the climate information obtained our sensitivity analysis demonstrates how limiting the access to information may result in the choice of adaptation measures that fail to properly protect against drought risk finally we observe that the nbs with large land requirements such as a retention area with integrated reservoir fail to become cost effective if property prices are high the benefits of avoided flood and drought damages may be dwarfed by the opportunities of retaining land for retention purposes if the land is designated as residential area our findings confirm the important factor of property prices of the land on which a nbs is supposed to be constructed while our model incorporates uncertainty of climate change we do not take socioeconomic uncertainty into consideration due to data constraints furthermore we encourage further research into quantifying the impacts of droughts on the performance of nbs to mitigate flood risk we expect that droughts could be detrimental to the functioning of ecosystems of a nbs additionally one could incorporate co benefits other than reductions in flood and drought damages such as recreation or the enhancement of ecosystems into an economic appraisal of adaptation measures therefore we believe that our results are conservative estimates we expect that the inclusion of various co benefits other than avoided flood damages would further improve the cost effectiveness of our nbs potentially extending the maturing time and property values under which nbs become cost effectiveness alternatives credit authorship contribution statement lennart g vogelsang

8630,while ongoing climate change requires effective adaptation strategies decision making on the scale timing and location of adaptation measures remains challenging as the extent and pace of climate change is uncertain in particular uncertainty surrounds the success of mitigation strategies and economic and demographic developments while grey measures such as dikes and pumping have been the dominant form of adaptation in the past against inland flooding nature based solutions are receiving more attention however evidence on their cost effectiveness compared to grey alternatives is still limited in this article we develop a real options model that integrates climate change uncertainty as well as flexibility of the timing of investment we expect that the uncertainty falls over time due to an increase in climate data that becomes available to the decision maker the decision maker learns about climate change from two types of events inland flooding and meteorological drought the model is calibrated with data from the oldambt eemskanaal dollardboezem water system in the dutch province of groningen our results show the potential for nature based solutions to become a viable alternative to dike heightening and pumping in addressing both extreme events moreover we observe that the cost effectiveness of nature based solutions depends on the maturing time of the ecosystem the value of land on which the measure is being implemented and the type of information considered in the investment decision we show that maturing times of up to nine years make a nature based solution the preferred measure to invest in even under strong beliefs of severe climate change when maturing times exceed nine years the option takes too long to become effective and pumping is preferred furthermore our results show that an increase in the value of land on which a nature based solution is being constructed may substantially reduce its cost effectiveness finally decision making flexibility becomes valuable if expected damages from floods and droughts are sufficiently low and the decision maker learns quickly about climate change jel classification d81 h54 q54 keywords

extreme precipitation events including inland floods and meteorological droughts 1 being among the most expensive natural disasters today 2 inland floods are expected to further increase in frequency and severity due to climate change 3 4 dramatic examples are the 2021 flood events in western europe that have claimed more than 180 lives in germany alone and caused billions of euros of flood damages 1 1 https www bundesregierung de in addition to flooding water scarcity is identified as a key risk in europe in the recent ipcc wgii 6th assessment report drought risk has expanded from southern to western central europe and is expected to intensify with higher global warming levels 5 6 for example the drought of 2018 in the netherlands has resulted in up to 2 billion of drought related damages 7 as global warming is expected to continue largely unabated effective climate change adaptation strategies are required to address both inland flood and meteorological drought risks 8 however decision making on the scale timing and location of adaptation measures remains challenging as the extent and pace of climate change is still uncertain 9 uncertainty stems from epistemic and knowledge uncertainties regarding the success of mitigation strategies economic and demographic developments various adaptation measures are available to reduce water related risks so far the dominant form of climate change adaptation have been grey measures for example the construction of dikes aims at reducing future coastal and inland flood risks 10 yet recent years have seen an increase in the implementation of green adaptation measures such as nature based solutions nbs as an alternative nbs integrate natural and ecosystem dynamics into their design in order to increase the coping potential of landscapes and urban areas with emerging environmental economic and societal challenges furthermore they are able to simultaneously provide benefits to both society and nature 11 13 the implementation of nbs has received increasing academic attention 14 a growing body of evidence shows positive ecological outcomes of nbs such as an increase in biodiversity 15 and their inherent potential to successfully adapt to changing environmental conditions 16 in contrast the small but growing literature on the cost effectiveness of nbs to address inland flood risk relative to grey alternatives show mixed results for example 17 and 18 show that storm water retention areas may turn out to be cost effective in contrast 19 find that only after careful spatial planning may the implementation of nature based flood risk management become cost effective even if implementation costs initially exceed the amount of expected avoided flood damages in our study we measure cost effectiveness as the costs of adaptation measures that are to be taken to reach a legal flood and or drought safety standard the small number of studies on the cost effectiveness of nbs particularly when compared to grey alternatives has been identified as a major research gap for the evaluation and successful implementation of nature based adaptation measures 20 22 and has been regarded as a significant challenge for their widespread use 13 23 24 in this paper we therefore compare the cost effectiveness of nbs to grey measures that address both inland flood and meteorological drought risk we investigate the implementation of flood and drought risk adaptation measures by a local water authority in the oldambt eemskanaal dollardboezem oed water system in the dutch province of groningen as the decision maker 25 the local water authority may decide to invest in the implementation of retention areas where former wetland and peat land ecosystems are revitalised in order to alleviate inland flood risk retention areas may either retain flood waters within the catchment area or create additional space for water storage in the floodplain 26 28 retention areas that integrate wetland and peat land ecosystems provide effective protection against inland floods and meteorological droughts through their ability to enhance water storage to reduce surface runoff to slow down water flow or to secure water supplies as well as to increase the water percolation capacity of soils 29 31 alternatively the decision maker may prefer to invest in one of two grey measures namely selectively heightening the dikes around economically valuable locations or to increase the pumping capacity of sea pumps however although the netherlands have invested billions of euros into coastal and inland flood protection measures in recent years 32 33 grey measures alone may not provide sufficient protection of the northeastern area of the oed against low frequency high impact flood events furthermore a recent increase in the frequency and scale of exceptionally dry summers have raised attention for the potential effectiveness of retention areas to reduce drought impacts to address future drought risk the local water authority has the additional option to invest in retention areas that have an integrated reservoir during summer this measure is able to address both inland flooding and meteorological drought risk the decision maker will invest in the measure with the lowest present value of all future costs the local water authority faces uncertainties about the scale and frequency of extreme precipitation events in the oed which may lead to under or over adaptation to flood and drought risk learning about future climate change has shown to raise awareness of climate impacts among decision makers thereby fostering the successful uptake of adaptation measures 34 to delay investment or to invest partially now and retain the option to invest further in the future may be valuable if the decision maker is uncertain about future climate change but expects uncertainty to decrease for example due to advancements in climate forecasting and observation of weather data 35 37 the decision to defer investment is optimal as long as the present value of cost savings is less than the required capital expenditure plus the value of the delay option that is destroyed when we invest 38 39 observe that overall investment costs of nbs can be substantially lowered if the decision maker is able to learn about climate change the value of the deferral option increases with the speed of learning as the period needed to receive new information about climate change is short however only a limited number of studies have explicitly integrated flexibility and climate change uncertainty into investment decision making of adaptation measures these studies include the application of the adaptation pathway approach 40 41 robust decision making 42 or real options analysis roa 38 43 44 while the approach of adaptation pathways allows for the inclusion of adaptive capacity and future options are kept open in economic analysis its application becomes challenging if multiple risks act together and if thresholds are difficult to identify where probabilistic information is lacking i e under deep uncertainty robust decision making has been recommended the approach is able to identify robust strategies today i e strategies that perform well over a large number of scenarios however it requires a large amount of quantitative information computing power and expert resources instead we apply a roa approach which has become an established tool to evaluate investment decisions of adaptation measures under uncertainty and learning 37 45 46 in contrast to adaptation pathways and robust decision making roa allows decision makers to quantify the benefits of decision making flexibility under uncertainty including decision making flexibility helps us to improve decision making about the timing and scale of the implementation of adaptation measures flexibility becomes valuable when we expect to receive updated climate information in the future 38 the ability to defer investment and to learn about climate change may turn out to be a valuable benefit to investment planning if the speed of learning about climate change is fast 47 furthermore investing in a small measure now and keeping the option open for potential future investment to scale up an adaptation measure may become beneficial for the decision maker rather than designing the measure to respond to current impacts or near term risks we apply a modified quadrinomial lattice model where new observations of inland flooding and meteorological drought events allow for gradual learning using a bayesian updating process 38 initially decision makers are uncertain about the climate change scenario they need to adapt to gradually though they reduce this uncertainty by observing the frequency of inland floods and meteorological drought events decision makers can update their climate change beliefs roa is especially useful for analysing major investment decisions in light of an existing adaptation deficit i e sunk costs and potential future lock ins furthermore roa can be applied when those investment decisions are irreversible and uncertainty is expected to be partially resolved through waiting for new information on the success of investment 47 as nbs require time for the proper provision of flood and drought safety wetland and peat land ecosystems need time to develop 48 nbs are frequently perceived as more risky by practitioners and the public especially during the first years following their implementation 49 in contrast grey measures such as dike heightening can address flood risks effectively right after completion yet they fail to provide other co benefits such as a reduction of drought related damages as a result enhanced insights into the cost effectiveness of nbs could facilitate their implementation 50 we contribute to the literature on nbs by first comparing the cost effectiveness of nbs to that of grey alternatives in a riverine landscape grey measures include the selective heightening of dikes that protect the main locations of economic activity as well as an increase in the discharge capacity of two sea pumps that regulate the water levels in our study area nbs consist of measures with and without an integrated reservoir a reservoir is integrated in order to mitigate drought risk while simultaneously protecting against inland flooding we explicitly take climate uncertainty as well as project flexibility into account the second contribution of the paper is the analysis of the conditions under which nbs become cost effective besides avoided flood damages which has been assessed in the existing literature 19 51 we investigate how the following factors determine the cost effectiveness of a nbs 1 its maturing time the time that integrated wetland and peat land ecosystems need to develop to provide proper flood protection 2 its ability to address multiple types of weather extremes or the amount of information that a decision maker has on inland flooding and meteorological droughts and 3 the value of property on which a nbs is being constructed regarding the maturing time of a nbs integrated ecosystems require a certain time before flood or drought risks are effectively lowered the restoration of formerly degraded wet and peat lands leads to an improvement in downstream flood safety within one to four years by reducing river peak discharges and flow velocity 48 52 next nbs are able to simultaneously address inland flood and meteorological drought risk while adaptation primarily addresses flood risk water scarcity is expected to intensify with higher global warming levels however analyses including multiple sources of climate related risks remain limited 53 55 we find that the decision maker prefers nbs over grey alternatives this is because nbs are able to perform better in reducing drought risk by increasing the water retention and flow capacity of wetlands and floodplains along with the restoration and enhancement of ecosystem services furthermore nbs have been shown to promote socio economic development 54 finally the value of land on which a nbs is being constructed may become a crucial factor in determining its cost effectiveness depending on the underlying land use and the size of the adaptation measure investing may be less attractive if property values are high 19 in this paper we find that the nbs with large land requirements such as a retention area with integrated reservoir becomes unattractive to invest in if property prices are high this is because the local water authority needs to purchase the land on which such measures are being constructed instead the decision maker prefers to invest in a measure that solely addresses inland flood risk as the expected damages from droughts are still smaller than the higher property prices the paper proceeds as follows section 2 gives a detailed description of the real options model that we apply as well as our study area 2 2 we introduce project flexibility in our appendix c an overview on the data requirements and model calibration is provided in section 3 the results of the study are presented in section 4 in section 5 we discuss our findings and implications to policy making while section 6 provides a conclusion 2 real options model we implement a real options roa model with an integrated bayesian updating process to allow for future learning about climate change uncertainties during investment decision making a real option is the right but not the obligation to adapt projects to changing conditions in the future or to wait with their implementation until uncertainty is partially resolved while uncertainty will never be fully resolved waiting for updated information over time will increase the knowledge on climate change impacts our roa model includes a decrease in uncertainty by assuming there are multiple climate change regimes with a different distribution of inland flood and meteorological drought events the decision maker does not know the exact climate regime but she reduces uncertainty by updating her beliefs through observing the frequency of occurring inland floods and meteorological droughts the decision maker will increase the probability she assigns to a severe climate change regime and lower the probability she assigns to a benign climate change regime if she frequently observes inland floods and or meteorological droughts as a result the perceived probability of a climate change regime fluctuates with the number of observed extreme precipitation events which is the source of volatility in the investment payoff 38 if the decision maker observes an inland flood or meteorological drought the probability she attaches to the severe climate change regime increases which as a result raises the expected investment payoff if she fails to observe an extreme event she lowers her beliefs which decreases expected investment payoff this variation in probability of extreme weather events is different from the majority of approaches that integrate investment flexibility which assume a constant probability our model is an expansion and an application of the roa model introduced by 38 we expand the model to incorporate two types of risk namely inland flood and meteorological drought risk additionally we apply the model to a real world case where the local water authority chooses to invest in a nbs selective dike heightening or an increase in pumping capacity those measures differ in their effectiveness to reduce the flood and drought damages in the area damage costs are incurred each time an inland flood and or meteorological drought event occurs as the decision maker is initially uncertain about the severity of future climate change she is also uncertain about the scale and timing of the required adaptation measure however she anticipates the acquisition of updated information about the severity of climate change in the future when making her investment decision the decision maker chooses the option with the lowest expected present value of costs following the established literature 36 39 we build and solve the model in three consecutive steps in section 2 1 we construct the quadrinomial lattice for the stochastic process that the uncertain parameters i e the number of inland floods and meteorological droughts follows over time over time the decision maker observes the number of floods and droughts to update her beliefs about whether a severe climate change scenario applies next section 2 2 provides the specification of six adaptation options that the local water authority considers to implement in order to address flood and drought risks in the oed the landscape is predominantly rural and characterised by small rivers and streams finally we formulate the optimisation objective of selecting the investment option with the lowest expected present value of costs taking future information gains of climate change into account this is followed by solving the model through backward induction section 2 3 we apply our model to a case in the netherlands where flood events in the provinces of groningen and drenthe in 1998 triggered the implementation of large scale flood risk management measures fig 1 although the local water authority prefers the implementation of retention areas expected increases in the scale and frequency of inland floods and meteorological droughts by 2100 requires the evaluation of alternative strategies such strategies need to able to provide immediate flood protection such as selectively rising dikes and increasing pumping capacity 25 56 2 1 specification of the quadrinomial lattice 2 1 1 conditional probabilities in roa uncertainty is included by specifying the probabilities of several outcomes and choosing those policies that maximise a project s expected value of net benefits typical assumptions of studies that apply roa are that the decision maker knows with certainty the model s underlying parameters and the stochastic process that determines future outcomes only random events that occur in the future are unknown for example 39 observe that incorporating learning about future climate change into the model decreases overall investment costs of climate change adaptation measures they derive the underlying distribution from the ukcp09 climate change data alternatively climate change uncertain may be modelled using continuous time stochastic processes such as geometric brownian motion for example 57 show that integrating future learning into the model reduces adaptation costs considerably compared to a situation where no learning and adaptation occur in contrast to our model the two studies assume a constant volatility of the state variable over time which greatly simplifies the analysis however this assumption does not apply in a world where we observe the actual weather to learn about the state of climate change therefore we implement a bayesian updating process to derive probabilities for the benign and the severe climate change scenario we use the observations of extreme precipitation events number of droughts and or floods as our stochastic exogenous state variable and the source of the option value whose volatility is allowed to change over time furthermore and in contrast to previous studies that apply roa our study allows for uncertainty about the model s underlying parameters we assume that there are two possible climate regimes or states of the world that is the climate can either be in state l the low damage cost ldc or benign scenario or in state h the hdc or severe scenario extreme weather events such as inland floods and meteorological droughts may occur in both states however in the ldc scenario such an event is less likely than in the hdc scenario let p l and p h be the annual inland flood probabilities i e return periods in the ldc and in the hdc scenario respectively and p l p h similarly let q l q h be the annual meteorological drought probabilities in the ldc and in the hdc scenario respectively and q l q h the decision maker holds an initial belief to be in the hdc scenario denoted by α 0 she makes two observations in each period first whether there is a drought or not second whether there is a flood or not in the current period 3 3 note that for our ultimate posterior belief it is irrelevant in which order the events occur for example suppose we have observed both a flood and a drought in the current year we can show that our posterior belief is independent of whether the flood or the drought occurs first in other words we know that the sequence of events does not matter for our posterior belief it is this feature that allows us to simply count the number of flood and drought years in a given number of years a sequence no flood drought gives the same posterior as drought no flood we update this probability each period after observing whether or not a flood and or drought has occurred in that period that is the decision maker updates her beliefs about being in the hdc scenario based on the number of inland floods and meteorological droughts she observes in each period therefore the true regime does not change in our model as time passes but the probabilities that we attach to each regime change over time according to bayes s law 38 we construct a quadrinomial lattice along which the beliefs about the climate regime evolve see fig 2 for a schematic example for two periods t 1 and t 2 each node represents a potential climate change belief that is an expected number of extreme precipitation events for different climate futures the colours indicate the number of inland flood years i and meteorological drought years j 4 4 we say flood and drought years since there may be an issue with having more than one flood or drought a year we allow for it but count it as one flood and one drought light green indicates being on a benign climate path with few or no extreme precipitation events in contrast dark grey indicates a frequent occurrence thereof node i j t corresponds to a period t when an inland flood event has occurred in i periods and a meteorological drought event has occurred in j periods of all periods 1 t therefore we simply count the occurrence of each event and we write the posterior belief after t years as α i j t where i counts the number flood years and j counts the number of drought years after t periods we have t 1 2 possible states of beliefs i e nodes of the tree that can be reached let α i j t denote the conditional probability that the hdc scenario applies if a flood and a drought occur in the next period we use bayes s law to update the probability that the hdc scenario applies and we have α i 1 j 1 t 1 if neither of these two events occurs in the next period the updated probability equals α i j t 1 when in the next period a drought occurs but no flood the probability that the hdc scenario applies becomes α i j 1 t 1 finally when we observe a flood event in the next period but no drought the probability that the hdc scenario applies becomes α i 1 j t 1 in order to derive a general formula for α i j t note that the odds of a posterior belief are the product of the odds of the prior belief and the ratio of the conditional probabilities of the event 5 5 for example if a flood and a drought occur in the first period we have α 1 f d 1 α 1 f d α 0 1 α 0 p h p l q h q l that is in each period if a flood and a drought occur the odds that we are in the hdc scenario increase by a factor p h p l q h q l and decrease by 1 p h 1 p l 1 q h 1 q l each time a flood and a drought do not occur if we believe that the hdc scenario applies with initial conditional probability of α 0 and if i and j of the next t periods witness a flood or drought respectively we will have revised this probability to the number α i j t defined implicitly according to bayes s law by 1 α i j t 1 1 1 α 0 1 α 0 p h p l i 1 p h 1 p l t i q h q l j 1 q h 1 q l t j if the decision maker observes a flood and or a drought in period t the probability that the hdc scenario applies increases and we move upwards on the lattice the belief that the hdc scenario applies falls if the decision maker observes a year without any extreme event leading us to move down the lattice our decision tree has decision points in every year 2 1 2 subjective probabilities given conditional probability α i j t we build a quadrinomial lattice for the perceived probability that inland flood or meteorological drought events occur next period i e subjective flood and drought probabilities p i j t and q i j t respectively the subjective probabilities i e the beliefs acquired at t of observing a flood or a drought in period t 1 are respectively 2 p i j t α i j t p h 1 α i j t p l and 3 q i j t α i j t q h 1 α i j t q l our assumptions that p l p h and q l q h imply that each period where both events occur we increase the probability attached to the hdc scenario and the flood and drought probabilities rise each period that both events do not occur we decrease the probability attached to the hdc scenario and the flood and drought probabilities decrease thus p i j t and q i j t are the stochastic exogenous state variables that are the source of option value in this model if we observe floods and droughts occurring with a relatively high frequency then p i j t and q i j t will approach p h and q h the actual return periods respectively in contrast if we observe them occurring with a rather low frequency then p i j t and q i j t will approach p l and q l respectively as time passes more information on future climate change is acquired thereby decreasing the volatility of the flood and drought probabilities 38 2 2 specification of the adaptation options adaptation measures are required to protect the oed against inland floods with a return period of 1 in 100 years in rural areas and of 1 in 1000 years in densely populated urban areas 58 6 6 a flood or drought return period is a flood or drought safety standard defined by the dutch government as the average time or an estimated average time between flood and drought events in our study flood return periods range between 1 in 100 years 1 annual exceedance probability and 1 in 1000 years 0 1 annual exceedance probability return periods for droughts have not been defined inland flood events occur primarily between october and march while meteorological droughts occur in the drier months between april and september therefore our numerical analysis differentiates between expected flood damages of a 1 in a 100 year flood event and a 1 in a 1000 year flood event with corresponding subjective flood probabilities denoted by p 100 i j t and p 1000 i j t respectively our six adaptation measures differ in their capabilities to partially protect against such flood events besides floods the last decade has seen an increase in the number of droughts in the study area so far drought related damages have been mitigated by diverting water from the ijsselmeer a large freshwater body 100 km to the west of our study area into the oed water system however an increase in the number of drought events is expected to require the implementation of additional measures in order to reduce drought related damages 59 one of such measures is the construction of a nbs with an integrated reservoir which stores water during the summer months the decision maker chooses the option with the lowest expected present value of costs denoted by c i j t each of these options comprises a separate project state with its own quadrinomial lattice we introduce b for baseline h for selective dike heightening p u for increasing pumping capacity n for the nbs without an integrated reservoir in summer n r for the nbs with an integrated reservoir which can release water during the summer months and n f for the small flexible nbs as long as state b prevails options h p u n n r and n f can be chosen once one of these options is implemented no further choices are to be made we discount all expected cash flows using the constant discount rate r in our initial state b one has not invested in flood protection yet but keeps the option open to invest in the future at each terminal node i j t of the quadrinomial lattice the decision maker chooses one of the following six options 1 maintaining dikes baseline dikes are already in place along streams and rivers of the oed however they need to be maintained and repaired existing dikes provide protection against inland flood events of a 1 in 100 year return period each occurrence of an inland flood or a meteorological drought event causes society to incur event related costs of f b and d b respectively where b stands for baseline there are no investment costs associated with the baseline while ongoing maintenance costs are m b without learning about future climate change i e under current beliefs about flood and drought probabilities maintaining the dikes must be sufficient to meet a predefined legal safety standard but it may not be optimal beliefs may change in the future which makes simple dike maintenance insufficient the expected event related costs in period t equal p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b if we decide to simply strengthen repair existing dikes in every future period the expected present value of costs at each node is 4 c i j t b p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b r c i j t b consists of costs incurred in year 0 as well as the discounted expected costs under an infinite time horizon postponing the decision to invest until new information about future climate change becomes available entails that the local water authority will not implement further climate change adaptation measures in a given period 2 selective dike heightening alternatively the decision maker may prefer to selectively heighten river dikes in order to provide protection against inland flood events with a 1 in 1000 year return period protected areas lie predominantly around the city of groningen where a large amount of economic activity takes place the remaining river dikes will not be heightened and effectively protect solely against a 1 in a 100 year inland flood event 25 selective dike heightening requires capital expenditure i h causing event related costs to fall to p 1000 i j t f h q i j t d h m h at each node where superscripts h and b stand for heightening and baseline respectively we assume that dike heightening takes one period such that enhanced flood protection is realised from period t 1 onward the expected present value of all future costs after investing in dike heightening in period t therefore consists of the expected baseline damage costs in period t 5 c i j t h p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b i h p 1000 i j t f h q i j t d h m h r 3 increasing pumping capacity the decision maker may also decide to increase pumping capacity in order to prevent water levels related to a 1 in a 1000 year inland flood event increasing pumping capacity requires investment costs of i p u and decreases event related costs to p 1000 i j t f p u q i j t d p u m p u at each node we assume that installing larger pumps takes one period such that enhanced flood protection is realised from period t 1 onward the expected present value of all future costs after investing in large pumps in period t therefore consists of the expected baseline

retention areas without an integrated reservoir during the summer months offers protection against extreme events with a probability of 1 in 1000 per year the nbs is used solely to retain water during an extreme weather event while the water is being gradually released to the streams and rivers immediately thereafter the size of the retention areas varies between 330 ha and 690 ha with a total wetland area of 1 820 ha water storage capacity of the nbs varies between 4 1 million m 3 and 8 2 million m 3 with a total storage capacity of 25 million m 3 25 if we decide to implement the nbs without integrated reservoir function in summer n b s n capital expenditures are i n event related costs fall subsequently to p 1000 i j t f n q i j t d n m n at each node we assume that constructing the nbs will take t years to mature the expected present value of all future costs after investing in the nbs therefore equals 7 c i j t n i n κ t 1 κ 1 κ t p 100 i j t f b q i j t d b m b p 1000 i j

designed in such a way that it can be readily expanded in the future if deemed necessary this flexible option is described in detail in appendix c as long as the baseline option is adopted i e state b

long as the present value of the cost reduction is lower than the required capital investment plus the value of the delay option that is destroyed when we invest as soon as an investment is made there is no further flexibility and eqs 5 8 as well as the flexible nbs apply 2 3 optimisation objective and backward induction our objective is to minimise the expected present value of all future costs

solving the optimisation problem through backward induction to identify the cost effective climate adaptation measure 7 7 we thank g guthrie for providing the mathematica code from 38 that inspired our own coding we evaluate our options over a time span of 85 years which corresponds to the time span of projections of daily precipitation between 2016 2100 see chapter 3 1 we measure cost effectiveness as the costs of adaptation measures that are to be taken to reach a legal flood and or drought safety standard we use a risk free discount rate of 1 6 recommended by the dutch ministry of finance for projects characterised by fixed and sunk costs 60 to calculate expected present value of costs of each of the six options considered in this study 8 8 in a sensitivity analysis we increase the discount rate to 2 a value recommended by the dutch government as a higher bound for cost benefit analyses on projects that are characterised by fixed and a sunk cost 60 we compare the results to a situation where the discount rate is decreased to 1 2 the lower bound recommended by the dutch ministry of finance see appendix d 3 data the following section describes the data required in order to calibrate the model first in section 3 1 we derive the return periods of inland floods and meteorological droughts section 3 2 describes the estimations of flood and drought damages as well as investment maintenance and operation costs of each of our six climate change adaptation measures 3 1 climate data inland flood events in order to estimate the effects of climate change on the oed we use projections of daily precipitation over a period of 85 years 2016 2100 for 15 weather stations that are located in our study area these projections correspond to the dutch knmi 14 g l and w h climate change scenarios and represent the ldc and hdc scenarios in our study respectively the knmi 14 climate scenarios estimate the potential range of future climate change for the netherlands according to the ipcc 61 the climate scenarios differ in the amount of global temperature increase and potential changes in air circulation patterns we thank knmi for their kind provision of the projected precipitation data 9 9 we thank knmi for their kind provision of the projected precipitation data a detailed description of the scenarios is provided in 62 the six adaptation measures considered in this study are designed to protect the oed against inland flood events of a 1 in a 100 year and or a 1 in a 1000 year return period inland floods in the oed predominantly occur if northwesterly storms reduce the discharge capacity of the two sea pumps and major precipitation events take place simultaneously in the region inland flood events with a return period of 1 in 100 years occur when water levels in the oed exceed 1 25 m above mean sea level this corresponds to 1 total precipitation amounts exceeding 53 mm over a four day period at each of the fifteen weather stations and 2 discharge capacities of the two sea pumps being reduced for at least four days a 1 in a 1000 year flood event occurs when 1 total precipitation amounts exceed 70 mm over a four day period at each of the fifteen weather stations in our study area and 2 discharge capacities of the two sea pumps are reduced for at least four days this in turn corresponds to a water level of 1 50 m above mean sea level in our study area future changes in discharge capacity of the two sea pumps is driven by sea level rise and the frequency and severity of north westerly storms however we lack data on regional projections of such storms still past observations have shown a positive correlation between major precipitation events and such storms 58 we therefore assume that future precipitation events exceeding the respective precipitation thresholds of 53 mm and 70 mm are accompanied by at least four days of reduced discharge capacities of the two sea pumps 58 meteorological drought events next we calculate the return periods of meteorological droughts according to the knmi we use the maximum potential precipitation deficit as a measure for meteorological drought 10 10 see https www knmi nl kennis en datacentrum uitleg droogte for a description of how meteorological droughts are being determined in the netherlands in dutch the annual potential precipitation deficit is defined as the annual sum of daily differences in precipitation and potential evaporation and is calculated as 11 δ t s d 1 t p d s e v d s where δ is the potential precipitation deficit mm p is the amount of precipitation mm and e v is the amount of potential evaporation mm the subscripts t d and s stand for year day and weather station respectively a meteorological drought occurs if the annual potential precipitation deficit exceeds a value of 230 mm the threshold corresponds to the maximum amount of potential precipitation deficit that is exceeded once every ten years 62 over the 85 year period that our model covers until 2100 the incidence of such an event is expected to increase by 3 5 in the g l and by 40 in the w h knmi 14 climate scenarios we acquired projected daily evaporation for fourteen weather stations four of which are located in or close to the oed 11 11 projected values of daily potential precipitation deficit can be accessed under https www knmi nl nederland nu knmi14 klimaatscenarios transformatieprogramma we assume that a drought occurs in the oed if summer precipitation falls short of 230 mm at least at three of the four weather stations we expect fourteen 1 in 100 year inland flood events to occur over an 85 year period in the ldc scenario in the hdc scenario twenty two 1 in 100 year inland flood events are projected to take place additionally we expect five 1 in 1000 year inland flood events to take place in the ldc scenario and eleven such events in the hdc scenario table a1 in appendix a summarises the return periods for floods and droughts for each climate change scenario finally we project four meteorological drought events to occur in the hdc scenario and none in the ldc scenario 3 2 economic data 3 2 1 flood damages we have used expected inland flood damages in the oed from 56 who derived inland flood damages using the hydrological so called bakjes model developed by 63 the model derives the inundation depth of an inland flood by estimating the amount of water entering an area and the topography of the flood plain in a first step the authors used topographic maps and the ahn actueel hoogtebestand nederland digital elevation model with a resolution of 100 100 m to identify dike rings flooding zones and dike segments that are most likely to fail during a flood event the model identifies the weakest dike segment or point of failure as the lowest point of the flood plain behind a dike ring where flood damages are expected to be highest next the bakjes model was used to estimate the volume of water that enters a dike ring the water volume depends on the size of the catchment the location of the point of failure of the dike ring and the ground level of the adjacent flood zone and the topography of the dike ring expected soil subsidence due to local gas and salt extraction as well as peat oxidation have been included subsequently 56 used the estimates of the water volume to derive water levels in each dike ring by deriving water level volume curves the final output of the bakjes model was the inundation depth of a flood event across the dike rings for a given water level and topographic profile 12 12 56 used a water level related to a 1 in a 100 year inland flood event they expect a similar water level for a flood with a 1 in a 1000 year return period if retention areas are activated finally flood damages were derived using the his ssm model flood information system damages and casualties model the gis based module uses inundation depth as inputs which was derived by the bakjes model as well as the type of land use in each dike ring in order to derive damage functions for various land use types and infrastructure categories including agriculture pumping stations transportation and railway lines gas and drinking water pipes communication systems companies as well as damages to low rise medium rise and high rise buildings the his ssm model has been applied in academic studies of investment decision making under flood risk 64 to assess the effect of damage reducing flood risk management measures 65 to derive probabilistic preventive evacuation criteria 66 and to evaluate location specific robust insurance policies 67 for more details on the flood damage module see 68 we assume that an inland flood will affect all assets located in a dike ring but that the number of affected dike rings differs by the implemented measure the dike rings are regional or secondary defences that protect the land against inland water from canals smaller rivers and lakes 56 included expected economic developments in their estimates of expected flood damages for 2025 and 2050 based on these estimates we derive an annual average economic growth rate of 0 88 for the oed flood damages that occur if one of our six options is in place are shown in table 1 column 2 fig 3 maps the dike rings that are affected by a flood for each adaptation measure table a2 in appendix a lists the dike rings that are affected by flooding depending on the implemented measure 3 2 2 drought damages we calculate drought damages in our study area by using results that were published in the climate damage estimator report 2020 klimaatschadeschatter rapportage 2020 by the national knowledge and innovation program climate and water 59 13 13 the climate damage estimations underlying the report were developed by the nkwk as a response to the severe 2018 and 2019 meteorological droughts to help gain insights into future climate damages in dutch municipalities and provinces the applied method waterwijzer landbouw determines the effect of changing hydrological variables precipitation and evapotranspiration among others on agricultural production due to climate change or water management our ldc scenario corresponds to the nkwk s current climate with irrigation scenario it assumes that agricultural land use activities will not change until 2050 in contrast the nkwk s warm without irrigation scenario which corresponds to our hdc scenario anticipates a 3 decline in agricultural activities during that period detailed information is available under https media deltares nl deltascenarios deltascenarios actualisering2017 hoofdrapport pdf table 1 column 3 shows the expected drought damages that occur for each of the six options currently the local water authority diverts 65 million m 3 water from the ijsselmeer towards the oldambt eemskanaal dollardboezem water system during extended drought periods this amount is supposed to be sufficient in the ldc scenario in contrast the hdc scenario is assumed to require additional measures to mitigate expected drought damages as water levels in the ijsselmeer are expected to be too low to pump sufficient water into our study area using retention areas as a water reservoir during the dryer summer months instead can provide 47 million m 3 of water or 71 of the water volume normally derived from the ijsselmeer we therefore assume a 71 reduction of drought related damages to 508 million if retention areas are being used as reservoirs 59 3 2 3 investment maintenance and operation costs investment maintenance and operation costs of each of the six options were provided by the regional water authority 25 investment costs are incurred once at the beginning of the project while maintenance and operation costs are incurred annually table 1 columns 4 and 5 investment costs for the n b s r are calculated as the investment costs of the n b s n plus the land bought from the farmers within the nbs using a land price of 6 m 2 investment and maintenance costs comprise total costs across the whole size of wetlands in our study area for both types of nbs 14 14 accessible under https edepot wur nl 446327 maintenance costs include the expenses of diverting water from the ijsselmeer into the oed 15 15 see https www hunzeenaas nl wat we doen voldoende water droogte and https www veld post nl artikel 144899 extreem zomerweer kost hunze en aas bijna vijf ton as well as compensation paid to the farmers by the local water authority if retention areas are flooded as land use functions will not be substantially changed in most water retention areas the local water board compensates farmers and municipalities for flood damages to crop yields and infrastructure following the activation of those retention areas regarding wetland maintenance local water authorities predominantly manage the density of trees and shrubs to create channels where water can flow freely across the floodplain 25 4 results in the following subsections we present the results of our analysis a detailed description of the results of changes in the discount rate can be found in appendix d in section 4 1 we analyse the sensitivity of our results to changes in the maturing time of the retention areas as a form of nbs various studies have shown that wetland and peat land ecosystems integrated into retention areas require one to nine years of development to provide proper flood protection 48 52 69 if no complementary measures are being taken a longer maturing time may translate into higher expected flood damages in section 4 2 we investigate how the cost effective investment option may change if the decision maker observes the number of flood events over time while ignoring the occurrence of meteorological droughts various studies on retention areas have highlighted their ability to provide a wide range of co benefits for example addressing both flood and drought risk simultaneously 2 53 however the large majority of assessments of the cost effectiveness of retention areas takes floods as the sole weather related risk into account 39 70 finally in section 4 3 we analyse the effects of an increase in property values on the cost effectiveness of the nbs namely if the price of land increases due to the option to develop the land for residential or commercial use 19 show how the value of land can affect the cost effectiveness of a nbs the authors find that the costs of preserving an area that would have otherwise been developed are higher than the benefits of reduced flood damage however designating the land for water retention purposes might be cost effective only if high benefit low cost parcels are being preserved 4 1 results of the real options model fig 4 a plots the expected present values of costs for the cost effective investment options if the decision maker is initially uncertain which climate change scenario will hold i e assuming α 0 0 5 at maturing times of one to seven years a retention area with an integrated reservoir n b s r is the cost effective option to the left of the vertical grey line in fig 4 a at higher maturing times increasing pumping capacity becomes most attractive to invest in fig 4 c shows the expected present value of costs for the cost effective investment options if the beliefs of the decision maker evolve over time and the maturing time of the nbs is fixed at three years we observe that under a low belief in the hdc α 0 lies between 0 and 0 3 the n b s n becomes the cost effective option to invest in if the beliefs in the hdc increase the decision maker switches to the n b s r this is because drought risk becomes prominent in the hdc and the decision maker decides to install a reservoir and use it during the summer table a3 in appendix b presents our results if we change both the maturing time and α 0 if initial beliefs that the hdc applies range between 0 and 20 and maturing times lie between one and six years a retention area without an integrated reservoir n b s n becomes cost effective as drought damages are projected to be negligible the additional costs of using the nbs as a reservoir in summer outweigh its benefits of providing additional water for irrigation purposes in the future furthermore as flood damages are expected to be substantial in the ldc scenario as well increased pumping capacity becomes cost effective if its maturing time of the n b s n exceeds six years if the belief that the hdc scenario applies exceeds 20 and maturing times range between one and nine years the n b s r becomes the cost effective option we observe that the threshold value for the maturing time of the n b s r increases with an increase in the belief that the hdc scenario applies this is because the n b s r has the potential to substantially reduce expected flood and drought damages a feature that the alternative options lack our results reflect those reported by 38 who has shown in his model that the cost effectiveness of an adaptation measure depends on the beliefs of the decision maker that a specific climate change scenario applies the options of selective dike heightening and deferring investment fail to become cost effective in any situation selective dike heightening in particular fails to become cost effective due to its high expected flood damages compared to retention areas and increased pumping capacity the measure protects dike rings of high economic significance against 1 1000 flood events while the majority of the study area remains exposed to such extreme flood events additionally selective dike heightening fails to address drought risk which becomes a concern particularly in the hdc scenario we now investigate how the value of flexibility is affected by the speed of learning about future climate change in our case study deferring investment always fails to be a cost effective option due to the considerable expected costs of waiting and the fact that learning about climate change is rather slow in this exercise we show a situation where delaying investment can be cost effective if we lower the flood and drought damages to 250 million and 200 million respectively and leave the other parameters as described in section 3 we let the speed of learning slow down as we move down the table the results are shown in table 2 initially the ldc and the hdc scenarios are believed to be equally likely columns 1 and 2 show the combinations of the probabilities of a flood in the low damage cost scenario ldc and the high damage cost scenario hdc respectively the present values of costs for our adaptation measures are shown in columns 3 to 7 similar to 38 we observe that the option to delay investment becomes attractive with increasing speed of learning as costs are lowered substantially i e increasing the differences between the two climate change scenarios as we move down the table the gap between the two climate change scenarios decreases thereby lowering the speed of learning at a very slow rate of learning the option to delay investment becomes worthless in such a situation the expectation to receive information in the near future is low while the period of waiting for this updated information is long this is associated with substantial waiting costs instead the decision maker prefers to immediately invest in a nbs without reservoir showing that the additional flexibility has lost its value this is shown by the equal values in columns 3 and 4 costs can be reduced however when the rate of learning is fast the intuition behind these results is that the flood probability changes when we learn about future flood risk under a decreasing flood probability the decision maker is able to avoid unnecessary costs if she defers investment into the future she can still invest in an adaptation measure if the flood probability increases in contrast the flood probability becomes more volatile if the difference between the two climate scenarios increases and learning occurs fast the expected benefits of investing in an adaptation measure increase with an increasing flood probability on the other hand a higher volatility in the flood probability will also cause a larger speed of learning in which case a decision maker would not invest this means that the upside risk of deferring investment is increased without affecting the downside risk 38 4 2 partial information next we observe that if the decision maker only updates her beliefs based on the observed occurrence of an inland flood event she might invest in a sub optimal adaptation measure compared to updating beliefs based on information from both floods and droughts specifically the option to construct a n b s r fails to become cost effective if the hdc scenario is more likely to apply the high investment and maintenance costs of the nbs appear to outweigh its benefits of drought alleviation fig 4 b plots the cost effective adaptation option if we keep the belief of being in the hdc scenario fixed at α 0 0 5 if wetland ecosystems require one to five years to develop the n b s n is the most cost effective option to the left of the grey vertical line however maturing times of six years or higher make increasing pumping capacity more attractive both of these measures fail to address meteorological drought risk fig 4 d shows the expected present value of costs for the cost effective investment options if the beliefs of the decision maker regarding the occurrence of flood events evolve over time and the maturing time of the nbs is fixed at three years we observe that the decision to invest in a n b s n is not affected by a change in beliefs of being in the hdc scenario changing both the maturing time and α 0 we show in table a4 in appendix b a decrease in the maturing time under which the n b s n becomes cost effective in the hdc scenario a measure with a short maturing time becomes cost effective as the decision maker expects flood related damages to be considerably higher in the hdc scenario the additional benefit of mitigating future meteorological droughts as we saw in section 4 1 and which would compensate for a longer maturing time becomes irrelevant if drought risk is being ignored therefore the additional ability to mitigate future drought damages can extend the tolerated maturing time to make a nbs cost effective 4 3 increasing property values the implementation of nbs requires land land use in the oed is predominantly agricultural while agricultural activities are allowed to take place within a n b s n the local water authority needs to purchase the land if retention areas are being used as a reservoir during the summer months in this subsection we assume that competition for land is fierce in the province of groningen agricultural land located in potential retention areas is assumed to be suitable for building these changes in land use correspond to a steep increase in property prices from 5 9 m 2 to 200 m 2 16 16 in 2013 prices for residential areas were 200 m 2 in the province of groningen https watismijnhuiswaard com grondprijzen nederland we observe that the n b s n with a maturing time between four and six years becomes the cost effective option to invest in see table a3 in appendix b at higher maturing times increasing pumping capacity becomes cost effective while the n b s n is negatively affected by higher property prices as well the amount of land which this measure requires for constructing surrounding embankments is much lower compared to the n b s r therefore increasing property prices by a factor of approximately forty leads to the n b s r to fail to become cost effective the price for land that needs to be paid upfront is higher than the future expected benefits of mitigating flood and drought damages 5 discussion 5 1 conditions of cost effectiveness hurdles to the successful implementation of nbs such as retention areas often include the lack of scientific studies on their cost effectiveness compared to grey alternatives 13 20 22 additionally while several studies have compared the cost effectiveness of retention areas to grey alternatives in the context of coastal flood risk 71 72 research on the cost effectiveness of nbs implemented along rivers and streams is still understudied in this article we analyse the cost effectiveness of retention areas as a form of nbs compared to grey alternatives under climate change uncertainty furthermore we investigate three conditions that influence their cost effectiveness 1 the maturing time of the wetland ecosystems integrated into retention areas 2 the amount of climate information used by the decision maker and 3 the value of land required to install such measures below we elaborate on each of the three conditions our results suggest that nbs in form of water retention areas can be a cost effective option to address flood and drought risks compared to grey measures of selective dike heightening and increased pumping capacity results are consistent with other studies on retention areas that show the cost effectiveness of such measures 29 31 comparing expected flood damages of two flood events 29 show that using retention areas for flood protection can turn out to be highly cost effective similarly 31 show how the ability of retention areas to increase water availability for irrigation and to improve river water quality and quantity can be cost effective under different climate change scenarios decision making can profit from delaying investment if the decision maker expects to learn more about the true climate in the future as the construction of an adaptation measure is assumed to be irreversible there is value in waiting for more information about which climate change scenario applies if she decides to wait with the implementation of an adaptation option she needs to weigh the benefits of updated information becoming available during waiting and the costs of being unprepared for extreme weather events however having the option to wait with investing is not attractive for the decision maker in this study delaying investment leaves the oed exposed to both drought and severe 1 in 1000 year flood events in the hdc and ldc scenarios the costs of waiting in form of expected flood and drought damages are therefore considerably higher than the expected benefits of receiving updated climate information in the future besides the expected costs of waiting the speed of learning determines the value of the delay option 38 if the characteristics of the ldc and hdc scenarios are rather different and the decision maker only requires a short period to learn which climate scenario applies being able to delay investment can reduce costs considerably 38 5 1 1 maturing time we observe that the maturing time is a crucial determinant of the cost effectiveness of retention areas we define the maturing time as the time that wetland and peat land ecosystems that have been integrated into retention areas require to develop and provide proper flood protection the range of the maturing time under which retention areas become the cost effective option changes with the beliefs of the decision maker to be in the hdc scenario specifically maturing times of up to nine years make the n b s r the preferred measure to invest in even under strong beliefs that the hdc scenario applies this result reflects the ability of the n b s r to considerably reduce future drought risks thereby compensating for potential flood and drought damages during its maturing time additionally investment and operation costs of retention areas are lower than its grey alternatives of selective dike heightening and pumping capacity however if maturing times exceed nine years the decision maker would prefer to invest in increased pumping capacity of the two sea pumps in the oed our results regarding the maturing time are comparable to the slowly emerging research conducted on peat re wetting and wetland restoration the restoration of a previously abundant natural habitat at the site generally depends on the current geo morphological and environmental conditions as well as the type of ecosystem peat land tidal zone wetland forest regarding coastal salt marshes as a form of coastal flood protection measure pioneer habitats of coastal salt marshes can develop fast under lee conditions and abundant sediment 73 found that typical salt marsh vegetation cover was restored within 10 to 20 years of constructing a flood defence several studies on the restoration of formerly degraded peat lands in the uk and finland found that peat re wetting leads to an improvement in downstream flood safety within one to four years by reducing river peak discharges and flow velocity as well as by delaying flood peaks 48 52 peat land restoration is aimed predominantly at increasing surface roughness in addition various studies point at the potential of woodlands to slow down flood peak speed and to increase temporary flood storage forests older than 9 years in particular have a higher impact on river hydrology 74 75 taking into account the dynamic nature of the impact of woodland on runoff 39 assume that 15 of the flood related benefits are realised in the first year of planting and increase at the same rate until they are fully realised in year 15 given our results decision makers may need to temporarily complement nbs that have extended maturing times such as wetland reforestation 17 17 https www rijksoverheid nl with grey measures such as selective dike heightening in order to mitigate extreme events while retention areas develop 5 1 2 partial information if the decision maker solely uses observations of flood events to update her beliefs about climate change the length of the maturing time of retention areas to be cost effective decreases with an increase in her belief to be in the hdc scenario in this study the decision maker would falsely prefer to invest in a n b s n if its maturing time ranges between four and six years depending on her initial belief that the hdc scenario applies furthermore if the information from drought events is ignored the n b s r fails to become cost effective her investment decision may therefore not be optimal in protecting an area against meteorological droughts if the decision maker holds strong beliefs to be in the hdc scenario increasing pumping capacity becomes the preferred investment option whenever maturing times of retention areas exceed four years while increased pumping capacity provides immediate flood protection it will be inefficient in mitigating the increased occurrence of drought related damages therefore a decision maker s investment decisions may be misguided 5 1 3 increasing property values finally we show that if we assume that the land use of the area in which the n b s r are being constructed changes from agricultural to residential the n b s r fails to become cost effective retention areas thus may fail to become cost effective if property prices are high for example if land use is being changed from agricultural to residential the price for land that needs to be paid upfront may be higher than the future expected benefits of mitigating flood and drought damages our results are similar to 19 51 19 find that the benefits of preserving land for water retention purposes may be lower than forgone opportunity costs if the land located in the designated floodplain would have otherwise been developed in the future instead they advise decision makers to target investments based on the costs of preservation and expected flood damages to reduce costs and increase net benefits similarly 51 show that the benefits of preserving a floodplain can be increased through careful spatial targeting more specifically the authors observe that the opportunity costs of retaining land for the implementation of nbs may partially offset their benefits of avoided flood damages they furthermore highlight the importance of nbs to provide various co benefits including recreational opportunities and aesthetics value especially if property values are considerably high 5 2 reliability of nbs implementing retention areas as a form of nbs is inherently complex 76 however if properly designed constructed and managed retention areas offer the potential to provide cost effective mitigation and adaptation against climate change while providing various benefits to nature and society 21 77 78 however extreme events may adversely affect nbs themselves 79 nbs are dynamic systems that rely on the ability of species and ecosystem processes to adapt to a wide range of climate change impacts 80 if nbs such as retention areas are frequently disturbed by extreme events before the system has sufficiently recovered the ecosystems ecological function and adaptive capacity may substantially decrease 81 in the oed a frequent occurrence of droughts may enhance the severity of consecutive floods if wetland ecosystems are damaged 8 82 active management of the nbs such as reducing pollution or invasive species plays therefore a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events and in enhancing ecological adaptation 81 83 the implementation of retention areas also presupposes an in depth understanding of how the integrated ecosystems provide adaptive capacity against climate change 84 however management and maintenance of nbs may be hampered if decision making is ill informed or cooperation across local regional and national scales is lacking 85 leading to a reduction of their adaptation potential in order to enhance the reliability of nbs an increasing number of studies promote the integration of green and grey adaptation measures 16 86 combining both types of measures has the potential to reduce the impacts of various climate change impacts on the integrated ecosystems to facilitate implementation and management over longer periods and to increase the provisioning of ecosystem services 13 5 3 caveats and limitations several data constraints limit our analysis the estimation of the expected present value of costs do not include socioeconomic uncertainties during the investment decision making process as expected flood and drought damages are determined by the exposure of both urban and rural areas in the oed water system to extreme events we expect changes in land use to affect our results for example agricultural activities may decline while cities are expanding or vice versa we therefore recommend future research to integrate socioeconomic uncertainties into the model to further improve the evaluation of retention areas as a form of nbs that are being implemented in densely populated urban areas in particular furthermore we do not take non market flood damages fatalities and injuries as well as displacement costs into account our study would also benefit from allowing the probabilities of floods and droughts to change over time we expect those probabilities to change in the future based on an increase in weather observations and an improvement in climate modelling while the decision maker receives updated information when waiting with investing into an adaptation measure the underlying climate change scenarios may change as well for example the ipcc updates its climate change scenarios approximately every five years which also implies an update in flood and drought probabilities a possibility to integrate changes in underlying climate scenarios into our model is the inclusion of a transition matrix to determine the probability of changes between climate scenarios 38 using a combination of a transition matrix and the observed frequency of floods and droughts the decision maker is then able to update the flood and drought probabilities as well as changes in the underlying climate scenarios finally we acknowledge that we have solely considered co benefits generated by retention areas in form of the reduction of drought risk and drought related damages as drought risk measures in our case study area solely comprise retention areas with an integrated water reservoir selective dike heightening and the increase in pumping capacity fail to address drought risk in the area however we encourage research comparing retention areas with grey alternatives that both deliver drought benefits related to this is the consideration of co benefits other than a reduction in flood and drought damages such as recreation or the enhancement of wetland ecosystems including a broader range of co benefits generated by nature based adaptation measures in particular may turn a nbs into a more favourable choice to invest in even under longer maturing times or higher property prices for example 39 observe that the share of flood regulation benefits depends on the planting location of a forest where flood regulation related co benefits are of greater importance for wetland forests compared to forests restored on hill slopes almost 99 of co benefits generated by the latter comprise carbon sequestration water quality improvement recreation aesthetic appeal and education 6 conclusion climate change requires the implementation of effective adaptation measures that simultaneously address flood and drought risks however because the extent and pace of climate change is still uncertain decision making on the timing and location of adaptation measures remains challenging especially as such adaptation measures are frequently characterised by long lead and lifetimes recent years have seen an increase in the implementation of green adaptation and of nature based solutions nbs in particular as alternatives to grey measures such as dike heightening and increased pumping capacity in contrast to grey adaptation measures nbs have the inherent potential to successfully adapt to changing environmental conditions however the implementation of nbs is frequently met with concern especially the small number of studies on the cost effectiveness of nbs has been identified as a major research gap on the evaluation and successful implementation of green adaptation measures the goal of this paper was to compare the cost effectiveness of retention areas as a form of nbs to grey adaptation and to identify the conditions under which such measures become cost effective under uncertain climate change the defining parameters in our study under which retention areas become cost effectiveness are 1 their maturing time 2 the availability of only partial climate information and 3 the property value of land on which retention areas are being constructed we find that the implementation of retention areas with an integrated reservoir to mitigate meteorological droughts is the cost effective option to invest in if its maturing time does not exceed nine years this is because the expected benefits following the implementation of such a nbs are higher than the costs of waiting until it provides proper flood protection nbs with maturing times up to nine years include peat re wetting and wetland restoration which has been integrated into retention areas in the oed regarding nbs with long maturing times of nine years or more such as wetland reforestation decision makers may need to complement the nbs with the implementation of grey measures such as selective dike heightening in order to mitigate extreme events while the nbs matures particularly if inland flood risk and meteorological droughts are expected to increase in the future the literature on the effect of the maturing time on flood and drought risk is only starting to emerge we therefore encourage further research into this area moreover we find that the choice of adaptation measure depends upon the beliefs about the severity of climate change and hence upon the climate information obtained our sensitivity analysis demonstrates how limiting the access to information may result in the choice of adaptation measures that fail to properly protect against drought risk finally we observe that the nbs with large land requirements such as a retention area with integrated reservoir fail to become cost effective if property prices are high the benefits of avoided flood and drought damages may be dwarfed by the opportunities of retaining land for retention purposes if the land is designated as residential area our findings confirm the important factor of property prices of the land on which a nbs is supposed to be constructed while our model incorporates uncertainty of climate change we do not take socioeconomic uncertainty into consideration due to data constraints furthermore we encourage further research into quantifying the impacts of droughts on the performance of nbs to mitigate flood risk we expect that droughts could be detrimental to the functioning of ecosystems of a nbs additionally one could incorporate co benefits other than reductions in flood and drought damages such as recreation or the enhancement of ecosystems into an economic appraisal of adaptation measures therefore we believe that our results are conservative estimates we expect that the inclusion of various co benefits other than avoided flood damages would further improve the cost effectiveness of our nbs potentially extending the maturing time and property values under which nbs become cost effectiveness alternatives credit authorship contribution statement lennart g vogelsang

8631,willingness to pay wtp has commonly been used as a metric for the valuation of environmental goods and services recent studies have also recommended the use of willingness to volunteer wtv as a measure for valuation especially in developing countries with low monetary income and missing or imperfect labor markets the joint households decision to contribute money and time however is often overlooked in these studies when households are willing to contribute both time and money using wtp or wtv alone can underestimate their preferences for environmental goods and services this study examines both households wtp and wtv for the danda river restoration in nepal using survey data of 752 households residing near the river by jointly estimating wtp and wtv this study finds robust public support for improving the river in both time and monetary forms although the proportion of respondents reporting positive wtv is higher wealthier households however prefer the payment option and are significantly less willing to contribute their time we also find that households that perceive more direct benefits from an improved danda river express higher wtp but are not significantly likely to volunteer more time suggesting that volunteering decisions may not purely be motivated by the benefits households perceive from a clean river keywords river restoration willingness to pay willingness to volunteer joint estimation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction public willingness to contribute towards improving environmental goods and services has been long studied by economists 1 2 given that environment is an essential input for human flourishing and suitability studies find robust public willingness to support environmental management programs as many developing countries grapple with the problem of environmental degradation policymakers face the difficult trade off between economic growth and environmental conservation 3 as such cost benefit analyses can provide clear policy guidelines for effective environmental management to that end information about the total value of environmental management and public willingness to contribute can immensely help guide policy actions willingness to pay wtp has been traditionally used as a valuation measure for environmental goods 4 7 however several recent studies 8 13 have also experimented with the willingness to volunteer wtv especially in developing areas with low monetary income and missing or imperfect labor markets the use of wtv as the mode of contribution in non market valuation studies has been found to increase the propensity of public participation relative to wtp in many of these studies 8 13 as such wtp may not adequately measure the value of environmental goods in places where people s ability to pay is already low which could undervalue goods and services 14 a case in point is a study conducted in the koshi basin of nepal 13 which demonstrates that the benefits measured in labor hours are higher than in terms of monetary payment furthermore when households are willing to contribute both money and labor hours wtp alone can grossly underestimate the total value of contributions 15 while the literature on the use of time and monetary contributions for environmental services is growing little attention has been paid to how households from developing settings distribute their time and monetary contributions 11 15 when households exhibit preferences for both time and money the decision on the contribution levels is not likely to be independent households total contribution comprises the combined value of volunteering and monetary contributions however households can choose the contribution levels in each payment mode to optimize the total value of their contributions given that households decisions to contribute time may strongly influence their decision to contribute their money and vice versa households contribution decisions may not be fully understood if each decision is examined independently 16 this may particularly be true when households have low income to contribute in terms of money but also must consider the opportunity cost of giving up the limited working hours that could otherwise be used to generate income for themselves further the independent assumption of willingness to pay wtp and willingness to volunteer wtv could bias the estimates of the total value of the environmental services under consideration this study uses the case of danda river restoration which flows through the rupandehi district of nepal to examine household decisions for time and monetary contributions the river is within the proximity of the world heritage site of lumbini the birthplace of the founder of buddhism lord buddha due to industrial runoffs and household sewage and solid waste disposal in the river the water quality in the danda river has been continually degrading an iucn international union for conservation of nature environmental impact study reports that the disposal of untreated waste is degrading the quality of surface water in the region around lumbini to the point that the water is unsafe for household use and wild animals 17 in a developing country like nepal where people rely heavily on local rivers for sustenance river water pollution can have far reaching impacts on the local communities 18 households that use polluted river water for domestic purposes such as drinking cooking and washing are likely to have poor health 19 besides river pollution places significant economic burdens on households that depend on rivers for agriculture and fishing given the significance of the river to the local community and the biodiversity in the region there is a pressing need for a restoration program to clean the river this study offers insights on public support for improving the danda river we consider both wtp and wtv in labor hours while evaluating the total household contribution for the river restoration we use the survey based contingent valuation cv method to elicit public wtp and wtv cv is a commonly used technique to assign value for non market goods such as environmental restoration 20 the basic theory behind cv is that individuals try to maximize their utility through their preferences within a budget constraint 6 in developing countries where data on revealed preferences for the clean environment are often scant or unavailable 14 21 the cv method conveniently allows individuals to express their preference for non market goods such as river water quality that are otherwise hard to quantify given that survey respondents decision for one mode of contribution is conditional on the decision for the other which could depend on the sequence of the valuation questions estimating wtp and wtv independently could lead to biased estimates 15 therefore our methodological contribution entails the joint estimation of wtp and wtv to better understand preferences for either monetary cash contributions or contributions in time in addition to understanding household preferences for time and monetary contributions the study also offers insights into the underlying factors influencing these contribution decisions we are particularly interested in the influence of household wealth on wtp and wtv decisions considering that wealthier households may have a higher marginal value of time we examine whether they prefer to contribute money as compared to time we also investigate whether the perception of deriving direct benefits in terms of safe drinking water health agriculture fishing increase in land house prices cultural values and recreational activities from an improved danda river influences households to contribute both money and time for the river restoration as a preview of our results the joint estimation of wtp and wtv reveals a statistically significant positive correlation between the two decisions suggesting that the decision to pay is not independent of the decision to volunteer households willing to contribute their time are also likely to contribute their money however wealthier households do exhibit a strong preference for money they are more willing to contribute money but are significantly less willing to contribute their time we also find that perceived benefits from an improved river significantly impact households wtp but do not impact their wtv decisions suggesting that volunteering decisions may not purely be motivated by the benefits households perceive from an improved river and that the households consider other factors while deciding to contribute their time 2 literature review despite the importance of the topic a limited number of studies have examined individuals and households decisions for time and monetary contributions together furthermore the existing economics literature on money and time contributions has so far remained divided about the relationship between the two preferences 22 23 were among the first to study the relationship between money and time donations for public charities based on the negative cross price effect of the monetary contribution tax on time these studies find money and time gross complements moreover brown and lankford 1992 suggest that individuals tend to prefer monetary contribution over time 24 examine the relationship between the two preferences using a utility maximization model and find empirical evidence supporting a positive association based on a negative cross price elasticity of charitable donation tax on time contribution however 25 26 find money and time contributions to be negatively correlated 25 considers wage as the opportunity cost of volunteering and finds that higher income individuals prefer contributing money over time two recent studies 16 27 also argue in favor of substitutability using a us national survey on household charitable giving 16 finds that any tax incentive to increase monetary contribution likely decreases time contribution however due to people s general taste for contributing the overall correlation between money and time remains positive 27 examines the effect of canadian tax policy reforms on money and time donations and finds positive cross price effects of money donation tax on time donation except for 27 all these studies use data from the us 28 29 examine decisions for money and time contributions together using data from europe 28 emphasize the need to examine the role of individual preferences and attitudes in determining donations especially in countries that give less importance to tax incentives using data from italy the study finds that impure altruism in the form of warm glow and social reputation significantly affect an individual s decision to contribute several past studies 6 30 have also argued that individual contributions could be motivated by impure altruism as they seek some benefits and thus gain utility from their contributions which could explain an individual s willingness to contribute 29 using social survey data from 19 european countries consider the impact of the opportunity cost of time on charitable contributions and find that individuals with a higher opportunity cost of time are significantly more likely to prefer money over time both 28 29 find a net positive correlation between money and time contributions the combined decisions of households willingness to contribute money and time for environmental restoration have often been overlooked in the environmental economics literature in the existing studies willingness to pay is commonly taken as a valuation metric for environmental goods and services however several recent studies 9 13 have also recommended the use of willingness to volunteer in labor hours as a metric for valuation particularly in the context of developing countries where households monetary income are low 9 considers both wtp and wtv to avoid a 20 decrease in urban trees in aotearoa new zealand the study finds that higher income concern for the environment loss perceived benefits from trees and the belief that trees have the right to exist have positive and significant impacts on wtp although it does not empirically estimate wtv the study reports that 70 of the households that agreed to pay also agreed to volunteer 11 use both labor and monetary payment attributes in the same choice set to investigate household willingness to pay to mitigate invasive plants in chitwan nation park of nepal the study finds that 36 of the respondents preferred the monetary option while 63 preferred the labor payment option suggesting a strong preference for volunteering another study by ref 12 finds a similar inclination among households by taking wtp and willingness to provide labor as a single binary term the study suggests that households with higher land education an off farm income and male respondent are likely to choose the monetary option households with more family members higher distance and that visit the community forest are more likely to choose the labor payment option 13 compare households willingness to pay and work for watershed services in the koshi river basin of nepal by splitting the sample into two halves based on the mode of contributions the study finds that public participation propensity to say yes and the estimation of the net social benefits were higher when labor hour was used as a payment option 14 also examines the difference between wtp and wtv for improved water quality in cambodia by separating the sample by the two contribution modes the study finds no significant difference between the use of money and time as payment vehicles the study nonetheless recommends exploring wtv as a valuation measure in areas with missing or non functioning labor markets a recent study by ref 31 use a split sample choice experiment design to investigate farmers preferences for flood reduction using money time and rice payment as the measure of value the study finds a higher marginal willingness to pay in terms of money than the two non monetary payment modes 15 use a cv survey that includes both money and time payments for reliable access to irrigation water in ethiopia by jointly estimating the two preferences the study crucially finds that these preferences are positively correlated but households are willing to pay more in terms of labor monetary contribution is only one fourth of the total value of the contribution 3 survey and data the data comes from a primary survey conducted in the vicinity of the danda river in the rupandehi district of nepal in 2016 the estimated total catchment area of the river is 70 km2 32 the survey area consisted of 1 urban siddharthanagar and 2 rural areas basantapur and bhagaha that fall within the catchment area the sampling proportion was based on the population size of these three areas the primary objectives of the survey were to gather information about the existing environmental quality mainly the river water quality discern households knowledge and attitude towards the environment and understand public preferences for ecosystem management in the danda river before conducting the final survey the research team participated in a focus group discussion with the local representatives and conducted two rounds of pilot surveys on 50 households to test the questionnaire after making the necessary modifications in the questionnaire the final survey was conducted from 14 409 households residing in the survey area we randomly selected 1 1 the survey area 1 urban and 2 rural areas can be further divided into 28 wards wards are the smallest administrative units in nepal we instructed the enumerators to take random routes in each ward and approach every 5th household and interviewed 752 households for the final survey with a response rate was about 90 the enumerators conducted in person interviews with households in the local dialects we only interviewed household representatives who are 18 years and above after the survey was conducted river water quality was also tested in 16 different spatial locations to assess the pollution level in the river the following map fig 1 shows the danda river and the surveyed households in the study area for the most part the river itself serves as a boundary between the urban and rural areas the area on the left of the river on the map is siddharthanagar municipality and the rural areas of basantapur and bhagaha are on the right of the river 4 descriptive statistics the following table presents descriptive statistics for all the variables used in the analysis table 1 the two outcome variables are households willingness to pay wtp and willingness to volunteer wtv for the danda river restoration a survey based cv method was used to obtain information about the amount of money and volunteering time households are willing to contribute to the danda river restoration the households were provided a hypothetical scenario of implementing a program that would restore the danda river and were asked how much they are willing to pay and volunteer for the program if the program were to be implemented the described river restoration program entails improving river water quality where it is suitable for boating fishing and irrigation protecting riverbanks from current 50 feet 150 feet from habitation and encroachment increasing the share of riverbanks having trees from current 10 80 and monitoring water quality regularly for the payment option the respondents were informed that the money would be collected annually through a local municipality tax for 5 years the surveyed households reported that they are willing to pay between nepalese rupees nrs 0 to 6000 approximately 55 per year for the program with the mean wtp being nrs 386 similarly the households reported that they are willing to volunteer between 0 and 16 h per week with the mean wtv being 2 5 h one of the restrictions in the survey design is that an open ended valuation format was used to obtain wtp and wtv values the open ended format has often been criticized for not being incentive compatible and having higher preference uncertainty compared to the recommended discrete choice format 33 our choice of open ended format followed from our pretest where we found a good understanding of the valuation scenario among survey respondents and high response rates for wtp and wtv questions in our final survey most households 84 63 were able to answer the wtp and or wtv questions and provide their maximum wtp and wtv values further we used the same open ended elicitation format for both wtv and wtp questions so that we could estimate them jointly given that an open ended format does not suffer from starting point and yea saying biases and directly provides a respondent s maximum wtp it also has some clear statistical advantages 34 in the survey the wtv question was presented before the wtp question and the respondents were not informed that they would also be asked about their wtp while asking the wtv question it is therefore difficult to know if the respondents would have chosen the same wtv and wtp values had they been timely informed this design may enforce bias towards a higher preference for volunteering which could overestimate wtv however a recent study by ref 15 hints that the order of the questions may not significantly affect household preferences the contribution in terms of volunteering is higher even when the volunteering question is second in the order the explanatory variables of interest are household wealth wealth and perceived benefits from an improved danda river perceived benefits household wealth includes 20 different assets such as houses vehicles and electronic gadgets owned by households we create a wealth index using the principal component factor method based on this index the households are divided into five wealth quintiles in increasing order households in the lowest wealth quintile are considered very poor and in the highest wealth quintile are considered very rich we use household wealth as an indicator of households economic well being 35 36 as for the perceived benefits households were asked to report if they think that they will benefit from an improved danda river in the following ways health agriculture land house value drinking water fishing recreation and culture respondents were asked to answer either yes or no to each of the seven options the households were allowed to choose more than one option we created a composite index of perceived agricultural land house value drinking water fishing recreational and cultural benefits by adding responses to the seven options the index ranges from 2 to 7 and the values are in ascending order to control for possible heterogeneity due to household characteristics and spatial variation we include variables for distance to the danda river respondent s subjective river water quality rating education sex total family members in the households occupation of the household head age and the number of years lived in the community in the empirical model to obtain information about the subjective river water quality we asked the respondents to rate the quality of river water on a scale of 1 10 with 1 being completely polluted 10 being completely clean and 5 being halfway in between based on their perception of the river water quality the occupation variable has been divided into 3 categories those who do not earn unemployed students and housewives those who earn by working for a fixed number of hours government officers teachers it and health professionals and those who earn by working variable hours daily labor farmer and businessman we take the first category as the base we expect higher wtp for the latter two occupation categories for those who earn are more likely to contribute money further we expect those who earn by working variable hours to express lower wtv since they may have less leisure time for volunteering their opportunity cost of time is likely to be higher 4 1 households preferences for money and time contributions one of the main objectives of this study is to examine household preferences for money and time contributions in the study area 15 37 of the households did not answer the wtp and or wtv questions those who answered except for 4 households almost all of them reported that they are willing to contribute to the danda river restoration program table 2 among them 84 36 of the households reported that they are willing to contribute at least some money and time whereas 13 43 reported that they are willing to volunteer only and 1 58 reported that they are willing to pay only these findings reveal two crucial pieces of information about the households living in the study area first in line with 8 10 and 13 a significant proportion of households are willing to contribute their time second a large percentage of those households are also willing to contribute their money to the danda river restoration fig 2 depicts households stated preferences for monetary payment and volunteering from the data the scatterplot shows that households state preferences for a clean river through both wtv and wtp the scatterplot also suggests a likely trade off between wtp and wtv at the two extreme ends high values of wtp and wtv households with a strong preference for volunteering reported lower wtp while some households with high wtp values reported lower wtv the following 2 bar graphs fig 3 show wtp and wtv by wealth quintiles the graphs indicate a declining overall trend in wtv by wealth categories poor households are willing to volunteer more hours than wealthier households the opposite is true for willingness to pay wealthier households are more willing to pay this suggests that household wealth could be an important determinant for a strong preference for money nonetheless a multivariate empirical analysis is required to establish this finding 5 empirical framework our empirical analysis builds on the theoretical models presented in refs 37 38 and 14 the underlying assumption of the theoretical framework is that households gain utility through the consumption of goods and services good environment and leisure given their income and time constraints environmental degradation can lower the utility level however the indirect utility relation in equation 1 shows that households can compensate with monetary contributions wtp out of their income y to improve environmental quality q0 q1 for a given vector of full prices p and socioeconomic characters z 1 v q1 y wtp p z v q0 y p z likewise the household can also contribute labor hours wtv out of their available time budget l to improve environmental quality q0 q1 as expressed in equation 2 2 v q1 l wtv p z v q0 l p z when households can choose to contribute both time and money for environmental improvement the total value of their money and labor payment i e wtp wtv represents the total contribution of the household given the time and income constraints the households can choose the level of contributions in either or both forms to maximize their utility through environmental improvement if a mode of contribution is costly for a household the household is expected to choose less of it for instance we can expect the volunteering level of households to decrease when the opportunity cost of their time increases similarly a cash constrained household may exhibit zero or lower wtp 5 1 empirical strategy based on this theoretical specification we build a system of two equations to estimate the households wtp and wtv for the danda river restoration program we are interested in understanding how households distribute their wtp and wtv and what factors influence these preferences 1 w t p i β 0 β 1 w e a l t h i β 2 p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s i δ x i η i u i 2 w t v i α 0 α 1 w e a l t h i α 2 p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s i θ x i η i v i where c o v u i v i 0 and w t p i w t p i i f w t p i 0 0 i f w t p i 0 in the above system of equations w t p i is the outcome variable in equation 1 wtp is a continuous variable ranging from nrs 0 to 6000 since a large proportion of wtp values are less than the mean wtp 66 8 the distribution of wtp is highly skewed to the right figure 4 left in appendix a1 we take the natural log of wtp to normalize its distribution to avoid taking the log of 0 values we added 1 to all wtp values before taking the log 39 adding 1 to all wtp values before the log transformation does not significantly change our wtp values and efficiently preserves a large sample size however the new distribution is not entirely normal because of a high percentage of 0 values figure 4 right in appendix a1 14 of respondents who answered the wtp question are unwilling to pay therefore in our tobit regression model we censor the log of w t p i from below at 0 similarly w t v i is the outcome variable in equation 2 wtv is a count variable and its distribution is also highly skewed to the right figure 5 left in appendix a1 given the issue of simultaneously estimating a linear regression and a count model we also use a linear regression to estimate wtv 2 2 for sensitivity analysis we also used count models poisson and negative binomial to analyze wtv separately without transforming the data the regression results are consistent with the main results from our preferred joint estimation model we take the natural log of wtv values to normalize the distribution since wtv values range from 0 to 16 adding 1 to all wtv values would largely change the original wtv values therefore to avoid taking the log of 0 values 0 1 was added to all the wtv values before taking the log the distribution of the natural log of wtv is presented in figure 5 right w e a l t h i and p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s i are the main explanatory variables which are the wealth quantile based on household assets and the composite index of benefits households perceive from a clean danda river respectively x i is the vector of all socio economic spatial and other controls we use the distance to the danda river subjective river quality rating education sex total family members in the households occupation of the household head age and the number of years lived in the community the municipality level fixed effect η i has been added to the model to control for locational variation lastly u i and v i represent the errors in the two models given that households wtp and wtv decisions could be correlated results coming out of separate estimations of the wtp equation and the wtv equation may not provide a comprehensive understanding of household contributions 29 37 therefore these two reduced form equations are estimated simultaneously by allowing a non zero correlation between their error terms the estimate of the correlation term reveals the interrelation between time and money preferences 15 29 a positive correlation would suggest that households that are willing to volunteer are also likely to pay we jointly estimate equations 1 and 2 using the full information maximum likelihood estimation mle procedure in stata 40 given our relatively small sample size we bootstrap each regression for 200 replications to estimate the standard errors for robustness check we use two sets of regressions in the first regression we consider the raw form of wtv as the dependent variable instead of its natural log in the second regression we consider the natural log of wtp in the uncensored form 6 results table 3 shows joint estimates of wtp and wtv for the danda river restoration in model 1 the logs of wtp and wtv are regressed on household wealth wealth and perceived benefits from an improved danda river perceived benefits controlling for the location the coefficient on wealth is significantly positive at the 1 level for wtp and significantly negative at the 5 level for wtv these results indicate that wealthier households strongly prefer payment as they are significantly more willing to contribute their money and less willing to contribute their time the coefficient on perceived benefits is significantly positive at the 1 level for wtp intriguingly the coefficient for wtv although positive is statistically insignificant these findings suggest that households that perceive more benefits from an improved danda river have higher wtp but are indifferent towards volunteering more time for the improvement another crucial finding from the regression is that the correlation ρ between the error terms of wtp and wtv 0 125 is positive and significant at the 1 level indicating a positive correlation between the two preferences in model 2 we add variables for households subjective rating of river quality river quality rating their distance to the river distance to river and the square of the distance to the river distance square 3 3 while designing the models we tested both linear and squared functional forms of the distance to the river variable the model with the squared form had better predictive power to the regression as expected the effect of river water quality rating is negative and significant on wtp suggesting that households satisfied with river water quality are less likely to pay for river restoration the effect on wtv although negative is insignificant we also find that the coefficient on the distance to the danda river is positive and significant for wtp the inclusion of additional variables does not change the sign and significance of our results from model 1 in model 3 we further add households socio demographic characteristics to the regression again our primary findings do not significantly change with the additional inclusion of households socio demographic characteristics as for our secondary findings we find that education is positively correlated with wtp this result indicates that educated households are more likely to pay reflecting their awareness of the benefits of having a clean river we however find no statistically significant association between education and wtv our results also suggest that males male while indifferent towards monetary contribution are significantly more likely to contribute their time the size of the household total family members has a significant positive impact on wtv for the occupation variable household heads who do not earn are taken as the base and the other two occupation categories office workers and nonoffice workers are compared against the base relative to those who do not earn both office workers and nonoffice workers are significantly more likely to pay which is not surprising given that household heads that earn have money to contribute interestingly there are no significant differences between the base and the other two occupation categories regarding volunteering respondent s age age has a significant negative effect on volunteering but has no impact on wtp finally the number of years households have lived in the community years in community appears to have no impact on any of the contributions the results table reports the aic values for all three models that have been calculated by correcting for the number of observations based on the minimum aic criterion the full model model 3 has better predictive power than the other two models the robust finding on the correlations ρ between the error terms of wtp and wtv in all three models corroborates that household wtp and wtv decisions are indeed correlated even after controlling for various household characteristics from our preferred model 3 conditional on giving we estimate the mean wtp value of nrs 341 42 and the mean wtv value of 2 17 h 6 1 results from robustness check tables 4 and 5 appendix a2 present results from the two sets of regressions used for the robustness check overall our main findings are robust to different model specifications and functional forms of the dependent variables the correlation term is positive and significant in all the models as for our secondary results the sign and significance of our variable coefficients are roughly consistent across different models except for the education and age variables education is positively correlated with wtv when wtv is considered in its raw form table 4 and table 5 respondent s age has no significant impact on wtv when wtv is taken in its raw form table 4 and table 5 likewise age has significant negative effects on wtp when the natural log of wtp is taken in the uncensored form table 5 7 discussion households contribution decisions are intricate and closely tied to their resource allocation decisions in the context of developing countries where households are considerably money constrained they can offer their time for environmental improvement however they must also consider the opportunity cost of giving up their limited working hours that could otherwise be used for generating income to help support their family as a clean environment is essential for the economic sustenance of the local community the critical policy question is how best the public can contribute to an environmental restoration program which depends on how households optimize their total contribution value in terms of money and time our survey data and empirical results reveal essential findings on household preferences for money and time contributions to improve the danda river we find robust public support for improving the river as reflected in households willingness to contribute their money and time 84 36 of the households who answered the payment and volunteering questions reported positive wtp and wtv values furthermore households that are willing to contribute their time are also likely to pay as suggested by the positive correlation between the unobservable determinants of wtp and wtv with these findings we validate that using wtp alone may underestimate the social benefit of environmental restoration we importantly note that there is a higher preference for time contribution households higher preference for volunteering is expected for several reasons people often use bartering and work exchange in low income areas as trading options 14 therefore they are more familiar with time allocation it is equally likely that households may view labor payment differently than monetary payment especially when the wage rates are not well defined in the context of nepal the under utilization of labor 30 underutilized can also help explain the higher preference for time contribution among the public 13 41 this further recommends policymakers to assess the value of underutilized labor while designing environmental management programs regarding preferences by household characteristics we find that wealthier households have a strong preference for monetary contributions but are significantly less likely to volunteer one possible explanation for why wealthier households strongly prefer monetary contribution is that they may have a greater opportunity cost of time and are likely to place a high value on their time therefore they are more willing to donate money and less willing to donate time 12 36 36 refers to this tendency as buying their way out of contributing their time 36 our finding on the positive impact of perceived benefits on wtp aligns with 35 who find that households that derive direct benefits in the form of the amount of firewood from forests are significantly more likely to participate in forest management programs this household tendency is also observed by ref 42 who find that those who fish in a mangrove region are willing to pay more for mangrove protection than those who fish outside because they perceive more benefits from the mangrove it is interesting to note that perceived benefits from an improved danda river do not influence households decisions for volunteering this suggests that households may not be purely motivated by the utilities they perceive from a clean river when deciding to volunteer for river restoration households wtv could be influenced by their belief that the river should be clean and they are willing to donate their time to clean the river regardless of the benefits they may gain donating time could also be considered a socially responsible thing to do however it is also likely that some other forms of personal benefits such as warm glow and enhanced social reputation could motivate the households to contribute their time 28 30 aside from our main findings some results warrant further discussion we find that women express lower wtv than men which aligns with the findings in ref 29 the finding differs from the discussion presented in ref 43 that women are more likely to exhibit pro environmental attitudes and are more likely to have a strong preference for a clean environment however we should also note that in the context of a developing country like nepal where the societal structure is strictly patriarchal women may have higher restrictions on volunteering activities outside of their houses therefore the lower wtv among women may not necessarily be the function of environmental attitudes but gender related activity restrictions 43 our finding that men and women have statistically insignificant wtp further supports this argument the findings for the occupations of the households are also interesting while the office and nonoffice workers are significantly more likely to pay than those who do not earn which we had anticipated there are no significant differences in their wtv we had particularly anticipated nonoffice workers who work variable hours to express lower wtv values as they are likely to have less leisure time for volunteering 29 however individuals general taste for contribution could likely overcome their opportunity cost of time contribution individuals may also view volunteering as an investment to build human and social capital through volunteering work and social interactions 28 29 in the context of our study farmers and businessmen may also have strong incentives to improve the river as a clean river is closely associated with an increase in agricultural production and land house value overall our results on wtv suggest that volunteering decisions could be a complex process and external non economic factors such as social reputation and restrictions could primarily affect households wtv a counterintuitive finding of this study is that households wtp is not affected by the distance decay effect distance has a positive effect on wtp generally distance to a resource is expected to negatively correlate with wtp because the user cost increases proportionally with the distance 44 this unanticipated result points toward an unaccounted spatial heterogeneity within the study area which could positively correlate wtp and distance 45 for instance wtp driven by higher non use values which households living further away from the danda river could exhibit may not conform to a monotonic distance decay pattern 39 further the affluent central market in our study area is located at a distance from the danda river as established in our study wealthier households are more likely to pay for the river restoration we observe that on average households in the poorest wealth quantiles live closest to the river and that the distance to the river increases for the first three wealth quintiles however this relationship is not apparent for the households in the top two wealth quintiles while we have controlled for wealth and other household characteristics in our regression estimates there could still be some unexplained socioeconomic factors that could be forcing a positive wtp with distance we note that further research is warranted to understand this spatial association fully which is beyond the scope of this study 8 conclusion this study examines households preferences for contributions of money and time to support the danda river restoration by jointly estimating households wtp and wtv this study makes the case that given the likely dependence of households decisions to contribute money and time households contributions towards an environmental good and the factors that influence their decision to contribute may not be understood fully when the two decisions are considered independently our regression results from the joint estimation of wtp and wtv indicate that households wtp and wtv are significantly correlated furthermore they have a positive correlation this result has an important policy implication in that any policy targeted to motivate the public to contribute their money for the river restoration will also have the added benefit of generating more time contribution or vice versa another key result is that wealthier households strongly prefer monetary contributions and are significantly less likely to contribute their time perceived benefits from an improved river substantially impact households wtp decisions but do not influence their wtv decision benefits in terms of agriculture land house value drinking water fishing recreation and cultural benefits are considered in this study from a policy standpoint our findings suggest that the river restoration program can increase benefits by asking wealthier households to contribute their money and poorer households to contribute their time furthermore given that the perceived benefits strongly influence wtp decisions policymakers can play an important role in clearly communicating the health economic and cultural benefits of the improved river to the local community which likely increases public perception and monetary contributions in our sample as many as 84 36 of the households who answered the wtp and wtv questions stated that they are willing to contribute both money and time and 13 43 stated that they are willing to contribute their time only in line with the past studies this finding suggests that a significant proportion of households especially in developing countries exhibit their preferences for environmental goods and services through their willingness to contribute their time hence this study recommends using wtv as a metric for non market valuation and incorporating both time and monetary modes of payment in valuation studies to better understand household preferences especially when households are willing to contribute in both forms our findings suggest that the respondents have a higher preference for volunteering the percentage of the households willing to volunteer is higher than the percentage for wtp however the higher percentage could have come from presenting the wtv question before the wtp question in the survey additionally survey respondents did not receive prior information about the wtp question while answering the wtv question this limitation however may not affect our critical findings that the households that are willing to contribute their time are also likely to contribute their money and that the wealthier households have a strong preference for money future research could address this concern by conducting a study in which half or a proportion of the sample receive prior information about the wtv and wtp questions and the remaining sample does not then comparing the obtained wtv and wtp values under two scenarios another interesting future work could be changing the sequence of the two modes of contributions in the survey and testing if the order of the questions changes households decisions future studies could also improve our survey limitations by utilizing other wtp and wtv elicitation formats like the payment card approach and screening zero wtp and wtv responses through protest questions household consent the surveyed households were properly briefed about the study and consents were obtained from all the households author contributions niraj khatiwada writing original draft

8631,willingness to pay wtp has commonly been used as a metric for the valuation of environmental goods and services recent studies have also recommended the use of willingness to volunteer wtv as a measure for valuation especially in developing countries with low monetary income and missing or imperfect labor markets the joint households decision to contribute money and time however is often overlooked in these studies when households are willing to contribute both time and money using wtp or wtv alone can underestimate their preferences for environmental goods and services this study examines both households wtp and wtv for the danda river restoration in nepal using survey data of 752 households residing near the river by jointly estimating wtp and wtv this study finds robust public support for improving the river in both time and monetary forms although the proportion of respondents reporting positive wtv is higher wealthier households however prefer the payment option and are significantly less willing to contribute their time we also find that households that perceive more direct benefits from an improved danda river express higher wtp but are not significantly likely to volunteer more time suggesting that volunteering decisions may not purely be motivated by the benefits households perceive from a clean river keywords river restoration willingness to pay willingness to volunteer joint estimation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction public willingness to contribute towards improving environmental goods and services has been long studied by economists 1 2 given that environment is an essential input for human flourishing and suitability studies find robust public willingness to support environmental management programs as many developing countries grapple with the problem of environmental degradation policymakers face the difficult trade off between economic growth and environmental conservation 3 as such cost benefit analyses can provide clear policy guidelines for effective environmental management to that end information about the total value of environmental management and public willingness to contribute can immensely help guide policy actions willingness to pay wtp has been traditionally used as a valuation measure for environmental goods 4 7 however several recent studies 8 13 have also experimented with the willingness to volunteer wtv especially in developing areas with low monetary income and missing or imperfect labor markets the use of wtv as the mode of contribution in non market valuation studies has been found to increase the propensity of public participation relative to wtp in many of these studies 8 13 as such wtp may not adequately measure the value of environmental goods in places where people s ability to pay is already low which could undervalue goods and services 14 a case in point is a study conducted in the koshi basin of nepal 13 which demonstrates that the benefits measured in labor hours are higher than in terms of monetary payment furthermore when households are willing to contribute both money and labor hours wtp alone can grossly underestimate the total value of contributions 15 while the literature on the use of time and monetary contributions for environmental services is growing little attention has been paid to how households from developing settings distribute their time and monetary contributions 11 15 when households exhibit preferences for both time and money the decision on the contribution levels is not likely to be independent households total contribution comprises the combined value of volunteering and monetary contributions however households can choose the contribution levels in each payment mode to optimize the total value of their contributions given that households decisions to contribute time may strongly influence their decision to contribute their money and vice versa households contribution decisions may not be fully understood if each decision is examined independently 16 this may particularly be true when households have low income to contribute in terms of money but also must consider the opportunity cost of giving up the limited working hours that could otherwise be used to generate income for themselves further the independent assumption of willingness to pay wtp and willingness to volunteer wtv could bias the estimates of the total value of the environmental services under consideration this study uses the case of danda river restoration which flows through the rupandehi district of nepal to examine household decisions for time and monetary contributions the river is within the proximity of the world heritage site of lumbini the birthplace of the founder of buddhism lord buddha due to industrial runoffs and household sewage and solid waste disposal in the river the water quality in the danda river has been continually degrading an iucn international union for conservation of nature environmental impact study reports that the disposal of untreated waste is degrading the quality of surface water in the region around lumbini to the point that the water is unsafe for household use and wild animals 17 in a developing country like nepal where people rely heavily on local rivers for sustenance river water pollution can have far reaching impacts on the local communities 18 households that use polluted river water for domestic purposes such as drinking cooking and washing are likely to have poor health 19 besides river pollution places significant economic burdens on households that depend on rivers for agriculture and fishing given the significance of the river to the local community and the biodiversity in the region there is a pressing need for a restoration program to clean the river this study offers insights on public support for improving the danda river we consider both wtp and wtv in labor hours while evaluating the total household contribution for the river restoration we use the survey based contingent valuation cv method to elicit public wtp and wtv cv is a commonly used technique to assign value for non market goods such as environmental restoration 20 the basic theory behind cv is that individuals try to maximize their utility through their preferences within a budget constraint 6 in developing countries where data on revealed preferences for the clean environment are often scant or unavailable 14 21 the cv method conveniently allows individuals to express their preference for non market goods such as river water quality that are otherwise hard to quantify given that survey respondents decision for one mode of contribution is conditional on the decision for the other which could depend on the sequence of the valuation questions estimating wtp and wtv independently could lead to biased estimates 15 therefore our methodological contribution entails the joint estimation of wtp and wtv to better understand preferences for either monetary cash contributions or contributions in time in addition to understanding household preferences for time and monetary contributions the study also offers insights into the underlying factors influencing these contribution decisions we are particularly interested in the influence of household wealth on wtp and wtv decisions considering that wealthier households may have a higher marginal value of time we examine whether they prefer to contribute money as compared to time we also investigate whether the perception of deriving direct benefits in terms of safe drinking water health agriculture fishing increase in land house prices cultural values and recreational activities from an improved danda river influences households to contribute both money and time for the river restoration as a preview of our results the joint estimation of wtp and wtv reveals a statistically significant positive correlation between the two decisions suggesting that the decision to pay is not independent of the decision to volunteer households willing to contribute their time are also likely to contribute their money however wealthier households do exhibit a strong preference for money they are more willing to contribute money but are significantly less willing to contribute their time we also find that perceived benefits from an improved river significantly impact households wtp but do not impact their wtv decisions suggesting that volunteering decisions may not purely be motivated by the benefits households perceive from an improved river and that the households consider other factors while deciding to contribute their time 2 literature review despite the importance of the topic a limited number of studies have examined individuals and households decisions for time and monetary contributions together furthermore the existing economics literature on money and time contributions has so far remained divided about the relationship between the two preferences 22 23 were among the first to study the relationship between money and time donations for public charities based on the negative cross price effect of the monetary contribution tax on time these studies find money and time gross complements moreover brown and lankford 1992 suggest that individuals tend to prefer monetary contribution over time 24 examine the relationship between the two preferences using a utility maximization model and find empirical evidence supporting a positive association based on a negative cross price elasticity of charitable donation tax on time contribution however 25 26 find money and time contributions to be negatively correlated 25 considers wage as the opportunity cost of volunteering and finds that higher income individuals prefer contributing money over time two recent studies 16 27 also argue in favor of substitutability using a us national survey on household charitable giving 16 finds that any tax incentive to increase monetary contribution likely decreases time contribution however due to people s general taste for contributing the overall correlation between money and time remains positive 27 examines the effect of canadian tax policy reforms on money and time donations and finds positive cross price effects of money donation tax on time donation except for 27 all these studies use data from the us 28 29 examine decisions for money and time contributions together using data from europe 28 emphasize the need to examine the role of individual preferences and attitudes in determining donations especially in countries that give less importance to tax incentives using data from italy the study finds that impure altruism in the form of warm glow and social reputation significantly affect an individual s decision to contribute several past studies 6 30 have also argued that individual contributions could be motivated by impure altruism as they seek some benefits and thus gain utility from their contributions which could explain an individual s willingness to contribute 29 using social survey data from 19 european countries consider the impact of the opportunity cost of time on charitable contributions and find that individuals with a higher opportunity cost of time are significantly more likely to prefer money over time both 28 29 find a net positive correlation between money and time contributions the combined decisions of households willingness to contribute money and time for environmental restoration have often been overlooked in the environmental economics literature in the existing studies willingness to pay is commonly taken as a valuation metric for environmental goods and services however several recent studies 9 13 have also recommended the use of willingness to volunteer in labor hours as a metric for valuation particularly in the context of developing countries where households monetary income are low 9 considers both wtp and wtv to avoid a 20 decrease in urban trees in aotearoa new zealand the study finds that higher income concern for the environment loss perceived benefits from trees and the belief that trees have the right to exist have positive and significant impacts on wtp although it does not empirically estimate wtv the study reports that 70 of the households that agreed to pay also agreed to volunteer 11 use both labor and monetary payment attributes in the same choice set to investigate household willingness to pay to mitigate invasive plants in chitwan nation park of nepal the study finds that 36 of the respondents preferred the monetary option while 63 preferred the labor payment option suggesting a strong preference for volunteering another study by ref 12 finds a similar inclination among households by taking wtp and willingness to provide labor as a single binary term the study suggests that households with higher land education an off farm income and male respondent are likely to choose the monetary option households with more family members higher distance and that visit the community forest are more likely to choose the labor payment option 13 compare households willingness to pay and work for watershed services in the koshi river basin of nepal by splitting the sample into two halves based on the mode of contributions the study finds that public participation propensity to say yes and the estimation of the net social benefits were higher when labor hour was used as a payment option 14 also examines the difference between wtp and wtv for improved water quality in cambodia by separating the sample by the two contribution modes the study finds no significant difference between the use of money and time as payment vehicles the study nonetheless recommends exploring wtv as a valuation measure in areas with missing or non functioning labor markets a recent study by ref 31 use a split sample choice experiment design to investigate farmers preferences for flood reduction using money time and rice payment as the measure of value the study finds a higher marginal willingness to pay in terms of money than the two non monetary payment modes 15 use a cv survey that includes both money and time payments for reliable access to irrigation water in ethiopia by jointly estimating the two preferences the study crucially finds that these preferences are positively correlated but households are willing to pay more in terms of labor monetary contribution is only one fourth of the total value of the contribution 3 survey and data the data comes from a primary survey conducted in the vicinity of the danda river in the rupandehi district of nepal in 2016 the estimated total catchment area of the river is 70 km2 32 the survey area consisted of 1 urban siddharthanagar and 2 rural areas basantapur and bhagaha that fall within the catchment area the sampling proportion was based on the population size of these three areas the primary objectives of the survey were to gather information about the existing environmental quality mainly the river water quality discern households knowledge and attitude towards the environment and understand public preferences for ecosystem management in the danda river before conducting the final survey the research team participated in a focus group discussion with the local representatives and conducted two rounds of pilot surveys on 50 households to test the questionnaire after making the necessary modifications in the questionnaire the final survey was conducted from 14 409 households residing in the survey area we randomly selected 1 1 the survey area 1 urban and 2 rural areas can be further divided into 28 wards wards are the smallest administrative units in nepal we instructed the enumerators to take random routes in each ward and approach every 5th household and interviewed 752 households for the final survey with a response rate was about 90 the enumerators conducted in person interviews with households in the local dialects we only interviewed household representatives who are 18 years and above after the survey was conducted river water quality was also tested in 16 different spatial locations to assess the pollution level in the river the following map fig 1 shows the danda river and the surveyed households in the study area for the most part the river itself serves as a boundary between the urban and rural areas the area on the left of the river on the map is siddharthanagar municipality and the rural areas of basantapur and bhagaha are on the right of the river 4 descriptive statistics the following table presents descriptive statistics for all the variables used in the analysis table 1 the two outcome variables are households willingness to pay wtp and willingness to volunteer wtv for the danda river restoration a survey based cv method was used to obtain information about the amount of money and volunteering time households are willing to contribute to the danda river restoration the households were provided a hypothetical scenario of implementing a program that would restore the danda river and were asked how much they are willing to pay and volunteer for the program if the program were to be implemented the described river restoration program entails improving river water quality where it is suitable for boating fishing and irrigation protecting riverbanks from current 50 feet 150 feet from habitation and encroachment increasing the share of riverbanks having trees from current 10 80 and monitoring water quality regularly for the payment option the respondents were informed that the money would be collected annually through a local municipality tax for 5 years the surveyed households reported that they are willing to pay between nepalese rupees nrs 0 to 6000 approximately 55 per year for the program with the mean wtp being nrs 386 similarly the households reported that they are willing to volunteer between 0 and 16 h per week with the mean wtv being 2 5 h one of the restrictions in the survey design is that an open ended valuation format was used to obtain wtp and wtv values the open ended format has often been criticized for not being incentive compatible and having higher preference uncertainty compared to the recommended discrete choice format 33 our choice of open ended format followed from our pretest where we found a good understanding of the valuation scenario among survey respondents and high response rates for wtp and wtv questions in our final survey most households 84 63 were able to answer the wtp and or wtv questions and provide their maximum wtp and wtv values further we used the same open ended elicitation format for both wtv and wtp questions so that we could estimate them jointly given that an open ended format does not suffer from starting point and yea saying biases and directly provides a respondent s maximum wtp it also has some clear statistical advantages 34 in the survey the wtv question was presented before the wtp question and the respondents were not informed that they would also be asked about their wtp while asking the wtv question it is therefore difficult to know if the respondents would have chosen the same wtv and wtp values had they been timely informed this design may enforce bias towards a higher preference for volunteering which could overestimate wtv however a recent study by ref 15 hints that the order of the questions may not significantly affect household preferences the contribution in terms of volunteering is higher even when the volunteering question is second in the order the explanatory variables of interest are household wealth wealth and perceived benefits from an improved danda river perceived benefits household wealth includes 20 different assets such as houses vehicles and electronic gadgets owned by households we create a wealth index using the principal component factor method based on this index the households are divided into five wealth quintiles in increasing order households in the lowest wealth quintile are considered very poor and in the highest wealth quintile are considered very rich we use household wealth as an indicator of households economic well being 35 36 as for the perceived benefits households were asked to report if they think that they will benefit from an improved danda river in the following ways health agriculture land house value drinking water fishing recreation and culture respondents were asked to answer either yes or no to each of the seven options the households were allowed to choose more than one option we created a composite index of perceived agricultural land house value drinking water fishing recreational and cultural benefits by adding responses to the seven options the index ranges from 2 to 7 and the values are in ascending order to control for possible heterogeneity due to household characteristics and spatial variation we include variables for distance to the danda river respondent s subjective river water quality rating education sex total family members in the households occupation of the household head age and the number of years lived in the community in the empirical model to obtain information about the subjective river water quality we asked the respondents to rate the quality of river water on a scale of 1 10 with 1 being completely polluted 10 being completely clean and 5 being halfway in between based on their perception of the river water quality the occupation variable has been divided into 3 categories those who do not earn unemployed students and housewives those who earn by working for a fixed number of hours government officers teachers it and health professionals and those who earn by working variable hours daily labor farmer and businessman we take the first category as the base we expect higher wtp for the latter two occupation categories for those who earn are more likely to contribute money further we expect those who earn by working variable hours to express lower wtv since they may have less leisure time for volunteering their opportunity cost of time is likely to be higher 4 1 households preferences for money and time contributions one of the main objectives of this study is to examine household preferences for money and time contributions in the study area 15 37 of the households did not answer the wtp and or wtv questions those who answered except for 4 households almost all of them reported that they are willing to contribute to the danda river restoration program table 2 among them 84 36 of the households reported that they are willing to contribute at least some money and time whereas 13 43 reported that they are willing to volunteer only and 1 58 reported that they are willing to pay only these findings reveal two crucial pieces of information about the households living in the study area first in line with 8 10 and 13 a significant proportion of households are willing to contribute their time second a large percentage of those households are also willing to contribute their money to the danda river restoration fig 2 depicts households stated preferences for monetary payment and volunteering from the data the scatterplot shows that households state preferences for a clean river through both wtv and wtp the scatterplot also suggests a likely trade off between wtp and wtv at the two extreme ends high values of wtp and wtv households with a strong preference for volunteering reported lower wtp while some households with high wtp values reported lower wtv the following 2 bar graphs fig 3 show wtp and wtv by wealth quintiles the graphs indicate a declining overall trend in wtv by wealth categories poor households are willing to volunteer more hours than wealthier households the opposite is true for willingness to pay wealthier households are more willing to pay this suggests that household wealth could be an important determinant for a strong preference for money nonetheless a multivariate empirical analysis is required to establish this finding 5 empirical framework our empirical analysis builds on the theoretical models presented in refs 37 38 and 14 the underlying assumption of the theoretical framework is that households gain utility through the consumption of goods and services good environment and leisure given their income and time constraints environmental degradation can lower the utility level however the indirect utility relation in equation 1 shows that households can compensate with monetary contributions wtp out of their income y to improve environmental quality q0 q1 for a given vector of full prices p and socioeconomic characters z 1 v q1 y wtp p z v q0 y p z likewise the household can also contribute labor hours wtv out of their available time budget l to improve environmental quality q0 q1 as expressed in equation 2 2 v q1 l wtv p z v q0 l p z when households can choose to contribute both time and money for environmental improvement the total value of their money and labor payment i e wtp wtv represents the total contribution of the household given the time and income constraints the households can choose the level of contributions in either or both forms to maximize their utility through environmental improvement if a mode of contribution is costly for a household the household is expected to choose less of it for instance we can expect the volunteering level of households to decrease when the opportunity cost of their time increases similarly a cash constrained household may exhibit zero or lower wtp 5 1 empirical strategy based on this theoretical specification we build a system of two equations to estimate the households wtp and wtv for the danda river restoration program we are interested in understanding how households distribute their wtp and wtv and what factors influence these preferences 1 w t p i β 0 β 1 w e a l t h i β 2 p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s i δ x i η i u i 2 w t v i α 0 α 1 w e a l t h i α 2 p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s i θ x i η i v i where c o v u i v i 0 and w t p i w t p i i f w t p i 0 0 i f w t p i 0 in the above system of equations w t p i is the outcome variable in equation 1 wtp is a continuous variable ranging from nrs 0 to 6000 since a large proportion of wtp values are less than the mean wtp 66 8 the distribution of wtp is highly skewed to the right figure 4 left in appendix a1 we take the natural log of wtp to normalize its distribution to avoid taking the log of 0 values we added 1 to all wtp values before taking the log 39 adding 1 to all wtp values before the log transformation does not significantly change our wtp values and efficiently preserves a large sample size however the new distribution is not entirely normal because of a high percentage of 0 values figure 4 right in appendix a1 14 of respondents who answered the wtp question are unwilling to pay therefore in our tobit regression model we censor the log of w t p i from below at 0 similarly w t v i is the outcome variable in equation 2 wtv is a count variable and its distribution is also highly skewed to the right figure 5 left in appendix a1 given the issue of simultaneously estimating a linear regression and a count model we also use a linear regression to estimate wtv 2 2 for sensitivity analysis we also used count models poisson and negative binomial to analyze wtv separately without transforming the data the regression results are consistent with the main results from our preferred joint estimation model we take the natural log of wtv values to normalize the distribution since wtv values range from 0 to 16 adding 1 to all wtv values would largely change the original wtv values therefore to avoid taking the log of 0 values 0 1 was added to all the wtv values before taking the log the distribution of the natural log of wtv is presented in figure 5 right w e a l t h i and p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s i are the main explanatory variables which are the wealth quantile based on household assets and the composite index of benefits households perceive from a clean danda river respectively x i is the vector of all socio economic spatial and other controls we use the distance to the danda river subjective river quality rating education sex total family members in the households occupation of the household head age and the number of years lived in the community the municipality level fixed effect η i has been added to the model to control for locational variation lastly u i and v i represent the errors in the two models given that households wtp and wtv decisions could be correlated results coming out of separate estimations of the wtp equation and the wtv equation may not provide a comprehensive understanding of household contributions 29 37 therefore these two reduced form equations are estimated simultaneously by allowing a non zero correlation between their error terms the estimate of the correlation term reveals the interrelation between time and money preferences 15 29 a positive correlation would suggest that households that are willing to volunteer are also likely to pay we jointly estimate equations 1 and 2 using the full information maximum likelihood estimation mle procedure in stata 40 given our relatively small sample size we bootstrap each regression for 200 replications to estimate the standard errors for robustness check we use two sets of regressions in the first regression we consider the raw form of wtv as the dependent variable instead of its natural log in the second regression we consider the natural log of wtp in the uncensored form 6 results table 3 shows joint estimates of wtp and wtv for the danda river restoration in model 1 the logs of wtp and wtv are regressed on household wealth wealth and perceived benefits from an improved danda river perceived benefits controlling for the location the coefficient on wealth is significantly positive at the 1 level for wtp and significantly negative at the 5 level for wtv these results indicate that wealthier households strongly prefer payment as they are significantly more willing to contribute their money and less willing to contribute their time the coefficient on perceived benefits is significantly positive at the 1 level for wtp intriguingly the coefficient for wtv although positive is statistically insignificant these findings suggest that households that perceive more benefits from an improved danda river have higher wtp but are indifferent towards volunteering more time for the improvement another crucial finding from the regression is that the correlation ρ between the error terms of wtp and wtv 0 125 is positive and significant at the 1 level indicating a positive correlation between the two preferences in model 2 we add variables for households subjective rating of river quality river quality rating their distance to the river distance to river and the square of the distance to the river distance square 3 3 while designing the models we tested both linear and squared functional forms of the distance to the river variable the model with the squared form had better predictive power to the regression as expected the effect of river water quality rating is negative and significant on wtp suggesting that households satisfied with river water quality are less likely to pay for river restoration the effect on wtv although negative is insignificant we also find that the coefficient on the distance to the danda river is positive and significant for wtp the inclusion of additional variables does not change the sign and significance of our results from model 1 in model 3 we further add households socio demographic characteristics to the regression again our primary findings do not significantly change with the additional inclusion of households socio demographic characteristics as for our secondary findings we find that education is positively correlated with wtp this result indicates that educated households are more likely to pay reflecting their awareness of the benefits of having a clean river we however find no statistically significant association between education and wtv our results also suggest that males male while indifferent towards monetary contribution are significantly more likely to contribute their time the size of the household total family members has a significant positive impact on wtv for the occupation variable household heads who do not earn are taken as the base and the other two occupation categories office workers and nonoffice workers are compared against the base relative to those who do not earn both office workers and nonoffice workers are significantly more likely to pay which is not surprising given that household heads that earn have money to contribute interestingly there are no significant differences between the base and the other two occupation categories regarding volunteering respondent s age age has a significant negative effect on volunteering but has no impact on wtp finally the number of years households have lived in the community years in community appears to have no impact on any of the contributions the results table reports the aic values for all three models that have been calculated by correcting for the number of observations based on the minimum aic criterion the full model model 3 has better predictive power than the other two models the robust finding on the correlations ρ between the error terms of wtp and wtv in all three models corroborates that household wtp and wtv decisions are indeed correlated even after controlling for various household characteristics from our preferred model 3 conditional on giving we estimate the mean wtp value of nrs 341 42 and the mean wtv value of 2 17 h 6 1 results from robustness check tables 4 and 5 appendix a2 present results from the two sets of regressions used for the robustness check overall our main findings are robust to different model specifications and functional forms of the dependent variables the correlation term is positive and significant in all the models as for our secondary results the sign and significance of our variable coefficients are roughly consistent across different models except for the education and age variables education is positively correlated with wtv when wtv is considered in its raw form table 4 and table 5 respondent s age has no significant impact on wtv when wtv is taken in its raw form table 4 and table 5 likewise age has significant negative effects on wtp when the natural log of wtp is taken in the uncensored form table 5 7 discussion households contribution decisions are intricate and closely tied to their resource allocation decisions in the context of developing countries where households are considerably money constrained they can offer their time for environmental improvement however they must also consider the opportunity cost of giving up their limited working hours that could otherwise be used for generating income to help support their family as a clean environment is essential for the economic sustenance of the local community the critical policy question is how best the public can contribute to an environmental restoration program which depends on how households optimize their total contribution value in terms of money and time our survey data and empirical results reveal essential findings on household preferences for money and time contributions to improve the danda river we find robust public support for improving the river as reflected in households willingness to contribute their money and time 84 36 of the households who answered the payment and volunteering questions reported positive wtp and wtv values furthermore households that are willing to contribute their time are also likely to pay as suggested by the positive correlation between the unobservable determinants of wtp and wtv with these findings we validate that using wtp alone may underestimate the social benefit of environmental restoration we importantly note that there is a higher preference for time contribution households higher preference for volunteering is expected for several reasons people often use bartering and work exchange in low income areas as trading options 14 therefore they are more familiar with time allocation it is equally likely that households may view labor payment differently than monetary payment especially when the wage rates are not well defined in the context of nepal the under utilization of labor 30 underutilized can also help explain the higher preference for time contribution among the public 13 41 this further recommends policymakers to assess the value of underutilized labor while designing environmental management programs regarding preferences by household characteristics we find that wealthier households have a strong preference for monetary contributions but are significantly less likely to volunteer one possible explanation for why wealthier households strongly prefer monetary contribution is that they may have a greater opportunity cost of time and are likely to place a high value on their time therefore they are more willing to donate money and less willing to donate time 12 36 36 refers to this tendency as buying their way out of contributing their time 36 our finding on the positive impact of perceived benefits on wtp aligns with 35 who find that households that derive direct benefits in the form of the amount of firewood from forests are significantly more likely to participate in forest management programs this household tendency is also observed by ref 42 who find that those who fish in a mangrove region are willing to pay more for mangrove protection than those who fish outside because they perceive more benefits from the mangrove it is interesting to note that perceived benefits from an improved danda river do not influence households decisions for volunteering this suggests that households may not be purely motivated by the utilities they perceive from a clean river when deciding to volunteer for river restoration households wtv could be influenced by their belief that the river should be clean and they are willing to donate their time to clean the river regardless of the benefits they may gain donating time could also be considered a socially responsible thing to do however it is also likely that some other forms of personal benefits such as warm glow and enhanced social reputation could motivate the households to contribute their time 28 30 aside from our main findings some results warrant further discussion we find that women express lower wtv than men which aligns with the findings in ref 29 the finding differs from the discussion presented in ref 43 that women are more likely to exhibit pro environmental attitudes and are more likely to have a strong preference for a clean environment however we should also note that in the context of a developing country like nepal where the societal structure is strictly patriarchal women may have higher restrictions on volunteering activities outside of their houses therefore the lower wtv among women may not necessarily be the function of environmental attitudes but gender related activity restrictions 43 our finding that men and women have statistically insignificant wtp further supports this argument the findings for the occupations of the households are also interesting while the office and nonoffice workers are significantly more likely to pay than those who do not earn which we had anticipated there are no significant differences in their wtv we had particularly anticipated nonoffice workers who work variable hours to express lower wtv values as they are likely to have less leisure time for volunteering 29 however individuals general taste for contribution could likely overcome their opportunity cost of time contribution individuals may also view volunteering as an investment to build human and social capital through volunteering work and social interactions 28 29 in the context of our study farmers and businessmen may also have strong incentives to improve the river as a clean river is closely associated with an increase in agricultural production and land house value overall our results on wtv suggest that volunteering decisions could be a complex process and external non economic factors such as social reputation and restrictions could primarily affect households wtv a counterintuitive finding of this study is that households wtp is not affected by the distance decay effect distance has a positive effect on wtp generally distance to a resource is expected to negatively correlate with wtp because the user cost increases proportionally with the distance 44 this unanticipated result points toward an unaccounted spatial heterogeneity within the study area which could positively correlate wtp and distance 45 for instance wtp driven by higher non use values which households living further away from the danda river could exhibit may not conform to a monotonic distance decay pattern 39 further the affluent central market in our study area is located at a distance from the danda river as established in our study wealthier households are more likely to pay for the river restoration we observe that on average households in the poorest wealth quantiles live closest to the river and that the distance to the river increases for the first three wealth quintiles however this relationship is not apparent for the households in the top two wealth quintiles while we have controlled for wealth and other household characteristics in our regression estimates there could still be some unexplained socioeconomic factors that could be forcing a positive wtp with distance we note that further research is warranted to understand this spatial association fully which is beyond the scope of this study 8 conclusion this study examines households preferences for contributions of money and time to support the danda river restoration by jointly estimating households wtp and wtv this study makes the case that given the likely dependence of households decisions to contribute money and time households contributions towards an environmental good and the factors that influence their decision to contribute may not be understood fully when the two decisions are considered independently our regression results from the joint estimation of wtp and wtv indicate that households wtp and wtv are significantly correlated furthermore they have a positive correlation this result has an important policy implication in that any policy targeted to motivate the public to contribute their money for the river restoration will also have the added benefit of generating more time contribution or vice versa another key result is that wealthier households strongly prefer monetary contributions and are significantly less likely to contribute their time perceived benefits from an improved river substantially impact households wtp decisions but do not influence their wtv decision benefits in terms of agriculture land house value drinking water fishing recreation and cultural benefits are considered in this study from a policy standpoint our findings suggest that the river restoration program can increase benefits by asking wealthier households to contribute their money and poorer households to contribute their time furthermore given that the perceived benefits strongly influence wtp decisions policymakers can play an important role in clearly communicating the health economic and cultural benefits of the improved river to the local community which likely increases public perception and monetary contributions in our sample as many as 84 36 of the households who answered the wtp and wtv questions stated that they are willing to contribute both money and time and 13 43 stated that they are willing to contribute their time only in line with the past studies this finding suggests that a significant proportion of households especially in developing countries exhibit their preferences for environmental goods and services through their willingness to contribute their time hence this study recommends using wtv as a metric for non market valuation and incorporating both time and monetary modes of payment in valuation studies to better understand household preferences especially when households are willing to contribute in both forms our findings suggest that the respondents have a higher preference for volunteering the percentage of the households willing to volunteer is higher than the percentage for wtp however the higher percentage could have come from presenting the wtv question before the wtp question in the survey additionally survey respondents did not receive prior information about the wtp question while answering the wtv question this limitation however may not affect our critical findings that the households that are willing to contribute their time are also likely to contribute their money and that the wealthier households have a strong preference for money future research could address this concern by conducting a study in which half or a proportion of the sample receive prior information about the wtv and wtp questions and the remaining sample does not then comparing the obtained wtv and wtp values under two scenarios another interesting future work could be changing the sequence of the two modes of contributions in the survey and testing if the order of the questions changes households decisions future studies could also improve our survey limitations by utilizing other wtp and wtv elicitation formats like the payment card approach and screening zero wtp and wtv responses through protest questions

8632,the abandonment or closure of wastewater treatment plants is a potential problem in sanitation policies where municipalities must decide which type of plant should build in their territory we used an interaction effects model to test the effect of financial self sufficiency in the operation of mexican treatment plants in the national sanitation policy periods the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach our results show that during the more planning policy approach the wastewater treatment plants effectiveness increases more than the more money policy approach period which is more vital in plants with low operating costs municipal financial self sufficiency positively affects wastewater treatment plants effectiveness more substantially in plants with high operating costs policy implications of these findings aim to be careful with the more money policy approach to developing wastewater infrastructure since municipalities require proper planning for the particular conditions of each site the mexican case shows how combining municipal financial insufficiency and centralization of planning in the national government as is common in the countries of the global south affects the probability of plant survivorship furthermore the effect of this combination grows when national governments increase their budgets to invest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the landscape of wastewater treatment plants in mexico changed considerably during the last sixteen years the number of new wastewater treatment plants grew by more than 200 while the number of abandoned plants evolved by more than 300 1 2 while mexico saw a critical growth of new plants the abandonment of plants was growing even at a faster pace this paradoxical landscape has its roots in the configuration of the national wastewater policy the federal government is committed to investing in new wastewater treatment plants but not maintaining their operation 3 therefore the fate of a wastewater plant depends on the capacity of each municipal government to maintain them current challenges around local water governance require focusing on research processes that discover complexity in water issues 4 each governance context represents different challenges for the wastewater treatment policy in many countries water reuse policies face multiple barriers including technology transfer financing planning and public acceptance to reuse projects 5 mainly much remains to be discovered about the drivers of two challenges in municipal wastewater governance the first is financing sanitation policies mainly in developing countries 6 8 the second is policy expertise for adequate water infrastructure planning 9 based on these two challenges we built the hypotheses of the present research on how financial self sufficiency influences the survival or abandonment of wastewater treatment plants in mexico differentiating two drivers the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach we incorporate the term more to illustrate how decision makers choose solutions for example bureaucrats mention that public policy problems remain unsolved due to a lack of money 10 therefore bureaucrats constantly ask for more money in their budgets so we ask ourselves if policy solutions need only more money which is why we also incorporated the more planning policy approach hypothesis on the one hand the more planning policy approach has executive projects before having the certainty of financing to carry them out it is planning without the rush to comply with the bureaucratic requirements of a resource approved for execution it means being sure of what a community needs accompanied by the technical details that make its implementation feasible it is contrary to the flow in the business as usual inertia which it uses to guide and plan by specifying the process for identifying infrastructure solutions 11 the professional tools for successful water planning involve scenarios strategies and goals before building water infrastructure 12 water policy planning is crucial to mitigate and adapting to climate change 13 therefore a planning policy project must carefully integrate different variables that can fail in wastewater infrastructure construction on the other hand the more money policy approach for maintaining the operation of wastewater plants in the global south is a crucial bet since water challenges are faced mainly through the public budget where developing countries must expense between two and four times more to achieve their goals however most municipalities need more capacity for financing access 14 in rural areas and small municipalities there is a more significant water financing problem because the issue of wastewater treatment relegates to the end of priorities after access to water and other issues 15 indeed investment in water infrastructure in small municipalities is more problematic mainly due to the need for adequate planning mechanisms and financing 16 financial self sufficiency is critical in municipal sanitation policies but is highly contingent on each governance context in the global north the private sector actively finances water infrastructure and the public sector has policy planning frameworks that operate with professional bureaucracies contrary to the reality of the countries of the global south where the public sector is the leading and almost sole funder of water projects it added to political machines embedded in bureaucracies that serve group interests 17 18 then countries of the global north have a greater variety of financing options and policy planning frameworks than those of the global south which have less democratic development so the countries of the global south depend to a greater extent on the public source of financing and require that municipalities have financial self sufficiency despite the diversity of international experiences regarding the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach there needs to be more literature regarding research that provides evidence about the endurance of financing water infrastructure especially in wastewater treatment the above is to assess whether these infrastructures are sustainable that is if they keep operating over time 19 22 we notice this gap in literature since a general policy recommendation is to elevate financing for having better wastewater services lately especially to achieve the sustainable development goals promoted by united nations organization 23 26 therefore we move the literature forward by studying to what extent municipal financial self sufficiency contributes to maintaining the operation of wastewater plants through the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach to do so we analyzed the case of the mexican wastewater treatment plants here we add evidence to solve the next policy dilemma in mexico why are being abandoned municipal wastewater treatment plants this article divides into six sections including the initial introduction section 2 reviews the literature on financial self sufficiency and wastewater policy approaches then we describe the mexican context in section 3 we show the data sources and statistical model in section 4 we present our main findings in section 5 we discuss results and policy implications finally we present our conclusions and propose an agenda for future research 2 municipal wastewater treatment plant survivorship more planning or more money the problem with infrastructure projects is often not a lack of financing but credible projects 27 the risk of inadequate public sanitation policies will not allow access to private investment instruments in wastewater treatment plants because private investors will not invest with high risk rates that is with high rates of abandonment of wastewater plants so the propensity to invest in wastewater treatment plants is a function of correct planning 28 however other authors argue that more technocratic planning is needed to implement water infrastructure adequately 29 30 we argue that the planning problem is twofold one that we affirm as the absence of infrastructure planning and the other is the excess of technocratic planning that excludes stakeholders table 1 summarizes the concepts of the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach including their main drivers and the main deviation risks as implementation gaps the drivers of the more planning policy approach imply selecting priorities with the public interest as the core since public policy requires sustaining solutions in the long term according to ref 31 public policy has two dimensions the intelligence of scientific evidence and the legitimacy of including networks of stakeholders public policy s main drivers are policy networks and scientific evidence policy networks refer to stakeholders engaging in interdependent resource exchange over policy decisions 32 33 scientific evidence implies using knowledge to design and evaluate policy to improve public officials reliability 34 35 the drivers of the more money policy approach entail having the most outstanding efficiency in collecting and spending resources accountability is essential in improving water services where transparency and end user driven development are critical to counter the emergence of patronage systems 36 the problem oriented bureaucrat s driver has three key accountability capabilities reflective improvement learning and adaptation collaborative inter organizational openness and data analytic data driven decision making 37 it is essential to notice that both policy approaches are challenging to implement because political interests are present in the policymaking process regarding the implementation gaps of the more planning policy approach there needs to be a significant gap between the practice of policymaking and the available knowledge to do it best 38 the political gap appears when a power structure captures and centralizes a policy issue for its private benefits displacing public interest policy capture is the power structure that determines priority 39 the knowledge gap appears when individuals and organizations use business as usual solutions instead of systematic revisions of alternatives in contrast the ideological cloud refers to the prevalence of dogmas beliefs or prejudges over data and scientific knowledge 40 regarding the implementation gaps of the more money policy approach the political gap appears when the personal interests of officials and bureaucrats take over the goals of a wastewater policy the above means that political machines distribute public sector jobs and resources in exchange for political support leading to deficit and inefficient spending 41 this political gap implies a spoiling of public money since private groups use the public budget for personal benefits to maintain power and increase their influence by providing allocations to their supporters 42 as 10 argues public officials maximize the public budget in exchange for specific outputs since they seek salary general reputation power and patronage besides the knowledge gap shapes business as usual inertia since it refers to the managers tendency to perceive their practices and vision as the best ones thus being unaware of other managerial practices or policy alternatives from abroad or from different perspectives 43 financing to invest in infrastructure is crucial to understanding the political economy of the construction of wastewater treatment plants and there are different financial systems worldwide 44 financial self sufficiency is essential for municipalities to make their investments more sustainable either in the more money policy approach or the more planning policy approach 45 47 next we briefly describe financial self sufficiency experiences from different countries to contextualize this research in non democratic contexts financial self sufficiency plays a minor role in water sanitation policies as the municipalities and the national sanitation policy are highly centralized 48 financial self sufficiency plays slightly different roles in countries transitioning towards a pluralistic governance context for example in ex communist countries such as slovakia the level of economic maturity of the territory influences the financial self sufficiency of local governments 49 in ukraine local governments are going through a process of decentralization policy planning beginning to eradicate a paternalistic tradition which accustomed citizens to not comply with their fiscal responsibilities and local authorities not to collect taxes 50 in wales a financial reform of local governments is taking place because many municipalities priorities need support with national financing 51 in indonesia local governments must be present in policy planning particularly post construction wastewater infrastructure however the indonesian community managed wastewater treatment systems have been successful because they require a minimum management capacity most minor maintenance and financing and only need a part time operator 52 singapore is a benchmark in water policies since governance drives toward an integrated regulatory framework where stakeholder participation at all levels is necessary especially the private ones 53 in romania public private partnerships have functioned in wastewater treatment services through local regional policy planning alliances 54 in summary some countries have opted for public private partnerships others for the concession of the service only to private investment in contrast other countries such as mexico which we will analyze in the next section have opted for the government as the sole funder in the cases where it has opted for private financing may have been problems of overpricing due to the capitalist incentive system which obtains rents in a monopoly environment as is the case with water management 44 in mexico commercialization and other neoliberal strategies may cause small communities not to have access to water and sanitation because they need to meet efficiency criteria 55 however governments that are most involved in boosting the economy have yet to be able to solve water problems either true decentralization is not a reality 3 the mexican context of wastewater governance the current national government s discourse in mexico argues that the past neoliberal policies produced inequality injustice and corruption the administrative solution of the mexican executive branch to end corruption is to centralize resources and deliver them directly to beneficiaries political opponents argue that decentralization and emerging quasi markets in public services are better governance options we argue that this ideological dispute hides a problem that has remained latent for centuries in mexico the weakness of governance capacities in mexican municipalities regardless of any ideology and stakes of the national government states and especially cities face local problems and realities an ideological change political will or good intentions are not enough to change mexico s reality mexican water agencies have not provided efficient public service because of low rates to cover operating costs short term policy views and lack of water metering 56 mainly because of a political machine s pattern in decision making since recruitment selection and promotion of public officers relies on a personal relationship with the political group in turn either with labor unions civil service is absent in most mexican bureaucracies 42 the significant reforms in the mexican water sector have been successful when organizations have governance capacity especially with financial self sufficiency 57 most mexican local water agencies have minimal governance capacities and they should avoid the business as usual governance style to achieve the long run sustainability of the water sector 58 regardless of water sector reforms local water agencies still need to improve governance weaknesses there are successful experiences of inter municipal associations strengthened by the concentration of income and a regional vision of the territory however these experiences are fewer there have been many efforts but few results mainly due to the governance weakness of local water agencies mainly policy planning capacity 59 good intentions around the new mexican general water law are a reality of weakness in policy planning and financing wastewater governance in mexico is primarily a municipal matter municipal governments must promote reuse and discharge wastewater to receiving bodies after treatment and comply with official regulations most mexican municipalities are small and their municipal water agencies need institutional strength on the other hand some medium sized cities and larger ones operate autonomous water agencies however these municipal water agencies still depend on the politicians in practice each state has a state water commission with broad but ambiguous powers these require the most outstanding creativity to promote water policies since it is an open space to fill with innovation the state water agencies are generally in charge of emblematic projects such as aqueducts and other regional infrastructures they support mainly small municipalities regarding technical issues such as measuring water quality and providing some chemicals to wastewater treatment plants 18 water and sanitation governance in mexico is a decentralized logic based on the municipal level because article 115 of the constitution states that the water service provision is a municipal responsibility however a new general water law proposal promotes that it will redistribute the current functions of the different levels of government with a more centralist tendency regardless of what the formality of legal organization dictates there is a solid historical tendency of centralism in mexico which has balked most local governments from developing capacities that improve their ability to comply with their obligations at the national level it promotes mexico s most relevant public policies including water and sanitation in contrast most municipalities have dedicated themselves to managing problems with a short term vision and without sufficient resources mainly the absence of adequately trained personnel 60 instead a clientelist pattern of local governance has prevailed 18 61 municipal governments and local water agencies have not reached a degree of organizational maturity that allows them to develop long term policy planning and financial self sufficiency after reviewing the literature the primary governance weakness of mexican municipalities points out the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach in this mexican governance context we will contribute with an evidence based answer to the question why are being abandoned municipal wastewater treatment plants 4 research design to address the research question we used a quantitative approach which helps us better understand how the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach affect the municipal management of wastewater treatment plants we centered our study on the municipalities of mexico as this case as will be detailed below helps contrast these two policy approaches we used an interaction effects statistical model for testing the hypothesis that we present in section 4 6 4 1 case selection the construction and operation of wastewater treatment plants in mexico represent a valuable case for studying how national policy approaches to the construction and operation of wastewater treatment plants affect the local management of such plants the mexican national policy followed a more planning policy approach up until 2005 this approach implied that the federal government was involved with local governments planning the construction of wastewater treatment plants federal government s support was primarily concerned with construction design technical choice of the treatment technology the location of the plant and estimations of treatment capacity needs however this policy approach had limited involvement in procuring the investment needed to construct the plant in 2005 the federal government changed to a more money policy approach which implied an ambitious effort to construct wastewater treatment plants however it needed to consider complementary financial support for the municipalities this policy began during the last years of vicente fox s presidency 2000 2006 up to the whole next presidency felipe calderon 2006 2012 this dramatic rise in construction amounted to five times more plants constructed than those plants built during 1998 2004 equivalent in time length 1 1 see figure a1 in supplementary material 4 2 data collection to study the effect of financial self sufficiency on municipal wastewater policies we collected data from two sources our first source was the registry of wastewater treatment plants in mexico s national water commission which provided us with the national inventory of water treatment plants in 2016 our second source was the national institute of geography and statistics from which we obtained data about municipal public finances the unit of analysis was at the wastewater treatment plant level 4 3 outcome variable our outcome variable is the effectiveness of municipal wastewater treatment local policies although effectiveness entails multiple dimensions we approached this concept by selecting the type of wastewater treatment plant because a central issue in the municipal wastewater policy is defining the kind of wastewater plant to be constructed to meet their treatment needs but also considering their financial and organizational resources 62 70 from this point of view a compelling choice of the type of wastewater treatment plant guarantees balancing the wastewater treatment needs with the financial possibilities we approximated the measure of wastewater policy effectiveness by using a binary variable that measures whether the treatment plant is active i e in operation or inactive i e temporally or permanently closed by 2016 the year of nwc s inventory although this binary variable does not capture the notion of policy effectiveness with fidelity it does help to indirectly observe through the activity or inactivity of the plant whether the municipal wastewater policy accurately balanced the financial and organizational conditions with the wastewater treatment needs 4 4 explanatory variables our statistical model s two main explanatory variables are financial self sufficiency and national wastewater governance conditions financial self sufficiency is the sustainable capacity of an institution to maintain enough autonomy and reliability to cover its operating expenses without depending on external transfers 56 71 73 literature has shown that financial self sufficiency is an important municipal capability to reduce dependence on state or federal governments to effectively operate their part of a multi stakeholder policy 71 74 76 to measure the level of financial self sufficiency in municipalities we used the percentage of the municipal budget corresponding to the municipal s tax collection efforts to mitigate the volatility of local tax collection due to electoral years or other contingent factors we averaged the percentage of municipal income generated by local tax collection from five fiscal years before the nwc s inventory that is during 2011 2015 our second explanatory variable was the national sanitation policy which comprises the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach as discussed above to balance the exposition of these two policy approaches we limited the data to the treatment plants built between 1998 and 2004 for the more planning policy approach and 2005 2012 for the more money policy approach seeking more robust results we operationalized this variable into two measurements firstly we used a dummy variable for each treatment plant to observe whether the plant was built during the period corresponding to the more planning policy approach or the more money policy approach this variable helped us to directly compare the performance of both policy approaches and test our hypotheses secondly we used a continuous variable which was the year of construction of the plant this variable helped us to have a more nuanced understanding of how the policy approaches moderate the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater policy effectiveness this nuanced analysis was fundamental as the more money policy approach was gradually implemented since 2005 2 2 see figure a1 in supplementary material 4 5 control variables we included three control variables that may confound the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater policy effectiveness 1 federal participations 2 federal and state shares and 3 wastewater treatment capacity federal participations are financial transfers from the federal government to municipalities these are a function of the federal taxes produced indirectly by the municipality s socio economic conditions municipalities are free to assign these financial transfers to any expenditure we expect that municipalities with higher levels of economic activity will receive a higher proportion of participations and will have higher needs for wastewater management policies therefore this municipality profile may have higher operational conditions of the wastewater treatment plants and better conditions to strengthen their financial self sufficiency shares are financial transfers from federal and state governments to reduce inequality among municipalities cities with lower levels of industrialization tend to receive a higher proportion of shares the amount received in shares is bounded to spending rules therefore we expect that the shares bring resources to operate wastewater plants but it also disincentives municipalities from strengthening their financial self sufficiency we operationalized these two variables as federal participations or shares per ten thousand inhabitants in mexican pesos which accounts for the variations in population size among municipalities the wastewater treatment capacity could be a confounding factor explaining plants survivorship and financial self sufficiency typically bigger municipalities have more treatment capacity needs while they also tend to have higher levels of financial self sufficiency treatment capacity would be associated with higher effectiveness of treatment plant management as plants with high treatment capacity are often built in bigger municipalities we operationalized this variable as treatment capacity in liters per second 4 6 hypothesis our central proposition is that the effect of municipal financial self sufficiency on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management is moderated by the national sanitation policy approach specifically a more planning policy approach reduces the need for financial self sufficiency as a determinant to manage wastewater treatment plants effectively therefore in this study we seek to test whether each of both policy approaches the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach moderates the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater treatment management which we formulated in the following hypotheses h1 a more planning policy approach increases the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater treatment management compared with a more money policy approach nevertheless we also argue that the role of the national sanitation policy on financial self sufficiency may vary depending on the operating costs of the wastewater treatment plants the high investment needed to install wastewater treatment plants and their high operating costs explain why these plants are not being adopted in developing countries 77 as explained above a more money policy approach helps expand the adoption of wastewater treatment plants but only sometimes solves the subsequent problem of plant abandonment as discussed previously financial self sufficiency plays a role in avoiding abandonment and we hypothesized in h1 that the type of national sanitation policy moderates such a role nevertheless we also argue that the plant s technology choice plays a crucial role in understanding how the national sanitation policy shapes the management of wastewater treatment plants the choice of treatment technologies affects the financial burden of a plant s operating costs since operating costs increase the financial burden on municipalities this type of plant increases the need for financial self sufficiency to avoid the abandonment of plants alternative technologies oriented toward reducing operating costs particularly energy consumption have been crucial for adopting treatment plants in municipalities with weak financial autonomy and small wastewater treatment needs 78 therefore the type of treatment technology also shapes the effect of financial self sufficiency on the effectiveness of treatment management depending on whether the technology entails low or high operating costs h2a for plants with low operating costs financial self sufficiency does not have an effect on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management h2b for plants with high operating costs financial self sufficiency has a positive effect on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management further the policy approach may also shape how operating costs affect the likelihood of plant abandonment since each of the two sanitation policies of the mexican case has had a different approach toward the issue of operating costs on the one side the more money policy approach has prioritized securing the money for investment and overcoming the bureaucratic constraints and administrative time delays but with minimal regard for the size of the municipal s wastewater treatment needs or treatment technology choice and consequently operating costs on the other hand the more planning policy approach has prioritized the revision of treatment technology choice plant location and municipal s treatment needs but with minimal attention to securing the money for investment administrative or political constraints nor has it taken into consideration the local stakeholders the more planning policy approach tends towards centralized and technical planning and consequently the more money policy approach partially overlooks operating costs which are only shaped by the consideration of the technical choice considering this indirect and incidental effect of technology choice on operating costs a more planning policy approach will increase the probability of financial self sufficiency of plants with low operating costs conversely this effect would disappear when it comes to plants with high operating costs we formulated these propositions into the following hypothesis h3a for plants with low operating costs the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach will increase the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management h3b for plants with high operating costs the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach will have an equivalent effect on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management 4 7 model specification since our dependent variable e f f e c t i v e n e s s i is binary 1 still operating we used a logit estimation for all our models 3 3 given the high percentage of active treatment plants it is possible that the estimator i e logit or probit may affect the results 79 we did a robust analysis comparing the results of the models using logit and probit finding no meaningful differences among them see section a 4 in supplementary material the first explanatory variable s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y i corresponds to the percentage of municipal budget generated by local tax collection the second explanatory variable y e a r b u i l t i measures the year the plant was built the model includes a set x i of control variables to test our main theoretical explanation against alternative and plausible explanatory factors the control variables measure federal participations federal and state shares and treatment capacity we included an interaction effect between the two explanatory variables financial self sufficiency and governance conditions e f f e c t i v e n e s s i α β 1 s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y i β 2 y e a r b u i l t i β 3 s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y i y e a r b u i l t i β i x i ε i we used three statistical models to test our three hypotheses each model uses the statistical specification presented above but a different dataset to test hypothesis 1 we used a dataset composed of all types of wastewater treatment plants built from 1998 to 2012 n 2 175 to test hypotheses 2a and 3a we used a dataset composed only of treatment plants using the technology lagoon system n 478 which has the lowest operating costs in mexico 4 4 the average operating estimated cost of lagoon system treatment plants in mexico is 0 01 mexican pesos per kw hour per cubic meter 80 stabilization lagoons systems and artificial wetlands are technologies that rely more on microorganisms and less on infrastructure to remove contaminants from wastewater 81 82 making this technology inexpensive in construction and operation 83 to test hypotheses 2b and 3b we used a data set composed only of treatment plants using the activated sludge n 671 technology which has the highest operating costs in mexico 5 5 the average operating estimated cost of activated sludge treatment plants in mexico is 0 21 mexican pesos per kw hour per cubic meter 80 table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the 2175 municipalities as of 2016 73 of the wastewater treatment plants were active the average plant s year of construction was 2002 we observed high variation in the treatment capacity of the installed treatment plants on average a treatment plant can process 622 l per second whereas the plant with the highest capacity could process 23 280 l per second in the financial landscape of the municipalities we observe that on average the municipality generates 24 of the annual municipal budget however we see a high variation in financial self sufficiency of the municipalities where the municipality with the weakest self sufficiency had 0 1 of its revenues and the highest had 74 5 results several authors have highlighted the challenges of analyzing nonlinear interaction models as they convey double marginal effects 79 84 85 a limitation of our analysis is that our model choice poses some limitations in testing our hypotheses in this section we present our results and analyze the statistical significance of these in visual forms rather than analytical hypothesis testing following the best practices suggested by ref 84 for analyzing nonlinear interaction models we use figs 1 and 2 to assess our hypothesis 1 fig 1 shows that the predicted probability of a plant being active increases as self sufficiency increases although the slope s inclination is modest fig 1 also shows that the slope for the more planning policy approach is higher than the slope for the more money policy approach implying that the former approach has a higher effect on the probability of a plant being active than the latter nevertheless the confidence intervals of the predicted probabilities for both approaches overlap therefore the results are inconclusive as a robustness check we repeated the analysis by changing the variable of the policy approach from binary to continuous which is the year of construction of the plant this allows us to understand the marginal changes of financial self sufficiency when moderated by year of construction as a less restrictive measure of policy approach the contour plots show the results of such analysis recapping 2005 marks the ending of the more planning policy approach and the be ginning of the more money policy approach the contour plot of fig 2 reveals an interesting pattern not observed in fig 1 the effect of financial self sufficiency on the probability of a plant being active is negative for the lower end of the year of construction axis while it becomes positive in the higher end of the same axis roughly speaking the region around the year 2005 is a hinge point where the effect of financial self sufficiency shifts from negative to positive suggesting that for the earliest years of construction financial self sufficiency has a negative effect on the probability of a plant being active the direction of this variation is upwards which means that the effect of financial self sufficiency on sludge plant survival becomes stronger as the plants were more recently constructed the effect of financial self sufficiency on sludge plant survival is positive across all years of construction but it is not statistically significant during the period 1998 2004 that means we can only infer a positive effect of financial self sufficiency for sludge plants built on or after 2005 we used figs 3 and 4 to assess our hypotheses 2a and 3a fig 3 shows that in a more money policy approach the probability of being active in this type of plant is not meaningfully affected by financial self sufficiency in other words a more money policy approach does not moderate the effect of financial self sufficiency on policy effectiveness on the contrary a more planning policy approach does moderate such effect the same figure shows that the nonlinear slope of the more planning policy approach follows a logarithmic shape the predicted probabilities increase at a decreasing rate ending up at high levels of financial self sufficiency being a policy approach giving higher probabilities of remain active for plants in municipalities with high financial self sufficiency as the confidence intervals of the predicted probabilities for both approaches also overlap these results are inconclusive in the contour plot displayed in fig 4 the region with the lowest predicted probability of being an active plant is the bottom right corner representing the plants built in the most recent years in municipalities with the lowest financial self sufficiency on the other hand the region with the highest predicted probability resides on the upper side of the graph across all years of construction these patterns suggest that high financial self sufficiency is equally relevant in both policy approaches for plants with low operating costs in contrast low financial self sufficiency leads to higher abandonments in plants built during the more money policy approach we use figs 5 and 6 to assess our hypotheses 2b and 3b fig 5 shows that the predicted probability of a plant being active increases as financial self sufficiency increases the nonlinear slope shows a considerable upward steepness showing that the effect is positive and meaningful this figure also shows that the slopes for the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach are relatively the same suggesting that the moderating effect of both policy approaches on financial self sufficiency is equivalent in treatment plants with high operating costs as the confidence intervals of the predicted probabilities for both approaches also overlap these results are inconclusive the contour plot displayed in fig 6 shows that during the years of the more planning policy approach the effect of financial self sufficiency was more homogeneous than during the years of more money that is during the years of the more planning policy approach the predicted probability of a plant with high operating costs being active is relatively stable across different levels of financial self sufficiency in contrast in the more money years the predicted probabilities are more sensitive to the variation in that variable 6 discussion and implications sanitation is a constitutional right in mexico and many other countries as well however there needs to be more good intentions and results as the following are four main wastewater policy implications in investing in new wastewater infrastructure in mexico 1 financial self sufficiency positively affects a wastewater treatment plant s effectiveness either in the more money policy approach or in the more planning policy approach however this effect is modest financial self sufficiency in mexican municipalities still is not pressured by public debt however prospecting public debt tendencies some municipalities would have serious financial problems in the following years 86 in the case of municipalities facing a financial crisis the cost of wastewater treatment is one of the first to be cut entirety because wastewater generally does not directly affect people but it indirectly affects the environment and public health 57 87 we consider that the satisfactory operation of wastewater treatment plants is sensitive to changes in the financial self sufficiency of municipalities since the most visible expenses for citizens are difficult to cut such as water supply garbage collection and public lighting raw wastewater discharges can go unnoticed since they remain far from the municipal head where there is no daily citizen supervision so if the national government decides to grant subsidies for wastewater treatment it must do so with specifically labeled resources to prevent municipalities from allocating those resources to other priorities also the national government should require adequate planning of each investment so that public money can be used to the maximum avoiding spoiling 2 financial self sufficiency positively and strongly affects plant effectiveness in wastewater treatment plants with high operating costs i e active sludge plants this effect is the same in both the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach financial self sufficiency has a positive and statistically significant effect on wastewater treatment plants with high operating costs since the activated sludge plants have a vocation mainly for municipalities with financial self sufficiency as a result of the collection of fees and generation of their income in addition to the advantage of taking advantage of economies of scale which allows having lower costs per user 88 otherwise a wastewater treatment plant with high operating costs located in a municipality with vulnerable financial self sufficiency will assume higher costs per user which may make the financial scheme unfeasible 3 compared with the more money policy approach the more planning policy approach increases the probability of wastewater treatment plants effectiveness the main weakness of policymaking is the need for adequate planning 89 argues the performance of budget management relies on policy planning it is evident in the mexican case since the outbreak of decreasing wastewater policy effectiveness in 2005 when the national government made extraordinary spending for new infrastructure as wastewater infrastructure is a long lived bet substantial policy planning is required 90 in mexico with an eminently national government investing system many water issues rely on adequate planning the national government allocates a pool of resources but it needs to exert control and proper monitoring this pattern can generate opportunities for corruption in the allocation construction and delivery of wastewater treatment plants 91 since government agencies are highly politicized local decisions depend more on political than technical knowledge 92 discretional allocations of subsidies reinforce the negative spiral of service deterioration in mexican municipal water agencies 93 there is a common belief that more money is enough and the most urgent issue is to achieve better water and sanitation services however it is necessary to improve the spending patterns in the public water sector since interest groups are trying to capture public resources 94 4 in plants with low operating costs i e lagoon systems the effect of financial self sufficiency on plants effectiveness varies depending on the policy approach a more money policy approach vanishes such effect while in the more planning policy approach the effect of financial self sufficiency on plants effectiveness is still positive and meaningful water governance implies decisions about how water services should be organized and financed by whom on what principles for serve what interests 95 6 the current wastewater treatment technology is mainly powered by expensive traditional technology however municipalities with a more planning policy approach may be the pioneers in transitioning to renewable energy alternatives such as solar panels in wastewater treatment plants this transition to cheaper electrical systems will also have a positive impact on the environment 96 97 our findings may have predicted that if the mexican government tries to invest a large number of resources more money policy approach in the renewable energy equipment of wastewater treatment plants is highly probable that the policy will be ineffective this tendency is because municipalities that chose to build lagoon wastewater treatment plants did so at the time of the more planning policy approach where the most meaningful effect in our findings is at the crossroads of wastewater plants effectiveness financial self sufficiency and more planning policy approach the above four policy implications of the mexican case can shed light on other countries mainly in the global south to focus efforts on providing more money to wastewater infrastructure water governance and policy must focus on policy planning mainly at the local level the waste of public money on water is unfair especially for the most vulnerable social groups both public ownership and private participation may be effective in the water sector public private partnerships can effectively provide water and sanitation services with a robust governance and policy framework when corruption is high private actors will pursue profit maximization over public needs which results in inadequate sanitation service provision 98 99 if the bribery risk is low the private sector can provide additional financing to public works projects in the water sector 100 then the main issue is controlling corruption in the water sector both in private and governmental agents an adequate water governance and policy framework will guarantee effectiveness rather than a unique ideological flag in favor or against the participation of private or public sectors in the water services provision public private or partnership investments will be effective in good governance 7 summary and conclusion why are being abandoned municipal wastewater treatment plants in mexico there is a high probability of an insufficient more money policy approach in wastewater treatment plants effectiveness when a municipality needs more robust financial self sufficiency and policy planning cities with larger populations are more likely to utilize their scale economies and activated sludge technology may be viable however during the more money policy approach the national government provided free funding to municipalities to build mainly high cost wastewater treatment infrastructure which needed more financial self sufficiency to sustain them mainly due to the excessive energy cost for the municipal budgets a more planning policy approach is more likely to succeed in maintaining operating wastewater treatment plants rather than a more money policy approach in mexico the main policy implication of these findings is to reform wastewater infrastructure financing requirements if a municipal water agency has no solid financial self sufficiency it must invest in a low energy cost plant avoiding activated sludge technology also community participation planning and involvement are essential in developing new wastewater treatment infrastructure the coming general water law will have good intentions and political correctness in writing strengthening municipal water agencies is the best bet to make good intentions a reality in mexico based on fig 2 we identify a future research agenda we observe that there is no effectiveness in wastewater treatment plants management at the beginning of the more planning policy approach which is contrary to our data tendencies we launched a hypothesis to study this contradiction at the beginning of the more planning policy approach there was null financial self sufficiency in mexican municipalities due to the high fiscal centralization of the national government in this sense we will search in the future for the key elements to understand when the more planning policy approach is not enough to achieve effectiveness in wastewater treatment plant management the mexican case illustrates two financing options and policy planning led by the public sector as is common in countries of the global south however involving municipal governments in these approaches is problematic for two reasons first municipal governments need more financial self sufficiency to ensure their capacity to contribute to a multi stakeholder wastewater treatment national policy second the centralization of planning and decisions of a national policy may become an obstacle to effective policy implementation the mexican case shows how combining these two conditions affects the probability of plant survivorship furthermore the effect of this combination grows when national governments follow a more money policy approach therefore we would expect that the findings of this study may be relevant for countries where governments are the prominent participants in the construction and maintenance of wastewater treatment plants particularly in countries where the planning of national policies is highly centralized and where local governments institutional capacity is weak finally the findings of this study indicate that pouring money into conditions of highly centralized planning and weak institutions in local governments could be more effective it is tempting to conclude that the problems to be solved are the centralization of planning and the institutional weakness of local governments however centralization and institutional weakness are inherent conditions of bureaucracies worldwide 101 for example the centralization of planning is instead a product of the administrative tradition of some states 102 on the other hand institutional capacity may be strengthened in a country but that does not impede strength variation across municipalities therefore a potential solution for the problem created by the combination of centralization and institutional weakness is an area of study for future research how or why this combination undermines the effectiveness of invested resources in a national sanitation

8632,the abandonment or closure of wastewater treatment plants is a potential problem in sanitation policies where municipalities must decide which type of plant should build in their territory we used an interaction effects model to test the effect of financial self sufficiency in the operation of mexican treatment plants in the national sanitation policy periods the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach our results show that during the more planning policy approach the wastewater treatment plants effectiveness increases more than the more money policy approach period which is more vital in plants with low operating costs municipal financial self sufficiency positively affects wastewater treatment plants effectiveness more substantially in plants with high operating costs policy implications of these findings aim to be careful with the more money policy approach to developing wastewater infrastructure since municipalities require proper planning for the particular conditions of each site the mexican case shows how combining municipal financial insufficiency and centralization of planning in the national government as is common in the countries of the global south affects the probability of plant survivorship furthermore the effect of this combination grows when national governments increase their budgets to invest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the landscape of wastewater treatment plants in mexico changed considerably during the last sixteen years the number of new wastewater treatment plants grew by more than 200 while the number of abandoned plants evolved by more than 300 1 2 while mexico saw a critical growth of new plants the abandonment of plants was growing even at a faster pace this paradoxical landscape has its roots in the configuration of the national wastewater policy the federal government is committed to investing in new wastewater treatment plants but not maintaining their operation 3 therefore the fate of a wastewater plant depends on the capacity of each municipal government to maintain them current challenges around local water governance require focusing on research processes that discover complexity in water issues 4 each governance context represents different challenges for the wastewater treatment policy in many countries water reuse policies face multiple barriers including technology transfer financing planning and public acceptance to reuse projects 5 mainly much remains to be discovered about the drivers of two challenges in municipal wastewater governance the first is financing sanitation policies mainly in developing countries 6 8 the second is policy expertise for adequate water infrastructure planning 9 based on these two challenges we built the hypotheses of the present research on how financial self sufficiency influences the survival or abandonment of wastewater treatment plants in mexico differentiating two drivers the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach we incorporate the term more to illustrate how decision makers choose solutions for example bureaucrats mention that public policy problems remain unsolved due to a lack of money 10 therefore bureaucrats constantly ask for more money in their budgets so we ask ourselves if policy solutions need only more money which is why we also incorporated the more planning policy approach hypothesis on the one hand the more planning policy approach has executive projects before having the certainty of financing to carry them out it is planning without the rush to comply with the bureaucratic requirements of a resource approved for execution it means being sure of what a community needs accompanied by the technical details that make its implementation feasible it is contrary to the flow in the business as usual inertia which it uses to guide and plan by specifying the process for identifying infrastructure solutions 11 the professional tools for successful water planning involve scenarios strategies and goals before building water infrastructure 12 water policy planning is crucial to mitigate and adapting to climate change 13 therefore a planning policy project must carefully integrate different variables that can fail in wastewater infrastructure construction on the other hand the more money policy approach for maintaining the operation of wastewater plants in the global south is a crucial bet since water challenges are faced mainly through the public budget where developing countries must expense between two and four times more to achieve their goals however most municipalities need more capacity for financing access 14 in rural areas and small municipalities there is a more significant water financing problem because the issue of wastewater treatment relegates to the end of priorities after access to water and other issues 15 indeed investment in water infrastructure in small municipalities is more problematic mainly due to the need for adequate planning mechanisms and financing 16 financial self sufficiency is critical in municipal sanitation policies but is highly contingent on each governance context in the global north the private sector actively finances water infrastructure and the public sector has policy planning frameworks that operate with professional bureaucracies contrary to the reality of the countries of the global south where the public sector is the leading and almost sole funder of water projects it added to political machines embedded in bureaucracies that serve group interests 17 18 then countries of the global north have a greater variety of financing options and policy planning frameworks than those of the global south which have less democratic development so the countries of the global south depend to a greater extent on the public source of financing and require that municipalities have financial self sufficiency despite the diversity of international experiences regarding the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach there needs to be more literature regarding research that provides evidence about the endurance of financing water infrastructure especially in wastewater treatment the above is to assess whether these infrastructures are sustainable that is if they keep operating over time 19 22 we notice this gap in literature since a general policy recommendation is to elevate financing for having better wastewater services lately especially to achieve the sustainable development goals promoted by united nations organization 23 26 therefore we move the literature forward by studying to what extent municipal financial self sufficiency contributes to maintaining the operation of wastewater plants through the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach to do so we analyzed the case of the mexican wastewater treatment plants here we add evidence to solve the next policy dilemma in mexico why are being abandoned municipal wastewater treatment plants this article divides into six sections including the initial introduction section 2 reviews the literature on financial self sufficiency and wastewater policy approaches then we describe the mexican context in section 3 we show the data sources and statistical model in section 4 we present our main findings in section 5 we discuss results and policy implications finally we present our conclusions and propose an agenda for future research 2 municipal wastewater treatment plant survivorship more planning or more money the problem with infrastructure projects is often not a lack of financing but credible projects 27 the risk of inadequate public sanitation policies will not allow access to private investment instruments in wastewater treatment plants because private investors will not invest with high risk rates that is with high rates of abandonment of wastewater plants so the propensity to invest in wastewater treatment plants is a function of correct planning 28 however other authors argue that more technocratic planning is needed to implement water infrastructure adequately 29 30 we argue that the planning problem is twofold one that we affirm as the absence of infrastructure planning and the other is the excess of technocratic planning that excludes stakeholders table 1 summarizes the concepts of the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach including their main drivers and the main deviation risks as implementation gaps the drivers of the more planning policy approach imply selecting priorities with the public interest as the core since public policy requires sustaining solutions in the long term according to ref 31 public policy has two dimensions the intelligence of scientific evidence and the legitimacy of including networks of stakeholders public policy s main drivers are policy networks and scientific evidence policy networks refer to stakeholders engaging in interdependent resource exchange over policy decisions 32 33 scientific evidence implies using knowledge to design and evaluate policy to improve public officials reliability 34 35 the drivers of the more money policy approach entail having the most outstanding efficiency in collecting and spending resources accountability is essential in improving water services where transparency and end user driven development are critical to counter the emergence of patronage systems 36 the problem oriented bureaucrat s driver has three key accountability capabilities reflective improvement learning and adaptation collaborative inter organizational openness and data analytic data driven decision making 37 it is essential to notice that both policy approaches are challenging to implement because political interests are present in the policymaking process regarding the implementation gaps of the more planning policy approach there needs to be a significant gap between the practice of policymaking and the available knowledge to do it best 38 the political gap appears when a power structure captures and centralizes a policy issue for its private benefits displacing public interest policy capture is the power structure that determines priority 39 the knowledge gap appears when individuals and organizations use business as usual solutions instead of systematic revisions of alternatives in contrast the ideological cloud refers to the prevalence of dogmas beliefs or prejudges over data and scientific knowledge 40 regarding the implementation gaps of the more money policy approach the political gap appears when the personal interests of officials and bureaucrats take over the goals of a wastewater policy the above means that political machines distribute public sector jobs and resources in exchange for political support leading to deficit and inefficient spending 41 this political gap implies a spoiling of public money since private groups use the public budget for personal benefits to maintain power and increase their influence by providing allocations to their supporters 42 as 10 argues public officials maximize the public budget in exchange for specific outputs since they seek salary general reputation power and patronage besides the knowledge gap shapes business as usual inertia since it refers to the managers tendency to perceive their practices and vision as the best ones thus being unaware of other managerial practices or policy alternatives from abroad or from different perspectives 43 financing to invest in infrastructure is crucial to understanding the political economy of the construction of wastewater treatment plants and there are different financial systems worldwide 44 financial self sufficiency is essential for municipalities to make their investments more sustainable either in the more money policy approach or the more planning policy approach 45 47 next we briefly describe financial self sufficiency experiences from different countries to contextualize this research in non democratic contexts financial self sufficiency plays a minor role in water sanitation policies as the municipalities and the national sanitation policy are highly centralized 48 financial self sufficiency plays slightly different roles in countries transitioning towards a pluralistic governance context for example in ex communist countries such as slovakia the level of economic maturity of the territory influences the financial self sufficiency of local governments 49 in ukraine local governments are going through a process of decentralization policy planning beginning to eradicate a paternalistic tradition which accustomed citizens to not comply with their fiscal responsibilities and local authorities not to collect taxes 50 in wales a financial reform of local governments is taking place because many municipalities priorities need support with national financing 51 in indonesia local governments must be present in policy planning particularly post construction wastewater infrastructure however the indonesian community managed wastewater treatment systems have been successful because they require a minimum management capacity most minor maintenance and financing and only need a part time operator 52 singapore is a benchmark in water policies since governance drives toward an integrated regulatory framework where stakeholder participation at all levels is necessary especially the private ones 53 in romania public private partnerships have functioned in wastewater treatment services through local regional policy planning alliances 54 in summary some countries have opted for public private partnerships others for the concession of the service only to private investment in contrast other countries such as mexico which we will analyze in the next section have opted for the government as the sole funder in the cases where it has opted for private financing may have been problems of overpricing due to the capitalist incentive system which obtains rents in a monopoly environment as is the case with water management 44 in mexico commercialization and other neoliberal strategies may cause small communities not to have access to water and sanitation because they need to meet efficiency criteria 55 however governments that are most involved in boosting the economy have yet to be able to solve water problems either true decentralization is not a reality 3 the mexican context of wastewater governance the current national government s discourse in mexico argues that the past neoliberal policies produced inequality injustice and corruption the administrative solution of the mexican executive branch to end corruption is to centralize resources and deliver them directly to beneficiaries political opponents argue that decentralization and emerging quasi markets in public services are better governance options we argue that this ideological dispute hides a problem that has remained latent for centuries in mexico the weakness of governance capacities in mexican municipalities regardless of any ideology and stakes of the national government states and especially cities face local problems and realities an ideological change political will or good intentions are not enough to change mexico s reality mexican water agencies have not provided efficient public service because of low rates to cover operating costs short term policy views and lack of water metering 56 mainly because of a political machine s pattern in decision making since recruitment selection and promotion of public officers relies on a personal relationship with the political group in turn either with labor unions civil service is absent in most mexican bureaucracies 42 the significant reforms in the mexican water sector have been successful when organizations have governance capacity especially with financial self sufficiency 57 most mexican local water agencies have minimal governance capacities and they should avoid the business as usual governance style to achieve the long run sustainability of the water sector 58 regardless of water sector reforms local water agencies still need to improve governance weaknesses there are successful experiences of inter municipal associations strengthened by the concentration of income and a regional vision of the territory however these experiences are fewer there have been many efforts but few results mainly due to the governance weakness of local water agencies mainly policy planning capacity 59 good intentions around the new mexican general water law are a reality of weakness in policy planning and financing wastewater governance in mexico is primarily a municipal matter municipal governments must promote reuse and discharge wastewater to receiving bodies after treatment and comply with official regulations most mexican municipalities are small and their municipal water agencies need institutional strength on the other hand some medium sized cities and larger ones operate autonomous water agencies however these municipal water agencies still depend on the politicians in practice each state has a state water commission with broad but ambiguous powers these require the most outstanding creativity to promote water policies since it is an open space to fill with innovation the state water agencies are generally in charge of emblematic projects such as aqueducts and other regional infrastructures they support mainly small municipalities regarding technical issues such as measuring water quality and providing some chemicals to wastewater treatment plants 18 water and sanitation governance in mexico is a decentralized logic based on the municipal level because article 115 of the constitution states that the water service provision is a municipal responsibility however a new general water law proposal promotes that it will redistribute the current functions of the different levels of government with a more centralist tendency regardless of what the formality of legal organization dictates there is a solid historical tendency of centralism in mexico which has balked most local governments from developing capacities that improve their ability to comply with their obligations at the national level it promotes mexico s most relevant public policies including water and sanitation in contrast most municipalities have dedicated themselves to managing problems with a short term vision and without sufficient resources mainly the absence of adequately trained personnel 60 instead a clientelist pattern of local governance has prevailed 18 61 municipal governments and local water agencies have not reached a degree of organizational maturity that allows them to develop long term policy planning and financial self sufficiency after reviewing the literature the primary governance weakness of mexican municipalities points out the more money policy approach and the more planning policy approach in this mexican governance context we will contribute with an evidence based answer to the question why are being abandoned municipal wastewater treatment plants 4 research design to address the research question we used a quantitative approach which helps us better understand how the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach affect the municipal management of wastewater treatment plants we centered our study on the municipalities of mexico as this case as will be detailed below helps contrast these two policy approaches we used an interaction effects statistical model for testing the hypothesis that we present in section 4 6 4 1 case selection the construction and operation of wastewater treatment plants in mexico represent a valuable case for studying how national policy approaches to the construction and operation of wastewater treatment plants affect the local management of such plants the mexican national policy followed a more planning policy approach up until 2005 this approach implied that the federal government was involved with local governments planning the construction of wastewater treatment plants federal government s support was primarily concerned with construction design technical choice of the treatment technology the location of the plant and estimations of treatment capacity needs however this policy approach had limited involvement in procuring the investment needed to construct the plant in 2005 the federal government changed to a more money policy approach which implied an ambitious effort to construct wastewater treatment plants however it needed to consider complementary financial support for the municipalities this policy began during the last years of vicente fox s presidency 2000 2006 up to the whole next presidency felipe calderon 2006 2012 this dramatic rise in construction amounted to five times more plants constructed than those plants built during 1998 2004 equivalent in time length 1 1 see figure a1 in supplementary material 4 2 data collection to study the effect of financial self sufficiency on municipal wastewater policies we collected data from two sources our first source was the registry of wastewater treatment plants in mexico s national water commission which provided us with the national inventory of water treatment plants in 2016 our second source was the national institute of geography and statistics from which we obtained data about municipal public finances the unit of analysis was at the wastewater treatment plant level 4 3 outcome variable our outcome variable is the effectiveness of municipal wastewater treatment local policies although effectiveness entails multiple dimensions we approached this concept by selecting the type of wastewater treatment plant because a central issue in the municipal wastewater policy is defining the kind of wastewater plant to be constructed to meet their treatment needs but also considering their financial and organizational resources 62 70 from this point of view a compelling choice of the type of wastewater treatment plant guarantees balancing the wastewater treatment needs with the financial possibilities we approximated the measure of wastewater policy effectiveness by using a binary variable that measures whether the treatment plant is active i e in operation or inactive i e temporally or permanently closed by 2016 the year of nwc s inventory although this binary variable does not capture the notion of policy effectiveness with fidelity it does help to indirectly observe through the activity or inactivity of the plant whether the municipal wastewater policy accurately balanced the financial and organizational conditions with the wastewater treatment needs 4 4 explanatory variables our statistical model s two main explanatory variables are financial self sufficiency and national wastewater governance conditions financial self sufficiency is the sustainable capacity of an institution to maintain enough autonomy and reliability to cover its operating expenses without depending on external transfers 56 71 73 literature has shown that financial self sufficiency is an important municipal capability to reduce dependence on state or federal governments to effectively operate their part of a multi stakeholder policy 71 74 76 to measure the level of financial self sufficiency in municipalities we used the percentage of the municipal budget corresponding to the municipal s tax collection efforts to mitigate the volatility of local tax collection due to electoral years or other contingent factors we averaged the percentage of municipal income generated by local tax collection from five fiscal years before the nwc s inventory that is during 2011 2015 our second explanatory variable was the national sanitation policy which comprises the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach as discussed above to balance the exposition of these two policy approaches we limited the data to the treatment plants built between 1998 and 2004 for the more planning policy approach and 2005 2012 for the more money policy approach seeking more robust results we operationalized this variable into two measurements firstly we used a dummy variable for each treatment plant to observe whether the plant was built during the period corresponding to the more planning policy approach or the more money policy approach this variable helped us to directly compare the performance of both policy approaches and test our hypotheses secondly we used a continuous variable which was the year of construction of the plant this variable helped us to have a more nuanced understanding of how the policy approaches moderate the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater policy effectiveness this nuanced analysis was fundamental as the more money policy approach was gradually implemented since 2005 2 2 see figure a1 in supplementary material 4 5 control variables we included three control variables that may confound the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater policy effectiveness 1 federal participations 2 federal and state shares and 3 wastewater treatment capacity federal participations are financial transfers from the federal government to municipalities these are a function of the federal taxes produced indirectly by the municipality s socio economic conditions municipalities are free to assign these financial transfers to any expenditure we expect that municipalities with higher levels of economic activity will receive a higher proportion of participations and will have higher needs for wastewater management policies therefore this municipality profile may have higher operational conditions of the wastewater treatment plants and better conditions to strengthen their financial self sufficiency shares are financial transfers from federal and state governments to reduce inequality among municipalities cities with lower levels of industrialization tend to receive a higher proportion of shares the amount received in shares is bounded to spending rules therefore we expect that the shares bring resources to operate wastewater plants but it also disincentives municipalities from strengthening their financial self sufficiency we operationalized these two variables as federal participations or shares per ten thousand inhabitants in mexican pesos which accounts for the variations in population size among municipalities the wastewater treatment capacity could be a confounding factor explaining plants survivorship and financial self sufficiency typically bigger municipalities have more treatment capacity needs while they also tend to have higher levels of financial self sufficiency treatment capacity would be associated with higher effectiveness of treatment plant management as plants with high treatment capacity are often built in bigger municipalities we operationalized this variable as treatment capacity in liters per second 4 6 hypothesis our central proposition is that the effect of municipal financial self sufficiency on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management is moderated by the national sanitation policy approach specifically a more planning policy approach reduces the need for financial self sufficiency as a determinant to manage wastewater treatment plants effectively therefore in this study we seek to test whether each of both policy approaches the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach moderates the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater treatment management which we formulated in the following hypotheses h1 a more planning policy approach increases the effect of financial self sufficiency on wastewater treatment management compared with a more money policy approach nevertheless we also argue that the role of the national sanitation policy on financial self sufficiency may vary depending on the operating costs of the wastewater treatment plants the high investment needed to install wastewater treatment plants and their high operating costs explain why these plants are not being adopted in developing countries 77 as explained above a more money policy approach helps expand the adoption of wastewater treatment plants but only sometimes solves the subsequent problem of plant abandonment as discussed previously financial self sufficiency plays a role in avoiding abandonment and we hypothesized in h1 that the type of national sanitation policy moderates such a role nevertheless we also argue that the plant s technology choice plays a crucial role in understanding how the national sanitation policy shapes the management of wastewater treatment plants the choice of treatment technologies affects the financial burden of a plant s operating costs since operating costs increase the financial burden on municipalities this type of plant increases the need for financial self sufficiency to avoid the abandonment of plants alternative technologies oriented toward reducing operating costs particularly energy consumption have been crucial for adopting treatment plants in municipalities with weak financial autonomy and small wastewater treatment needs 78 therefore the type of treatment technology also shapes the effect of financial self sufficiency on the effectiveness of treatment management depending on whether the technology entails low or high operating costs h2a for plants with low operating costs financial self sufficiency does not have an effect on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management h2b for plants with high operating costs financial self sufficiency has a positive effect on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management further the policy approach may also shape how operating costs affect the likelihood of plant abandonment since each of the two sanitation policies of the mexican case has had a different approach toward the issue of operating costs on the one side the more money policy approach has prioritized securing the money for investment and overcoming the bureaucratic constraints and administrative time delays but with minimal regard for the size of the municipal s wastewater treatment needs or treatment technology choice and consequently operating costs on the other hand the more planning policy approach has prioritized the revision of treatment technology choice plant location and municipal s treatment needs but with minimal attention to securing the money for investment administrative or political constraints nor has it taken into consideration the local stakeholders the more planning policy approach tends towards centralized and technical planning and consequently the more money policy approach partially overlooks operating costs which are only shaped by the consideration of the technical choice considering this indirect and incidental effect of technology choice on operating costs a more planning policy approach will increase the probability of financial self sufficiency of plants with low operating costs conversely this effect would disappear when it comes to plants with high operating costs we formulated these propositions into the following hypothesis h3a for plants with low operating costs the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach will increase the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management h3b for plants with high operating costs the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach will have an equivalent effect on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plant management 4 7 model specification since our dependent variable e f f e c t i v e n e s s i is binary 1 still operating we used a logit estimation for all our models 3 3 given the high percentage of active treatment plants it is possible that the estimator i e logit or probit may affect the results 79 we did a robust analysis comparing the results of the models using logit and probit finding no meaningful differences among them see section a 4 in supplementary material the first explanatory variable s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y i corresponds to the percentage of municipal budget generated by local tax collection the second explanatory variable y e a r b u i l t i measures the year the plant was built the model includes a set x i of control variables to test our main theoretical explanation against alternative and plausible explanatory factors the control variables measure federal participations federal and state shares and treatment capacity we included an interaction effect between the two explanatory variables financial self sufficiency and governance conditions e f f e c t i v e n e s s i α β 1 s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y i β 2 y e a r b u i l t i β 3 s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y i y e a r b u i l t i β i x i ε i we used three statistical models to test our three hypotheses each model uses the statistical specification presented above but a different dataset to test hypothesis 1 we used a dataset composed of all types of wastewater treatment plants built from 1998 to 2012 n 2 175 to test hypotheses 2a and 3a we used a dataset composed only of treatment plants using the technology lagoon system n 478 which has the lowest operating costs in mexico 4 4 the average operating estimated cost of lagoon system treatment plants in mexico is 0 01 mexican pesos per kw hour per cubic meter 80 stabilization lagoons systems and artificial wetlands are technologies that rely more on microorganisms and less on infrastructure to remove contaminants from wastewater 81 82 making this technology inexpensive in construction and operation 83 to test hypotheses 2b and 3b we used a data set composed only of treatment plants using the activated sludge n 671 technology which has the highest operating costs in mexico 5 5 the average operating estimated cost of activated sludge treatment plants in mexico is 0 21 mexican pesos per kw hour per cubic meter 80 table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the 2175 municipalities as of 2016 73 of the wastewater treatment plants were active the average plant s year of construction was 2002 we observed high variation in the treatment capacity of the installed treatment plants on average a treatment plant can process 622 l per second whereas the plant with the highest capacity could process 23 280 l per second in the financial landscape of the municipalities we observe that on average the municipality generates 24 of the annual municipal budget however we see a high variation in financial self sufficiency of the municipalities where the municipality with the weakest self sufficiency had 0 1 of its revenues and the highest had 74 5 results several authors have highlighted the challenges of analyzing nonlinear interaction models as they convey double marginal effects 79 84 85 a limitation of our analysis is that our model choice poses some limitations in testing our hypotheses in this section we present our results and analyze the statistical significance of these in visual forms rather than analytical hypothesis testing following the best practices suggested by ref 84 for analyzing nonlinear interaction models we use figs 1 and 2 to assess our hypothesis 1 fig 1 shows that the predicted probability of a plant being active increases as self sufficiency increases although the slope s inclination is modest fig 1 also shows that the slope for the more planning policy approach is higher than the slope for the more money policy approach implying that the former approach has a higher effect on the probability of a plant being active than the latter nevertheless the confidence intervals of the predicted probabilities for both approaches overlap therefore the results are inconclusive as a robustness check we repeated the analysis by changing the variable of the policy approach from binary to continuous which is the year of construction of the plant this allows us to understand the marginal changes of financial self sufficiency when moderated by year of construction as a less restrictive measure of policy approach the contour plots show the results of such analysis recapping 2005 marks the ending of the more planning policy approach and the be ginning of the more money policy approach the contour plot of fig 2 reveals an interesting pattern not observed in fig 1 the effect of financial self sufficiency on the probability of a plant being active is negative for the lower end of the year of construction axis while it becomes positive in the higher end of the same axis roughly speaking the region around the year 2005 is a hinge point where the effect of financial self sufficiency shifts from negative to positive suggesting that for the earliest years of construction financial self sufficiency has a negative effect on the probability of a plant being active the direction of this variation is upwards which means that the effect of financial self sufficiency on sludge plant survival becomes stronger as the plants were more recently constructed the effect of financial self sufficiency on sludge plant survival is positive across all years of construction but it is not statistically significant during the period 1998 2004 that means we can only infer a positive effect of financial self sufficiency for sludge plants built on or after 2005 we used figs 3 and 4 to assess our hypotheses 2a and 3a fig 3 shows that in a more money policy approach the probability of being active in this type of plant is not meaningfully affected by financial self sufficiency in other words a more money policy approach does not moderate the effect of financial self sufficiency on policy effectiveness on the contrary a more planning policy approach does moderate such effect the same figure shows that the nonlinear slope of the more planning policy approach follows a logarithmic shape the predicted probabilities increase at a decreasing rate ending up at high levels of financial self sufficiency being a policy approach giving higher probabilities of remain active for plants in municipalities with high financial self sufficiency as the confidence intervals of the predicted probabilities for both approaches also overlap these results are inconclusive in the contour plot displayed in fig 4 the region with the lowest predicted probability of being an active plant is the bottom right corner representing the plants built in the most recent years in municipalities with the lowest financial self sufficiency on the other hand the region with the highest predicted probability resides on the upper side of the graph across all years of construction these patterns suggest that high financial self sufficiency is equally relevant in both policy approaches for plants with low operating costs in contrast low financial self sufficiency leads to higher abandonments in plants built during the more money policy approach we use figs 5 and 6 to assess our hypotheses 2b and 3b fig 5 shows that the predicted probability of a plant being active increases as financial self sufficiency increases the nonlinear slope shows a considerable upward steepness showing that the effect is positive and meaningful this figure also shows that the slopes for the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach are relatively the same suggesting that the moderating effect of both policy approaches on financial self sufficiency is equivalent in treatment plants with high operating costs as the confidence intervals of the predicted probabilities for both approaches also overlap these results are inconclusive the contour plot displayed in fig 6 shows that during the years of the more planning policy approach the effect of financial self sufficiency was more homogeneous than during the years of more money that is during the years of the more planning policy approach the predicted probability of a plant with high operating costs being active is relatively stable across different levels of financial self sufficiency in contrast in the more money years the predicted probabilities are more sensitive to the variation in that variable 6 discussion and implications sanitation is a constitutional right in mexico and many other countries as well however there needs to be more good intentions and results as the following are four main wastewater policy implications in investing in new wastewater infrastructure in mexico 1 financial self sufficiency positively affects a wastewater treatment plant s effectiveness either in the more money policy approach or in the more planning policy approach however this effect is modest financial self sufficiency in mexican municipalities still is not pressured by public debt however prospecting public debt tendencies some municipalities would have serious financial problems in the following years 86 in the case of municipalities facing a financial crisis the cost of wastewater treatment is one of the first to be cut entirety because wastewater generally does not directly affect people but it indirectly affects the environment and public health 57 87 we consider that the satisfactory operation of wastewater treatment plants is sensitive to changes in the financial self sufficiency of municipalities since the most visible expenses for citizens are difficult to cut such as water supply garbage collection and public lighting raw wastewater discharges can go unnoticed since they remain far from the municipal head where there is no daily citizen supervision so if the national government decides to grant subsidies for wastewater treatment it must do so with specifically labeled resources to prevent municipalities from allocating those resources to other priorities also the national government should require adequate planning of each investment so that public money can be used to the maximum avoiding spoiling 2 financial self sufficiency positively and strongly affects plant effectiveness in wastewater treatment plants with high operating costs i e active sludge plants this effect is the same in both the more planning policy approach and the more money policy approach financial self sufficiency has a positive and statistically significant effect on wastewater treatment plants with high operating costs since the activated sludge plants have a vocation mainly for municipalities with financial self sufficiency as a result of the collection of fees and generation of their income in addition to the advantage of taking advantage of economies of scale which allows having lower costs per user 88 otherwise a wastewater treatment plant with high operating costs located in a municipality with vulnerable financial self sufficiency will assume higher costs per user which may make the financial scheme unfeasible 3 compared with the more money policy approach the more planning policy approach increases the probability of wastewater treatment plants effectiveness the main weakness of policymaking is the need for adequate planning 89 argues the performance of budget management relies on policy planning it is evident in the mexican case since the outbreak of decreasing wastewater policy effectiveness in 2005 when the national government made extraordinary spending for new infrastructure as wastewater infrastructure is a long lived bet substantial policy planning is required 90 in mexico with an eminently national government investing system many water issues rely on adequate planning the national government allocates a pool of resources but it needs to exert control and proper monitoring this pattern can generate opportunities for corruption in the allocation construction and delivery of wastewater treatment plants 91 since government agencies are highly politicized local decisions depend more on political than technical knowledge 92 discretional allocations of subsidies reinforce the negative spiral of service deterioration in mexican municipal water agencies 93 there is a common belief that more money is enough and the most urgent issue is to achieve better water and sanitation services however it is necessary to improve the spending patterns in the public water sector since interest groups are trying to capture public resources 94 4 in plants with low operating costs i e lagoon systems the effect of financial self sufficiency on plants effectiveness varies depending on the policy approach a more money policy approach vanishes such effect while in the more planning policy approach the effect of financial self sufficiency on plants effectiveness is still positive and meaningful water governance implies decisions about how water services should be organized and financed by whom on what principles for serve what interests 95 6 the current wastewater treatment technology is mainly powered by expensive traditional technology however municipalities with a more planning policy approach may be the pioneers in transitioning to renewable energy alternatives such as solar panels in wastewater treatment plants this transition to cheaper electrical systems will also have a positive impact on the environment 96 97 our findings may have predicted that if the mexican government tries to invest a large number of resources more money policy approach in the renewable energy equipment of wastewater treatment plants is highly probable that the policy will be ineffective this tendency is because municipalities that chose to build lagoon wastewater treatment plants did so at the time of the more planning policy approach where the most meaningful effect in our findings is at the crossroads of wastewater plants effectiveness financial self sufficiency and more planning policy approach the above four policy implications of the mexican case can shed light on other countries mainly in the global south to focus efforts on providing more money to wastewater infrastructure water governance and policy must focus on policy planning mainly at the local level the waste of public money on water is unfair especially for the most vulnerable social groups both public ownership and private participation may be effective in the water sector public private partnerships can effectively provide water and sanitation services with a robust governance and policy framework when corruption is high private actors will pursue profit maximization over public needs which results in inadequate sanitation service provision 98 99 if the bribery risk is low the private sector can provide additional financing to public works projects in the water sector 100 then the main issue is controlling corruption in the water sector both in private and governmental agents an adequate water governance and policy framework will guarantee effectiveness rather than a unique ideological flag in favor or against the participation of private or public sectors in the water services provision public private or partnership investments will be effective in good governance 7 summary and conclusion why are being abandoned municipal wastewater treatment plants in mexico there is a high probability of an insufficient more money policy approach in wastewater treatment plants effectiveness when a municipality needs more robust financial self sufficiency and policy planning cities with larger populations are more likely to utilize their scale economies and activated sludge technology may be viable however during the more money policy approach the national government provided free funding to municipalities to build mainly high cost wastewater treatment infrastructure which needed more financial self sufficiency to sustain them mainly due to the excessive energy cost for the municipal budgets a more planning policy approach is more likely to succeed in maintaining operating wastewater treatment plants rather than a more money policy approach in mexico the main policy implication of these findings is to reform wastewater infrastructure financing requirements if a municipal water agency has no solid financial self sufficiency it must invest in a low energy cost plant avoiding activated sludge technology also community participation planning and involvement are essential in developing new wastewater treatment infrastructure the coming general water law will have good intentions and political correctness in writing strengthening municipal water agencies is the best bet to make good intentions a reality in mexico based on fig 2 we identify a future research agenda we observe that there is no effectiveness in wastewater treatment plants management at the beginning of the more planning policy approach which is contrary to our data tendencies we launched a hypothesis to study this contradiction at the beginning of the more planning policy approach there was null financial self sufficiency in mexican municipalities due to the high fiscal centralization of the national government in this sense we will search in the future for the key elements to understand when the more planning policy approach is not enough to achieve effectiveness in wastewater treatment plant management the mexican case illustrates two financing options and policy planning led by the public sector as is common in countries of the global south however involving municipal governments in these approaches is problematic for two reasons first municipal governments need more financial self sufficiency to ensure their capacity to contribute to a multi stakeholder wastewater treatment national policy second the centralization of planning and decisions of a national policy may become an obstacle to effective policy implementation the mexican case shows how combining these two conditions affects the probability of plant survivorship furthermore the effect of this combination grows when national governments follow a more money policy approach therefore we would expect that the findings of this study may be relevant for countries where governments are the prominent participants in the construction and maintenance of wastewater treatment plants particularly in countries where the planning of national policies is highly centralized and where local governments institutional capacity is weak finally the findings of this study indicate that pouring money into conditions of highly centralized planning and weak institutions in local governments could be more effective it is tempting to conclude that the problems to be solved are the centralization of planning and the institutional weakness of local governments however centralization and institutional weakness are inherent conditions of bureaucracies worldwide 101 for example the centralization of planning is instead a product of the administrative tradition of some states 102 on the other hand institutional capacity may be strengthened in a country but that does not impede strength variation across municipalities therefore a potential solution for the problem created by the combination of centralization and institutional weakness is an area of study for future research how or why this combination undermines the effectiveness of invested resources in a national sanitation

8633,water access is a critical public policy problem that many people face worldwide as demand for fresh water rises and supply declines a growing number of regions and localities including cities will be compelled to respond to water shortages therefore this paper aims to examine the rationalization of water consumption utilizing demarketing strategies in the gaza strip gs palestine the population under study comprises the residents of the gs amounting to approximately 2 1 million 2021 individuals a survey among 372 respondents living and working in the five gs governorates using a stratified random sample approach to mirror the population distribution finds a significant relationship between consumer attitudes toward reducing water consumption and 5 key marketing variables product price place promotion and people furthermore four moderators reinforced these relationships i e the perceived role of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment toward the water authority s management of water resources additionally age education level marital status and monthly income influence the effect of the demarketing mix on consumer attitudes toward reducing water consumption this study informs managerial action and policy making about the key variables to modulate in order to improve consumers attitudes toward water rationalization and thus intrinsically motivate consumers to curb water consumption keywords demarketing water consumption factor analysis structural equation modeling water right moral obligation institutional sentiment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water is essential for life yet access to water can sometimes be a challenge in several parts of the world 1 2 one of these areas is the gaza strip gs in palestine territorial restrictions on the gs have made access to water increasingly difficult for the more than 2 million residents of the gs as a result they buy water privately despite financial difficulty and poor water quality 3 in fact much of the purchased water is often polluted due to high salinity nitrate and chloride levels 4 5 this increases the risk of a large scale humanitarian crisis that may exacerbate the gs current living conditions which are already dire 6 in 2018 total household water use amounted to 83 1 million cubic meters falling short of the world health organization s who recommended minimum of 100 l per capita per day to cover basic household needs including cooking drinking bathing and laundry it is expected that additional supplies in the short to medium term will not be able to remedy the acute water scarcity situation in the gs this situation requires direct action in order to prevent the gs from spiralling down into a crisis the water and environmental economics literature has traditionally approached such issues from a managerial perspective by improving the distributional aspect of various water allocation schemes involving several stakeholders 7 focusing on infrastructure 8 and advanced technology 9 special emphasis has been placed on the economic value of cooperation through cooperative development and management of waters 10 the water conflict resolution management literature in particular emphasized the application of modeling e g hydro economic behavioral e g refs 11 13 legal aspects 14 policies 15 diplomacy 16 and governance 17 to settle issues in water allocation and distribution this research stream reemphasized the crucial importance of cooperation over rivalry to meet water demand 18 19 however this traditional supply approach to freshwater management fails to take into consideration the user or the demand side management although it is a crucial element of the total water cycle management approach and complementary to supply management 8 20 in response to the need to explore the user or consumer perspective a substantial water pricing literature has developed where pricing is the main instrument for water demand management in economics 21 24 in addition to water pricing a growing body of literature in environmental psychology has explored a broader range of drivers of conserving water 25 the present study contributes to this evolving research stream by suggesting the demarketing framework as an alternative perspective to promote water conservation behavior at the user level for improved water demand management this study adopts a multidisciplinary perspective by connecting the water demand management and environmental psychology areas with the social sciences and more specifically the marketing and consumer behaviour literature through demarketing a framework to nudge consumers to rationalize their water consumption and hence modulate water demand this is also in line with the recommendations of the palestinian water authority n d urging users to take necessary precautions and taking a series of corrective measures to minimize water waste e g prevent leakage optimal use of water in the shower and in the kitchen responsible car cleaning demarketing consists of a combination of demarketing strategies performed by marketing managers on the 4 ps of the marketing mix product price place promotion 26 to which we add the people variable demarketing employs the marketing mix to discourage customers from consuming or purchasing certain products either because they are harmful or because consumer demand exceeds supply 27 demarketing can help rationalize consumption by lowering product availability raising pricing conducting public awareness campaigns and shifting customer preferences to other products 28 past demarketing studies have found connections between consumers affective cognitive and behavioral responses 29 in a range of contexts including not only potentially hazardous consumption like smoking illegal drug use or firearms diversion for example 30 but also water and electricity consumption 31 32 consumer reactions to water demarketing techniques on the other hand have not been thoroughly researched in the literature 32 33 this research tries to address that void focusing on the gs region experiencing acute shortages in brief this approach has proven highly useful for curbing the consumption of various products or resources as such this framework could potentially help reduce water consumption too the current study adapts 26 approach to investigate consumers perceptions of and reactions to water demarketing efforts more specifically this research focuses on empirically testing the impact of consumers perceived demarketing efforts on their attitude toward deconsuming water besides in contrast to previous studies applying the demarketing framework we investigate the moderating effect of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment defined as attitudes toward water supply institutions and their handling of the water scarcity situation we find evidence that consumers perceptions of water demarketing efforts improve their attitude toward deconsuming water identifying the usefulness of demarketing in modifying consumers attitudes toward water usage and determining whether and how consumer predispositions reduce demarketing effectiveness are critical topics to address in areas where conservation is not optional but mandatory besides we opt to focus on attitude toward reducing water consumption as the dependent variable because factually observable behaviour might be biased e g no other alternative and extrinsically motivated e g fines rewards whereas attitudes as predispositions toward a specific object e g a particular behaviour constitute a better assessor of intrinsic or autotelic motivation which drives more meaningful and longer lasting behaviour 34 for this reason we focus on attitude instead of behaviour this study makes several contributions to the existing literature the first contribution is methodological and theoretical through the investigation of the demarketing framework and consumer reactions under a series of conditions or moderators including the role of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment towards the water authority s management of water resources fine tuning previous study results further in particular the results are consistent with past research e g ref 35 who found that regulatory methods for water conservation are more diversified e g changing laws adapting fiscal measures than those for water pricing second attitude instead of behaviour is considered as the dependent variable this constitutes a deviation from the existing water economics literature where typically behavioral changes are measured as a result of price changes instead we consider a broader array of drivers for behavioral change and focus primarily on improving attitudes towards such behavior another contribution resides in the use of 26 demarketing framework to determine how demarketing affects customer attitudes toward deconsuming water in the gs as such the study thus contributes to previous studies 6 in applying the demarketing framework to promote societal activities besides the study documents consumer reactions to water demarketing techniques which have typically been under researched in the literature 32 33 finally another contribution is practical because given the severity of water losses in the gs compared to the west bank 36 there is still ample room for improvement to foster water deconsumption 2 conceptual framework and hypotheses development 2 1 demarketing theory according to 26 demarketing is synonymous with demand reduction demarketing is defined as that aspect of marketing that deals with discouraging customers in general or a certain class of customers in particular on either a temporary or permanent basis 26 p 75 this definition is widely accepted by marketing scholars and practitioners e g 37 and is adopted in the current study demarketing is implemented by organizations and or governments by modulating the marketing mix elements i e product price place and promotion four situations call for demarketing 26 1 managing an existing shortage 2 avoiding potential shortages 3 minimizing harm to individuals 4 minimizing damage to nature or unique resources as we live in a world of diminishing earthly resources and products that can seriously affect our health demarketing is becoming the new normal however demarketing has some caveats 26 first the demarketing campaign might make the product or service desirable e g banning a book or movie second demarketing efforts might spur the emergence of a criminal class that will prosper during the induced scarcity e g the case during the prohibition era in the u s when liquor was banned third some human rights liberals and libertarians might argue about the government s interference with what they consider citizens basic rights none of these caveats apply to the current study moreover demarketing strategies to rationalize water consumption in the gaza strip are currently the only available alternative to tackle the water supply shortage ref 26 stated that demarketing works best when there is a high citizen consensus that some good or service consumption should be reduced by obtaining consumer input on potential demarketing action this study attempts to accomplish precisely that empirical research on the demarketing of water has grown in the past decades especially with the emergence of social marketing ethical marketing and sustainability in marketing e g 31 while water demarketing is crucial to palestinians and residents from neighboring arab countries it appears that water shortage is also a serious concern in israel 38 in that context ref 38 explored how different groups within israel s multiethnic country respond to the government s demarketing campaign to reduce water consumption ref 39 studied the effectiveness of pro environmental demarketing on consumers electricity consumption behaviors and found significant effects ref 40 evaluated the impact of a general demarketing strategy on electricity demand in a jordanian sample the demarketing strategy was composed of six elements advertising perception price solar energy provision and reference group which effectively reduced electricity demand furthermore 31 studied electricity demarketing strategies in gs under various psychographic variables including palestinians awareness motivation and attitudes toward the electricity supply company however neither of these past studies considered government regulation perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment towards the water authority s management of water resources along with demarketing strategies in addition we add people as a fifth strategy to the four basic strategies in contrast to past research and to complement the state of the art this study proposes that laws and regulations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment toward the water authority s management of water resources are critical moderators with the potential to strengthen demarketing managerial efforts for water deconsumption 2 2 relationship between the demarketing mix and consumer response this study focuses on demarketing strategies by organizations not the government we stipulate a direct effect from demarketing elements of the product h1 price h2 place h3 and promotion h4 respectively as well as people h5 to consumer attitude toward reducing water consumption as described below under the framework of demarketing the product corresponds to marketing efforts to reduce its sales volume as part of the concept of demarketing ref 41 states that companies try to limit supply lines and minimize service and productive activities encouraging customers to purchase the product furthermore it is well established that satisfied customers positively impact profitability because they prefer to buy more product units and engage in long term repurchases 42 in contrast dissatisfied customers reduce revenue because of their lower purchases and product consumption 42 additionally their dissatisfaction often contributes to complaints 43 and unfavorable word of mouth 44 therefore if satisfaction increases consumption and dissatisfaction reduces it a dissatisfied customer would be more likely to form deconsumption attitudes also facilitating and urging the use of alternative products is a critical demarketing strategy 45 based on the above we hypothesize h1 product modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption price determination can present a simple yet effective solution to the deconsumption of water 22 24 the demarketing pricing strategy focuses on decreasing the current demand by increasing prices 32 as 46 has noted pricing impacts customer attitudes and behavior if customers see prices as unreasonably high they would likely have a negative attitude toward the product coupled with a low buying intention 47 increasing prices will decrease demand e g 48 yet price determination in demarketing poses one of the most challenging decision making processes 49 the objective of the demarketing pricing policy is to increase prices to reduce but not eliminate product demand thus we set the following hypothesis h2 price modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption previous research deems place location as one of the critical aspects of demarketing the place may be modulated either in terms of place of consumption or place of buying and both elements can impose a demarketing effect 50 according to ref 51 limiting the areas to enact a behavior may serve as a barrier to promoting the behavior and profoundly impacting intentions thus restrictions on consumption are an essential barrier to consumption and should also directly impact consumption attitudes 52 also limitations on buying would have a similar result curbing the influence attributable to opportunity cost e g 53 applied in a demarketing sense this implies that spending more time and effort looking for a product would minimize the time for other tasks such as leisure household chores or self maintenance 52 thus we propose the following hypothesis h3 place modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption the demarketing strategy includes promotions to encourage customers to purchase products that are not utilized and anti promotion practices to rationalize consumption 54 drawing on 55 55 ref 41 points out that as one of the main goals of environmental marketing promotions concentrate on informing the public about the value of environmental behavior and the need to protect the environment and natural resources furthermore research demonstrates the importance of consumer promotion in demarketing 56 57 due to its direct negative impact on attitudes 58 therefore we anticipate the following hypothesis h4 promotion modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption people can also propose a simple yet effective solution to the problem of water shortage individuals who engage in self prediction examine what they have done versus what they should do in relation to a specific behavior self predictions in the direction of social norms are common people who make self predictions frequently act in a socially acceptable manner to ease the related cognitive dissonance they subsequently act in a way that would have been less likely before 59 as a result if the social norm shifts behavior may also shift people s behavior will begin to change as social norms change because people tend to make self predictions in the direction of social norms they must be educated and then nudged adequately to achieve the appropriate changes self prediction can make people feel uncomfortable psychologically by bringing up differences between their beliefs and prior behaviors leading to targeted persons changing their minds as a result we propose the following hypothesis h5 people modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 3 the moderating effect of regulations government backed regulation is likely to influence consumers water deconsumption directly and amplify the effect of demarketing measures regulation is broadly defined as the intentional activity of attempting to control order or influence the behavior of others 60 p 19 the term regulation is a broader concept than law 61 and thus is adopted in this study in addition to formally established laws such as statutes primary and delegated regulations and common laws regulations also include economic incentives and market based frameworks 62 it is hypothesized that regulations regarding a specific product or service should heighten consumer sensitivity toward that product and as a result make its characteristics such as the product itself price place and distribution more salient to the consumer therefore h6 regulations amplify the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 4 the moderating effect of perceived moral obligation despite extensive studies in the field of environmental consumption little empirical research has been conducted on the concept of consumer responsibility 63 64 examine the impact of moral obligation in morally significant scenarios comparable to the setting here and find that it improves the theory of planned behavior tpb model albeit the results are inconsistent the degree to which an individual feels morally obligated to execute a certain behavior is known as perceived moral obligation it may be significant when consumers consider the impact of their actions on others e g donating blood and drunk driving according to 51 some researchers have proved that both social influences and perceived moral obligations impact people s behavioral intentions 65 outline three criteria for defining a moral situation 1 the choice is essential and significant 2 moral rules are not arbitrary and cannot be made up and 3 appeals to obey moral rules are based on the premise that the rules are important in themselves rather than primarily utilitarian motives in light of these principles water consumption in a drought stricken area is an interesting environment to investigate the impact of moral obligation on individual consumption decisions 66 for example utilizes perceived moral obligation to increase the fundamental tpb in the context of building a model to investigate water use behavior according to the results based on the above mentioned findings perceived moral obligations significantly influence moral intentions this is especially true when the behavior involves conflicts between self and public interests furthermore since water conservation may be considered a social dilemma using water freely provides personal comfort and convenience while also harming public interest perceived moral obligations are likely to influence people s positive predisposition toward conservation therefore h7 perceived moral obligation amplifies the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 5 the moderating effect of perceived water right 66 extends the tpb model by including a person s perceived water right the degree to which people believe they have the right to use water as they choose is known as perceived water right other water consumption research has emphasized its significance in understanding water use e g 67 69 water rights have long been considered an important topic in water resource issues several authors e g 67 70 discussed it from economic and political viewpoints however psychological research on how individuals view their personal water rights let alone the impact of such perceptions has been limited perceived water right and perceived moral obligation on the surface appear to be contradictory people who believe they have a legal right to consume water will feel less obligated to save it nonetheless the concepts of obligation and right may not be mutually exclusive on the one hand some individuals may feel compelled to save water while believing they have the right to use it it would be interesting to learn how people s beliefs about their water rights impact their behavior particularly if these perceptions conflict with their perceived obligations in conclusion both a tpb model with only main effects and a tpb model including interaction effects may help better understand household water conservation furthermore in addition to the impact accounted for by these models perceived moral obligation and perceived water right may have an influence this research looks into all of these options a tpb model with linear and quadratic effects is also evaluated to prevent misunderstanding of quadratic effects for spurious interactions 71 thus h8 perceived water right amplifies the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 6 the moderating effect of institutional sentiment and the water authority s management of water resources in understanding consumer behavior toward public goods we suggest that consumers attitudes regarding water supply institutions and their handling of the water situation are essential explanatory variables for water use consumers according to neoclassical economic theory are primarily driven by self interest although there is evidence that customers are often unaware of the prices they pay for utilities water usage may adjust to prices paid as individuals maximize their own utility 35 price effectiveness is likely to be hampered by a lack of knowledge experimental economists and evolutionary psychologists provide a much more sophisticated consumer image than the homo economicus viewpoint that occasionally dominates the argument consumers are increasingly being seen behaving in exchange relationships in the setting of reciprocal inclinations e g 72 73 reciprocity is defined as a in kind response to a beneficial or harmful act 72 p 160 although the variables that influence reciprocal behavior are debatable this implies that people reward positive behavior and penalize negative behavior even when it costs them money cf 74 75 institutional trust a term similar to but separate from attitudes toward the organization is argued to have a role in water consumption decisions in other studies 76 this however has yet to be empirically validated extending this logic and applying the theory of reciprocity to water consumption within the context of a social marketing intervention to promote the deconsumption of that utility it is proposed that household water consumption decisions are influenced by residents perceptions of how well the institutions in charge manage their water thus consumers will show positive reciprocity and lower their water usage if they believe their region s water is managed correctly e g through informed positive and beneficial marketing communications on the other hand consumers will display negative reciprocity and penalize the water authority by paying less attention to their water usage if they believe their water is not being well managed e g through less informed marketing and or harmful marketing communications consequently it is expected that consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption is favorably related to institutional sentiment towards the water authority s management of water resources therefore we articulate the following hypothesis h9 institutional sentiment amplifies the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption fig 1 illustrates the resulting conceptual framework from a consumer viewpoint this model connects the demarketing mix including people with the dependent variable consumers water deconsumption attitudes it also indicates the four moderating variables impact on each hypothesized path from the demarketing mix factors to the dependent variable 3 method 3 1 study context this research was carried out in the gs palestine water delivery is increasingly difficult because of the israeli government s territorial restrictions on the gs as a result about two million gazans face a continual water deficit worsening in summer the tap water is polluted with high salinity nitrite and chloride levels 5 and should not be consumed without treatment residents are obliged to use this water for bathing and washing since they have no other options yet the supply is inconsistent and unpredictable so that residents have no alternative except to buy water privately for drinking and cooking despite extreme financial difficulties and even then it is frequently of poor quality 3 the water shortage in the gs and the poor tap water quality has been well documented e g 3 over pumping and wastewater contamination have damaged the gs s coastal aquifer its only water supply as a result 96 2 of the aquifer s household water is non potable furthermore due to the gs s outdated infrastructure around 40 of the household water supply is lost on its way to consumers due to leaking however an estimated 68 of this water is polluted with high nitrite and chloride levels 5 putting people in danger of disease transmission due to water supply unreliability many residents store water in containers on their rooftops when the supply is shut off the power supply in gs is also intermittent and it frequently does not turn on at the same time as the water residents ability to run pumps to fill containers is therefore hampered families that do not get a chance to pump water to the roof before the electricity goes out will be without running water gazans are forced to buy desalinated water from private vendors due to the low quality and restricted water availability which they use primarily for drinking and cooking purposes but also for other reasons however the purchased water is too expensive for many gaza residents 77 according to ref 4 95 1 million cubic meters of water were supplied for household use in the gs in 2018 with 193 7 million cubic meters of total water use however due to the gs s outdated and damaged infrastructure about 35 6 million cubic meters of water are wasted on the way to households as a result total home use in 2018 was 83 1 million cubic meters falling short of the world health organization s who recommended minimum of 100 l per capita per day this who recommended minimum of 100 l should be sufficient to cover basic household requirements such as drinking bathing cooking and laundry 3 2 data collection and sample the study used a descriptive cross sectional survey research approach a questionnaire was developed by adapting existing measurement scales three marketing academics and three marketing practitioners pretested the questionnaire following that the researchers modified the questionnaire according to their comments the questionnaire was translated into arabic by a professional translator the content accuracy of the translation was then pilot tested after two arabic native speakers approved it a group of 20 people administered the final questionnaire and submitted it in person during field visits using direct face to face interviewing this contributed to ensure a greater response rate five groups of team members were formed three data collectors and one supervisor made up each group each of the five gs governorates a palestinian territory administrative division called in arabic muhafazah namely north gaza gaza deir el balah khan yunis and rafah received one group more specifically the target sample for this study was established as adult consumers 18 years of age and older residing in the different gs governorates consequently the sampling frame consisted of the geographical distribution of palestinian households in each governorate the sampling is also of a probabilistic nature since the neighborhoods and the household starting point inside each of those neighborhoods were both randomly picked as part of a two step geographic stratified sampling technique each of these strata s first household was chosen randomly and a questionnaire was submitted to the household head of every fifth household team members attended a two day training workshop on data gathering processes group supervisors were in charge of guaranteeing data quality closely monitoring the process and minimizing interviewer bias to overcome any apprehensions about participating in the study a letter from the researchers clarified the study s goal and then invited them to engage in the study by filling out the questionnaire the sample size was obtained using the formula below 78 n n p 1 n p e 2 with n as the sample size np as the population size and e as the error term e 0 05 according to the calculation a sample size of 384 was deemed appropriate for an error margin of 5 seven of the 384 residents who were chosen to participate in this study declined to do so for various reasons another five consented but either did not answer parts of the questions or declined to complete the questionnaire after starting it as a result 372 questionnaires were collected from april 27 2021 to may 26 2021 the study population comprises the residents of the gs 2 1 million in 2021 36 as stated in table 1 384 people were chosen using a stratified random sampling approach to mirror the population distribution in the five gs governorates using the smartpls 3 0 software the data was analyzed using pls sem modeling the structural equation model was evaluated using a two step analytic methodology 80 the measuring items 81 were subjected to validity and reliability testing in the first stage the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement outer model was tested a comparison was made between the square root of the average variance extracted ave and the correlation between latent constructs to assess discriminant validity the structural inner model and the hypotheses were tested in the second step the coefficient of determination was used to analyze the relationships between variables in the hypotheses r2 bootstrapping based on 5000 re samples was used to test all hypothesized path coefficients 3 3 measures consumer perceptions of the five demarketing elements were used to determine how effective they were the product variable was evaluated by a four item scale adapted from 31 82 price was measured by a four item scale adapted from 28 83 the place variable was assessed by a four item scale adapted from 28 84 the promotion measure was adapted from 32 52 using a four item scale people was assessed by a five item scale adapted from 85 86 the questionnaire s second section includes questions about the moderators the effect of laws and legislations in rationalizing water consumption was evaluated by a three item scale developed by 55 87 a four item scale derived from 66 68 measured the perceived moral obligation perceived water right was assessed by a four item scale derived from 66 68 institutional sentiment regarding the water authority s water resources management was measured with a four item scale derived from 68 76 the dependent variable was addressed in the third section of the questionnaire the measure of attitude toward water deconsumption was taken from 68 88 using a four item scale all questions were graded on a seven point likert scale ranging from 1 to 7 with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 7 meaning strongly agree various demographic questions including age gender education level marital status monthly income and financial independence were also evaluated finally some factors specific to the study such as perceptions of water price levels were included 4 results 4 1 descriptive data the sample demographics are typical and representative of the gs population as shown in table 2 notably more than 43 of respondents are under the age of 30 54 of respondents are male besides 81 2 of respondents have a diploma or a bachelor s degree according to the palestinian central bureau of statistics pcbs 2021 1 1 https www pcbs gov ps postar aspx lang ar itemid 4313 the illiteracy rate of palestine is one of the lowest rates in the world 2 3 of the population of 15 years old and more in addition more than 46 000 students graduate annually from the palestinian universities that is about 1 of the total population 2 2 ministry of higher education and scientific research 2022 annual report available in arabic at https www mohe pna ps services statistics in addition more than half of the respondents are married 63 7 and 60 2 of the respondents earn less than usd 500 per month this monthly salary is gross and per individual it is worth noting that the minimum monthly wage in palestine is nis 1880 which is equivalent to about us 500 it is also worth mentioning that some 65 3 of respondents are financially independent additionally almost three quarters of the respondents 74 find that the price level of purchased water is high and 31 5 of them do not pay for their water this may be the result of a variety of reasons including 1 the dominant culture in which many people assume that donor nations like qatar are providing funds to the gs to cover the cost of water and 2 the high unemployment and poverty rates and the worsening of economic conditions more specifically the unemployment rate among labor force participants in 2022 was 24 the unemployment rate between the west bank and gaza strip is still significantly different reaching 45 in the gaza strip compared to 13 in the west bank 3 3 https www pcbs gov ps post aspx lang en itemid 4421 in addition data issued in 2022 indicate that 36 of the palestinian population lives below the poverty line according to figures from the united nations conference on trade and development unctad which warned of deepening poverty in the occupied palestinian territories 4 2 measurement model the questionnaire items are shown in table 3 to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measures all construct indicators were integrated into a confirmatory factor analysis cfa smartpls 3 0 cfa is a statistical method for confirming the factor structure of a collection of observed data the researcher can examine the hypothesis that there is a connection between the variables that are seen and the latent constructs that underlie them using cfa in general factor loading is the correlation between the factor and the variable factor loading displays the variation on that specific factor that is explained by the variable according to the sem technique as a rule of thumb a factor loading of 0 7 or above indicates that the factor extracts sufficient variation from the variable as shown in table 3 all of the 40 items were significantly over the standard criteria of 0 70 p 0 001 89 indicating high convergent validity convergent validity is known as the degree to which one test is connected to others that assess the same or related constructs therefore a range of indicators is commonly used to validate constructs accordingly cronbach s alpha is calculated it is an indicator of how closely connected a group of items is to one another i e internal consistency it is regarded as a measure of scale reliability as shown in table 3 all cronbach s alpha values were above or marginally close to the 0 60 cut off level 90 in addition the coefficients of reliability are calculated it is a measure of the consistency of scores across contexts its value which ranges from 0 to 1 gives an estimate of the portion of the computed score variance that is attributable to real variation as opposed to error the greater this coefficient the more certain the researcher may be that results collected at various periods under comparable circumstances with the same individuals would be comparable as shown in table 3 the coefficients of reliability ranged between 0 705 and 0 934 these results suggest satisfactory construct reliability furthermore the average variance extracted ave is calculated it is a metric for comparing the variation recorded by a construct to the variance resulting from measurement error as shown in table 3 the ave exceeded the threshold of 0 50 in each case 91 these findings confirm that the constructs have convergent validity for skewness and kurtosis values conventional thresholds of 1 and 2 respectively were used in addition to the means and standard deviations no concerns with skewness or kurtosis were found in the dataset as indicated in table 3 overall these findings imply that the data across the great majority of construct items are normally distributed additionally we examined the variance inflation factors vif values to spot multi collinearity issues the results are reported in table 3 each predictor construct s vif value must be less than 5 in order to be considered exempt from multi collinearity issues 92 the results show that all vif values are below 5 as a result it was established that the variables employed in this study do not exhibit multi collinearity issues discriminant validity was evaluated using fornell and larcker s criterion 93 table 4 shows that no ave had a lower correlation than the maximum correlation with any other component indicating discriminant validity 4 3 structural model assessment the structural model findings are shown in table 5 since smartpls can not estimate several moderators simultaneously we used five different models one without interaction effects and four that assessed the interactive effect of each moderating variable separately throughout the five models the overall fit is excellent in addition the srmr value of the composite model was 0 103 which is close to 94 suggested value of 0 10 the stone geisser q2 was used to determine predictive relevance and the standardized root mean residual was employed q2 95 assesses the model s and estimated parameters ability to reproduce observed values with a value greater than 0 indicating predictive relevance 96 the explanatory power of the structural model and its ability to predict endogenous components were assessed using the r2 determination coefficient the adjusted r2 revealed that the independent factors account for 55 2 of the variation in attitude toward reducing water usage this proportion is comparable to other sem based analytics studies with smartpls for example 97 0 181 0 734 or 98 0 489 obtained similar r2 values using the sem method with smartpls the sign magnitude and significance of path coefficients were all considered the significance of each estimated path was determined using bootstrapping which consisted of 5000 resamples drawn with replacement the results in table 5 suggest that all five elements of the demarketing strategy are positively connected to the attitude to reduce water consumption however when any of the three moderators is added the influence of price becomes minimal this suggests that price changes will not always result in a less favorable attitude toward water deconsumption for well informed motivated and conscientious consumers therefore product place and promotion modifications should be employed as well for such customers the main findings will be discussed in more detail in the next section 5 discussion all five demarketing variables product price place promotion and people influence a positive attitude toward water consumption rationalization in order of priority place people price promotion and product are positively connected to attitude toward water usage reduction as shown in table 4 supporting h1 5 in terms of moderators while the role of laws and legislations did not interact much with product and price to affect attitude toward water limitation it did significantly impact such attitudes the empirical findings confirm the moderating function of laws and legislations on the place people and promotion attitude links bolstering h6c e but not h6a b this finding is consistent with past research such as 35 who found that regulatory methods for water conservation are more diversified than those for the price and that their implications and efficacy are less explored for climate related reasons water utilities in australia where barrett s study took place favor restrictions limiting water consumption typically water use limits take the form of prohibitions on watering outdoor gardens during droughts this has proven to be quite successful in lowering water use 83 the results of the present study further emphasize the direct role of law and legislation in favoring attitudes toward water deconsumption especially for individuals perceiving that water utilities and companies modulate water distribution promote water deconsumption and have competent staff although perceived moral obligation has a direct influence on attitude toward limiting water consumption it does not interact with people according to table 4 but it does interact favorably with all the other elements of the demarketing mix i e product price place promotion h7a d is supported by these data but not h7e previous research contradicts this conclusion e g 66 despite its intuitive appeal and theoretical foundations perceived moral obligation had little effect on attitudes toward reducing water usage 68 however a deeper examination of the data reveals that the average perceived moral obligation was extraordinarily high m 4 77 on a scale of 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree with 83 highly agreeing and 14 agreeing with the statement idiosyncratic effects pertaining to the gs may be in effect here in fact the protracted drought experienced by gs residents in addition to the specific climate and geopolitical contexts enhanced respondents impressions in this research setting as a result quantitatively determining the influence of perceived moral obligation inside water usage models is challenging in light of this research using 66 as well as 68 as starting points more precise constructs operationalizing the perceived moral obligation variable might need to be developed also because consumers perceived moral obligation is linked to sustainable consumption policy makers should work to improve customers perceptions of sustainability and their feeling of social responsibility to affect their actual behavior 99 although perceived water right does not interact with price or people it has a favorable impact on deconsumption attitude similar to the two preceding moderators furthermore perceived water right has a favorable relationship with product place and promotion these findings collectively support h8a and h8c d but h8b and h8e are not supported one explanation for this might be that perceived water right refers to how much people believe they have the right to utilize water in any way they choose and indeed other water consumption research has emphasized the significance of the effect of perceived water right on water usage behavior e g 68 69 interestingly in 66 the findings show that integrating a sense of moral obligation does not significantly improve the statistical fit of the model and that the influence of a sense of water right is empirically inconsistent this is one of the few instances in which both impacts have been empirically demonstrated in the literature the impact has been hypothesized but only weakly experimentally verified in earlier research e g 66 providing significant evidence of the need to use alternative variables e g tpb variables in investigating household water consumption models yet the current study shows the significant impact of both variables at least in a developing country context where access to water is scarce due to geopolitically laden contingencies in other circumstances where a person s perceived water right might be greater e g canada marketing communications aimed at lowering water use could also diminish a person s perceived water right by appealing to their values given the diversity of consumer perceptions of water as a right organizations should first strive to identify the degree to which customers regard water as a right since this will greatly influence the design of future marketing programs and communications for example household water may be recast as a product with economic and environmental consequences or a luxury rather than a right in specific circumstances this would also be in line with the consumer citizenship literature e g 63 which emphasizes the significance of understanding ethical consumption decisions through the concept of consumer responsibility if on the other hand residents in a specific location have a poor perception of their water rights appealing to consumer attitudes about water rights may not significantly influence water conservation thus alternative methods should be utilized 68 like the three preceding moderators the water authority s management of water resources has a beneficial impact on attitude toward water deconsumption even though having no interaction with promotion or people instead the water authority s management of water resources interacts positively with product price and place strategies h9a c is supported by these data but not h9d e one explanation for this might be that home water usage decisions are influenced by the inhabitants perceptions of how well the institutions in charge manage water consumers perceiving that the utility is modified product water price is modulated price and access to water is amended place will show better reciprocity and more favorable attitudes toward water deconsumption if they believe their region s water is being effectively managed the water authority s management of water resources can enact such positive signaling through informational positive and beneficial marketing communications on the other hand consumers perceiving similar changes in product price and place will demonstrate negative reciprocity and penalize the water authority by paying less attention to their water use if they believe their water is not well managed this could result from effective mismanagement or sub optimal marketing actions and or negative communications from third parties e g ngos media moreover these effects tend to differ significantly across demographics according to the findings of the independent samples test f 0 164 t 3 48 sig 2 tailed 0 000 female and younger customers are more likely to be impacted by the demarketing factors furthermore as confirmed by post hoc least significant difference lsd tests that followed anova the effect of the perceived demarketing strategy on water consumption is significantly different for different demographic segments specifically age p 0 000 level of education p 0 027 marital status p 0 000 and monthly income p 0 046 the lsd test revealed that those between 21 and 30 are more likely to be persuaded by demarketing efforts than those between 51 and 60 and those aged 61 and above this might be because elderly customers spend more time at home and hence require more water water conservation attitudes are favorably connected with younger customers the lsd test also revealed that those with a high school degree or less are more likely to be affected by demarketing efforts to minimize water usage than people with a master s degree or a ph d furthermore statistically significant differences exist between diploma holders and bachelor s degree holders favoring diploma holders the findings further reveal that married people are more likely to be influenced by demarketing efforts than single people this might be because married people have children use more water and are thus more sensitive to water usage to curb costs finally the lsd test revealed that people with a lower monthly income per capita below 1000 are more likely to be affected by demarketing approaches than those with a monthly income of 1501 to 2000 there might be various reasons for this perhaps most importantly consumers income influences their purchasing power thus those with a higher income can drink more water than those with a lower income 6 conclusions in sum under certain consumer states specifically the role of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation water right and water authority s management of water resources the influence of demarketing strategies on the product price place promotion and people elements of the demarketing mix appears beneficial however a deeper look into these interactions reveals some additional insights into the unique context of areas with severe water shortages product price place promotion and people reconfigurations to better satisfy demands tend to reduce water use while prior research has focused on water price modulations as a critical component of water demand management this study reveals the insufficiency of such an approach since it also seems required to consider product place promotion and people to shape more favorable attitudes toward water deconsumption the results confirm 100 s or 101 s conclusions about the importance of pricing and non pricing measures to rationalize domestic water consumption for example 100 show that in addition to pricing modulation emphasis should also be put on non pricing initiatives such as public education information and awareness campaigns in an empirical analysis based on self reported data 101 further show that non pricing measures especially public awareness campaigns to rationalize water use and targeted campaigns to promote water savings technologies have an even greater impact on water consumption decisions compared to pricing measures more generally the study emphasizes the importance of the psychological perspective 20 to modulate the demand site in water demand management the construction of a substantial and unique model for demarketing water use in the gs contributes to the water demand management literature by promoting water conservation behavior as emphasized in the early works in this research stream as household water usage becomes more important the consumer becomes a critical stakeholder in any water conservation project 8 20 this is even more critical in areas characterized by scarce water access therefore developing a substantial and unique model for demarketing water use in the gs contributes meaningfully to the water demand management literature and the following implications can be formed for this research area first while this study did not look at the availability of other water sources such as importing water e g from turkey and establishing a desalination plant for seawater it did look into import solutions in the place variable which showed to be significantly positive for improving attitudes toward water deconsumption this study contributes to previous research by stressing that alternative product sources and product substitution lead to favorable attitudes toward deconsumption besides in contrast to previous studies that ignored promotion in favor of product price and place this study demonstrates that promotion plays a vital role in demarketing it is in fact a recurrently significant factor furthermore promotion receives the highest positive reinforcement from all moderators followed by place and product with price receiving the least positive reinforcement the current study further suggests that deconsumption can arise outside of the green or sustainable aspect deconsumption can also happen and primarily occurs under dire political and territorial conditions for sustenance or even survival matters rather than for environmental reasons thirdly social advertisers and policy makers cannot rely on unidimensional demarketing strategies such as pricing alone as an effective way to change customers attitudes and behavior only a comprehensive multidimensional full fledged demarketing plan that also includes staff people is expected to provide meaningful reductions in water use as another implication ad hoc and one time demarketing actions are unlikely to have the desired effect however the findings show that the 4ps besides people have a demarketing effect over time implying that governments should give adequate and long term strategic instruments for anti promotional activities furthermore the results pertaining to palestine although plausible and well established may not apply to other nations inter country disparities in water use positive social norms regarding water usage the water sector s involvement in the national economy or circumstances that dissuade the government from deflating water consumption rationalization may impact attitudes finally although the demarketing framework espouses the psychological perspective to water demand management 20 complementing therefore water supply practice and research it does however offer authorities and organizations organisms practical guidelines in the form of the demarketing strategies as such albeit user focused the framework provides useful guidelines for managerial action e g modulating product price place promotion and connects therefore also at least partially with the supply side of the water demand management research area while the research presented makes the aforementioned contributions it is not without limitations that future research might address first future research should consider other factors influencing participants reactions such as their average house area as well as the space available to them for storing water and the type of storage equipment that they possess e g storage tanks second this research focuses on the influence of demarketing tactics on customers and how consumers perceive them future research might compare these findings to actual data on water consumption following demarketing campaigns author statement mohammed salem conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing myriam

8633,water access is a critical public policy problem that many people face worldwide as demand for fresh water rises and supply declines a growing number of regions and localities including cities will be compelled to respond to water shortages therefore this paper aims to examine the rationalization of water consumption utilizing demarketing strategies in the gaza strip gs palestine the population under study comprises the residents of the gs amounting to approximately 2 1 million 2021 individuals a survey among 372 respondents living and working in the five gs governorates using a stratified random sample approach to mirror the population distribution finds a significant relationship between consumer attitudes toward reducing water consumption and 5 key marketing variables product price place promotion and people furthermore four moderators reinforced these relationships i e the perceived role of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment toward the water authority s management of water resources additionally age education level marital status and monthly income influence the effect of the demarketing mix on consumer attitudes toward reducing water consumption this study informs managerial action and policy making about the key variables to modulate in order to improve consumers attitudes toward water rationalization and thus intrinsically motivate consumers to curb water consumption keywords demarketing water consumption factor analysis structural equation modeling water right moral obligation institutional sentiment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water is essential for life yet access to water can sometimes be a challenge in several parts of the world 1 2 one of these areas is the gaza strip gs in palestine territorial restrictions on the gs have made access to water increasingly difficult for the more than 2 million residents of the gs as a result they buy water privately despite financial difficulty and poor water quality 3 in fact much of the purchased water is often polluted due to high salinity nitrate and chloride levels 4 5 this increases the risk of a large scale humanitarian crisis that may exacerbate the gs current living conditions which are already dire 6 in 2018 total household water use amounted to 83 1 million cubic meters falling short of the world health organization s who recommended minimum of 100 l per capita per day to cover basic household needs including cooking drinking bathing and laundry it is expected that additional supplies in the short to medium term will not be able to remedy the acute water scarcity situation in the gs this situation requires direct action in order to prevent the gs from spiralling down into a crisis the water and environmental economics literature has traditionally approached such issues from a managerial perspective by improving the distributional aspect of various water allocation schemes involving several stakeholders 7 focusing on infrastructure 8 and advanced technology 9 special emphasis has been placed on the economic value of cooperation through cooperative development and management of waters 10 the water conflict resolution management literature in particular emphasized the application of modeling e g hydro economic behavioral e g refs 11 13 legal aspects 14 policies 15 diplomacy 16 and governance 17 to settle issues in water allocation and distribution this research stream reemphasized the crucial importance of cooperation over rivalry to meet water demand 18 19 however this traditional supply approach to freshwater management fails to take into consideration the user or the demand side management although it is a crucial element of the total water cycle management approach and complementary to supply management 8 20 in response to the need to explore the user or consumer perspective a substantial water pricing literature has developed where pricing is the main instrument for water demand management in economics 21 24 in addition to water pricing a growing body of literature in environmental psychology has explored a broader range of drivers of conserving water 25 the present study contributes to this evolving research stream by suggesting the demarketing framework as an alternative perspective to promote water conservation behavior at the user level for improved water demand management this study adopts a multidisciplinary perspective by connecting the water demand management and environmental psychology areas with the social sciences and more specifically the marketing and consumer behaviour literature through demarketing a framework to nudge consumers to rationalize their water consumption and hence modulate water demand this is also in line with the recommendations of the palestinian water authority n d urging users to take necessary precautions and taking a series of corrective measures to minimize water waste e g prevent leakage optimal use of water in the shower and in the kitchen responsible car cleaning demarketing consists of a combination of demarketing strategies performed by marketing managers on the 4 ps of the marketing mix product price place promotion 26 to which we add the people variable demarketing employs the marketing mix to discourage customers from consuming or purchasing certain products either because they are harmful or because consumer demand exceeds supply 27 demarketing can help rationalize consumption by lowering product availability raising pricing conducting public awareness campaigns and shifting customer preferences to other products 28 past demarketing studies have found connections between consumers affective cognitive and behavioral responses 29 in a range of contexts including not only potentially hazardous consumption like smoking illegal drug use or firearms diversion for example 30 but also water and electricity consumption 31 32 consumer reactions to water demarketing techniques on the other hand have not been thoroughly researched in the literature 32 33 this research tries to address that void focusing on the gs region experiencing acute shortages in brief this approach has proven highly useful for curbing the consumption of various products or resources as such this framework could potentially help reduce water consumption too the current study adapts 26 approach to investigate consumers perceptions of and reactions to water demarketing efforts more specifically this research focuses on empirically testing the impact of consumers perceived demarketing efforts on their attitude toward deconsuming water besides in contrast to previous studies applying the demarketing framework we investigate the moderating effect of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment defined as attitudes toward water supply institutions and their handling of the water scarcity situation we find evidence that consumers perceptions of water demarketing efforts improve their attitude toward deconsuming water identifying the usefulness of demarketing in modifying consumers attitudes toward water usage and determining whether and how consumer predispositions reduce demarketing effectiveness are critical topics to address in areas where conservation is not optional but mandatory besides we opt to focus on attitude toward reducing water consumption as the dependent variable because factually observable behaviour might be biased e g no other alternative and extrinsically motivated e g fines rewards whereas attitudes as predispositions toward a specific object e g a particular behaviour constitute a better assessor of intrinsic or autotelic motivation which drives more meaningful and longer lasting behaviour 34 for this reason we focus on attitude instead of behaviour this study makes several contributions to the existing literature the first contribution is methodological and theoretical through the investigation of the demarketing framework and consumer reactions under a series of conditions or moderators including the role of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment towards the water authority s management of water resources fine tuning previous study results further in particular the results are consistent with past research e g ref 35 who found that regulatory methods for water conservation are more diversified e g changing laws adapting fiscal measures than those for water pricing second attitude instead of behaviour is considered as the dependent variable this constitutes a deviation from the existing water economics literature where typically behavioral changes are measured as a result of price changes instead we consider a broader array of drivers for behavioral change and focus primarily on improving attitudes towards such behavior another contribution resides in the use of 26 demarketing framework to determine how demarketing affects customer attitudes toward deconsuming water in the gs as such the study thus contributes to previous studies 6 in applying the demarketing framework to promote societal activities besides the study documents consumer reactions to water demarketing techniques which have typically been under researched in the literature 32 33 finally another contribution is practical because given the severity of water losses in the gs compared to the west bank 36 there is still ample room for improvement to foster water deconsumption 2 conceptual framework and hypotheses development 2 1 demarketing theory according to 26 demarketing is synonymous with demand reduction demarketing is defined as that aspect of marketing that deals with discouraging customers in general or a certain class of customers in particular on either a temporary or permanent basis 26 p 75 this definition is widely accepted by marketing scholars and practitioners e g 37 and is adopted in the current study demarketing is implemented by organizations and or governments by modulating the marketing mix elements i e product price place and promotion four situations call for demarketing 26 1 managing an existing shortage 2 avoiding potential shortages 3 minimizing harm to individuals 4 minimizing damage to nature or unique resources as we live in a world of diminishing earthly resources and products that can seriously affect our health demarketing is becoming the new normal however demarketing has some caveats 26 first the demarketing campaign might make the product or service desirable e g banning a book or movie second demarketing efforts might spur the emergence of a criminal class that will prosper during the induced scarcity e g the case during the prohibition era in the u s when liquor was banned third some human rights liberals and libertarians might argue about the government s interference with what they consider citizens basic rights none of these caveats apply to the current study moreover demarketing strategies to rationalize water consumption in the gaza strip are currently the only available alternative to tackle the water supply shortage ref 26 stated that demarketing works best when there is a high citizen consensus that some good or service consumption should be reduced by obtaining consumer input on potential demarketing action this study attempts to accomplish precisely that empirical research on the demarketing of water has grown in the past decades especially with the emergence of social marketing ethical marketing and sustainability in marketing e g 31 while water demarketing is crucial to palestinians and residents from neighboring arab countries it appears that water shortage is also a serious concern in israel 38 in that context ref 38 explored how different groups within israel s multiethnic country respond to the government s demarketing campaign to reduce water consumption ref 39 studied the effectiveness of pro environmental demarketing on consumers electricity consumption behaviors and found significant effects ref 40 evaluated the impact of a general demarketing strategy on electricity demand in a jordanian sample the demarketing strategy was composed of six elements advertising perception price solar energy provision and reference group which effectively reduced electricity demand furthermore 31 studied electricity demarketing strategies in gs under various psychographic variables including palestinians awareness motivation and attitudes toward the electricity supply company however neither of these past studies considered government regulation perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment towards the water authority s management of water resources along with demarketing strategies in addition we add people as a fifth strategy to the four basic strategies in contrast to past research and to complement the state of the art this study proposes that laws and regulations perceived moral obligation perceived water right and institutional sentiment toward the water authority s management of water resources are critical moderators with the potential to strengthen demarketing managerial efforts for water deconsumption 2 2 relationship between the demarketing mix and consumer response this study focuses on demarketing strategies by organizations not the government we stipulate a direct effect from demarketing elements of the product h1 price h2 place h3 and promotion h4 respectively as well as people h5 to consumer attitude toward reducing water consumption as described below under the framework of demarketing the product corresponds to marketing efforts to reduce its sales volume as part of the concept of demarketing ref 41 states that companies try to limit supply lines and minimize service and productive activities encouraging customers to purchase the product furthermore it is well established that satisfied customers positively impact profitability because they prefer to buy more product units and engage in long term repurchases 42 in contrast dissatisfied customers reduce revenue because of their lower purchases and product consumption 42 additionally their dissatisfaction often contributes to complaints 43 and unfavorable word of mouth 44 therefore if satisfaction increases consumption and dissatisfaction reduces it a dissatisfied customer would be more likely to form deconsumption attitudes also facilitating and urging the use of alternative products is a critical demarketing strategy 45 based on the above we hypothesize h1 product modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption price determination can present a simple yet effective solution to the deconsumption of water 22 24 the demarketing pricing strategy focuses on decreasing the current demand by increasing prices 32 as 46 has noted pricing impacts customer attitudes and behavior if customers see prices as unreasonably high they would likely have a negative attitude toward the product coupled with a low buying intention 47 increasing prices will decrease demand e g 48 yet price determination in demarketing poses one of the most challenging decision making processes 49 the objective of the demarketing pricing policy is to increase prices to reduce but not eliminate product demand thus we set the following hypothesis h2 price modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption previous research deems place location as one of the critical aspects of demarketing the place may be modulated either in terms of place of consumption or place of buying and both elements can impose a demarketing effect 50 according to ref 51 limiting the areas to enact a behavior may serve as a barrier to promoting the behavior and profoundly impacting intentions thus restrictions on consumption are an essential barrier to consumption and should also directly impact consumption attitudes 52 also limitations on buying would have a similar result curbing the influence attributable to opportunity cost e g 53 applied in a demarketing sense this implies that spending more time and effort looking for a product would minimize the time for other tasks such as leisure household chores or self maintenance 52 thus we propose the following hypothesis h3 place modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption the demarketing strategy includes promotions to encourage customers to purchase products that are not utilized and anti promotion practices to rationalize consumption 54 drawing on 55 55 ref 41 points out that as one of the main goals of environmental marketing promotions concentrate on informing the public about the value of environmental behavior and the need to protect the environment and natural resources furthermore research demonstrates the importance of consumer promotion in demarketing 56 57 due to its direct negative impact on attitudes 58 therefore we anticipate the following hypothesis h4 promotion modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption people can also propose a simple yet effective solution to the problem of water shortage individuals who engage in self prediction examine what they have done versus what they should do in relation to a specific behavior self predictions in the direction of social norms are common people who make self predictions frequently act in a socially acceptable manner to ease the related cognitive dissonance they subsequently act in a way that would have been less likely before 59 as a result if the social norm shifts behavior may also shift people s behavior will begin to change as social norms change because people tend to make self predictions in the direction of social norms they must be educated and then nudged adequately to achieve the appropriate changes self prediction can make people feel uncomfortable psychologically by bringing up differences between their beliefs and prior behaviors leading to targeted persons changing their minds as a result we propose the following hypothesis h5 people modulation positively affects consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 3 the moderating effect of regulations government backed regulation is likely to influence consumers water deconsumption directly and amplify the effect of demarketing measures regulation is broadly defined as the intentional activity of attempting to control order or influence the behavior of others 60 p 19 the term regulation is a broader concept than law 61 and thus is adopted in this study in addition to formally established laws such as statutes primary and delegated regulations and common laws regulations also include economic incentives and market based frameworks 62 it is hypothesized that regulations regarding a specific product or service should heighten consumer sensitivity toward that product and as a result make its characteristics such as the product itself price place and distribution more salient to the consumer therefore h6 regulations amplify the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 4 the moderating effect of perceived moral obligation despite extensive studies in the field of environmental consumption little empirical research has been conducted on the concept of consumer responsibility 63 64 examine the impact of moral obligation in morally significant scenarios comparable to the setting here and find that it improves the theory of planned behavior tpb model albeit the results are inconsistent the degree to which an individual feels morally obligated to execute a certain behavior is known as perceived moral obligation it may be significant when consumers consider the impact of their actions on others e g donating blood and drunk driving according to 51 some researchers have proved that both social influences and perceived moral obligations impact people s behavioral intentions 65 outline three criteria for defining a moral situation 1 the choice is essential and significant 2 moral rules are not arbitrary and cannot be made up and 3 appeals to obey moral rules are based on the premise that the rules are important in themselves rather than primarily utilitarian motives in light of these principles water consumption in a drought stricken area is an interesting environment to investigate the impact of moral obligation on individual consumption decisions 66 for example utilizes perceived moral obligation to increase the fundamental tpb in the context of building a model to investigate water use behavior according to the results based on the above mentioned findings perceived moral obligations significantly influence moral intentions this is especially true when the behavior involves conflicts between self and public interests furthermore since water conservation may be considered a social dilemma using water freely provides personal comfort and convenience while also harming public interest perceived moral obligations are likely to influence people s positive predisposition toward conservation therefore h7 perceived moral obligation amplifies the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 5 the moderating effect of perceived water right 66 extends the tpb model by including a person s perceived water right the degree to which people believe they have the right to use water as they choose is known as perceived water right other water consumption research has emphasized its significance in understanding water use e g 67 69 water rights have long been considered an important topic in water resource issues several authors e g 67 70 discussed it from economic and political viewpoints however psychological research on how individuals view their personal water rights let alone the impact of such perceptions has been limited perceived water right and perceived moral obligation on the surface appear to be contradictory people who believe they have a legal right to consume water will feel less obligated to save it nonetheless the concepts of obligation and right may not be mutually exclusive on the one hand some individuals may feel compelled to save water while believing they have the right to use it it would be interesting to learn how people s beliefs about their water rights impact their behavior particularly if these perceptions conflict with their perceived obligations in conclusion both a tpb model with only main effects and a tpb model including interaction effects may help better understand household water conservation furthermore in addition to the impact accounted for by these models perceived moral obligation and perceived water right may have an influence this research looks into all of these options a tpb model with linear and quadratic effects is also evaluated to prevent misunderstanding of quadratic effects for spurious interactions 71 thus h8 perceived water right amplifies the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption 2 6 the moderating effect of institutional sentiment and the water authority s management of water resources in understanding consumer behavior toward public goods we suggest that consumers attitudes regarding water supply institutions and their handling of the water situation are essential explanatory variables for water use consumers according to neoclassical economic theory are primarily driven by self interest although there is evidence that customers are often unaware of the prices they pay for utilities water usage may adjust to prices paid as individuals maximize their own utility 35 price effectiveness is likely to be hampered by a lack of knowledge experimental economists and evolutionary psychologists provide a much more sophisticated consumer image than the homo economicus viewpoint that occasionally dominates the argument consumers are increasingly being seen behaving in exchange relationships in the setting of reciprocal inclinations e g 72 73 reciprocity is defined as a in kind response to a beneficial or harmful act 72 p 160 although the variables that influence reciprocal behavior are debatable this implies that people reward positive behavior and penalize negative behavior even when it costs them money cf 74 75 institutional trust a term similar to but separate from attitudes toward the organization is argued to have a role in water consumption decisions in other studies 76 this however has yet to be empirically validated extending this logic and applying the theory of reciprocity to water consumption within the context of a social marketing intervention to promote the deconsumption of that utility it is proposed that household water consumption decisions are influenced by residents perceptions of how well the institutions in charge manage their water thus consumers will show positive reciprocity and lower their water usage if they believe their region s water is managed correctly e g through informed positive and beneficial marketing communications on the other hand consumers will display negative reciprocity and penalize the water authority by paying less attention to their water usage if they believe their water is not being well managed e g through less informed marketing and or harmful marketing communications consequently it is expected that consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption is favorably related to institutional sentiment towards the water authority s management of water resources therefore we articulate the following hypothesis h9 institutional sentiment amplifies the effect of a product b price c place d promotion and e people on consumers attitude toward reducing water consumption fig 1 illustrates the resulting conceptual framework from a consumer viewpoint this model connects the demarketing mix including people with the dependent variable consumers water deconsumption attitudes it also indicates the four moderating variables impact on each hypothesized path from the demarketing mix factors to the dependent variable 3 method 3 1 study context this research was carried out in the gs palestine water delivery is increasingly difficult because of the israeli government s territorial restrictions on the gs as a result about two million gazans face a continual water deficit worsening in summer the tap water is polluted with high salinity nitrite and chloride levels 5 and should not be consumed without treatment residents are obliged to use this water for bathing and washing since they have no other options yet the supply is inconsistent and unpredictable so that residents have no alternative except to buy water privately for drinking and cooking despite extreme financial difficulties and even then it is frequently of poor quality 3 the water shortage in the gs and the poor tap water quality has been well documented e g 3 over pumping and wastewater contamination have damaged the gs s coastal aquifer its only water supply as a result 96 2 of the aquifer s household water is non potable furthermore due to the gs s outdated infrastructure around 40 of the household water supply is lost on its way to consumers due to leaking however an estimated 68 of this water is polluted with high nitrite and chloride levels 5 putting people in danger of disease transmission due to water supply unreliability many residents store water in containers on their rooftops when the supply is shut off the power supply in gs is also intermittent and it frequently does not turn on at the same time as the water residents ability to run pumps to fill containers is therefore hampered families that do not get a chance to pump water to the roof before the electricity goes out will be without running water gazans are forced to buy desalinated water from private vendors due to the low quality and restricted water availability which they use primarily for drinking and cooking purposes but also for other reasons however the purchased water is too expensive for many gaza residents 77 according to ref 4 95 1 million cubic meters of water were supplied for household use in the gs in 2018 with 193 7 million cubic meters of total water use however due to the gs s outdated and damaged infrastructure about 35 6 million cubic meters of water are wasted on the way to households as a result total home use in 2018 was 83 1 million cubic meters falling short of the world health organization s who recommended minimum of 100 l per capita per day this who recommended minimum of 100 l should be sufficient to cover basic household requirements such as drinking bathing cooking and laundry 3 2 data collection and sample the study used a descriptive cross sectional survey research approach a questionnaire was developed by adapting existing measurement scales three marketing academics and three marketing practitioners pretested the questionnaire following that the researchers modified the questionnaire according to their comments the questionnaire was translated into arabic by a professional translator the content accuracy of the translation was then pilot tested after two arabic native speakers approved it a group of 20 people administered the final questionnaire and submitted it in person during field visits using direct face to face interviewing this contributed to ensure a greater response rate five groups of team members were formed three data collectors and one supervisor made up each group each of the five gs governorates a palestinian territory administrative division called in arabic muhafazah namely north gaza gaza deir el balah khan yunis and rafah received one group more specifically the target sample for this study was established as adult consumers 18 years of age and older residing in the different gs governorates consequently the sampling frame consisted of the geographical distribution of palestinian households in each governorate the sampling is also of a probabilistic nature since the neighborhoods and the household starting point inside each of those neighborhoods were both randomly picked as part of a two step geographic stratified sampling technique each of these strata s first household was chosen randomly and a questionnaire was submitted to the household head of every fifth household team members attended a two day training workshop on data gathering processes group supervisors were in charge of guaranteeing data quality closely monitoring the process and minimizing interviewer bias to overcome any apprehensions about participating in the study a letter from the researchers clarified the study s goal and then invited them to engage in the study by filling out the questionnaire the sample size was obtained using the formula below 78 n n p 1 n p e 2 with n as the sample size np as the population size and e as the error term e 0 05 according to the calculation a sample size of 384 was deemed appropriate for an error margin of 5 seven of the 384 residents who were chosen to participate in this study declined to do so for various reasons another five consented but either did not answer parts of the questions or declined to complete the questionnaire after starting it as a result 372 questionnaires were collected from april 27 2021 to may 26 2021 the study population comprises the residents of the gs 2 1 million in 2021 36 as stated in table 1 384 people were chosen using a stratified random sampling approach to mirror the population distribution in the five gs governorates using the smartpls 3 0 software the data was analyzed using pls sem modeling the structural equation model was evaluated using a two step analytic methodology 80 the measuring items 81 were subjected to validity and reliability testing in the first stage the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement outer model was tested a comparison was made between the square root of the average variance extracted ave and the correlation between latent constructs to assess discriminant validity the structural inner model and the hypotheses were tested in the second step the coefficient of determination was used to analyze the relationships between variables in the hypotheses r2 bootstrapping based on 5000 re samples was used to test all hypothesized path coefficients 3 3 measures consumer perceptions of the five demarketing elements were used to determine how effective they were the product variable was evaluated by a four item scale adapted from 31 82 price was measured by a four item scale adapted from 28 83 the place variable was assessed by a four item scale adapted from 28 84 the promotion measure was adapted from 32 52 using a four item scale people was assessed by a five item scale adapted from 85 86 the questionnaire s second section includes questions about the moderators the effect of laws and legislations in rationalizing water consumption was evaluated by a three item scale developed by 55 87 a four item scale derived from 66 68 measured the perceived moral obligation perceived water right was assessed by a four item scale derived from 66 68 institutional sentiment regarding the water authority s water resources management was measured with a four item scale derived from 68 76 the dependent variable was addressed in the third section of the questionnaire the measure of attitude toward water deconsumption was taken from 68 88 using a four item scale all questions were graded on a seven point likert scale ranging from 1 to 7 with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 7 meaning strongly agree various demographic questions including age gender education level marital status monthly income and financial independence were also evaluated finally some factors specific to the study such as perceptions of water price levels were included 4 results 4 1 descriptive data the sample demographics are typical and representative of the gs population as shown in table 2 notably more than 43 of respondents are under the age of 30 54 of respondents are male besides 81 2 of respondents have a diploma or a bachelor s degree according to the palestinian central bureau of statistics pcbs 2021 1 1 https www pcbs gov ps postar aspx lang ar itemid 4313 the illiteracy rate of palestine is one of the lowest rates in the world 2 3 of the population of 15 years old and more in addition more than 46 000 students graduate annually from the palestinian universities that is about 1 of the total population 2 2 ministry of higher education and scientific research 2022 annual report available in arabic at https www mohe pna ps services statistics in addition more than half of the respondents are married 63 7 and 60 2 of the respondents earn less than usd 500 per month this monthly salary is gross and per individual it is worth noting that the minimum monthly wage in palestine is nis 1880 which is equivalent to about us 500 it is also worth mentioning that some 65 3 of respondents are financially independent additionally almost three quarters of the respondents 74 find that the price level of purchased water is high and 31 5 of them do not pay for their water this may be the result of a variety of reasons including 1 the dominant culture in which many people assume that donor nations like qatar are providing funds to the gs to cover the cost of water and 2 the high unemployment and poverty rates and the worsening of economic conditions more specifically the unemployment rate among labor force participants in 2022 was 24 the unemployment rate between the west bank and gaza strip is still significantly different reaching 45 in the gaza strip compared to 13 in the west bank 3 3 https www pcbs gov ps post aspx lang en itemid 4421 in addition data issued in 2022 indicate that 36 of the palestinian population lives below the poverty line according to figures from the united nations conference on trade and development unctad which warned of deepening poverty in the occupied palestinian territories 4 2 measurement model the questionnaire items are shown in table 3 to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measures all construct indicators were integrated into a confirmatory factor analysis cfa smartpls 3 0 cfa is a statistical method for confirming the factor structure of a collection of observed data the researcher can examine the hypothesis that there is a connection between the variables that are seen and the latent constructs that underlie them using cfa in general factor loading is the correlation between the factor and the variable factor loading displays the variation on that specific factor that is explained by the variable according to the sem technique as a rule of thumb a factor loading of 0 7 or above indicates that the factor extracts sufficient variation from the variable as shown in table 3 all of the 40 items were significantly over the standard criteria of 0 70 p 0 001 89 indicating high convergent validity convergent validity is known as the degree to which one test is connected to others that assess the same or related constructs therefore a range of indicators is commonly used to validate constructs accordingly cronbach s alpha is calculated it is an indicator of how closely connected a group of items is to one another i e internal consistency it is regarded as a measure of scale reliability as shown in table 3 all cronbach s alpha values were above or marginally close to the 0 60 cut off level 90 in addition the coefficients of reliability are calculated it is a measure of the consistency of scores across contexts its value which ranges from 0 to 1 gives an estimate of the portion of the computed score variance that is attributable to real variation as opposed to error the greater this coefficient the more certain the researcher may be that results collected at various periods under comparable circumstances with the same individuals would be comparable as shown in table 3 the coefficients of reliability ranged between 0 705 and 0 934 these results suggest satisfactory construct reliability furthermore the average variance extracted ave is calculated it is a metric for comparing the variation recorded by a construct to the variance resulting from measurement error as shown in table 3 the ave exceeded the threshold of 0 50 in each case 91 these findings confirm that the constructs have convergent validity for skewness and kurtosis values conventional thresholds of 1 and 2 respectively were used in addition to the means and standard deviations no concerns with skewness or kurtosis were found in the dataset as indicated in table 3 overall these findings imply that the data across the great majority of construct items are normally distributed additionally we examined the variance inflation factors vif values to spot multi collinearity issues the results are reported in table 3 each predictor construct s vif value must be less than 5 in order to be considered exempt from multi collinearity issues 92 the results show that all vif values are below 5 as a result it was established that the variables employed in this study do not exhibit multi collinearity issues discriminant validity was evaluated using fornell and larcker s criterion 93 table 4 shows that no ave had a lower correlation than the maximum correlation with any other component indicating discriminant validity 4 3 structural model assessment the structural model findings are shown in table 5 since smartpls can not estimate several moderators simultaneously we used five different models one without interaction effects and four that assessed the interactive effect of each moderating variable separately throughout the five models the overall fit is excellent in addition the srmr value of the composite model was 0 103 which is close to 94 suggested value of 0 10 the stone geisser q2 was used to determine predictive relevance and the standardized root mean residual was employed q2 95 assesses the model s and estimated parameters ability to reproduce observed values with a value greater than 0 indicating predictive relevance 96 the explanatory power of the structural model and its ability to predict endogenous components were assessed using the r2 determination coefficient the adjusted r2 revealed that the independent factors account for 55 2 of the variation in attitude toward reducing water usage this proportion is comparable to other sem based analytics studies with smartpls for example 97 0 181 0 734 or 98 0 489 obtained similar r2 values using the sem method with smartpls the sign magnitude and significance of path coefficients were all considered the significance of each estimated path was determined using bootstrapping which consisted of 5000 resamples drawn with replacement the results in table 5 suggest that all five elements of the demarketing strategy are positively connected to the attitude to reduce water consumption however when any of the three moderators is added the influence of price becomes minimal this suggests that price changes will not always result in a less favorable attitude toward water deconsumption for well informed motivated and conscientious consumers therefore product place and promotion modifications should be employed as well for such customers the main findings will be discussed in more detail in the next section 5 discussion all five demarketing variables product price place promotion and people influence a positive attitude toward water consumption rationalization in order of priority place people price promotion and product are positively connected to attitude toward water usage reduction as shown in table 4 supporting h1 5 in terms of moderators while the role of laws and legislations did not interact much with product and price to affect attitude toward water limitation it did significantly impact such attitudes the empirical findings confirm the moderating function of laws and legislations on the place people and promotion attitude links bolstering h6c e but not h6a b this finding is consistent with past research such as 35 who found that regulatory methods for water conservation are more diversified than those for the price and that their implications and efficacy are less explored for climate related reasons water utilities in australia where barrett s study took place favor restrictions limiting water consumption typically water use limits take the form of prohibitions on watering outdoor gardens during droughts this has proven to be quite successful in lowering water use 83 the results of the present study further emphasize the direct role of law and legislation in favoring attitudes toward water deconsumption especially for individuals perceiving that water utilities and companies modulate water distribution promote water deconsumption and have competent staff although perceived moral obligation has a direct influence on attitude toward limiting water consumption it does not interact with people according to table 4 but it does interact favorably with all the other elements of the demarketing mix i e product price place promotion h7a d is supported by these data but not h7e previous research contradicts this conclusion e g 66 despite its intuitive appeal and theoretical foundations perceived moral obligation had little effect on attitudes toward reducing water usage 68 however a deeper examination of the data reveals that the average perceived moral obligation was extraordinarily high m 4 77 on a scale of 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree with 83 highly agreeing and 14 agreeing with the statement idiosyncratic effects pertaining to the gs may be in effect here in fact the protracted drought experienced by gs residents in addition to the specific climate and geopolitical contexts enhanced respondents impressions in this research setting as a result quantitatively determining the influence of perceived moral obligation inside water usage models is challenging in light of this research using 66 as well as 68 as starting points more precise constructs operationalizing the perceived moral obligation variable might need to be developed also because consumers perceived moral obligation is linked to sustainable consumption policy makers should work to improve customers perceptions of sustainability and their feeling of social responsibility to affect their actual behavior 99 although perceived water right does not interact with price or people it has a favorable impact on deconsumption attitude similar to the two preceding moderators furthermore perceived water right has a favorable relationship with product place and promotion these findings collectively support h8a and h8c d but h8b and h8e are not supported one explanation for this might be that perceived water right refers to how much people believe they have the right to utilize water in any way they choose and indeed other water consumption research has emphasized the significance of the effect of perceived water right on water usage behavior e g 68 69 interestingly in 66 the findings show that integrating a sense of moral obligation does not significantly improve the statistical fit of the model and that the influence of a sense of water right is empirically inconsistent this is one of the few instances in which both impacts have been empirically demonstrated in the literature the impact has been hypothesized but only weakly experimentally verified in earlier research e g 66 providing significant evidence of the need to use alternative variables e g tpb variables in investigating household water consumption models yet the current study shows the significant impact of both variables at least in a developing country context where access to water is scarce due to geopolitically laden contingencies in other circumstances where a person s perceived water right might be greater e g canada marketing communications aimed at lowering water use could also diminish a person s perceived water right by appealing to their values given the diversity of consumer perceptions of water as a right organizations should first strive to identify the degree to which customers regard water as a right since this will greatly influence the design of future marketing programs and communications for example household water may be recast as a product with economic and environmental consequences or a luxury rather than a right in specific circumstances this would also be in line with the consumer citizenship literature e g 63 which emphasizes the significance of understanding ethical consumption decisions through the concept of consumer responsibility if on the other hand residents in a specific location have a poor perception of their water rights appealing to consumer attitudes about water rights may not significantly influence water conservation thus alternative methods should be utilized 68 like the three preceding moderators the water authority s management of water resources has a beneficial impact on attitude toward water deconsumption even though having no interaction with promotion or people instead the water authority s management of water resources interacts positively with product price and place strategies h9a c is supported by these data but not h9d e one explanation for this might be that home water usage decisions are influenced by the inhabitants perceptions of how well the institutions in charge manage water consumers perceiving that the utility is modified product water price is modulated price and access to water is amended place will show better reciprocity and more favorable attitudes toward water deconsumption if they believe their region s water is being effectively managed the water authority s management of water resources can enact such positive signaling through informational positive and beneficial marketing communications on the other hand consumers perceiving similar changes in product price and place will demonstrate negative reciprocity and penalize the water authority by paying less attention to their water use if they believe their water is not well managed this could result from effective mismanagement or sub optimal marketing actions and or negative communications from third parties e g ngos media moreover these effects tend to differ significantly across demographics according to the findings of the independent samples test f 0 164 t 3 48 sig 2 tailed 0 000 female and younger customers are more likely to be impacted by the demarketing factors furthermore as confirmed by post hoc least significant difference lsd tests that followed anova the effect of the perceived demarketing strategy on water consumption is significantly different for different demographic segments specifically age p 0 000 level of education p 0 027 marital status p 0 000 and monthly income p 0 046 the lsd test revealed that those between 21 and 30 are more likely to be persuaded by demarketing efforts than those between 51 and 60 and those aged 61 and above this might be because elderly customers spend more time at home and hence require more water water conservation attitudes are favorably connected with younger customers the lsd test also revealed that those with a high school degree or less are more likely to be affected by demarketing efforts to minimize water usage than people with a master s degree or a ph d furthermore statistically significant differences exist between diploma holders and bachelor s degree holders favoring diploma holders the findings further reveal that married people are more likely to be influenced by demarketing efforts than single people this might be because married people have children use more water and are thus more sensitive to water usage to curb costs finally the lsd test revealed that people with a lower monthly income per capita below 1000 are more likely to be affected by demarketing approaches than those with a monthly income of 1501 to 2000 there might be various reasons for this perhaps most importantly consumers income influences their purchasing power thus those with a higher income can drink more water than those with a lower income 6 conclusions in sum under certain consumer states specifically the role of laws and legislations perceived moral obligation water right and water authority s management of water resources the influence of demarketing strategies on the product price place promotion and people elements of the demarketing mix appears beneficial however a deeper look into these interactions reveals some additional insights into the unique context of areas with severe water shortages product price place promotion and people reconfigurations to better satisfy demands tend to reduce water use while prior research has focused on water price modulations as a critical component of water demand management this study reveals the insufficiency of such an approach since it also seems required to consider product place promotion and people to shape more favorable attitudes toward water deconsumption the results confirm 100 s or 101 s conclusions about the importance of pricing and non pricing measures to rationalize domestic water consumption for example 100 show that in addition to pricing modulation emphasis should also be put on non pricing initiatives such as public education information and awareness campaigns in an empirical analysis based on self reported data 101 further show that non pricing measures especially public awareness campaigns to rationalize water use and targeted campaigns to promote water savings technologies have an even greater impact on water consumption decisions compared to pricing measures more generally the study emphasizes the importance of the psychological perspective 20 to modulate the demand site in water demand management the construction of a substantial and unique model for demarketing water use in the gs contributes to the water demand management literature by promoting water conservation behavior as emphasized in the early works in this research stream as household water usage becomes more important the consumer becomes a critical stakeholder in any water conservation project 8 20 this is even more critical in areas characterized by scarce water access therefore developing a substantial and unique model for demarketing water use in the gs contributes meaningfully to the water demand management literature and the following implications can be formed for this research area first while this study did not look at the availability of other water sources such as importing water e g from turkey and establishing a desalination plant for seawater it did look into import solutions in the place variable which showed to be significantly positive for improving attitudes toward water deconsumption this study contributes to previous research by stressing that alternative product sources and product substitution lead to favorable attitudes toward deconsumption besides in contrast to previous studies that ignored promotion in favor of product price and place this study demonstrates that promotion plays a vital role in demarketing it is in fact a recurrently significant factor furthermore promotion receives the highest positive reinforcement from all moderators followed by place and product with price receiving the least positive reinforcement the current study further suggests that deconsumption can arise outside of the green or sustainable aspect deconsumption can also happen and primarily occurs under dire political and territorial conditions for sustenance or even survival matters rather than for environmental reasons thirdly social advertisers and policy makers cannot rely on unidimensional demarketing strategies such as pricing alone as an effective way to change customers attitudes and behavior only a comprehensive multidimensional full fledged demarketing plan that also includes staff people is expected to provide meaningful reductions in water use as another implication ad hoc and one time demarketing actions are unlikely to have the desired effect however the findings show that the 4ps besides people have a demarketing effect over time implying that governments should give adequate and long term strategic instruments for anti promotional activities furthermore the results pertaining to palestine although plausible and well established may not apply to other nations inter country disparities in water use positive social norms regarding water usage the water sector s involvement in the national economy or circumstances that dissuade the government from deflating water consumption rationalization may impact attitudes finally although the demarketing framework espouses the psychological perspective to water demand management 20 complementing therefore water supply practice and research it does however offer authorities and organizations organisms practical guidelines in the form of the demarketing strategies as such albeit user focused the framework provides useful guidelines for managerial action e g modulating product price place promotion and connects therefore also at least partially with the supply side of the water demand management research area while the research presented makes the aforementioned contributions it is not without limitations that future research might address first future research should consider other factors influencing participants reactions such as their average house area as well as the space available to them for storing water and the type of storage equipment that they possess e g storage tanks second this research focuses on the influence of demarketing tactics on customers and how consumers perceive them future research might compare these findings to actual data on water consumption following demarketing campaigns author statement mohammed salem conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing myriam

8634,payments for watershed services pws programs have become a prominent approach to protect or restore ecosystems and watershed services but little is known about where these innovative financing tools and governance systems emerge and persist in 2008 the mexican government launched a program where they matched funding from local partners to establish user financed pws leading to the creation of 145 programs between 2008 and 2019 we study the factors related to the emergence and persistence of these local user financed pws programs across mexico we assemble a unique database on these programs as well as biophysical economic socio cultural and institutional variables at the municipality level we use logistic regression to analyze the variables correlated with the emergence and persistence of pws we find that pws programs are more likely to emerge in municipalities with lower opportunity costs of forest conservation that are wealthier that have higher institutional capacity and that have more collective land tenure and protected areas pws programs are more likely to persist in municipalities where watershed conditions are a concern that have more wealth and institutional capacity and that have a non governmental organization or water utility involved as the local counterpart these results suggest that emergence and persistence of local user financed pws programs to address water security can occur when the opportunity costs of conservation are met the provision of ecosystem services is enhanced there are sustainable sources of financing and there is institutional capacity that involves non state actors keywords green infrastructure investments in watershed services nature based solutions payments for ecosystem services pagos por servicios ambientales data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasingly water security and water related hazards are being addressed through investments in nature based solutions nbs especially around urban areas 1 2 nbs for water security differ from engineered solutions by using the conservation or restoration of forests and other natural ecosystems to maintain regulate or improve water quality and or flows 3 nbs reflect new paradigms about the relationships between people and nature and utilitarian views about the role of natural capital and ecosystem services as part of this paradigm payments for watershed services pws programs also known as investments in watershed services iws have emerged over the last two decades pws are voluntary transactions between ecosystem service users and ecosystem service providers within a particular watershed that are conditional on upstream management actions that generate downstream watershed services there are approximately 387 pws programs worldwide categorized as government or user financed 4 the latter occur through either collective action funding the pooling of resources from public private and civil sector actors to incentivize ecosystem service provision or bilateral agreements which most often occur through a non governmental organization ngo or a private entity and ecosystem service providers there are fewer user financed pws programs than government financed pws despite the belief that local user financed programs would be more responsive to local needs reduce transaction costs and increase additionality 5 specifically government financed programs spent more than 20 billion usd in 2016 on watershed services whereas user financed programs spent just under 700 million usd 4 understanding why local user financed pws solutions to water security emerge and persist can generate lessons about the enabling conditions that are needed to expand the use of local user financed pws for water security 6 9 additionally it can help point to factors that lead to the success of programs over time increasing the return on these financial investments finally a better understanding of where local user financed pws programs emerge and persist can help contextualize the types of efficiency effectiveness and equity outcomes that are occurring and can inform future program designs to enhance these outcomes 10 conceptually the overall conditions or enabling factors necessary for the emergence of pws programs or more broadly payments for ecosystem services pes can be grouped into the categories of biophysical economic socio cultural and institutional 7 11 biophysically pes programs focus on the protection management or restoration of ecosystem services from natural or semi natural ecosystems pre existing land cover and other ecological conditions are important determinants of ecosystem service provision and thus determinants of where programs are located 12 the original theory of pes emphasized economic conditions including that the beneficiaries willingness to pay for ecosystem services needs to be greater than providers willingness to accept 11 13 the latter is closely tied to opportunity costs of conservation since pes payments will not be able to compete with all alternative land uses pes also require low transaction costs and information exchange between buyers and sellers 11 socio cultural conditions also play an important role in pes emergence this includes presence of existing social norms to conserve or pro environmental values 14 and the interplay between financial incentives and potential crowding out of these intrinsic motivations 13 finally institutional factors are a critical part of pes program design clear land tenure rights and security have been shown to be important for pes programs to operate 11 13 organizational technical or social capacity is also key for both pes beneficiaries to organize and distribute payments and pes sellers especially in the case of collective pes contracts 5 15 trust between service providers and users is necessary and often enhanced by intermediary organizations 16 competing conservation or land use policies can support or undermine pes program effectiveness 17 pes programs can also be a complement to other social programs 18 there is a large body of literature focusing on how enabling factors influence household or community participation in pes programs 14 the literature on participation in pes programs points to the role of household or community eligibility ability and willingness to participate in pes programs 14 19 many of these factors mimic the broader literature on conditions for pes emergence including the role of land tenure human capacity and financial resources but finds that enrollment depends on a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations 14 these factors have all been found to be important in mexico the focus of this paper with land tenure conditions low opportunity costs social capacity of communities pro social motivations and trust between participants and program operators key determinants to participation 20 24 a smaller number of studies have looked at the participation of pes beneficiaries or buyers in pes programs these studies show that user participation depends on internal leadership external pressure from constituents trust organizational capacity and perceived benefits from the program that includes both financial and non financial benefits 25 26 most of the studies above focus on participation in pes programs or pes emergence at one study site there are fewer empirical studies that quantitatively assess the influence of different factors on pes emergence across multiple study sites one study that does this is a country level analysis of 64 pan tropical countries across africa asia and latin america 9 bosch et al 9 use logistic regression to explore relationships between economic institutional and physical geological variables and pws emergence they find that variables within each category are important to emergence but that topography hydrology and institutions have the most influence on a country having at least one pws program a second study that explores the question of pws emergence across different sites is a global analysis of the emergence of pws programs across 400 of the world s largest cities 8 using random forest models to explore which variables are most important to emergence romulu et al 8 find that more agricultural land has the strongest positive relationship with pws emergence while more protected areas within the watershed are negatively correlated with the presence of pws programs neither of these two studies focus exclusively on local user financed pws emergence and since they compare emergence across multiple countries they are unable to control for regional differences in institutional and socio cultural factors that could influence pws emergence in the broader literature on pes emergence and participation few studies consider what happens over time in terms of persistence of programs or continued participation 27 28 the question of persistence is important for pws programs to understand the return on investment following initial start up costs and ecological success since restoring hydrological responses is a long term endeavor most studies have examined the question of persistence of individual or group conservation behaviors after a pes program ends these studies suggest that conservation behaviors are more likely to persist if landowner attitudes and motivations align with the conservation action the landowner has sufficient resources to continue the behavior and overcome opportunity costs and social ties and norms support continued implementation 27 29 31 while no papers were found on the specific topic of pes program level persistence over time studies that consider the success of different pes programs shed light on the types of factors that could matter for example a study of 40 pes programs in latin america found that success defined as meeting program goals or improving outcomes was higher in programs that were able to protect ecosystem services operate at a local or regional scale use a mix of cash and in kind incentives and establish direct transactions between buyers and sellers 32 low degrees of success were associated with programs that could not reduce pressures on target ecosystems protect ecosystem services or meet opportunity costs of conservation in sum factors such as opportunity costs and non financial motivations influence both emergence and persistence of pes programs however program design features such as transaction types and actors as well as the ability of the program to deliver ecosystem services outcomes are important to the success or persistence of pes programs over time in this paper we contribute to this body of knowledge through an intra country quantitative analysis of the factors related to the emergence and persistence of local user financed pws programs in mexico we answer the following research questions 1 what factors are related to pws emergence and 2 after pws programs emerge what factors are correlated with the persistence versus failure of a program we study mexico a country well known for having developed one of the first government financed national pws programs known as pago por servicios ambientales hidrológicos psah in spanish in 2003 here we focus on the country s lesser studied local user financed mechanism for pes known as mechanismos locales de pago por servicios ambientales fondos concurrentes mlpsa fc in spanish which has been the main form of pes expansion in the country since 2008 while this program allows for ecosystem services other than water most local programs developed to date have focused exclusively on watershed services this user financed pes program was developed by the national forestry commission conafor to generate more funding for ecosystem services ensure greater participation by local actors allow for restoration as well as conservation of ecosystems and allow programs greater flexibility and responsiveness to local conditions conafor pays up to 50 with local partners paying remaining costs the local pws programs considered in this study enrolled more than 800 000 ha between 2008 and 2019 across the country with local partners including state and municipal governments ngos water utilities and private firms 33 local partners determine the criteria for selecting participants and setting payment amounts with fewer restrictions on where programs can be established compared to the national pws program our analysis adds to the existing literature on pes emergence by providing a quantitative intra country analysis that reduces the number of unobservable factors that might influence emergence by studying pws programs that originate from the same policy mechanism mexico also has specific institutional conditions that we focus on in our analysis including a large portion of forest under community or collective ownership and targeting of pes toward protected areas 34 additionally we tackle the question of persistence versus failure of pws programs after they emerge expecting similar as well as different factors to influence the success of these programs over time local user financed pws is one tool to increase water security and this paper will be beneficial to understand what factors can increase the chances they are developed and persist over time and to identify local contexts where these types of approaches may be less useful 2 methods 2 1 dependent variables and sample sizes we assembled an original database of local user financed pws programs using data from conafor including unique contracts information on the local counterpart number of participants area enrolled and payment amounts we organized contracts by unique pws program based on consistency in the names and locations of the contracts and then verified our list with conafor we identified 145 unique pws programs during the period 2008 2019 that focused exclusively on watershed services as of 2019 only 60 of these programs remained active the average length of operation for a pws program was seven years on average a program had two contracts approved by conafor since it started with a range of one to seven contracts per pws program the length of contracts ranged from one to 15 years with a median of five years most local pws programs in mexico are organized around municipality or micro watershed boundaries relevant to the watershed service beneficiaries we used municipality boundaries to spatially attribute a pws program to a specific location for this study because data for most independent variables including variables on water quality and quantity and all economic and socio cultural variables were only available at this level in 2008 when the pws programs began there were 2456 municipalities including the 16 boroughs of mexico city across 32 states we spatially defined where payments were being made in the 145 local pws programs based on shapefiles obtained from conafor since several of the 145 pws programs span multiple municipalities our final sample includes 260 municipalities with at least one local pws program between the years 2008 and 2019 fig 1 only four of 32 mexican states had no local pws programs during this time to answer the research question about the emergence of pws we only considered the binary outcome of whether a municipality had a local pws program or not if a program was in operation anytime between 2008 and 2019 the municipality was labeled 1 n 260 otherwise it was labeled 0 n 2194 while it would be ideal to have municipalities that applied to the pws program but were rejected as the controls conafor informed us that only a handful of applications had ever been rejected due to a two step process which requires all application materials to be reviewed at the state level before the application is submitted to the national level to answer the second research question on persistence of pws programs we only considered pws programs that had started by 2014 to ensure they had time to renew their contracts since the median contract length was five years of the 260 municipalities that had a pws program as of 2019 170 had a pws program that started by 2014 of these 170 only 50 remained in existence as of 2019 these were labeled as 1 in the analysis and all others were labeled as 0 we construct our dependent variable in this way because the year of creation of a local pws program varies across municipalities we do not use number of years of program existence as the dependent variable to capture persistence but do use it as a control variable later because number of years also reflects early versus late adoption in our sample given the variation in start year our binary dependent variable allows us to explore the factors correlated with the likelihood that a program keeps operating once a program is created 2 2 independent variables definitions and hypotheses we included 15 independent variables categorized into three themes 1 biophysical 7 variables 2 economic and socio cultural 3 variables and 3 institutional 5 variables for each variable we sought data close to 2008 to capture the conditions before the local pws program was started table 1 under the biophysical theme we included water quality and reported incidences of drought and floods higher frequency of drought or floods and poorer water quality could increase the probability of emergence or persistence if this threat or scarcity in watershed services drives users to invest in pws to protect or restore them 9 however it could also be the case that having sufficient watershed services is more important for forming pws programs because users want to protect what they already have akin to the precautionary principle of wanting to protect what is in place 11 we included a measure of deforestation in the municipality as a measure of threat to watershed services higher deforestation would correlate with starting and maintaining a pws program if these programs are being used to address the threat of losing land cover however if the precautionary principle is being used or payments are considered more compensation for good behavior then the sign could go in the other direction 34 the extent of agriculture and pastureland in the municipality were included because more dominance of these land uses might signal greater pressure on forest resources and threats to water security and thus more likelihood of pws finally we included a measure of terrain ruggedness to capture opportunity costs of land similar to bosch et al 9 the expected influence was positive for program emergence and persistence terrain ruggedness could also signal important hydrological processes such as soil infiltration water storage capacity and quick flow responses 35 36 under the economic and socio cultural theme we included a national multidimensional poverty index conafor uses a measure of marginalization a variable that has some similarities to multidimensional poverty but with fewer indicators in targeting their national pes program but this is not a criteria for the local pws mechanism poverty could have a negative influence on local pws emergence and persistence if it reflects difficulty in funding a pws program especially if there is more urban poverty or it could be positively correlated if it signals lower opportunity costs to get landowners involved in a program because it captures rural poverty 23 we included a measure of gdp per capita to similarly gauge willingness to pay accept in a pws program like poverty it could capture the positive relationship between financial capital and willingness to pay or a negative relationship between high opportunity costs and low willingness to accept conservation 9 finally we included a count of the number of cities and localities in a municipality that had more than 2500 persons depending on the location of that population it could signal more demand for pws or could capture scarcity of land for conservation in pws programs 8 9 under the institutional theme we included measures of land tenure and conservation policies that could be complements enabling pws or substitutes used in place of pws to a local pws program while land tenure security does vary across mexico 21 there is no national measure however we included form of land tenure in our analysis since mexico has both private and collective tenure systems where the collective system nucleos agrarios includes both indigenous communities and ejidos 34 we included a dummy variable to control for private land tenure expecting a negative correlation with pws programs since collective pws contracts are more common in the national pws program 37 we included the percent of all natural protected areas npa the relationship with the local pws program was considered ambiguous npas could be a substitute to pws similar to romulu et al 9 however since mexico has explicitly promoted pws in areas within or adjacent to protected areas to help compensate for restricted access to resources 34 there could be a positive correlation we also included a measure of the percent of all national pes programs in a municipality between the years 2003 to 2008 which included payments for water biodiversity agroforestry and carbon during these years national pes payments could positively influence emergence and persistence of local pws programs by building institutional capacity or if the two programs are considered substitutes then more national pes payments could negatively influence local pws emergence we also included a private effort led by the mexican fund for the conservation of nature fondo mexicano para la conservación de la naturaleza fmcn in spanish known as the watersheds and cities program cuencas y ciudades in spanish it started in 2001 and was designed specifically to foster an alliance with local partners that would assume leadership on protecting water supply in their cities the presence of this program was expected to positively relate to the presence of local pws programs because the program would have built capacity and established relationships between cities and the basins that supply them with water in the analysis of persistence we included a variable on the type of local operator this information is only available for the areas with pws programs this variable captures the type of counterpart that signed the pws contract and that is responsible for providing 50 of the local pws funds and operating the program we coded information on counterparts into five dummy variables one for each of the following counterparts state government municipal government ngo private industry and water utility a municipality can be associated with more than one counterpart if there was more than one type of operator listed for a specific program or if there were multiple pws programs in that municipality with different types of operators 2 3 data analysis the variables in table 1 were summarized and t tests and normalized differences in means conducted to look for differences across pws and non pws municipalities correlation tests confirmed the absence of multicollinearity across all included variables to analyze the first research question on emergence of pws we used backwards stepwise logistic regression models with a cutoff of 90 to select variables from table 1 eq 1 p r o b p i 1 f α θ x i where p i 1 when a municipality had a pws program x i are the observable variables listed in table 1 and f is the logistic function we report odds ratios and robust standard errors an odds ratio greater than one indicates a positive relationship an odds ratio less than one a negative relationship this analysis was done for 1 the full municipality sample and 2 for a reduced sample that only included programs that started by 2014 to compare with the sample of municipalities used in the analysis of persistence we also ran eq 1 with and without dummy variables for seven terrestrial ecoregions in mexico to further reduce unobservable bias in terms of hydrological conditions and land productivity that may not be captured in our variables listed in table 1 data on ecoregions come from mexico s commission on biodiversity conabio and include categories such as desert plains dry temperate forests and wet humid forests similarly to understand what factors influence the persistence of pws we used backwards stepwise logistic regression with a cutoff of 90 with and without ecoregion dummy variables for this second analysis p i 1 in eq 1 when a municipality started a pws program by 2014 and it was still in operation as of 2019 and 0 if the program started by 2014 but had ceased to operate as a robustness check we also estimated this regression controlling for number of years of program existence to account for the influence that duration of each program prior to 2019 could have on whether the program was still in existence this was created as 2019 first year of program while panel data is available on when pws programs emerged and stopped operating in mexico we do not use panel data methods e g an event study in this analysis because only four of the independent variables in table 1 have annual data available limiting what we could conclude in terms of explanatory factors instead we focus on spatial correlation between independent variables and the emergence and persistence of local pws programs 2 4 discussions with conafor we held two virtual meetings with three staff members that operate the local user financed pws program at conafor s central offices the first meeting was to discuss our research questions and objectives with the organization to clarify the data on pws programs and to gather information from conafor on how the local pws program was designed implemented and adapted over time additionally we asked conafor about what factors they thought were important for enabling a municipality to start a pws program and for a local pws program to persist over time a second meeting was held after we completed our analysis to present our results to conafor and discuss with them our findings and interpretations this meeting was critical in understanding the policy implications of our findings and how they could influence on the ground operations 3 results 3 1 summary statistics municipalities with a local matching pws program in mexico had on average more rugged terrain lower deforestation rates less pastureland and fewer flood declarations table 2 there were no statistically significant differences in the extent of agricultural area the number of drought declarations or water quality between municipalities with and without a local pws program within the economic and socio cultural variables municipalities with pws programs had on average higher gdp per capita and more localities and cities but there was no statistically significant difference in multidimensional poverty rates all four institutional variables were statistically different municipalities with pws programs had on average a greater percent of area in a national pes program and within npas were more likely to be part of the watersheds and cities program and had less area in private land tenure summarizing from the conafor database for the 145 local user financed pws programs that emerged since 2008 the mean payment was 2393 pesos per ha 118 usd per ha in 2021 and median payment was 2099 pesos per ha 103 usd per ha in 2021 the counterparts for these programs were municipal government 37 ngo 25 state government 18 private industry 14 and water utility 6 most programs only listed one local counterpart with a maximum of three partners listed on a contract the mean number of landowners receiving payments across the 145 pws programs was 18 while this may seem low many contracts are made with ejido leaders to protect large tracts of collective forestland in mexico 33 3 2 emergence of pws three biophysical variables are statistically significant at the 90 level or greater in the logistic regression on emergence of pws terrain ruggedness deforestation and extent of agriculture table 3 municipalities with more terrain ruggedness and more agricultural area are more likely to have developed a local pws program however agricultural area was only statistically significant in one model having a higher deforestation rate is negatively correlated with emergence of a local pws program in most models all economic and socio cultural variables are statistically significant higher gdp per capita and a larger number of localities and cities both result in higher odds of developing a local pws program higher rates of multidimensional poverty however decrease the odds of having a local pws program this variable is not statistically significant in the 2014 sample institutional variables influence the emergence of local pws programs in mexico with the presence of other conservation programs npas national pes and watersheds and cities all complementing pws emergence private land tenure is negatively associated with the emergence of local pws programs 3 3 persistence of pws terrain ruggedness is statistically significant in one model with a positive correlation with local pws persistence table 3 agricultural extent is statistically significant and negatively correlated with local pws persistence flood occurrence and water quality both become statistically significant in these regression models with more floods and poorer water quality associated with persistence of user financed pws programs gdp per capita is statistically significant in one model private land tenure is negatively related to persistence of pws programs when the ecoregion dummy variable is not included presence of npas is positively associated with the persistence of local pws across all models whereas national pes payments are not correlated with persistence the watersheds and cities program is statistically significant when ecoregion dummy variables are included with a positive influence on persistence four of the five counterpart dummy variables are positively correlated with persistence of local pws when ecoregion dummy variables are not included with two counterparts remaining statistically significant when ecoregion dummy variables are included specifically ngos and water operators have large odds ratios positive influence and are statistically significant at the 99 confidence level across both models municipal government and industry counterparts are positively correlated with persistence when ecoregion dummy variables are not included but with lower odds ratios than ngos and water utilities when number of years of program operation was added to the persistence regression model models 7 and 8 similar variables remained statistically significant with qualitatively similar findings the number of years of program operation was statistically significant with a positive influence on pws persistence 4 discussion our quantitative and intra country analysis of mexico s local user financed pws programs supports previous conclusions in terms of the categories or factors that are correlated with emergence 7 9 and also point to a few factors specific to the mexican context our results on persistence of pws also support previous studies on the factors that are associated with success of pes programs over time 32 since our municipality level variables can capture both upstream and downstream characteristics that represent pws participants or pws beneficiaries respectively below we combine regression results with the previous literature and our discussions with conafor staff to tease out the most plausible mechanisms between statistically significant variables and the emergence and persistence of pws programs in mexico and beyond related to biophysical factors pws tend to emerge in places with more terrain ruggedness this could pick up higher contribution to hydrological conditions but more likely captures lower opportunity costs since more uneven terrain would be less suitable for agricultural production studies in mexico and other countries show that pes programs are commonly found in areas with higher slope a variable related to ruggedness and lower opportunity cost lands 38 40 land use as a measure of threats to watershed services shows mixed results in explaining emergence while higher deforestation rates were associated with emergence in a multi country analysis 9 in our study lower deforestation rates are correlated with emergence this is not surprising given that evaluations of mexico s national and local pws programs indicate that pws payments typically go to lands at lower risk of deforestation 37 40 lowering additionality 30 however agricultural extent a proxy for threat to forest cover and watershed services has a positive association with pws emergence in mexico this was also the case in a global city analysis of pws emergence 8 and suggests that local pws programs could be responding to perceived threats to watershed services in mexico in two global analyses watershed variables capturing water quantity water quality drought and flooding were correlated with pws emergence 8 9 but these metrics had no influence on pws emergence in this study in our discussions with conafor officials were surprised by this result as local operators have communicated that watershed conditions are a main driver for creating a local pws program under economic and socio cultural conditions the financial ability to pay for pws programs determines where they emerge across mexico in our study measures of both gdp per capita and multidimensional poverty indicated that wealth was important for emergence and financial resources were one of the main factors that conafor identified in our discussions as determining where local pws programs are developed in mexico the positive influence of gdp per capita on emergence suggests that higher economic activity in a municipality leads to more ability to pay higher gdp per capita was also related to pws emergence in non u s cities in a global analysis 8 poverty is negatively related to pws emergence in mexico likely picking up a lack of ability to pay for pws programs while poverty could also indicate lower opportunity costs upstream if this were the mechanism we would have expected a positive relationship between poverty and pws presence while user financed pws programs are not often directly funded by downstream households municipality wealth could correlate with funding available from taxes contributions or water utility bills to many of the counterparts in the mexican program e g municipal government state government or water utility wealth may also correlate with where private industry or ngos are present and where there is more pro environmental sentiments and spending in general 41 we also find that municipalities with more localities and cities are more likely to have pws most likely picking up population size downstream and thus demand for watershed services population spread or unevenness was important to pws emergence in a multi country study of pws emergence 9 for institutional variables two global analyses highlighted the role of land tenure security 8 9 and this enabling condition is highlighted consistently in the pes literature 11 tenure form can also influence pws emergence and in mexico collective tenure systems are more likely to have pws contracts 37 this could reflect the fact that ejido lands cover more than two thirds of existing forest cover in the country and because working with ejidos can lower the transaction costs of pws programs 23 34 the presence of other conservation policies and programs appear to act as complements to local pws emergence in mexico our result for npas contrasts with an analysis of global cities 8 but in mexico pes payments are often made to communities living within npas and in buffer zones to offset the opportunity costs of conservation faced by local communities 34 the national pes program and the watersheds and cities program also act as complements most likely because they provided capacity building and institutional strengthening for local actors to be able to implement a local pws mechanism in our discussions with conafor they pointed to the role of social capital or organizational capacity of local users as critical to emergence of local pws programs a smaller number of variables influence persistence of pws compared to emergence in our study under biophysical factors past deforestation does not have an influence on explaining persistence of pws programs terrain ruggedness and agricultural extent remain important to persistence however the direction of influence of agricultural extent switches between emergence and persistence of pws programs one explanation for this is that while threats to watershed services from agriculture help initiate pws responses pws programs may not be able to achieve their goals of protecting or restoring hydrologically important areas at certain thresholds of agricultural land use due to higher opportunity costs this is similar to results from a review of 40 pes programs in latin america which concluded that programs failed when they could not reduce the pressures on the ecosystem or meet the opportunity costs of conservation 32 two measures of watershed services are related to pws program persistence and with large odds ratios specifically pws programs appear to persist in areas with more reported flood incidences and with poorer water quality suggesting that demand side factors for watershed services are important to persistence perhaps since local pws programs can invest up to 7 of their budget in monitoring of watershed services counterparts become more aware of watershed conditions in their locale after a pws program has emerged thus if more people are aware of water quantity and quality issues there might be more support for starting and maintaining pws programs this finding is more in line with conafor s observations that local pws operators are motivated by hydrological conditions the ability to secure the continued provision of ecosystem services and seeing the added value of financial investments in pes programs were also strongly related to the success of 40 pes programs in latin america 32 in the category of economic and socio cultural factors gdp continues to play a role in pws program persistence indicating the importance of wealth over time in these types of programs this willingness or ability to pay is necessary to meet the opportunity costs of conservation and overcome pressures on ecosystems 32 related to institutional factors private land tenure and npas remain statistically significant to the continued operation of local pws programs this could be because pws programs are more likely to find enough participants over time where there is collective land tenure and or communities located within npas the institutional variables capturing capacity building and institutional strengthening the national pes program and watersheds and cities program have mixed results with only the watersheds and cities program remaining positive and significant however the magnitude of influence of the watersheds and cities program is higher for persistence than emergence suggesting that having sufficient capacity downstream is even more important for sustaining the program over time in terms of the role of local counterparts to pws success we find that pws programs are more likely to persist when ngos including both local and international organizations or water utilities are involved in funding and operating the program ngos are often more locally situated and politically neutral than other counterparts which can help increase trust 42 43 it is less common for water utilities to be the operator of local pws programs in mexico and this may be linked to issues of lack of trust by the general population or that water utility operators are not convinced that nbs are effective compared to engineered solutions however when they are involved they seem to lead to successful pws programs perhaps because they can fund programs through tariffs on water bills that lead to more sustainable funding sources having the local operator be a private industry or municipal government was also positively related to persistence in some models but with smaller odds ratios and weaker statistical significance having the state government act as the local pws program operator had no effect on pws persistence suggesting that more centralized actors are not as effective as decentralized operators in many countries there is a tendency for incoming politicians to reject programs started by previous leaders especially when there is a change in party our intra country analysis has many advantages over multi country and global analyses by minimizing unobservable bias controlling for the policy mechanism leading to pws and addressing the question of persistence in addition to emergence however it relies on secondary data and could miss harder to measure factors important for emergence or persistence in our discussions with conafor financial resources social capital and environmental motivations were mentioned as the most important factors for successful local user financed pws programs in our analysis our measures of gdp per capita and poverty indicate that municipalities that have access to more wealth are more likely to have a pws program emerge and persist social capital is measured in our analysis through the presence of the watersheds and cities program and the national pes program and both were important to the initial emergence of pws programs in our sample and the former program remained important to the persistence of pws over time conafor identified environmental or non financial motivations as occurring both through upstream landowners and through individuals within downstream organizations advocating for conservation there are no direct secondary variables in our analysis that account for these non financial motivations but these motivations have been found to be important in other studies of pws emergence and success 14 26 in addition to buyer and seller motivations other program design features such as transaction types have been identified as influencing pes success or persistence 32 42 but secondary data were not available on these factors for this study the factors that lead to pws emergence and or persistence have policy design implications and help shed light on the efficiency effectiveness and equity of existing pws programs in mexico and beyond first pws programs are more likely to appear where there are lower opportunity costs which fits the theory but also indicates lower additionality or use of the precautionary principle by program operators 11 to increase additionality higher payment amounts will be needed to compensate opportunity costs in more hydrologically sensitive areas or those with greater deforestation risk second while more supply of watershed services influence emergence of pws in global studies 8 9 this was not the case in our study despite conafor stating that this is a primary motivation however measures of water security did influence persistence of pws in our study this suggests that more investments in monitoring and reporting on actual watershed metrics could be important to the long term success of pws programs 44 and could spur other municipalities to develop a local pws program third pws programs tend to emerge and persist in places that have more wealth and financial resources conafor mentioned that this was a critical aspect for local pws programs but this signals an inequity in where pws can be a solution to water security issues 45 in the case of mexico s matching funds program or other programs experimenting with a differentiated approach to providing matching funds based on need or using an approach that scales funding back over time i e starts with more support that decreases over time might allow more areas where pws would be beneficial to emerge of course more flexible rules can increase transaction costs and may not be perceived as fair by local participants fourth institutional strength or social capital are critical for pws emergence and persistence highlighting the need for external capacity building efforts like the watersheds and cities program in mexico to occur before local pws solutions emerge finally involvement of more decentralized actors like ngos and water utilities in funding and operation appears key to the long term success of local pws initiatives possibly due to more trust in these organizations the stability of these actors over time compared to government personnel or more secure financial resources suggesting that more public private partnerships are needed for watershed sustainability 5 conclusion in this paper we contribute to the knowledge base on emergence and persistence of pws programs through analysis of a novel intra country dataset on local user financed pws programs in mexico in essence the mexican government set up a natural experiment by providing half the funding needed to start these local pws approaches we study the results of this natural experiment by assessing the biophysical socio economic and institutional factors that are correlated with emergence and persistence of the 145 pws programs established between 2008 and 2019 the key generalizable lessons we learned can be summarized as follows 1 programs need to be able to meet the opportunity costs of conservation and address the external threats to ecosystem services 2 programs need to provide perceived or real valued added impact in terms of the provision of ecosystem services 3 programs need a sustainable source of financing that will continually fund the program over time and 4 the institutional capacity to operate a program needs to be in place before program development and ideally involves non state actors without all four of these conditions local user financed pws programs are unlikely to emerge and as seen in the case of mexico if they do emerge but cannot meet these conditions they are likely to end understanding these conditions should help local beneficiaries assess if they are ready to develop a user financed pws program or whether additional interventions or support are needed before implementing these types of water security approaches while our research provides a cross sectional analysis of emergence and persistence future research could build on this effort by focusing on longitudinal analysis of program persistence using fixed effects that control for additional unobservable variation exploring how local pes programs interact with other conservation programs and institutional conditions across time and bringing in primary data from program operators to flesh out the mechanisms behind emergence and persistence in general conducting similar analyses in different countries or regions to test the generalizability of the factors from this paper and global analyses 8 9 is needed so that future evidence based syntheses can be conducted to generalize

8634,payments for watershed services pws programs have become a prominent approach to protect or restore ecosystems and watershed services but little is known about where these innovative financing tools and governance systems emerge and persist in 2008 the mexican government launched a program where they matched funding from local partners to establish user financed pws leading to the creation of 145 programs between 2008 and 2019 we study the factors related to the emergence and persistence of these local user financed pws programs across mexico we assemble a unique database on these programs as well as biophysical economic socio cultural and institutional variables at the municipality level we use logistic regression to analyze the variables correlated with the emergence and persistence of pws we find that pws programs are more likely to emerge in municipalities with lower opportunity costs of forest conservation that are wealthier that have higher institutional capacity and that have more collective land tenure and protected areas pws programs are more likely to persist in municipalities where watershed conditions are a concern that have more wealth and institutional capacity and that have a non governmental organization or water utility involved as the local counterpart these results suggest that emergence and persistence of local user financed pws programs to address water security can occur when the opportunity costs of conservation are met the provision of ecosystem services is enhanced there are sustainable sources of financing and there is institutional capacity that involves non state actors keywords green infrastructure investments in watershed services nature based solutions payments for ecosystem services pagos por servicios ambientales data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasingly water security and water related hazards are being addressed through investments in nature based solutions nbs especially around urban areas 1 2 nbs for water security differ from engineered solutions by using the conservation or restoration of forests and other natural ecosystems to maintain regulate or improve water quality and or flows 3 nbs reflect new paradigms about the relationships between people and nature and utilitarian views about the role of natural capital and ecosystem services as part of this paradigm payments for watershed services pws programs also known as investments in watershed services iws have emerged over the last two decades pws are voluntary transactions between ecosystem service users and ecosystem service providers within a particular watershed that are conditional on upstream management actions that generate downstream watershed services there are approximately 387 pws programs worldwide categorized as government or user financed 4 the latter occur through either collective action funding the pooling of resources from public private and civil sector actors to incentivize ecosystem service provision or bilateral agreements which most often occur through a non governmental organization ngo or a private entity and ecosystem service providers there are fewer user financed pws programs than government financed pws despite the belief that local user financed programs would be more responsive to local needs reduce transaction costs and increase additionality 5 specifically government financed programs spent more than 20 billion usd in 2016 on watershed services whereas user financed programs spent just under 700 million usd 4 understanding why local user financed pws solutions to water security emerge and persist can generate lessons about the enabling conditions that are needed to expand the use of local user financed pws for water security 6 9 additionally it can help point to factors that lead to the success of programs over time increasing the return on these financial investments finally a better understanding of where local user financed pws programs emerge and persist can help contextualize the types of efficiency effectiveness and equity outcomes that are occurring and can inform future program designs to enhance these outcomes 10 conceptually the overall conditions or enabling factors necessary for the emergence of pws programs or more broadly payments for ecosystem services pes can be grouped into the categories of biophysical economic socio cultural and institutional 7 11 biophysically pes programs focus on the protection management or restoration of ecosystem services from natural or semi natural ecosystems pre existing land cover and other ecological conditions are important determinants of ecosystem service provision and thus determinants of where programs are located 12 the original theory of pes emphasized economic conditions including that the beneficiaries willingness to pay for ecosystem services needs to be greater than providers willingness to accept 11 13 the latter is closely tied to opportunity costs of conservation since pes payments will not be able to compete with all alternative land uses pes also require low transaction costs and information exchange between buyers and sellers 11 socio cultural conditions also play an important role in pes emergence this includes presence of existing social norms to conserve or pro environmental values 14 and the interplay between financial incentives and potential crowding out of these intrinsic motivations 13 finally institutional factors are a critical part of pes program design clear land tenure rights and security have been shown to be important for pes programs to operate 11 13 organizational technical or social capacity is also key for both pes beneficiaries to organize and distribute payments and pes sellers especially in the case of collective pes contracts 5 15 trust between service providers and users is necessary and often enhanced by intermediary organizations 16 competing conservation or land use policies can support or undermine pes program effectiveness 17 pes programs can also be a complement to other social programs 18 there is a large body of literature focusing on how enabling factors influence household or community participation in pes programs 14 the literature on participation in pes programs points to the role of household or community eligibility ability and willingness to participate in pes programs 14 19 many of these factors mimic the broader literature on conditions for pes emergence including the role of land tenure human capacity and financial resources but finds that enrollment depends on a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations 14 these factors have all been found to be important in mexico the focus of this paper with land tenure conditions low opportunity costs social capacity of communities pro social motivations and trust between participants and program operators key determinants to participation 20 24 a smaller number of studies have looked at the participation of pes beneficiaries or buyers in pes programs these studies show that user participation depends on internal leadership external pressure from constituents trust organizational capacity and perceived benefits from the program that includes both financial and non financial benefits 25 26 most of the studies above focus on participation in pes programs or pes emergence at one study site there are fewer empirical studies that quantitatively assess the influence of different factors on pes emergence across multiple study sites one study that does this is a country level analysis of 64 pan tropical countries across africa asia and latin america 9 bosch et al 9 use logistic regression to explore relationships between economic institutional and physical geological variables and pws emergence they find that variables within each category are important to emergence but that topography hydrology and institutions have the most influence on a country having at least one pws program a second study that explores the question of pws emergence across different sites is a global analysis of the emergence of pws programs across 400 of the world s largest cities 8 using random forest models to explore which variables are most important to emergence romulu et al 8 find that more agricultural land has the strongest positive relationship with pws emergence while more protected areas within the watershed are negatively correlated with the presence of pws programs neither of these two studies focus exclusively on local user financed pws emergence and since they compare emergence across multiple countries they are unable to control for regional differences in institutional and socio cultural factors that could influence pws emergence in the broader literature on pes emergence and participation few studies consider what happens over time in terms of persistence of programs or continued participation 27 28 the question of persistence is important for pws programs to understand the return on investment following initial start up costs and ecological success since restoring hydrological responses is a long term endeavor most studies have examined the question of persistence of individual or group conservation behaviors after a pes program ends these studies suggest that conservation behaviors are more likely to persist if landowner attitudes and motivations align with the conservation action the landowner has sufficient resources to continue the behavior and overcome opportunity costs and social ties and norms support continued implementation 27 29 31 while no papers were found on the specific topic of pes program level persistence over time studies that consider the success of different pes programs shed light on the types of factors that could matter for example a study of 40 pes programs in latin america found that success defined as meeting program goals or improving outcomes was higher in programs that were able to protect ecosystem services operate at a local or regional scale use a mix of cash and in kind incentives and establish direct transactions between buyers and sellers 32 low degrees of success were associated with programs that could not reduce pressures on target ecosystems protect ecosystem services or meet opportunity costs of conservation in sum factors such as opportunity costs and non financial motivations influence both emergence and persistence of pes programs however program design features such as transaction types and actors as well as the ability of the program to deliver ecosystem services outcomes are important to the success or persistence of pes programs over time in this paper we contribute to this body of knowledge through an intra country quantitative analysis of the factors related to the emergence and persistence of local user financed pws programs in mexico we answer the following research questions 1 what factors are related to pws emergence and 2 after pws programs emerge what factors are correlated with the persistence versus failure of a program we study mexico a country well known for having developed one of the first government financed national pws programs known as pago por servicios ambientales hidrológicos psah in spanish in 2003 here we focus on the country s lesser studied local user financed mechanism for pes known as mechanismos locales de pago por servicios ambientales fondos concurrentes mlpsa fc in spanish which has been the main form of pes expansion in the country since 2008 while this program allows for ecosystem services other than water most local programs developed to date have focused exclusively on watershed services this user financed pes program was developed by the national forestry commission conafor to generate more funding for ecosystem services ensure greater participation by local actors allow for restoration as well as conservation of ecosystems and allow programs greater flexibility and responsiveness to local conditions conafor pays up to 50 with local partners paying remaining costs the local pws programs considered in this study enrolled more than 800 000 ha between 2008 and 2019 across the country with local partners including state and municipal governments ngos water utilities and private firms 33 local partners determine the criteria for selecting participants and setting payment amounts with fewer restrictions on where programs can be established compared to the national pws program our analysis adds to the existing literature on pes emergence by providing a quantitative intra country analysis that reduces the number of unobservable factors that might influence emergence by studying pws programs that originate from the same policy mechanism mexico also has specific institutional conditions that we focus on in our analysis including a large portion of forest under community or collective ownership and targeting of pes toward protected areas 34 additionally we tackle the question of persistence versus failure of pws programs after they emerge expecting similar as well as different factors to influence the success of these programs over time local user financed pws is one tool to increase water security and this paper will be beneficial to understand what factors can increase the chances they are developed and persist over time and to identify local contexts where these types of approaches may be less useful 2 methods 2 1 dependent variables and sample sizes we assembled an original database of local user financed pws programs using data from conafor including unique contracts information on the local counterpart number of participants area enrolled and payment amounts we organized contracts by unique pws program based on consistency in the names and locations of the contracts and then verified our list with conafor we identified 145 unique pws programs during the period 2008 2019 that focused exclusively on watershed services as of 2019 only 60 of these programs remained active the average length of operation for a pws program was seven years on average a program had two contracts approved by conafor since it started with a range of one to seven contracts per pws program the length of contracts ranged from one to 15 years with a median of five years most local pws programs in mexico are organized around municipality or micro watershed boundaries relevant to the watershed service beneficiaries we used municipality boundaries to spatially attribute a pws program to a specific location for this study because data for most independent variables including variables on water quality and quantity and all economic and socio cultural variables were only available at this level in 2008 when the pws programs began there were 2456 municipalities including the 16 boroughs of mexico city across 32 states we spatially defined where payments were being made in the 145 local pws programs based on shapefiles obtained from conafor since several of the 145 pws programs span multiple municipalities our final sample includes 260 municipalities with at least one local pws program between the years 2008 and 2019 fig 1 only four of 32 mexican states had no local pws programs during this time to answer the research question about the emergence of pws we only considered the binary outcome of whether a municipality had a local pws program or not if a program was in operation anytime between 2008 and 2019 the municipality was labeled 1 n 260 otherwise it was labeled 0 n 2194 while it would be ideal to have municipalities that applied to the pws program but were rejected as the controls conafor informed us that only a handful of applications had ever been rejected due to a two step process which requires all application materials to be reviewed at the state level before the application is submitted to the national level to answer the second research question on persistence of pws programs we only considered pws programs that had started by 2014 to ensure they had time to renew their contracts since the median contract length was five years of the 260 municipalities that had a pws program as of 2019 170 had a pws program that started by 2014 of these 170 only 50 remained in existence as of 2019 these were labeled as 1 in the analysis and all others were labeled as 0 we construct our dependent variable in this way because the year of creation of a local pws program varies across municipalities we do not use number of years of program existence as the dependent variable to capture persistence but do use it as a control variable later because number of years also reflects early versus late adoption in our sample given the variation in start year our binary dependent variable allows us to explore the factors correlated with the likelihood that a program keeps operating once a program is created 2 2 independent variables definitions and hypotheses we included 15 independent variables categorized into three themes 1 biophysical 7 variables 2 economic and socio cultural 3 variables and 3 institutional 5 variables for each variable we sought data close to 2008 to capture the conditions before the local pws program was started table 1 under the biophysical theme we included water quality and reported incidences of drought and floods higher frequency of drought or floods and poorer water quality could increase the probability of emergence or persistence if this threat or scarcity in watershed services drives users to invest in pws to protect or restore them 9 however it could also be the case that having sufficient watershed services is more important for forming pws programs because users want to protect what they already have akin to the precautionary principle of wanting to protect what is in place 11 we included a measure of deforestation in the municipality as a measure of threat to watershed services higher deforestation would correlate with starting and maintaining a pws program if these programs are being used to address the threat of losing land cover however if the precautionary principle is being used or payments are considered more compensation for good behavior then the sign could go in the other direction 34 the extent of agriculture and pastureland in the municipality were included because more dominance of these land uses might signal greater pressure on forest resources and threats to water security and thus more likelihood of pws finally we included a measure of terrain ruggedness to capture opportunity costs of land similar to bosch et al 9 the expected influence was positive for program emergence and persistence terrain ruggedness could also signal important hydrological processes such as soil infiltration water storage capacity and quick flow responses 35 36 under the economic and socio cultural theme we included a national multidimensional poverty index conafor uses a measure of marginalization a variable that has some similarities to multidimensional poverty but with fewer indicators in targeting their national pes program but this is not a criteria for the local pws mechanism poverty could have a negative influence on local pws emergence and persistence if it reflects difficulty in funding a pws program especially if there is more urban poverty or it could be positively correlated if it signals lower opportunity costs to get landowners involved in a program because it captures rural poverty 23 we included a measure of gdp per capita to similarly gauge willingness to pay accept in a pws program like poverty it could capture the positive relationship between financial capital and willingness to pay or a negative relationship between high opportunity costs and low willingness to accept conservation 9 finally we included a count of the number of cities and localities in a municipality that had more than 2500 persons depending on the location of that population it could signal more demand for pws or could capture scarcity of land for conservation in pws programs 8 9 under the institutional theme we included measures of land tenure and conservation policies that could be complements enabling pws or substitutes used in place of pws to a local pws program while land tenure security does vary across mexico 21 there is no national measure however we included form of land tenure in our analysis since mexico has both private and collective tenure systems where the collective system nucleos agrarios includes both indigenous communities and ejidos 34 we included a dummy variable to control for private land tenure expecting a negative correlation with pws programs since collective pws contracts are more common in the national pws program 37 we included the percent of all natural protected areas npa the relationship with the local pws program was considered ambiguous npas could be a substitute to pws similar to romulu et al 9 however since mexico has explicitly promoted pws in areas within or adjacent to protected areas to help compensate for restricted access to resources 34 there could be a positive correlation we also included a measure of the percent of all national pes programs in a municipality between the years 2003 to 2008 which included payments for water biodiversity agroforestry and carbon during these years national pes payments could positively influence emergence and persistence of local pws programs by building institutional capacity or if the two programs are considered substitutes then more national pes payments could negatively influence local pws emergence we also included a private effort led by the mexican fund for the conservation of nature fondo mexicano para la conservación de la naturaleza fmcn in spanish known as the watersheds and cities program cuencas y ciudades in spanish it started in 2001 and was designed specifically to foster an alliance with local partners that would assume leadership on protecting water supply in their cities the presence of this program was expected to positively relate to the presence of local pws programs because the program would have built capacity and established relationships between cities and the basins that supply them with water in the analysis of persistence we included a variable on the type of local operator this information is only available for the areas with pws programs this variable captures the type of counterpart that signed the pws contract and that is responsible for providing 50 of the local pws funds and operating the program we coded information on counterparts into five dummy variables one for each of the following counterparts state government municipal government ngo private industry and water utility a municipality can be associated with more than one counterpart if there was more than one type of operator listed for a specific program or if there were multiple pws programs in that municipality with different types of operators 2 3 data analysis the variables in table 1 were summarized and t tests and normalized differences in means conducted to look for differences across pws and non pws municipalities correlation tests confirmed the absence of multicollinearity across all included variables to analyze the first research question on emergence of pws we used backwards stepwise logistic regression models with a cutoff of 90 to select variables from table 1 eq 1 p r o b p i 1 f α θ x i where p i 1 when a municipality had a pws program x i are the observable variables listed in table 1 and f is the logistic function we report odds ratios and robust standard errors an odds ratio greater than one indicates a positive relationship an odds ratio less than one a negative relationship this analysis was done for 1 the full municipality sample and 2 for a reduced sample that only included programs that started by 2014 to compare with the sample of municipalities used in the analysis of persistence we also ran eq 1 with and without dummy variables for seven terrestrial ecoregions in mexico to further reduce unobservable bias in terms of hydrological conditions and land productivity that may not be captured in our variables listed in table 1 data on ecoregions come from mexico s commission on biodiversity conabio and include categories such as desert plains dry temperate forests and wet humid forests similarly to understand what factors influence the persistence of pws we used backwards stepwise logistic regression with a cutoff of 90 with and without ecoregion dummy variables for this second analysis p i 1 in eq 1 when a municipality started a pws program by 2014 and it was still in operation as of 2019 and 0 if the program started by 2014 but had ceased to operate as a robustness check we also estimated this regression controlling for number of years of program existence to account for the influence that duration of each program prior to 2019 could have on whether the program was still in existence this was created as 2019 first year of program while panel data is available on when pws programs emerged and stopped operating in mexico we do not use panel data methods e g an event study in this analysis because only four of the independent variables in table 1 have annual data available limiting what we could conclude in terms of explanatory factors instead we focus on spatial correlation between independent variables and the emergence and persistence of local pws programs 2 4 discussions with conafor we held two virtual meetings with three staff members that operate the local user financed pws program at conafor s central offices the first meeting was to discuss our research questions and objectives with the organization to clarify the data on pws programs and to gather information from conafor on how the local pws program was designed implemented and adapted over time additionally we asked conafor about what factors they thought were important for enabling a municipality to start a pws program and for a local pws program to persist over time a second meeting was held after we completed our analysis to present our results to conafor and discuss with them our findings and interpretations this meeting was critical in understanding the policy implications of our findings and how they could influence on the ground operations 3 results 3 1 summary statistics municipalities with a local matching pws program in mexico had on average more rugged terrain lower deforestation rates less pastureland and fewer flood declarations table 2 there were no statistically significant differences in the extent of agricultural area the number of drought declarations or water quality between municipalities with and without a local pws program within the economic and socio cultural variables municipalities with pws programs had on average higher gdp per capita and more localities and cities but there was no statistically significant difference in multidimensional poverty rates all four institutional variables were statistically different municipalities with pws programs had on average a greater percent of area in a national pes program and within npas were more likely to be part of the watersheds and cities program and had less area in private land tenure summarizing from the conafor database for the 145 local user financed pws programs that emerged since 2008 the mean payment was 2393 pesos per ha 118 usd per ha in 2021 and median payment was 2099 pesos per ha 103 usd per ha in 2021 the counterparts for these programs were municipal government 37 ngo 25 state government 18 private industry 14 and water utility 6 most programs only listed one local counterpart with a maximum of three partners listed on a contract the mean number of landowners receiving payments across the 145 pws programs was 18 while this may seem low many contracts are made with ejido leaders to protect large tracts of collective forestland in mexico 33 3 2 emergence of pws three biophysical variables are statistically significant at the 90 level or greater in the logistic regression on emergence of pws terrain ruggedness deforestation and extent of agriculture table 3 municipalities with more terrain ruggedness and more agricultural area are more likely to have developed a local pws program however agricultural area was only statistically significant in one model having a higher deforestation rate is negatively correlated with emergence of a local pws program in most models all economic and socio cultural variables are statistically significant higher gdp per capita and a larger number of localities and cities both result in higher odds of developing a local pws program higher rates of multidimensional poverty however decrease the odds of having a local pws program this variable is not statistically significant in the 2014 sample institutional variables influence the emergence of local pws programs in mexico with the presence of other conservation programs npas national pes and watersheds and cities all complementing pws emergence private land tenure is negatively associated with the emergence of local pws programs 3 3 persistence of pws terrain ruggedness is statistically significant in one model with a positive correlation with local pws persistence table 3 agricultural extent is statistically significant and negatively correlated with local pws persistence flood occurrence and water quality both become statistically significant in these regression models with more floods and poorer water quality associated with persistence of user financed pws programs gdp per capita is statistically significant in one model private land tenure is negatively related to persistence of pws programs when the ecoregion dummy variable is not included presence of npas is positively associated with the persistence of local pws across all models whereas national pes payments are not correlated with persistence the watersheds and cities program is statistically significant when ecoregion dummy variables are included with a positive influence on persistence four of the five counterpart dummy variables are positively correlated with persistence of local pws when ecoregion dummy variables are not included with two counterparts remaining statistically significant when ecoregion dummy variables are included specifically ngos and water operators have large odds ratios positive influence and are statistically significant at the 99 confidence level across both models municipal government and industry counterparts are positively correlated with persistence when ecoregion dummy variables are not included but with lower odds ratios than ngos and water utilities when number of years of program operation was added to the persistence regression model models 7 and 8 similar variables remained statistically significant with qualitatively similar findings the number of years of program operation was statistically significant with a positive influence on pws persistence 4 discussion our quantitative and intra country analysis of mexico s local user financed pws programs supports previous conclusions in terms of the categories or factors that are correlated with emergence 7 9 and also point to a few factors specific to the mexican context our results on persistence of pws also support previous studies on the factors that are associated with success of pes programs over time 32 since our municipality level variables can capture both upstream and downstream characteristics that represent pws participants or pws beneficiaries respectively below we combine regression results with the previous literature and our discussions with conafor staff to tease out the most plausible mechanisms between statistically significant variables and the emergence and persistence of pws programs in mexico and beyond related to biophysical factors pws tend to emerge in places with more terrain ruggedness this could pick up higher contribution to hydrological conditions but more likely captures lower opportunity costs since more uneven terrain would be less suitable for agricultural production studies in mexico and other countries show that pes programs are commonly found in areas with higher slope a variable related to ruggedness and lower opportunity cost lands 38 40 land use as a measure of threats to watershed services shows mixed results in explaining emergence while higher deforestation rates were associated with emergence in a multi country analysis 9 in our study lower deforestation rates are correlated with emergence this is not surprising given that evaluations of mexico s national and local pws programs indicate that pws payments typically go to lands at lower risk of deforestation 37 40 lowering additionality 30 however agricultural extent a proxy for threat to forest cover and watershed services has a positive association with pws emergence in mexico this was also the case in a global city analysis of pws emergence 8 and suggests that local pws programs could be responding to perceived threats to watershed services in mexico in two global analyses watershed variables capturing water quantity water quality drought and flooding were correlated with pws emergence 8 9 but these metrics had no influence on pws emergence in this study in our discussions with conafor officials were surprised by this result as local operators have communicated that watershed conditions are a main driver for creating a local pws program under economic and socio cultural conditions the financial ability to pay for pws programs determines where they emerge across mexico in our study measures of both gdp per capita and multidimensional poverty indicated that wealth was important for emergence and financial resources were one of the main factors that conafor identified in our discussions as determining where local pws programs are developed in mexico the positive influence of gdp per capita on emergence suggests that higher economic activity in a municipality leads to more ability to pay higher gdp per capita was also related to pws emergence in non u s cities in a global analysis 8 poverty is negatively related to pws emergence in mexico likely picking up a lack of ability to pay for pws programs while poverty could also indicate lower opportunity costs upstream if this were the mechanism we would have expected a positive relationship between poverty and pws presence while user financed pws programs are not often directly funded by downstream households municipality wealth could correlate with funding available from taxes contributions or water utility bills to many of the counterparts in the mexican program e g municipal government state government or water utility wealth may also correlate with where private industry or ngos are present and where there is more pro environmental sentiments and spending in general 41 we also find that municipalities with more localities and cities are more likely to have pws most likely picking up population size downstream and thus demand for watershed services population spread or unevenness was important to pws emergence in a multi country study of pws emergence 9 for institutional variables two global analyses highlighted the role of land tenure security 8 9 and this enabling condition is highlighted consistently in the pes literature 11 tenure form can also influence pws emergence and in mexico collective tenure systems are more likely to have pws contracts 37 this could reflect the fact that ejido lands cover more than two thirds of existing forest cover in the country and because working with ejidos can lower the transaction costs of pws programs 23 34 the presence of other conservation policies and programs appear to act as complements to local pws emergence in mexico our result for npas contrasts with an analysis of global cities 8 but in mexico pes payments are often made to communities living within npas and in buffer zones to offset the opportunity costs of conservation faced by local communities 34 the national pes program and the watersheds and cities program also act as complements most likely because they provided capacity building and institutional strengthening for local actors to be able to implement a local pws mechanism in our discussions with conafor they pointed to the role of social capital or organizational capacity of local users as critical to emergence of local pws programs a smaller number of variables influence persistence of pws compared to emergence in our study under biophysical factors past deforestation does not have an influence on explaining persistence of pws programs terrain ruggedness and agricultural extent remain important to persistence however the direction of influence of agricultural extent switches between emergence and persistence of pws programs one explanation for this is that while threats to watershed services from agriculture help initiate pws responses pws programs may not be able to achieve their goals of protecting or restoring hydrologically important areas at certain thresholds of agricultural land use due to higher opportunity costs this is similar to results from a review of 40 pes programs in latin america which concluded that programs failed when they could not reduce the pressures on the ecosystem or meet the opportunity costs of conservation 32 two measures of watershed services are related to pws program persistence and with large odds ratios specifically pws programs appear to persist in areas with more reported flood incidences and with poorer water quality suggesting that demand side factors for watershed services are important to persistence perhaps since local pws programs can invest up to 7 of their budget in monitoring of watershed services counterparts become more aware of watershed conditions in their locale after a pws program has emerged thus if more people are aware of water quantity and quality issues there might be more support for starting and maintaining pws programs this finding is more in line with conafor s observations that local pws operators are motivated by hydrological conditions the ability to secure the continued provision of ecosystem services and seeing the added value of financial investments in pes programs were also strongly related to the success of 40 pes programs in latin america 32 in the category of economic and socio cultural factors gdp continues to play a role in pws program persistence indicating the importance of wealth over time in these types of programs this willingness or ability to pay is necessary to meet the opportunity costs of conservation and overcome pressures on ecosystems 32 related to institutional factors private land tenure and npas remain statistically significant to the continued operation of local pws programs this could be because pws programs are more likely to find enough participants over time where there is collective land tenure and or communities located within npas the institutional variables capturing capacity building and institutional strengthening the national pes program and watersheds and cities program have mixed results with only the watersheds and cities program remaining positive and significant however the magnitude of influence of the watersheds and cities program is higher for persistence than emergence suggesting that having sufficient capacity downstream is even more important for sustaining the program over time in terms of the role of local counterparts to pws success we find that pws programs are more likely to persist when ngos including both local and international organizations or water utilities are involved in funding and operating the program ngos are often more locally situated and politically neutral than other counterparts which can help increase trust 42 43 it is less common for water utilities to be the operator of local pws programs in mexico and this may be linked to issues of lack of trust by the general population or that water utility operators are not convinced that nbs are effective compared to engineered solutions however when they are involved they seem to lead to successful pws programs perhaps because they can fund programs through tariffs on water bills that lead to more sustainable funding sources having the local operator be a private industry or municipal government was also positively related to persistence in some models but with smaller odds ratios and weaker statistical significance having the state government act as the local pws program operator had no effect on pws persistence suggesting that more centralized actors are not as effective as decentralized operators in many countries there is a tendency for incoming politicians to reject programs started by previous leaders especially when there is a change in party our intra country analysis has many advantages over multi country and global analyses by minimizing unobservable bias controlling for the policy mechanism leading to pws and addressing the question of persistence in addition to emergence however it relies on secondary data and could miss harder to measure factors important for emergence or persistence in our discussions with conafor financial resources social capital and environmental motivations were mentioned as the most important factors for successful local user financed pws programs in our analysis our measures of gdp per capita and poverty indicate that municipalities that have access to more wealth are more likely to have a pws program emerge and persist social capital is measured in our analysis through the presence of the watersheds and cities program and the national pes program and both were important to the initial emergence of pws programs in our sample and the former program remained important to the persistence of pws over time conafor identified environmental or non financial motivations as occurring both through upstream landowners and through individuals within downstream organizations advocating for conservation there are no direct secondary variables in our analysis that account for these non financial motivations but these motivations have been found to be important in other studies of pws emergence and success 14 26 in addition to buyer and seller motivations other program design features such as transaction types have been identified as influencing pes success or persistence 32 42 but secondary data were not available on these factors for this study the factors that lead to pws emergence and or persistence have policy design implications and help shed light on the efficiency effectiveness and equity of existing pws programs in mexico and beyond first pws programs are more likely to appear where there are lower opportunity costs which fits the theory but also indicates lower additionality or use of the precautionary principle by program operators 11 to increase additionality higher payment amounts will be needed to compensate opportunity costs in more hydrologically sensitive areas or those with greater deforestation risk second while more supply of watershed services influence emergence of pws in global studies 8 9 this was not the case in our study despite conafor stating that this is a primary motivation however measures of water security did influence persistence of pws in our study this suggests that more investments in monitoring and reporting on actual watershed metrics could be important to the long term success of pws programs 44 and could spur other municipalities to develop a local pws program third pws programs tend to emerge and persist in places that have more wealth and financial resources conafor mentioned that this was a critical aspect for local pws programs but this signals an inequity in where pws can be a solution to water security issues 45 in the case of mexico s matching funds program or other programs experimenting with a differentiated approach to providing matching funds based on need or using an approach that scales funding back over time i e starts with more support that decreases over time might allow more areas where pws would be beneficial to emerge of course more flexible rules can increase transaction costs and may not be perceived as fair by local participants fourth institutional strength or social capital are critical for pws emergence and persistence highlighting the need for external capacity building efforts like the watersheds and cities program in mexico to occur before local pws solutions emerge finally involvement of more decentralized actors like ngos and water utilities in funding and operation appears key to the long term success of local pws initiatives possibly due to more trust in these organizations the stability of these actors over time compared to government personnel or more secure financial resources suggesting that more public private partnerships are needed for watershed sustainability 5 conclusion in this paper we contribute to the knowledge base on emergence and persistence of pws programs through analysis of a novel intra country dataset on local user financed pws programs in mexico in essence the mexican government set up a natural experiment by providing half the funding needed to start these local pws approaches we study the results of this natural experiment by assessing the biophysical socio economic and institutional factors that are correlated with emergence and persistence of the 145 pws programs established between 2008 and 2019 the key generalizable lessons we learned can be summarized as follows 1 programs need to be able to meet the opportunity costs of conservation and address the external threats to ecosystem services 2 programs need to provide perceived or real valued added impact in terms of the provision of ecosystem services 3 programs need a sustainable source of financing that will continually fund the program over time and 4 the institutional capacity to operate a program needs to be in place before program development and ideally involves non state actors without all four of these conditions local user financed pws programs are unlikely to emerge and as seen in the case of mexico if they do emerge but cannot meet these conditions they are likely to end understanding these conditions should help local beneficiaries assess if they are ready to develop a user financed pws program or whether additional interventions or support are needed before implementing these types of water security approaches while our research provides a cross sectional analysis of emergence and persistence future research could build on this effort by focusing on longitudinal analysis of program persistence using fixed effects that control for additional unobservable variation exploring how local pes programs interact with other conservation programs and institutional conditions across time and bringing in primary data from program operators to flesh out the mechanisms behind emergence and persistence in general conducting similar analyses in different countries or regions to test the generalizability of the factors from this paper and global analyses 8 9 is needed so that future evidence based syntheses can be conducted to generalize
