18355,poor environmental technologies and gastrointestinal illnesses have been hypothesized to be a primary cause to the lack of impact of child health programs on child stunting rates low height for age in south africa this study assessed correlations between environmental exposures water source water treatment sanitation refuse diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation proxies among female and male children under five years of age in the eastern cape a conceptual model was hypothesized using structural equation se modeling and two sex specific female and male datasets were subsequently generated from the data and applied to the hypothesized se model results suggested that environmental exposure variables associated with diarrhea and systemic inflammation proxies were different

below the median of the sex specific growth standard among children under five years of age in south africa has stagnated may and timæus 2014 shisana et al 2014 previous studies have reported that gastrointestinal illnesses as well as other water sanitation and hygiene wash related infections are associated with stunting checkley et al 2008 guerrant et al 2008 nel 2010 walker et al 2011 in 2016 the south african national prevalence rate of diarrhea for children under five years of age was 10 statistics south africa 2016 therefore while child diarrheal prevalence rates remain low high stunting levels persist among children in south africa this suggests there is need for further research on the complex mechanistic pathways between wash general gastrointestinal illnesses and stunting environmental enteric dysfunction eed is an asymptomatic condition characterized by local intestinal inflammation an increase in intestinal wall permeability and subsequent systemic inflammation keusch et al 2014 this condition has been identified within populations living in areas with poor sanitation and has been associated with diarrhea and child stunting chambers and von medeazza 2014 prendergast and kelly 2016 a growing body of evidence suggests the prevalence of eed may be higher than diarrhea and that the association between diarrhea and eed as measured by local intestinal inflammation and intestinal wall permeability may be cyclical bourke et al 2016 owino et al 2016 furthermore the early onset characteristics of eed local intestinal inflammation and intestinal wall permeability and diarrhea have both been reported as associated with systemic inflammation later stage characteristic of eed specifically among children under five years of age kosek et al 2017 in either health problem eed or diarrhea the child is at risk of micronutrient deficiencies due to the prevention in utilization or inappropriate allocation of crucial nutrients for growth oria 2016 to investigate the complex associations between environmental exposure factors and specific characteristics of eed appropriate modeling techniques are required structural equation se modeling has shown promise in applications related to environmental health problems se modeling advances multivariate regression by combining the use of latent or hidden variables and path models i e those with two or more outcomes of interest to capture multiple and potentially interacting associations divelbiss and co workers divelbiss et al 2013 originally utilized se modeling to assess several environmental factors impacting both biosand filter use and diarrhea outcomes recently we extended this application to assess environmental factors impacting both eed and child stunting in guatemala voth gaeddert et al 2018b this approach provides an adaptable framework which may be applied to situations of complex environmental exposures and health problems such as those addressed by the current study using literature and prior experience we developed a comprehensive set of hypotheses to describe environmental exposures and child health in the local context of the eastern cape these hypotheses include improved drinking water source has a negative effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e less sickness when drinking clean water less distance between the drinking water source and the household has a negative effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e hauling water long distances results in choosing to consume poorer quality water with a greater likelihood of sickness improved drinking water treatment has a negative effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e less sickness when drinking clean water improved refuse handling has a negative effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e hygienic behaviors such as proper trash disposal correspond to choosing to drink clean water improved sanitation facility has a negative effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e hygienic behaviors such as proper toilet correspond to choosing to drink clean water an increase in shared sanitation facilities has a positive effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e share toilets are less hygienic less distance between the sanitation facility and the household has a positive effect on diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation i e toilets near homes correspond to more sickness increased diarrheal occurrences has a positive effect on systemic inflammation i e one sickness corresponds to other sick conditions increased systemic inflammation can increase the manifestation of severe cough infections transmitted sexually or transferred at birth pneumonia and bronchitis i e one sickness corresponds to other sick conditions se modeling provides a method to test these hypotheses simultaneously and to understand the relative contribution of each hypothesis within the context of the larger system finally recent literature has suggested there are significant gender inequality gaps among females and males related to nutritional status and caregiver decision making on child health in south africa and other countries with high inequality bornstein and putnick 2016 unicef 2017 zere and mcintyre 2003 a multigroup se model analysis was used in this study to investigate specific differences of associated factors between females and males to reduce the population of this study to a level conducive to the statistical approach while also maintaining a representative population for the province the eastern cape was selected selection criteria included high levels of reported morbidity diarrhea fever and cough and local informal observation data on sex differences in child rearing practices the study population was then divided based on reported sex female male as a proxy for differential gender roles and a se model group analysis was conducted in this study the term sex refers to population differences determined by genitals while the term gender refers to population differences determined by socio political status delphy 1993 this study utilizes secondary data from the 2014 and 2015 general household survey ghs datasets and the statistical framework of se modeling to test the following questions among specific sexes of children under five years of age in the eastern cape 1 which wash variables water sanitation and refuse are associated with diarrheal occurrences 2 which wash variables are associated with systemic inflammation 3 do diarrheal occurrences mediate the correlation between wash variables and systemic inflammation and 4 is there a difference between females and males in the type of wash variables associated with either diarrheal occurrences or systemic inflammation 2 methods 2 1 study setting the eastern cape has a population of 6 7 million residents 12 1 of the national population making it the third most populous province after gauteng and kwazulu natal statistics south africa 2017a the province is predominately agrarian with a high proportion of households practicing subsistence agriculture despite the high number of people engaged in agriculture the sector only contributed 2 to the provincial economy in 2016 with manufacturing primarily vehicles contributing 11 trade and industrial policy strategies 2016 furthermore wages in the province were below the national average in 2015 with a total monthly average income of zar 7513 i e zar 4001 below the national average which is second lowest among all provinces statistics south africa 2017b in the eastern cape coverage of household water sanitation and hygiene wash resources suggests that 84 8 of households in the province have access to improved sanitation and 75 7 of households have piped water in their dwelling however 6 5 of residents in the province either have no toilet facility or use bucket toilets statistics south africa 2017a 2 2 study design and sample eastern cape provincial data utilized to test the hypotheses in this study were aggregated from the 2014 and 2015 south african ghs n 2930 the ghs is an annual cross sectional national survey which is also representative at the provincial level statistics south africa 2015 2014 it is administered by local trained fieldworkers to mothers in household settings since 2002 the survey has collected data on diarrheal occurrences in addition to other diseases geospatial metrics local environmental factors and socioeconomic and demographic variables in this study the 2014 and 2015 ghs data were pooled to increase the sample size of a small domain variable diarrhea with the aim to improve the robustness of the data during the pooling of the data specific criteria were followed 1 the two years of data were each drawn from independent sampling frames 2 there was minimal time difference in sampling less than one year as this supported the low probability of changing characteristics in the underlying population and 3 the variables used in each survey did not change in structure or format the study population was then divided into two groups female n 1460 and male n 1470 for analysis the dataset can be accessed online at https www datafirst uct ac za dataportal statistics south africa 2015 2014 2 3 variables table 1 presents the list of variables and associated questions drawn from the ghs survey systemic inflammation a hypothesized late onset characteristic of eed was a latent variable computed using factor analysis and a set of self reported health problems displayed by children each health problem or indicator variable was hypothesized to increase in prevalence among children with systemic inflammation these variables included severe cough sexually transmitted diseases std pneumonia and bronchitis the list was developed based on a literature review and the input of local and international medical experts but it was limited to the available variables collected by the ghs severe cough pneumonia and bronchitis have been suggested to increase among patients with systemic inflammation as both a cause and consequence either due to an increase in acquiring a new infection or presenting symptoms during a weaker infection wood et al 2012 similarly presenting symptoms and subsequently diagnosing an std during the acute primary infection stage is more likely among children who already have systemic inflammation masson et al 2015 posavad and koelle 1997 a similar variable was employed in the mal ed study and reported by kosek et al 2017 they used a composite variable which included diarrhea fever and respiratory infection the term systemic inflammation will be used in this paper to denote the latent variable generated by the identified proxies listed above furthermore utilizing the latent variable approach provided a method to leverage low frequency variables in a mathematically appropriate manner diarrheal occurrence was the other outcome variable incorporated into the se model as a mediating factor diarrhea was used as a proxy for the early onset characteristics of eed namely local intestinal inflammation and intestinal wall permeability as these variables were not available in the dataset guerrant and co workers guerrant et al 2013 reviewed the similarities and differences between diarrhea and local intestinal inflammation and intestinal wall permeability wash variables included have been identified in previous literature to impact child diarrhea and systemic inflammation and can be divided into three categories infrastructure or devices operation characteristics and geospatial location infrastructure and devices included drinking water source drinking water treatment and type of sanitation cairncross et al 2010 ngure et al 2014 operation characteristics included refuse handling and sharing sanitation fazzo et al 2017 fuller et al 2014 finally geospatial location included distance of drinking water source and distance of sanitation pickering and davis 2012 presented several considerations regarding the relationship among distance and geospatial location of water and sanitation infrastructure and the impacts on the prevalence of sickness especially in poor households these relationships include 1 a reduced chance of spreading pathogens present in latrines to the household with increased distance 2 a reduced chance of spreading pathogens with less open defecation or defecating in a bucket with decreased distance of latrines and 3 reduced chance of contaminating water during transport from a source to a home where it is consumed when the distance the water must be transported is minimized 2 4 statistical analyses basic descriptive statistics were generated for each variable an initial bivariate analysis non parametric kruskal wallis ratio test was conducted and a multigroup structural equation se model was tested with the data to better understand the data and contributions of the sem approach kruskal wallis tests were conducted for all variables in the hypothesized se model for both outcomes using three datasets all children females and males to assess each factor s relationship with systemic inflammation an aggregate score was used based on the summation of the binary indicator variables in addition a single binomial regression model was developed and included diarrhea as the outcome along with all wash variables and the sex variable the all children dataset was used and the iteratively reweighted least squares estimator applied all analyses were conducted in r v3 4 se modeling has previously been applied in the assessment of a community health intervention divelbiss et al 2013 a multimethod community health assessment voth gaeddert et al 2018a and a multi model assessment of enteric dysfunction voth gaeddert et al 2018b briefly in this study the se model contained diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation as mediating and outcome variables respectively and were both regressed on by a hypothesized set of wash variables these wash variables as described above were identified in previous literature to be associated with diarrheal occurrences and were therefore regressed on this variable to test if diarrheal occurrences may then lead to systemic inflammation and if any wash variables may directly influence systemic inflammation without causing diarrhea all wash variables were regressed on systemic inflammation fig 1 depicts the hypothesized se model for this study in the figure rectangles represent observed variables the oval represents the latent variable and arrows are hypothesized correlations the primary outcome systemic inflammation the latent variable in the model was estimated from a set of symptom based variables hypothesized to be more prevalent among children with systemic inflammation factor analysis was chosen over an index summation calculation for the estimation of systemic inflammation variable based on the hypothesized causal relationships between the underlying issue systemic inflammation and the subsequent outcomes of that issue reported symptoms to test the fit of the data to a hypothesized model a set of model fit statistics are utilized these include chi square χ2 p value 0 05 confirmatory factor index cfi 0 90 tucker lewis index tli 0 90 and the root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 08 if the model fit statistics suggest adequate fit of the data to the hypothesized model then the parameter estimates within the model can be analyzed the parameter estimates in the model are read as regression parameter estimates and are interpreted as follows a one unit increase in the independent variable is correlated with a shift in the dependent variable equal to that of the parameter estimate all independent variables were categorical or dichotomous therefore a one unit increase or just increase here on in an independent variable such as the type of sanitation facility is interpreted as improving from one type of sanitation facility to the next best type e g improving from a ventilated pit latrine with cement flooring to a flush toilet both standardized s and unstandardized u parameter estimates are reported to investigate differences between female and male based se models the se model group analysis method was utilized grace 2006 rosseel 2017 the lavaan package of r 3 3 2 was utilized for the analysis 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics table 2 and table 3 display the results of the descriptive statistics for both quantitative and qualitative variables qualitative variables were quantified by rank order for analysis based on world health organization and us agency for international development guidelines who unicef joint monitoring programme for water sanitation and hygiene jmp 2017 the dataset included n 2930 children 50 2 female n 1460 and 49 8 male n 1470 overall means for the self reported illness occurrence variables were low suggesting few households reported children with these illnesses the most common being the flu or respiratory illness the means and modes within the descriptive statistics suggested that the ethnicity of the households was primarily black with little formal education household members owned their own refuse dump while defecation occurred in ventilated improved pit latrines located in the yard not often shared with other families finally on average water was obtained at a public tap 201 500 m from the household and was almost never treated once brought into the household however the analysis suggested the associations between these variables and the health outcome variables differed between females and males 3 2 bivariate and binomial regression analyses full data for the bivariate analysis is presented in table 4 the bivariate analyses identified the same five of seven variables significant with diarrhea across the three datasets all children females males these included distance of sanitation type of sanitation proper refuse handling dist of drinking water source and drinking water source for systemic inflammation six of eight variables were significant for the all children and male datasets while in the female dataset only five were significant significant variables for all three datasets included type of sanitation proper refuse handling dist of drinking water source drinking water source and diarrhea while distance of sanitation was not statistically significant within the female dataset the binomial regression model on diarrhea did not identify sex as statistically significant but did identify refuse handling as statistically significant see table 5 3 3 se models diarrhea and systemic inflammation fig 2 depicts the final se model output for the hypothesized relationships for the female population of children under five years of age four model fit statistics were utilized to test overall model fit these suggested adequate fit of the model χ2 43 273 p 0 109 cfi 0 961 tli 0 941 rmsea 0 010 ci 0 000 0 018 since adequate fit was attained the individual parameter estimates could then be assessed in fig 2 the diarrheal occurrence variable was regressed on six wash variables three significant variables were identified at a 5 level and included refuse handling s 0 161 p 0 007 share sanitation s 0 060 p 0 023 and drinking water treatment s 0 043 p 0 025 the systemic inflammation variable was estimated from four symptom based variables and regressed on six wash variables and the diarrheal occurrence variable the loading estimates from the symptom based variables suggested a reliable estimation of the latent distribution three significant variables were identified at a 5 level and included diarrheal occurrence s 0 291 p 0 021 proper refuse handling s 0 184 p 0 012 and drinking water source s 0 003 p 0 005 explained variances for both the diarrheal occurrence variable and systemic inflammation variable were low r2 0 020 and r2 0 093 respectively fig 3 depicts the final se model output for the hypothesized relationships for the male population of children under five years of age the same four model fit statistics were utilized to test overall model fit these suggested adequate fit of the model χ2 23 334 p 0 894 cfi 1 000 tli 01 052 rmsea 0 000 ci 0 000 0 006 since adequate fit was attained the individual parameter estimates could then be assessed in fig 3 as before the diarrheal occurrence variable was regressed on six wash variables however only one variable was identified as significant at a 5 level which was type of sanitation s 0 113 p 0 016 the systemic inflammation variable was estimated from the same four symptom based variables and regressed on the same six wash variables and the diarrheal occurrence variable the loading estimates from the symptom based variables again suggested a reliable estimation of the latent distribution two significant variables were identified at a 5 level and included diarrheal occurrence s 0 319 p 0 004 and drinking water source s 0 142 p 0 022 the explained variances for both the diarrheal occurrence variable and systemic inflammation variable were again low r2 0 017 and r2 0 107 respectively fig 4 depicts the cumulative findings in the sex differences of significant environmental exposure factors associated with diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation females and males did not share any common significant variables correlated with diarrheal occurrences but did share two common significant variables correlated with systemic inflammation type of drinking water source and diarrheal occurrence 4 discussion 4 1 limitations this study has several limitations first the low reported occurrence of diarrhea and other illness variables was a limitation despite the fact that researchers pooled two years of survey data to increase the domain the latent variable approach was utilized to combine systemic inflammation based illness variables with low frequencies and a non parametric robust estimator was utilized for overall parameter estimation second the ghs has several sanitation variables absent e g hand washing which have been reported to be significantly associated with the occurrence of diarrhea our previous work suggests that various wash variables can mediate the relationship between other wash variables and health outcomes however these indirect effects are often small voth gaeddert et al 2019 voth gaeddert and oerther 2019 third biases may potentially arise when utilizing self reported symptoms as done for both diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation however subramanian and co workers subramanian et al 2009 suggest this may be less of a problem than originally thought finally we did not control for large scale events such as floods or droughts which may have occurred between 2014 and 2015 4 2 bivariate and binomial regression analyses the bivariate kruskal wallis analysis and binomial regression model identified that sex was not associated with or a significant predictor of diarrhea or systemic inflammation there was no binomial regression model for systemic inflammation however while the poor health outcomes did not statistically vary between sexes identifying whether variations exist between sexes for the wash variables that potentially contribute to the poor health outcomes is most important the bivariate analysis only identified one difference in statistically significant variables which was the distance of the sanitation facility was significant for males but not for females at a 5 level see table 4 sharing sanitation facilities and drinking water treatment were not identified as significant for either diarrhea or systemic inflammation across both sexes the binomial regression model for diarrhea identified refuse handling as statistically significant using all data however to fully assess the differences in the potential causes of both outcome variables and obtain an accurate measure of parameter estimates which account for indirect interactions with other variables the se models were tested 4 3 se models diarrhea between the female and male se models no statistically significant correlations between environmental factors and diarrheal occurrences were the same within the female se model three significant correlations were identified while within the male se model only one significant correlation was identified for females sharing sanitation facilities among families was correlated with reported diarrheal occurrences in the past three months among female children this supports the original hypothesis as well as recent literature kwiringira and co workers kwiringira et al 2014 reported on a qualitative study of gender differences and shared sanitation in uganda concluding females have higher health risks than males in association with sharing sanitation facilities baker and co workers baker et al 2016 reported findings from a multinational study global enteric multicenter study suggesting households who shared sanitation with three or more other households had a significantly higher probability of having a child female or male with diarrhea next an increase in frequency of water treatment as reported by the household was correlated with a decrease in diarrheal occurrences among female children this again supports the original hypothesis as well as recent literature on the positive impact of household water treatment on diarrheal occurrences among young children clasen 2015 however the literature is less clear on gender specific effects fischer walker and co workers fischer walker et al 2013 conducted a literature review of gender based analyses of diarrheal burdens and found 23 studies seven of which identified males as having statistically significant higher cases of diarrhea but with high heterogeneity between publication contexts finally the data suggested that an increase in the prevalence of proper refuse handling was correlated with an increase in reported diarrheal occurrences among female children counter to the original hypothesis but in agreement with the previous statistical tests frequencies within the refuse handling variable were investigated and the two primary response categories included removed by local authority or company classified as a more proper handling technique and household owned or managed refuse dump classified as a less proper handling technique however several studies suggest that the quality of refuse removal by local authorities can be poor henry et al 2006 zurbrügg 2003 while personal or informal handling of refuse can lead to better refuse handling rules set among household members as well as economic benefits for the entire household wilson et al 2006 among children in indonesia cronin and co workers cronin et al 2016 found that females had a higher odds of diarrhea as compared to males in regards to poor household waste disposal practices lastly the kruskal wallis test did not identify shared sanitation or drinking water treatment as statistically significant but a mann whitney u test did this may be attributed to the ranks and pooled variances for the two ordinal variables tested for males the only statistically significant variable for diarrheal occurrences was type of sanitation facility the data suggested that an increase in the prevalence of use of improved types of sanitation facilities was correlated with an increase in diarrheal occurrences among male children counter to the original hypothesis but in agreement with previous statistical tests upon further investigation of the frequencies in responses the majority of households either had a flush toilet classified as a more improved type of sanitation or a ventilated pit latrine classified as less improved furthermore there was a high covariance between the type of sanitation and the distance of sanitation to the household general field observations suggested that flush toilets were located more closely to the household than ventilated pit latrines but due to the lack of granularity within the sanitation distance question completely controlling for distance within the model likely did not occur further research is needed to separate the type versus distance sanitation relationship a previous study by pickering and co workers pickering et al 2012 demonstrated that the probability of high pathogen abundance in sanitation facilities was not dependent on the type of sanitation facility therefore a household possessing a flush toilet sanitation facility as compared to a ventilated pit latrine may have a decreased distance between a pathogen source and their child but with limited or no decrease in pathogen abundance 4 4 se models systemic inflammation between the female and male se models there were two statistically significant correlations between environmental factors and systemic inflammation that were the same in addition the female se model identified one more significant correlation that was not identified in the male se model for females an increase in prevalence of proper refuse handling was negatively correlated with systemic inflammation supporting the original hypothesis and in agreement with previous statistical tests this correlation appears in contrast with the counterintuitive finding between refuse handling and diarrheal occurrences in the female model and warrants further investigation prior studies have reported several different mechanistic pathways that may lead to systemic inflammation in children suggesting several pathways which are not related to pathogen exposures calderón garcidueñas et al 2009 copeland et al 2014 rodriguez hernandez et al 2013 furthermore several of these non pathogen contaminant sources reported such as environmental pollutants chemicals and drugs can be health concerns associated with refuse dumps fazzo et al 2017 therefore it may be possible to own a properly run household refuse dump in regard to pathogen management but still be exposed in different ways e g inhalation and to different types of harmful non pathogenic compounds e g chemicals toxins etc further research is needed on the complex refuse diarrhea systemic inflammation association the two shared variables among females and males which were correlated to systemic inflammation were the type of drinking water source and diarrheal occurrences the finding of an increase in diarrheal occurrences being correlated to an increase in systemic inflammation supported the original hypothesis and agreed with previous statistical tests recent work by kosek and co workers kosek et al 2017 has demonstrated several mechanistic pathways in which diarrhea causing pathogens can also increase intestinal permeability leading to systemic inflammation diarrhea is often associated with local intestinal inflammation and repeated bouts of diarrhea can lead to reduced intestinal integrity and intestinal immune dysfunction guerrant et al 2013 finally the other shared statistically significant variable with systemic inflammation was drinking water source however the data suggested that an increase in the prevalence of use of an improved type of water source was correlated with an increase in systemic inflammation among both sexes counter to the original hypothesis but in agreement with previous statistical tests again the frequencies of responses were investigated which identified that the majority of households reported either having water pumped onto the premises classified as an improved water source or were using a public tap classified as less improved further investigation should be undertaken in regard to water quality and the associated water sources factors such as informal pipe connections household water storage practices and water removal devices have been previously reported as potential issues associated with water source quality acharya et al 2018 clasen et al 2015 furthermore government provided public water sources have been demonstrated to be of general good quality in south africa department of water affairs 2012 therefore this finding warrants further investigation while this analysis is focused on wash factors health and gender items such as disease vulnerability differences and gender specific care practices have also been shown to influence child health barcellos et al 2014 ganatra and hirve 1994 studies in india suggest that males may be breastfed longer by mothers jayachandran and kuziemko 2011 and receive more health care benefits such as more immunizations and increased supplementation rates basu 1989 ganatra and hirve 1994 however many of these results of differences in care practices between females and males are not generalizable as other studies have failed to establish the same differential treatment patterns in females and males in different contexts deaton 2003 based on this study from the eastern cape as well as the heterogeneity in findings from previously reported child gender analyses the addition of a gender analysis module for future wash health studies is recommended many local and international organizations in south africa have work which falls under the direction of the 2016 south african national sanitation policy including the us agency for international development the world bank and save the children several organizations have previously expressed the need for targeted direction for their inhouse monitoring and evaluation programs to improve gender and sex sensitive implementation of wash programs voth gaeddert personal communication 2017 the tool demonstrated here offers a flexible assessment framework that can 1 be adapted to a wide range of wash projects 2 be easily interpreted by non statistical experts and 3 provide clarity on complex interactions among transmission pathways and barriers that occur in field interventions furthermore it can be deployed at pre intervention baseline to improve intervention selection and understanding gender disparities in a longitudinal framework bollen and curran 2006 or in a pre post post framework mun et al 2009 5 conclusion this study used se modeling to analyze national data specifically related to the eastern cape on the complex correlations of wash variables with diarrhea and systemic inflammation the results supported the notion that multiple exposure routes are present for both genders and that there are unique exposure routes for each gender further research should be undertaken to better understand the gender specific wash factors associated with the transmission of intestinal diseases field practitioners and community health workers should be sensitive to these unique and complex associations lastly while these differences warrant further investigation the data generally support the policies outlined in the south african national sanitation policy 2016 but aim to begin to provide insight on how to translate these general policies into specific practices utilizing a data driven

context of the larger system finally recent literature has suggested there are significant gender inequality gaps among females and males related to nutritional status and caregiver decision making on child health in south africa and other countries with high inequality bornstein and putnick 2016 unicef 2017 zere and mcintyre 2003 a multigroup se model analysis was used in this study to investigate specific differences of associated factors between females and males to reduce the population of this study to a level conducive to the statistical approach while also maintaining a representative population for the province the eastern cape was selected selection criteria included high levels of reported morbidity diarrhea fever and cough and local informal observation data on sex differences in child rearing practices the study population was then divided based on reported sex female male as a proxy for differential gender roles and a se model group analysis was conducted in this study the term sex refers to population differences determined by genitals while the term gender refers to population differences determined by socio political status delphy 1993 this study utilizes secondary data from the 2014 and 2015 general household survey ghs datasets and the statistical framework of se modeling to test the following questions among specific sexes of children under five years of age in the eastern cape 1 which wash variables water sanitation and refuse are associated with diarrheal occurrences 2 which wash variables are associated with systemic inflammation 3 do diarrheal occurrences mediate the correlation between wash variables and systemic inflammation and 4 is there a difference between females and males in the type of wash variables associated with either diarrheal occurrences or systemic inflammation 2 methods 2 1 study setting the eastern cape has a population of 6 7 million residents 12 1 of the national population making it the third most populous province after gauteng and kwazulu natal statistics south africa 2017a the province is predominately agrarian with a high proportion of households practicing subsistence agriculture despite the high number of people engaged in agriculture the sector only contributed 2 to the provincial economy in 2016 with manufacturing primarily vehicles contributing 11 trade and industrial policy strategies 2016 furthermore wages in the province were below the national average in 2015 with a total monthly average income of zar 7513 i e zar 4001 below the national average which is second lowest among all provinces statistics south africa 2017b in the eastern cape coverage of household water sanitation and hygiene wash resources suggests that 84 8 of households in the province have access to improved sanitation and 75 7 of households have piped water in their dwelling however 6 5 of residents in the province either have no toilet facility or use bucket toilets statistics south africa 2017a 2 2 study design and sample eastern cape provincial data utilized to test the hypotheses in this study were aggregated from the 2014 and 2015 south african ghs n 2930 the ghs is an annual cross sectional national survey which is also representative at the provincial level statistics south africa 2015 2014 it is administered by local trained fieldworkers to mothers in household settings since 2002 the survey has collected data on diarrheal occurrences in addition to other diseases geospatial metrics local environmental factors and socioeconomic and demographic variables in this study the 2014 and 2015 ghs data were pooled to increase the sample size of a small domain variable diarrhea with the aim to improve the robustness of the data during the pooling of the data specific criteria were followed 1 the two years of data were each drawn from independent sampling frames 2 there was minimal time difference in sampling less than one year as this supported the low probability of changing characteristics in the underlying population and 3 the variables used in each survey did not change in structure or format the study population was then divided into two groups female n 1460 and male n 1470 for analysis the dataset can be accessed online at https www datafirst uct ac za dataportal statistics south africa 2015 2014 2 3 variables table 1 presents the list of variables and associated questions drawn from the ghs survey systemic inflammation a hypothesized late onset characteristic of eed was a latent variable computed using factor analysis and a set of self reported health problems displayed by children each health problem or indicator variable was hypothesized to increase in prevalence among children with systemic inflammation these variables included severe cough sexually transmitted diseases std pneumonia and bronchitis the list was developed based on a literature review and the input of local and international medical experts but it was limited to the available variables collected by the ghs severe cough pneumonia and bronchitis have been suggested to increase among patients with systemic inflammation as both a cause and consequence either due to an increase in acquiring a new infection or presenting symptoms during a weaker infection wood et al 2012 similarly presenting symptoms and subsequently diagnosing an std during the acute primary infection stage is more likely among children who already have systemic inflammation masson et al 2015 posavad and koelle 1997 a similar variable was employed in the mal ed study and reported by kosek et al 2017 they used a composite variable which included diarrhea fever and respiratory infection the term systemic inflammation will be used in this paper to denote the latent variable generated by the identified proxies listed above furthermore utilizing the latent variable approach provided a method to leverage low frequency variables in a mathematically appropriate manner diarrheal occurrence was the other outcome variable incorporated into the se model as a mediating factor diarrhea was used as a proxy for the early onset characteristics of eed namely local intestinal inflammation and intestinal wall permeability as these variables were not available in the dataset guerrant and co workers guerrant et al 2013 reviewed the similarities and differences between diarrhea and local intestinal inflammation and intestinal wall permeability wash variables included have been identified in previous literature to impact child diarrhea and systemic inflammation and can be divided into three categories infrastructure or devices operation characteristics and geospatial location infrastructure and devices included drinking water source drinking water treatment and type of sanitation cairncross et al 2010 ngure et al 2014 operation characteristics included refuse handling and sharing sanitation fazzo et al 2017 fuller et al 2014 finally geospatial location included distance of drinking water source and distance of sanitation pickering and davis 2012 presented several considerations regarding the relationship among distance and geospatial location of water and sanitation infrastructure and the impacts on the prevalence of sickness especially in poor households these relationships include 1 a reduced chance of spreading pathogens present in latrines to the household with increased distance 2 a reduced chance of spreading pathogens with less open defecation or defecating in a bucket with decreased distance of latrines and 3 reduced chance of contaminating water during transport from a source to a home where it is consumed when the distance the water must be transported is minimized 2 4 statistical analyses basic descriptive statistics were generated for each variable an initial bivariate analysis non parametric kruskal wallis ratio test was conducted and a multigroup structural equation se model was tested with the data to better understand the data and contributions of the sem approach kruskal wallis tests were conducted for all variables in the hypothesized se model for both outcomes using three datasets all children females and males to assess each factor s relationship with systemic inflammation an aggregate score was used based on the summation of the binary indicator variables in addition a single binomial regression model was developed and included diarrhea as the outcome along with all wash variables and the sex variable the all children dataset was used and the iteratively reweighted least squares estimator applied all analyses were conducted in r v3 4 se modeling has previously been applied in the assessment of a community health intervention divelbiss et al 2013 a multimethod community health assessment voth gaeddert et al 2018a and a multi model assessment of enteric dysfunction voth gaeddert et al 2018b briefly in this study the se model contained diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation as mediating and outcome variables respectively and were both regressed on by a hypothesized set of wash variables these wash variables as described above were identified in previous literature to be associated with diarrheal occurrences and were therefore regressed on this variable to test if diarrheal occurrences may then lead to systemic inflammation and if any wash variables may directly influence systemic inflammation without causing diarrhea all wash variables were regressed on systemic inflammation fig 1 depicts the hypothesized se model for this study in the figure rectangles represent observed variables the oval represents the latent variable and arrows are hypothesized correlations the primary outcome systemic inflammation the latent variable in the model was estimated from a set of symptom based variables hypothesized to be more prevalent among children with systemic inflammation factor analysis was chosen over an index summation calculation for the estimation of systemic inflammation variable based on the hypothesized causal relationships between the underlying issue systemic inflammation and the subsequent outcomes of that issue reported symptoms to test the fit of the data to a hypothesized model a set of model fit statistics are utilized these include chi square χ2 p value 0 05 confirmatory factor index cfi 0 90 tucker lewis index tli 0 90 and the root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 08 if the model fit statistics suggest adequate fit of the data to the hypothesized model then the parameter estimates within the model can be analyzed the parameter estimates in the model are read as regression parameter estimates and are interpreted as follows a one unit increase in the independent variable is correlated with a shift in the dependent variable equal to that of the parameter estimate all independent variables were categorical or dichotomous therefore a one unit increase or just increase here on in an independent variable such as the type of sanitation facility is interpreted as improving from one type of sanitation facility to the next best type e g improving from a ventilated pit latrine with cement flooring to a flush toilet both standardized s and unstandardized u parameter estimates are reported to investigate differences between female and male based se models the se model group analysis method was utilized grace 2006 rosseel 2017 the lavaan package of r 3 3 2 was utilized for the analysis 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics table 2 and table 3 display the results of the descriptive statistics for both quantitative and qualitative variables qualitative variables were quantified by rank order for analysis based on world health organization and us agency for international development guidelines who unicef joint monitoring programme for water sanitation and hygiene jmp 2017 the dataset included n 2930 children 50 2 female n 1460 and 49 8 male n 1470 overall means for the self reported illness occurrence variables were low suggesting few households reported children with these illnesses the most common being the flu or respiratory illness the means and modes within the descriptive statistics suggested that the ethnicity of the households was primarily black with little formal education household members owned their own refuse dump while defecation occurred in ventilated improved pit latrines located in the yard not often shared with other families finally on average water was obtained at a public tap 201 500 m from the household and was almost never treated once brought into the household however the analysis suggested the associations between these variables and the health outcome variables differed between females and males 3 2 bivariate and binomial regression analyses full data for the bivariate analysis is presented in table 4 the bivariate analyses identified the same five of seven variables significant with diarrhea across the three datasets all children females males these included distance of sanitation type of sanitation proper refuse handling dist of drinking water source and drinking water source for systemic inflammation six of eight variables were significant for the all children and male datasets while in the female dataset only five were significant significant variables for all three datasets included type of sanitation proper refuse handling dist of drinking water source drinking water source and diarrhea while distance of sanitation was not statistically significant within the female dataset the binomial regression model on diarrhea did not identify sex as statistically significant but did identify refuse handling as statistically significant see table 5 3 3 se models diarrhea and systemic inflammation fig 2 depicts the final se model output for the hypothesized relationships for the female population of children under five years of age four model fit statistics were utilized to test overall model fit these suggested adequate fit of the model χ2 43 273 p 0 109 cfi 0 961 tli 0 941 rmsea 0 010 ci 0 000 0 018 since adequate fit was attained the individual parameter estimates could then be assessed in fig 2 the diarrheal occurrence variable was regressed on six wash variables three significant variables were identified at a 5 level and included refuse handling s 0 161 p 0 007 share sanitation s 0 060 p 0 023 and drinking water treatment s 0 043 p 0 025 the systemic inflammation variable was estimated from four symptom based variables and regressed on six wash variables and the diarrheal occurrence variable the loading estimates from the symptom based variables suggested a reliable estimation of the latent distribution three significant variables were identified at a 5 level and included diarrheal occurrence s 0 291 p 0 021 proper refuse handling s 0 184 p 0 012 and drinking water source s 0 003 p 0 005 explained variances for both the diarrheal occurrence variable and systemic inflammation variable were low r2 0 020 and r2 0 093 respectively fig 3 depicts the final se model output for the hypothesized relationships for the male population of children under five years of age the same four model fit statistics were utilized to test overall model fit these suggested adequate fit of the model χ2 23 334 p 0 894 cfi 1 000 tli 01 052 rmsea 0 000 ci 0 000 0 006 since adequate fit was attained the individual parameter estimates could then be assessed in fig 3 as before the diarrheal occurrence variable was regressed on six wash variables however only one variable was identified as significant at a 5 level which was type of sanitation s 0 113 p 0 016 the systemic inflammation variable was estimated from the same four symptom based variables and regressed on the same six wash variables and the diarrheal occurrence variable the loading estimates from the symptom based variables again suggested a reliable estimation of the latent distribution two significant variables were identified at a 5 level and included diarrheal occurrence s 0 319 p 0 004 and drinking water source s 0 142 p 0 022 the explained variances for both the diarrheal occurrence variable and systemic inflammation variable were again low r2 0 017 and r2 0 107 respectively fig 4 depicts the cumulative findings in the sex differences of significant environmental exposure factors associated with diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation females and males did not share any common significant variables correlated with diarrheal occurrences but did share two common significant variables correlated with systemic inflammation type of drinking water source and diarrheal occurrence 4 discussion 4 1 limitations this study has several limitations first the low reported occurrence of diarrhea and other illness variables was a limitation despite the fact that researchers pooled two years of survey data to increase the domain the latent variable approach was utilized to combine systemic inflammation based illness variables with low frequencies and a non parametric robust estimator was utilized for overall parameter estimation second the ghs has several sanitation variables absent e g hand washing which have been reported to be significantly associated with the occurrence of diarrhea our previous work suggests that various wash variables can mediate the relationship between other wash variables and health outcomes however these indirect effects are often small voth gaeddert et al 2019 voth gaeddert and oerther 2019 third biases may potentially arise when utilizing self reported symptoms as done for both diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation however subramanian and co workers subramanian et al 2009 suggest this may be less of a problem than originally thought finally we did not control for large scale events such as floods or droughts which may have occurred between 2014 and 2015 4 2 bivariate and binomial regression analyses the bivariate kruskal wallis analysis and binomial regression model identified that sex was not associated with or a significant predictor of diarrhea or systemic inflammation there was no binomial regression model for systemic inflammation however while the poor health outcomes did not statistically vary between sexes identifying whether variations exist between sexes for the wash variables that potentially contribute to the poor health outcomes is most important the bivariate analysis only identified one difference in statistically significant variables which was the distance of the sanitation facility was significant for males but not for females at a 5 level see table 4 sharing sanitation facilities and drinking water treatment were not identified as significant for either diarrhea or systemic inflammation across both sexes the binomial regression model for diarrhea identified refuse handling as statistically significant using all data however to fully assess the differences in the potential causes of both outcome variables and obtain an accurate measure of parameter estimates which account for indirect interactions with other variables the se models were tested 4 3 se models diarrhea between the female and male se models no statistically significant correlations between environmental factors and diarrheal occurrences were the same within the female se model three significant correlations were identified while within the male se model only one significant correlation was identified for females sharing sanitation facilities among families was correlated with reported diarrheal occurrences in the past three months among female children this supports the original hypothesis as well as recent literature kwiringira and co workers kwiringira et al 2014 reported on a qualitative study of gender differences and shared sanitation in uganda concluding females have higher health risks than males in association with sharing sanitation facilities baker and co workers baker et al 2016 reported findings from a multinational study global enteric multicenter study suggesting households who shared sanitation with three or more other households had a significantly higher probability of having a child female or male with diarrhea next an increase in frequency of water treatment as reported by the household was correlated with a decrease in diarrheal occurrences among female children this again supports the original hypothesis as well as recent literature on the positive impact of household water treatment on diarrheal occurrences among young children clasen 2015 however the literature is less clear on gender specific effects fischer walker and co workers fischer walker et al 2013 conducted a literature review of gender based analyses of diarrheal burdens and found 23 studies seven of which identified males as having statistically significant higher cases of diarrhea but with high heterogeneity between publication contexts finally the data suggested that an increase in the prevalence of proper refuse handling was correlated with an increase in reported diarrheal occurrences among female children counter to the original hypothesis but in agreement with the previous statistical tests frequencies within the refuse handling variable were investigated and the two primary response categories included removed by local authority or company classified as a more proper handling technique and household owned or managed refuse dump classified as a less proper handling technique however several studies suggest that the quality of refuse removal by local authorities can be poor henry et al 2006 zurbrügg 2003 while personal or informal handling of refuse can lead to better refuse handling rules set among household members as well as economic benefits for the entire household wilson et al 2006 among children in indonesia cronin and co workers cronin et al 2016 found that females had a higher odds of diarrhea as compared to males in regards to poor household waste disposal practices lastly the kruskal wallis test did not identify shared sanitation or drinking water treatment as statistically significant but a mann whitney u test did this may be attributed to the ranks and pooled variances for the two ordinal variables tested for males the only statistically significant variable for diarrheal occurrences was type of sanitation facility the data suggested that an increase in the prevalence of use of improved types of sanitation facilities was correlated with an increase in diarrheal occurrences among male children counter to the original hypothesis but in agreement with previous statistical tests upon further investigation of the frequencies in responses the majority of households either had a flush toilet classified as a more improved type of sanitation or a ventilated pit latrine classified as less improved furthermore there was a high covariance between the type of sanitation and the distance of sanitation to the household general field observations suggested that flush toilets were located more closely to the household than ventilated pit latrines but due to the lack of granularity within the sanitation distance question completely controlling for distance within the model likely did not occur further research is needed to separate the type versus distance sanitation relationship a previous study by pickering and co workers pickering et al 2012 demonstrated that the probability of high pathogen abundance in sanitation facilities was not dependent on the type of sanitation facility therefore a household possessing a flush toilet sanitation facility as compared to a ventilated pit latrine may have a decreased distance between a pathogen source and their child but with limited or no decrease in pathogen abundance 4 4 se models systemic inflammation between the female and male se models there were two statistically significant correlations between environmental factors and systemic inflammation that were the same in addition the female se model identified one more significant correlation that was not identified in the male se model for females an increase in prevalence of proper refuse handling was negatively correlated with systemic inflammation supporting the original hypothesis and in agreement with previous statistical tests this correlation appears in contrast with the counterintuitive finding between refuse handling and diarrheal occurrences in the female model and warrants further investigation prior studies have reported several different mechanistic pathways that may lead to systemic inflammation in children suggesting several pathways which are not related to pathogen exposures calderón garcidueñas et al 2009 copeland et al 2014 rodriguez hernandez et al 2013 furthermore several of these non pathogen contaminant sources reported such as environmental pollutants chemicals and drugs can be health concerns associated with refuse dumps fazzo et al 2017 therefore it may be possible to own a properly run household refuse dump in regard to pathogen management but still be exposed in different ways e g inhalation and to different types of harmful non pathogenic compounds e g chemicals toxins etc further research is needed on the complex refuse diarrhea systemic inflammation association the two shared variables among females and males which were correlated to systemic inflammation were the type of drinking water source and diarrheal occurrences the finding of an increase in diarrheal occurrences being correlated to an increase in systemic inflammation supported the original hypothesis and agreed with previous statistical tests recent work by kosek and co workers kosek et al 2017 has demonstrated several mechanistic pathways in which diarrhea causing pathogens can also increase intestinal permeability leading to systemic inflammation diarrhea is often associated with local intestinal inflammation and repeated bouts of diarrhea can lead to reduced intestinal integrity and intestinal immune dysfunction guerrant et al 2013 finally the other shared statistically significant variable with systemic inflammation was drinking water source however the data suggested that an increase in the prevalence of use of an improved type of water source was correlated with an increase in systemic inflammation among both sexes counter to the original hypothesis but in agreement with previous statistical tests again the frequencies of responses were investigated which identified that the majority of households reported either having water pumped onto the premises classified as an improved water source or were using a public tap classified as less improved further investigation should be undertaken in regard to water quality and the associated water sources factors such as informal pipe connections household water storage practices and water removal devices have been previously reported as potential issues associated with water source quality acharya et al 2018 clasen et al 2015 furthermore government provided public water sources have been demonstrated to be of general good quality in south africa department of water affairs 2012 therefore this finding warrants further investigation while this analysis is focused on wash factors health and gender items such as disease vulnerability differences and gender specific care practices have also been shown to influence child health barcellos et al 2014 ganatra and hirve 1994 studies in india suggest that males may be breastfed longer by mothers jayachandran and kuziemko 2011 and receive more health care benefits such as more immunizations and increased supplementation rates basu 1989 ganatra and hirve 1994 however many of these results of differences in care practices between females and males are not generalizable as other studies have failed to establish the same differential treatment patterns in females and males in different contexts deaton 2003 based on this study from the eastern cape as well as the heterogeneity in findings from previously reported child gender analyses the addition of a gender analysis module for future wash health studies is recommended many local and international organizations in south africa have work which falls under the direction of the 2016 south african national sanitation policy including the us agency for international development the world bank and save the children several organizations have previously expressed the need for targeted direction for their inhouse monitoring and evaluation programs to improve gender and sex sensitive implementation of wash programs voth gaeddert personal communication 2017 the tool demonstrated here offers a flexible assessment framework that can 1 be adapted to a wide range of wash projects 2 be easily interpreted by non statistical experts and 3 provide clarity on complex interactions among transmission pathways and barriers that occur in field interventions furthermore it can be deployed at pre intervention baseline to improve intervention selection and understanding gender disparities in a longitudinal framework bollen and curran 2006 or in a pre post post framework mun et al 2009 5 conclusion this study used se modeling to analyze national data specifically related to the eastern cape on the complex correlations of wash variables with diarrhea and systemic inflammation the results supported the notion that multiple exposure routes are present for both genders and that there are unique exposure routes for each gender further research should be undertaken to better understand the gender specific wash factors associated with the transmission of intestinal diseases field practitioners and community health workers should be sensitive to these unique and complex associations lastly while these differences warrant further investigation the data generally support the policies outlined in the south african national sanitation policy 2016 but aim to begin to provide insight on how to translate these general policies into specific practices utilizing a data driven gender specific approach may help increase the probability of a sustainable positive impact declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

18356,real time monitoring of subsurface temperature profiles is a promising approach to resolving natural source zone depletion nszd rates for shallow petroleum liquids herein a new single stick computational method for transforming temperature data into nszd rates is advanced the method is predicated on subsurface temperatures being a function of surface heating and cooling and the heat associated with nszd given subsurface temperature at two points a system of two equation two unknown is used to resolve nszd rates mathematical formulations and computational algorithms are validated through computational tests showing near perfect agreement between prescribed and predicted nszd heating and observed and predicted subsurface temperatures the method is applied to temperature data from five field sites results include lower nszd rates in areas where petroleum liquids are absent by a factor of 0 5 7 5 as compared to background correction methods while the single stick method provides the lowest rate in unimpacted areas it also provides reasonable rates as compared to two of three background correction methods in addition the single stick method yields a coefficient of variation equal to 6 in a triplicate analysis and reasonable estimates of nszd in lnapl impacted areas without background corrected data graphical abstract image 1 keywords lnapl biodegradation nszd rate subsurface temperature non background correction 1 introduction in almost every part of the world vast amounts of petroleum have been produced transported refined stored and or used as fuel or feedstock inadvertently large amounts of petroleum liquids have been released into soil and groundwater daghio et al 2017 doshi et al 2018 implementation of appropriate active remediation is a demanding task for cleaning up contaminated sites to determine the appropriate time for ceasing engineered remedial efforts characterizing lnapl remediation endpoints is vital sookhak lari et al 2018 fortunately natural losses via biodegradation help reduce the risks associated with subsurface petroleum liquids in the later stages of remediation lifecycle mahler et al 2012 sale et al 2018 herein subsurface petroleum liquids are referred to as light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls and the processes controlling losses of lnapl bodies fig 1 is referred to as natural source zone depletion nszd nszd is a part of the natural short term i e decades to centuries biological organic carbon cycle sookhak lari et al 2019 wherein a large fraction of organic carbon introduced into the shallow subsurface settings is returned to the atmosphere as gases amos et al 2005 following atekwana and atekwana 2010 irianni renno et al 2016 and garg et al 2017 released lnapls commonly reside about the water table available electron acceptors are depleted by percent concentrations of lnapl and methanogenesis often ensues albeit slow methanogenesis has the advantage over other electron acceptor based nszd processes of not being limited by the availability of primary electrons acceptors including o2 fe 3 and so 4 2 generation of nszd co2 and ch4 leads to exceedances of aqueous phase gas solubility and upward fluxes of co2 and ch4 through the unsaturated zone typically methane encounters a downward flux of oxygen amos et al 2005 and is exothermally converted into co2 by methanotrophs stockwell 2015 irianni renno et al 2016 garg et al 2017 under select conditions volatile organic compounds vocs may dominate methane in consuming the downward flux of oxygen davis et al 2005 sookhak lari et al 2019 comprehensive information regarding modeling approaches for physiochemical processes that affect nszd rates can be found in sookhak lari et al 2019 initial efforts to quantify nszd rates focused on quantifying nszd gas fluxes given lnapl nszd rates of 1000 to 10 000 l ha year upward co2 gas fluxes are on the order of 0 11 1 1 m year johnson and lundegard 2006 used soil gas concentrations and fick s law to estimate gas fluxes sihota et al 2011 employed dynamic flux chambers at ground surface to quantify co2 efflux and mccoy et al 2015 advanced the use of co2 traps at ground surface to quantify co2 efflux a common limitation of surface gas flux methods is that measurements are typically made over brief periods in systems where gas fluxes can be dynamic due to barometric pumping and or transient soil moisture davis et al 2005 karimi askarani et al 2018 furthermore the accuracy of gas flux based nszd rates can be constrained by non uniform gas fluxes in porous media associated with heterogeneous gas phase diffusion coefficients and soil permeability for gases early work using heat production to resolve reaction rates in subsurface environments is presented in harries and ritchie 1981 and johnston et al 2008 more recently temperature based approaches for quantifying lnapl nszd rates have been advanced by sweeney and ririe 2014 sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 published temperature based approaches involve 1 continuously measuring vertical temperature profiles in background and lnapl impacted areas 2 isolating nszd heat from heat associated with surface heating by subtracting background temperatures from temperature in lnapl impacted areas 3 conducting an energy balance to resolve nszd energy e g w m2 and 4 estimating nszd rates by dividing nszd energy by the estimated nszd heat of reaction continuous real time temperature monitoring addresses issues with temporally sparse gas flux measurements karimi askarani et al 2018 and thermal properties of subsurface media are arguably far more uniform than gas phase diffusion coefficients and soil permeability the primary limitation of published methods for transforming temperature to nszd rates is that background correction for surface heating and cooling at lnapl impacted locations constrains the accuracy of reported values manifestations of flawed background corrections can include occasionally implausible nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl negative nszd rates and or improbably large nszd rates in areas with lnapl ideally background locations need to be similar to the lnapl impacted locations through time with respect to all factors controlling surface heating and cooling including albedo infiltration evaporation of precipitation and incident radiation to name a few as an example a background location with asphalt and direct sunlight is likely to yield flawed background correction data for surface heating and cooling in an lnapl impacted area with direct sunlight and a natural vegetative cover additionally at a background location the depth of the vadose zone needs to be similar to that at lnapl impacted locations while concerns can be raised with respect to the accuracy of all methods for quantifying nszd rates we can be confident that nszd frequently plays an important role in constraining the extent of lnapl and the associated risks herein we explore a new single stick method for converting real time continuous temperature data into nszd rates in which temperature profiles of a single location are used to estimate surface heating and cooling and subsurface heating associated with nszd a novel mathematical method is advanced the validity of the method is tested methods for converting temperature into nszd rates are compared using data from three field sites and merits limitations of the single stick method are evaluated the motivation for this study is to try to develop an acceptable method for estimating nszd rates from temperature data and thereby to gain greater confidence in our emerging reliance on nszd to address lnapls in soil and groundwater 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model the two primary heat sources sinks in a media impacted by lnapl are surface heating and cooling and subsurface nszd processes driving surface heating and cooling include incidental solar radiation black body radiation incident precipitation and evaporative cooling of soil water to name a few heat moves into the subsurface when the net surficial inflow of energy is greater than the loss of energy conversely heat moves out of the subsurface when the energy loss is greater than energy input jury and horton 2004 hillel 2013 general reactions associated with subsurface nszd are presented in table 1 following johnson and lundegard 2006 decane is used as representative model petroleum hydrocarbon the first reaction 1 is mediated by methanogens under anaerobic conditions producing ch4 and co2 methanogenesis typically occurs in and about the space where lnapls are present irianni et al 2016 garg et al 2017 while the exergonic δ g r o value for reaction 1 favors the forward reaction the δ h r o value is positive indicating an endothermic reaction in the second reaction 2 methanotrophs aerobically oxidize methane into co2 and h2o oxidation of ch4 occurs above the lnapl body at a vertical position where the outward flux of ch4 meets an inward flux of atmospheric o2 notably the inward flux of oxygen can vary with time due to temporally varying effective oxygen diffusion coefficient controlled by soil water content barometric pumping and water table fluctuations karimi askarani et al 2018 reaction 2 oxidation of methane provides the primary source of heat for nszd following sookhak lari et al 2019 under select conditions nszd can be dominated by processes other than methanogenesis 2 2 derivation the following section advances a solution for estimating nszd rates as a function of temperatures measured along a vertical subsurface profile at a single location this method is referred to as the single stick method all other current methods of transforming temperature to nszd rates rely on background temperature corrections as described in sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 following carslaw and jaeger 1959 jury and horton 2004 and hillel 2013 the governing equation for conductive heat transfer is 1 x k x t x y k y t y z k z t z ρ c t t where k ml t3θ is thermal conductivity c l2 t2θ is specific heat capacity t θ is temperature t t is time ρ m l3 is sediment density and x y z l are spatial coordinates as shown in fig 2 the surface heat source sink q s m t3 occurs at x 0 the subsurface heat source sink q s s m t3 occurs at a temporally varying position x x at any point in the domain temperature is a function of the temporal values of q s q s s and x additional assumptions used to derive a solution include 1 surface and subsurface heat sources sinks can be approximated as planar features 2 thermal properties of soil are independent of position direction temperature and time 3 horizontal heat fluxes are negligible stockwell 2015 4 temporally varying surface and subsurface heat source sink can be approximated using a succession of steady state i e daily values 5 the surface heating and cooling term addresses all processes controlling surface heating and cooling including but not limited to solar radiation black body radiation incident precipitations evaporative cooling and composting shallow soil organic compounds 6 reactions are assumed to be occurring instantaneously at location x x and rapidly compared to gas transport times in the soil profile davis et al 2009 7 the subsurface heat source sink q s

precipitation or dissolution of minerals or changes in thermodynamic states do not contribute significantly to subsurface heating and cooling karimi askarani et al 2018 9 geothermal temperature gradients are negligible stockwell 2015 karimi askarani et al 2018 10 observed nearly constant temperatures at depth are the basis for the initial temperature condition 11 the energy produced from mineralization of decane is representative of the energy produced through nszd of the hydrocarbons of concern 2 3 solution applying the stated assumptions the governing equation reduces to 2 2 t x 2 1 κ t t boundary and initial conditions include 3 q s κ d t d x x 0 4 t x t t 0 5 t x 0 t 0 where t 0 is initial temperature and κ k ρ c is thermal diffusivity l2 t note that the value of t 0 is an initial seed value i e nearly constant temperatures at depth used to condition the model the model is run using the seed value t 0 for a conditioning period and the results are discarded to diminish the effect of initial temperature value a solution for eq 2 is obtained by superimposing separate solutions for temperatures associated with q s and q s s following carslaw and jeager 1959 a solution for temperature as a function of q s is 6 t x t t 0 2 q s κ κ t π e x p x 2 4 κ t x 2 e r f c x 4 κ t eq 6 satisfies all conditions of eqs 3 5 again following carslaw and jeager 1959 using the fundamental solution of heat equation that is integrated over a plane and through time the solution of eq 2 for temperature as a function of q s s at x is 7 t x t t 0 q s s ρ c t π κ e x p x x 2 4 κ t

to satisfy a zero flux condition at x 0 carslaw and jeager 1959 the first term on the right hand side of eq 7 accounts for the real subsurface nszd heat source the second term in eq 7 is an imaginary source located in imaginary space at a position equidistant to the real subsurface heat source above the ground surface summation of eqs 6 and 7 yields 8 t x t t 0 2 q s κ κ t π e x p x 2 4 κ t x 2 e r f c x 4 κ t q s s ρ c t π κ e x p x x 2 4 κ t x x 2 κ e r f c x x 4 κ t q s s ρ c t π κ e x p x x 2 4 κ t x x 2 κ e r f c x x 4 κ t note that eq 8 satisfies a single boundary condition at ground surface which is the combination of two boundary conditions in more detail eq 8 is achieved by superimposing two equations eq 6 and eq 7 each of which has their own boundary condition including 1 q s κ d t d x x 0 that is satisfied by eq 6 and 2 a zero flux condition at the ground surface κ d t d x x 0 0 that is satisfied by eq 7 in net the combination of real surface and subsurface heat sources and an imaginary subsurface heat source leads to a mathematical framework where nszd heat can leave the real model domain at x 0 a solution accounting for temporal variations in q s q s s and x is obtained using a succession of steady states 9 t x t t 0 i 1 n q s i q s i 1 f x t t i 1 q s s i g x t t i 1 x i q s s i 1 g x t t i 1 x i 1 where q s q s s and x are assumed constant between consecutive time steps t n 1 t t n and 10 f x t t i 1 2 κ κ t t i 1 π e x p x 2 4 κ t t i 1 x 2 e r f c x 4 κ t t i 1 11 g x t t i 1 x i 1 ρ c t t i 1 π κ e x p x x i 2 4 κ t t i 1 x x i 2 κ e r f c x

calculation marches through time using time steps i e day in which fluxes are constant by measuring temperature in the subsurface at two different positions fig 2 eq 9 can be solved in the following two equation two unknown system for determining the values of q s and q s s 12 t x 1 t i 1 n q s i q s i 1 f x 1 t t i 1 q s s i g x 1 t t i 1 x i q s s i 1 g x 1 t t i 1 x i 1 t x 2 t i 1 n q s i q s

finally the values of subsurface heat source q s s are converted to nszd rates on a volumetric basis using 13 n s z d q s s δ h d e c a n e ρ d e c a n e where n s z d is the rate of nszd l t δ h d e c a n e is the enthalpy of complete mineralization ml2 t2 mol and ρ d e c a n e is the molar density of decane 5 14 mol l 2 4 algorithm estimates of nszd rates n s z d through time are obtained using an algorithm programmed in matlab the mathworks inc natick massachusetts the primary input in this algorithm is vertical profiles of real time subsurface temperatures measured in lnapl impacted areas through time measured temperatures at any vertical position in the subsurface are averaged on a daily basis key steps for transforming daily average temperature data to nszd rates using this algorithm are illustrated in fig 3 in more detail 1 the daily average of measured subsurface temperatures thermal properties of soil profile and number of positions for evaluating the subsurface heat source are inputs to the program 2 in a fixed time step i the algorithm selects a position for subsurface heat source x j 3 a system of two equations eq 12 is solved for determining the values of q s j i and q s s j i based on the selected position for the subsurface heat source 4 the simulated temperature distribution t p r d is obtained using eq 9 5 the conformity of simulated temperature distribution t p r d to the observed temperature distribution t o b s is evaluated using a r 2 value 6 after the subsurface heat source is evaluated at all specified positions j n the algorithm proceeds to the next step otherwise it reverts to step 2 to consider another position for the subsurface heat source 7 in a fixed time step i the values of q s i q s s i and x are resolved based on the simulated temperature profile with best conformity 8 lastly the estimated value of the subsurface nszd heat source is converted into an nszd rate using eq 13 9 the program iterates through time until all of the temperature data have been transformed into nszd rates 2 5 confirmation of solution and algorithm the following sections describe three approaches used to test the validity of the solution and computational algorithm 2 5 1 numerical model test a two step process was used to test the validity of the analytical solution eq 8 and to check the computational algorithm under ideal conditions wherein all assumptions are applied firstly daily prescribed values for q s and q s s were imposed on the surface and in the subsurface of a soil profile i e all assumptions are held modeled using a finite element approach programmed in matlab to simulate a temperature distribution throughout the soil profile for a 50 day period fig 4 secondly the single stick model was employed to estimate q s and q s s using the simulated temperatures of the soil profile agreement between imposed and estimated values of q s and q s s are used to evaluate the validity of the mathematical solution and the matlab code model performance is assessed using 1 root mean square error rmse 2 coefficient of determination r2 3 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 4 index of agreement d willmott 1981 5 percent error pe and 6 mean μ and standard deviation σ of residuals observed minus modeled 2 5 2 comparison of observed and single stick derived fitting temperature profiles this section is dedicated to investigate how close the derived fitting temperature profiles by single stick method are to the observed temperatures herein the derived fit to actual temperatures are obtained by substituting the single stick estimations of q s q s s and x into eq 9 the ability of estimated q s q s s and x to reproduce a close fit to observed subsurface temperatures provides an additional mean of evaluating the validity of the mathematical solution and the matlab code 2 5 3 triplicate test three temperature monitoring sticks were installed in a lnapl area site 4 approximately 2 m apart in an equilateral triangle the triplicate values from single stick method and the values derived from the co2 trap method at a different field site mccoy 2015 are used to evaluate the coefficient of variation the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value due to local spatial variations and measurement accuracy 2 6 nszd rate 2 6 1 comparison of single stick and background correction methods the merits of the single stick computational approach are evaluated by comparing results from three field sites sites 1 2 and 3 using single stick and background correction methods background correction methods include methods presented in 1 sale et al 2015 2 warren and bekins 2015 and 3 karimi askarani et al 2018 background correction methods are predicated on using real time subsurface temperature data at a representative background no lnapl location to isolate heat associated with surface heating and cooling from heat associated with nszd in addition since each site considered in this study has two background locations applications of the background correction method include considering one background location as an lnapl impacted location and the other background location as a background location nszd rates at background locations using both background correction and single stick methods are calculated to provide a basis for evaluating the ability of all methods to capture ideally zero nszd rates at background locations 2 6 2 nszd rate at a lnapl impacted location in a site with no background data to show the main advantage of the single stick method using estimation of nszd rates in lnapl areas with no need for background correction the nszd rate at a lnapl impacted location in a former refinery site 5 where there is no background location is calculated this location has also been characterized and monitored by collecting cryogenic cores following the method described in kiaalhosseini et al 2016 2 6 3 negative rates site wide monthly averages of nszd rates calculated by the single stick method at site 3 are provided to show not only seasonal behavior of nszd rates but more importantly the occurrence of negative nszd rates through time in the study period 2 7 study sites data from five field sites are used to evaluate the single stick method relevant attributes of each site are presented in table 2 sites 1 2 and 3 are equipped with vertical strings referred to as sticks of type t copper constant thermocouples to fabricate the thermocouples copper and constantan wires of a pfa coated thermocouple wire tc direct hillside illinois were spot welded together at the end of the wire and the spot welds were enclosed in glass caps filled with epoxy the thermocouples were attached to 9 5 mm od pvc rods to control the depth of installation karimi askarani et al 2018 vertical position of the thermocouples in the subsurface and the period of data collection at each study site are provided in table 2 each thermocouple is connected to a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah powered by a 12 v dc 24 amp h sealed rechargeable battery bp24 campbell scientific which is charged by a 20 w solar panel sp20 campbell scientific the current between

subsurface temperatures by the datalogger are sent once a day to a computer over a cellular network the estimated accuracy of the combined thermocouples and dataloggers based on laboratory tests is 0 1 c karimi askarani et al 2018 sites 4 and 5 were equipped with similar patent pending digital temperature sensor systems based on prior site investigations and studies the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of unsaturated and saturated areas in all the study sites are assumed to be 0 96 w m k 1 57 mj m3 k 1 46 w m k and 2 51 mj m3 k respectively stockwell 2015 the sediment density in the study sites is 2 65 g cm3 the heat of full oxidation of decane 6791 kj mol stockwell 2015 is used to convert nszd energy into estimates of lnapl depletion rates 3 results 3 1 confirmation of solution and algorithm 3 1 1 numerical model test fig 5 presents imposed and predicted values of q s and q s s for a 50 day computational test period predicted values are based on the single stick method a statistical analysis of imposed and predicted values is provided in table 3 favorable agreement between imposed and temperature derived q s and q s s values supports the validity of the single stick analytical solution and the computational algorithm 3 1 2 comparison of observed and single stick derived fitting temperature profiles fig 6 presents measured subsurface versus single stick derived fits to subsurface temperature at site 1 at three month intervals over a 1 year period the fits to observed temperatures are based on daily estimates of q s q s s and x obtained using the single stick method applied to eq 9 the estimated position of subsurface heat source by the single stick method ranged from 1 8 to 2 2 m bgs throughout the study period similarly close agreement between observed temperatures and derived temperatures using estimated q s q s s and x is seen for all other sites see table b1 in supplementary material 3 1 3 triplicate test table 4 presents tabulated nszd rates from three monitoring sticks at site 4 as noted in methods the sticks are approximately 2 m apart in an equilateral triangle and as such they are considered to be a triplicate data set from a single location table 4 indicates that the nszd rates from the single stick method range from 24 300 to 27 100 l ha year with a coefficient of variation equal to 6 in comparison a similar set of triplicate nszd rates is reported by mccoy et al 2015 based on co2 trap methods the coefficient of variation associated with the co2 trap triplicate test is 200 greater than the coefficient from the single stick method 3 2 nszd rate 3 2 1 comparison of single stick and background correction methods fig 7 presents nszd rates for the three sites using background correction and single stick methods in general all methods are in agreement at an order of magnitude basis on average estimated nszd rates at lnapl impacted locations using background correction methods advanced by sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 are respectively 11 and 44 lower and 155 greater than nszd rates obtained using the single stick method estimated nszd rates at all background locations using all methods are greater than the ideal value of zero liters per hectare per year the single stick method provides the lowest nszd rates at background locations it is plausible that non zero nszd rate at background locations is due to the heat associated with natural attenuation of dissolved phase petroleum compounds or unrecognized heat sources 3 2 2 nszd rate at a lnapl impacted location in a site with no background location at site 5 the average monthly nszd rates based on daily values derived by single stick method over a 100 day study period is 14 000 l ha year monthly nszd rates at this site from january 2019 to april 2019 are 3 000 12 000 22 000 and 20 000 l ha year respectively due to absence of a representative lnapl impacted location with no lnapl i e a background location the single stick method is the only applicable approach for estimation of nszd rates at this location 3 2 3 negative rates fig 8 illustrates the site wide monthly average of nszd rates from the single stick method in site 3 based on daily values the periodic behavior of nszd rates indicates the apparent nszd rates increase in warmer dryer seasons and decrease through the cooler wetter seasons the monthly average of nszd rates demonstrates apparent negative values of nszd rates through october 2017 to february 2018 when the monthly average of water content in shallow soil and evapotranspiration et reached their maximum and minimum values respectively fig 8 the water content and evapotranspiration data were obtained from giovanni online data system developed and maintained by the nasa ges disc xia et al 2012a 2012b 4 discussion 4 1 confirmation of the single stick solution and algorithm three lines of evidence were considered to evaluate the validity of the single stick method and supporting computational algorithms collectively close agreement is seen between 1 estimated and numerically synthesized q s and q s s values 2 observed and single stick derived fitting subsurface temperature profiles and 3 nszd rates at three co located sticks based on the three analyses it seems likely that the single stick method including underpinning assumptions mathematical formulations and computational algorithms are largely valid perhaps the most compelling argument for validity is that absent accurate estimates of q s q s s and x it seems improbable that the close agreement between the fit derived by single stick and observed subsurface temperatures in fig 6 and table b1 could be achieved notably the conclusions regarding the validity of the single stick method are predicated on limited number of sites specific conditions that could pose challenges to the single stick method include shallow water tables fractured media and low permeability settings 4 2 nszd rates development of the single stick method was motivated by concerns regarding occasionally 1 implausible nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl 2 negative nszd rates and or 3 improbably large nszd rates in areas with lnapl the ability of the single stick method to address these concerns is explored in the following discussion with respect to implausible nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl continuous cryogenic core following the methods of kiaalhosseini et al 2016 was collected at background location in site 2 no lnapl with dissolved phase hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater were observed at the background location in site 2 based on fig 7 temperature based estimates of annual average nszd rates for the background location in site 2 are 4 700 9 400 9 400 and 46 000 l ha year using the single stick method sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 respectively although the lowest nszd rate at the background location in site 2 is estimated by the single stick method the rates from background correction and single stick methods at this location are apparently high the high apparent nszd rates at the background location in site 2 can be explained by 1 warm water in the subsurface due to industrial processes occurring in an active refinery and 2 the heat produced through natural attenuation of dissolved phase petroleum compounds in groundwater fig 9 presents average predicted nszd rates from all background locations in sites 1 2 and 3 the data indicate that the estimated average nszd rate by the single stick method is 55 106 and 750 lower than nszd rates obtained using warren et al 2015 sale et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 respectively our hypothesis is that lower more plausible nszd results at background locations using the single stick method are attributed to elimination of background corrections that can be flawed in space and or time overall an ability to achieve low nszd rates at locations where lnapl is absent suggests that the single stick method is more valid than the background correction methods with respect to negative nszd rates negative rates have been a chronic concern with temperature based estimates of nszd rates a primary hypothesis for negative nszd rates has been flawed background correction wherein surface heating and cooling at background locations are occasionally significantly different than surface heating and cooling at impacted locations the method of karimi askarani et al 2018 addresses negative nszd rates by treating them as zero rates based on implausibility the methods of sale et al 2015 and warren et al 2015 include negative nszd rates in averaged rates inclusion of negative rates can be justified based on an assumed normal distribution of errors in the estimated nszd rates unfortunately per fig 8 the single stick method elimination of the background correction has not completely eliminated occasional negative nszd rates this result has led to an additional hypothetical explanation for negative nszd rates based on table 1 nszd consists of two reactions first methanogenesis is an endothermic reaction that occurs primarily in the lnapl zone second methane or other vocs are oxidized above the lnapl zones via an exothermic reaction occurring at an interface where oxygen encounters methane or vocs an argument can be advanced that sites and or times with negative nszd rates correlate to shallow soil with high water content including frozen ground that precludes oxygen entry into the subsurface fig 8 exclusion of oxygen could lead to methanogenesis being the primary reaction and endothermic cooling producing apparent negative nszd rates support for the hypothesis of endothermic cooling can be found in ongoing methanogenic laboratory column studies where the column soils are consistently 0 3 0 4 c cooler than room temperatures given endothermic cooling negative rates are not a basis for invalidating temperature based nszd rates and negative rates should be included in cumulative estimates of nszd rates further work is needed to fully resolve the basis for apparent negative nszd rates obtained from temperature data and the implications of negative rates with respect to the accuracy of temperature based estimates of nszd rates with respect to large nszd rates in areas with lnapl mean values from all data sets are 22 000 4 700 7 500 and 8400 l ha year using the methods of karimi askarani et al 2018 warren et al 2015 sale et al 2015 and the single stick method respectively the highest values coming from the methods of karimi askarani et al 2018 is attributed to exclusion of negative rates as described in the preceding paragraph on average the remaining three approaches provide lower and similar results unfortunately variation between high and low values at individual locations for the same time period as large as a factor of 4 4 to 18 5 fig 7 indicates that the methods of sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and the single stick method are not equivalent based on technical rigor including elimination of background correction errors an argument can be advanced that of the temperature methods the single stick method is likely to provide the best estimates of nszd rates unfortunately technical rigor alone is an insufficient basis for resolving which method provides the best estimates of nszd rates currently work is ongoing to collect and analyze cryogenic core at benchmark locations at all of the sites considered in this study observed changes in subsurface lnapl concentration over time will be used to independently verify nszd rates and further resolve the merits of available method for transforming temperature data into nszd rates 4 3 merits and limitations of the single stick method as stated in the introduction a primary objective of the paper is to resolve merits and limitations of the single stick method with respect to other temperature based methods of estimating nszd rates to the positive eliminating a need for background temperature is valuable background correction requires additional data collection at a sufficient number of locations to capture surface heating and cooling at impacted locations furthermore at many sites finding representative background locations is difficult or infeasible in addition eliminating background corrections removes the errors that are inherent to imperfect background correction lastly an ability to provide lower near zero estimates of nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl is advantageous arguably methods that predict higher nszd rates where lnapl is absent are less valid than methods that yield lower nszd rates where lnapl is absent to the negative the single stick method is computationally complex as compared to the analytical methods of sale et al 2015 and warren et al 2015 currently the single stick code requires access to matlab and the code is not publicly available given the ambiguity as to the merits of the single stick method versus background correction methods it is difficult to argue that the benefits of the single stick method outweigh the costs of more complicated single stick computational method to resolve access to the single stick method efforts are ongoing to move collected data and the single stick code to cloud based computing space where it may be combined with soil redox water level and climate data to provide a comprehensive sensor based data set for real time monitoring subsurface conditions 5 conclusion herein a novel single stick computational approach is advanced for transforming subsurface temperature data from lnapl zones into nszd rates reliance on temperature data to resolve nszd rates has the advantage over surface gas flux methods of providing continuous nszd rates in potentially dynamic systems where sparse temporal data can be a poor indictor of average rates also the single stick method has the advantage over other thermal methods of not requiring background temperature data to resolve heat associated with nszd the benefits of eliminating background correction are two fold including eliminating 1 the need for collecting background data and 2 errors that can be inherent to background correction approaches arguments supporting the validity of the single stick method include its strong foundation in first principles favorable results from computational tests that show close agreement between imposed and predicted heating fluxes favorable agreement between observed and single stick derived fitting subsurface temperatures and lower nszd rates at background locations while the merits of the single stick method can be advanced it is difficult to argue that the single stick method is clearly the best approach for obtaining nszd rates certainly the methods for temperature data of sale et al 2015 and warren et al 2015 are computationally more practical and in the big picture tell a similar story of nszd rates of 1 000s to 10 000s of l ha year also noteworthy following arguments advanced in cohen 2013 a tendency is evident for averaged nszd rates to move to similar values using the methods described in this paper as the number of measured nszd rates gets large much work is ongoing to further resolve the accuracy of estimated nszd rates and processes including the use of cryogenic coring methods to validate independently measured nszd rates unfortunately it takes time for nszd to deplete enough lnapl for accurate quantification of nszd rates using cryogenic coring methods furthermore research is in progress to optimize the spatial and temporal scales of temperature measurements to provide an accurate and reliable estimate of nszd rates on another path nascent efforts are ongoing to combine soil oxidation reduction potential sorp data burge et al 2018 and water level data with temperature data synergistically in a world of big data artificial intelligence and machine learning interdependencies of sorp water level and temperature data are leading to a better understanding of nszd processes and the appropriate application of nszd

18356,real time monitoring of subsurface temperature profiles is a promising approach to resolving natural source zone depletion nszd rates for shallow petroleum liquids herein a new single stick computational method for transforming temperature data into nszd rates is advanced the method is predicated on subsurface temperatures being a function of surface heating and cooling and the heat associated with nszd given subsurface temperature at two points a system of two equation two unknown is used to resolve nszd rates mathematical formulations and computational algorithms are validated through computational tests showing near perfect agreement between prescribed and predicted nszd heating and observed and predicted subsurface temperatures the method is applied to temperature data from five field sites results include lower nszd rates in areas where petroleum liquids are absent by a factor of 0 5 7 5 as compared to background correction methods while the single stick method provides the lowest rate in unimpacted areas it also provides reasonable rates as compared to two of three background correction methods in addition the single stick method yields a coefficient of

subsurface petroleum liquids are referred to as light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls and the processes controlling losses of lnapl bodies fig 1 is referred to as natural source zone depletion nszd nszd is a part of the natural short term i e decades to centuries biological organic carbon cycle sookhak lari et al 2019 wherein a large fraction of organic carbon introduced into the shallow

nszd processes of not being limited by the availability of primary electrons acceptors including o2 fe 3 and so 4 2 generation of nszd co2 and ch4 leads to exceedances of aqueous phase gas solubility

2019 comprehensive information regarding modeling approaches for physiochemical processes that affect nszd rates can be found in sookhak lari et al 2019 initial efforts to quantify nszd rates focused

fick s law to estimate gas fluxes sihota et al 2011 employed dynamic flux chambers at ground surface to quantify co2 efflux and mccoy et al 2015 advanced the use of co2 traps at ground surface to quantify co2 efflux a common limitation of surface gas flux methods is that measurements are typically made over brief periods in systems where gas fluxes can be dynamic due to barometric pumping and or transient soil moisture davis et al 2005 karimi askarani et al 2018 furthermore the accuracy of gas flux based nszd rates can be constrained by non uniform gas fluxes in porous media associated with heterogeneous gas phase diffusion coefficients and soil permeability for gases early work using heat production to resolve reaction rates in subsurface environments is presented in harries and ritchie 1981 and johnston et al 2008 more recently temperature based approaches for quantifying lnapl nszd rates have been advanced by sweeney and ririe 2014 sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 published temperature based approaches involve 1 continuously measuring vertical temperature profiles in background and lnapl impacted areas 2 isolating nszd heat from heat associated with surface heating by subtracting background temperatures from temperature in lnapl impacted areas 3 conducting an energy balance to resolve nszd energy e g w m2 and 4 estimating nszd rates by dividing nszd energy by the estimated nszd heat of reaction continuous real time temperature monitoring addresses issues with temporally sparse gas flux measurements karimi askarani et al 2018 and thermal properties of subsurface media are arguably far more uniform than gas phase diffusion coefficients and soil permeability the primary limitation of published methods for transforming temperature to nszd rates is that background correction for surface heating and cooling at lnapl impacted locations constrains the accuracy of reported values manifestations of flawed background corrections can include occasionally implausible nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl negative nszd rates and or improbably large nszd rates in areas with lnapl ideally background locations need to be similar to the lnapl impacted locations through time with respect to all factors controlling surface heating and cooling including albedo infiltration evaporation of precipitation and incident radiation to name a few as an example a background location with asphalt and direct sunlight is likely to yield flawed background correction data for surface heating and cooling in an lnapl impacted area with direct sunlight and a natural vegetative cover additionally at a background location the depth of the vadose zone needs to be similar to that at lnapl impacted locations while concerns can be raised with respect to the accuracy of all methods for quantifying nszd rates we can be confident that nszd frequently plays an important role in constraining the extent of lnapl and the associated risks herein we explore a new single stick method for converting real time continuous temperature data into nszd rates in which temperature profiles of a single location are used to estimate surface heating and cooling and subsurface heating associated with nszd a novel mathematical method is advanced the validity of the method is tested methods for converting temperature into nszd rates are compared using data from three field sites and merits limitations of the single stick method are evaluated the motivation for this study is to try to develop an acceptable method for estimating nszd rates from temperature data and thereby to gain greater confidence in our emerging reliance on nszd to address lnapls in soil and groundwater 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model the two primary heat sources sinks in a media impacted by lnapl are surface heating and cooling and subsurface nszd processes driving surface heating and cooling include incidental solar radiation black body radiation incident precipitation and evaporative cooling of soil water to name a few heat moves into the subsurface when the net surficial inflow of energy is greater than the loss of energy conversely heat moves out of the subsurface when the energy loss is greater than energy input jury and horton 2004 hillel 2013 general reactions associated with subsurface nszd are presented in table 1 following johnson and lundegard 2006 decane is used as representative model petroleum hydrocarbon the first reaction 1 is mediated by methanogens under anaerobic conditions producing ch4 and co2 methanogenesis typically occurs in and about the space where lnapls are present irianni et al 2016 garg et al 2017 while the exergonic δ g r o value for reaction 1 favors the forward reaction the δ h r o value is positive indicating an endothermic reaction in the second reaction 2 methanotrophs aerobically oxidize methane into co2 and h2o oxidation of ch4 occurs above the lnapl body at a vertical position where the outward flux of ch4 meets an inward flux of atmospheric o2 notably the inward flux of oxygen can vary with time due to temporally varying effective oxygen diffusion coefficient controlled by soil water content barometric pumping and water table fluctuations karimi askarani et al 2018 reaction 2 oxidation of methane provides the primary source of heat for nszd following sookhak lari et al 2019 under select conditions nszd can be dominated by processes other than methanogenesis 2 2 derivation the following section advances a solution for estimating nszd rates as a function of temperatures measured along a vertical subsurface profile at a single location this method is referred to as the single stick method all other current methods of transforming temperature to nszd rates rely on background temperature corrections as described in sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 following carslaw and jaeger 1959 jury and horton 2004 and hillel 2013 the governing equation for conductive heat transfer is 1 x k x t x y k y t y z k z t z ρ c t t where k ml t3θ is thermal conductivity c l2 t2θ is specific heat capacity t θ is temperature t t is time ρ m l3 is sediment density and x y z l are spatial coordinates as shown in fig 2 the surface heat source sink q s m t3 occurs at x 0 the subsurface heat source sink q s s m t3 occurs at a temporally varying position x x at any point in the domain temperature is a function of the temporal values of q s q s s and x additional assumptions used to derive a solution include 1 surface and subsurface heat sources sinks can be approximated as planar features 2 thermal properties of soil are independent of position direction temperature and time 3 horizontal heat fluxes are negligible stockwell 2015 4 temporally varying surface and subsurface heat source sink can be approximated using a succession of steady state i e daily values 5 the surface heating and cooling term addresses all processes controlling surface heating and cooling including but not limited to solar radiation black body radiation incident precipitations evaporative cooling and composting shallow soil organic compounds 6 reactions are assumed to be occurring instantaneously at location x x and rapidly compared to gas transport times in the soil profile davis et al 2009 7 the subsurface heat source sink q s s has a spatio temporal varying position x approximated using a succession of steady state values and an image source sink symmetrically located at position x 8 net gain or loss of biomass precipitation or dissolution of minerals or changes in thermodynamic states do not contribute significantly to subsurface heating and cooling karimi askarani et al 2018 9 geothermal temperature gradients are negligible stockwell 2015 karimi askarani et al 2018 10 observed nearly constant temperatures at depth are the basis for the initial temperature condition 11 the energy produced from mineralization of decane is representative of the energy produced through nszd of the hydrocarbons of concern 2 3 solution applying the stated assumptions the governing equation reduces to 2 2 t x 2 1 κ t t boundary and initial conditions include 3 q s κ d t d x x 0 4 t x t t 0 5 t x 0 t 0 where t 0 is initial temperature and κ k ρ c is thermal diffusivity l2 t note that the value of t 0 is an initial seed value i e nearly constant temperatures at depth used to condition the model the model is run using the seed value t 0 for a conditioning period and the results are discarded to diminish the effect of initial temperature value a solution for eq 2 is obtained by superimposing separate solutions for temperatures associated with q s and q s s following carslaw and jeager 1959 a solution for temperature as a function of q s is 6 t x t t 0 2 q s κ κ t π e x p x 2 4 κ t x 2 e r f c x 4 κ t eq 6 satisfies all conditions of eqs 3 5 again following carslaw and jeager 1959 using the fundamental solution of heat equation that is integrated over a plane and through time the solution of eq 2 for temperature as a function of q s s at x is 7 t x t t 0 q s s ρ c t π κ e x p x x 2 4 κ t

to satisfy a zero flux condition at x 0 carslaw and jeager 1959 the first term on the right hand side of eq 7 accounts for the real subsurface nszd heat source the second term in eq 7 is an imaginary source located in imaginary space at a position equidistant to the real subsurface heat source above the ground surface summation of eqs 6 and 7 yields 8 t x t t 0 2 q s κ κ t π e x p x 2 4 κ t x 2 e

surface which is the combination of two boundary conditions in more detail eq 8 is achieved by superimposing two equations eq 6 and eq 7 each of which has their own boundary condition including 1 q s κ d t d x x 0 that is satisfied by eq 6 and 2 a zero flux condition at the ground surface κ d t d x x 0 0 that is satisfied by eq 7 in net the combination of real surface and subsurface heat sources and an imaginary subsurface heat source leads to a mathematical framework where nszd heat can leave the real model domain at x 0 a solution accounting for temporal variations in q s q s s and x is obtained using a succession of steady states 9 t x t t 0 i 1 n q s i q s i 1 f x t t i 1 q s s i g x t t i 1 x i q s s i 1 g x t t i 1 x i 1 where q s q s s and x are assumed constant between consecutive time steps t n 1 t t n and 10 f x t t i 1 2 κ κ t t i 1 π e x p x 2 4 κ t t i 1 x 2 e r f c x 4 κ t t i 1 11 g x t t i 1 x i 1 ρ c t t i 1 π κ e x p x x i 2 4 κ t t i 1 x x i 2 κ e r f c x

calculation marches through time using time steps i e day in which fluxes are constant by measuring temperature in the subsurface at two different positions fig 2 eq 9 can be solved in the following two equation two unknown system for determining the values of q s and q s s 12 t x 1 t i 1 n q s i q s i 1 f x 1 t t i 1 q s s i g x 1 t t i 1 x i q s s i 1 g x 1 t t i 1 x i 1 t x 2 t i 1 n q s i q s

finally the values of subsurface heat source q s s are converted to nszd rates on a volumetric basis using 13 n s z d q s s δ h d e c a n e ρ d e c a n e where n s z d is the rate of nszd l t δ h d e c a n e is the enthalpy of complete mineralization ml2 t2 mol and ρ d e c a n e is the molar density of decane 5 14 mol l 2 4 algorithm estimates of nszd rates n s z d through time are obtained using an algorithm programmed in matlab the mathworks inc natick massachusetts the primary input in this algorithm is vertical profiles of real time subsurface temperatures measured in lnapl impacted areas through time measured temperatures at any vertical position in the subsurface are averaged on a daily basis key steps for transforming daily average temperature data to nszd rates using this algorithm are illustrated in fig 3 in more detail 1 the daily average of measured subsurface temperatures thermal properties of soil profile and number of positions for evaluating the subsurface heat source are inputs to the program 2 in a fixed time step i the algorithm selects a position for subsurface heat source x j 3 a system of two equations eq 12 is solved for determining the values of q s j i and q s s j i based on the selected position for the subsurface heat source 4 the simulated temperature distribution t p r d is obtained using eq 9 5 the conformity of simulated temperature distribution t p r d to the observed temperature distribution t o b s is evaluated using a r 2 value 6 after the subsurface heat source is evaluated at all specified positions j n the algorithm proceeds to the next step otherwise it reverts to step 2 to consider another position for the subsurface heat source 7 in a fixed time step i the values of q s i q s s i and x are resolved based on the simulated temperature profile with best conformity 8 lastly the estimated value of the subsurface nszd heat source is converted into an nszd rate using eq 13 9 the program iterates through time until all of the temperature data have been transformed into nszd rates 2 5 confirmation of solution and algorithm the following sections describe three approaches used to test the validity of the solution and computational algorithm 2 5 1 numerical model test a two step process was used to test the validity of the analytical solution eq 8 and to check the computational algorithm under ideal conditions wherein all assumptions are applied firstly daily prescribed values for q s and q s s were imposed on the surface and in the subsurface of a soil profile i e all assumptions are held modeled using a finite element approach programmed in matlab to simulate a temperature distribution throughout the soil profile for a 50 day period fig 4 secondly the single stick model was employed to estimate q s and q s s using the simulated temperatures of the soil profile agreement between imposed and estimated values of q s and q s s are used to evaluate the validity of the mathematical solution and the matlab code model performance is assessed using 1 root mean square error rmse 2 coefficient of determination r2 3 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 4 index of agreement d willmott 1981 5 percent error pe and 6 mean μ and standard deviation σ of residuals observed minus modeled 2 5 2 comparison of observed and single stick derived fitting temperature profiles this section is dedicated to investigate how close the derived fitting temperature profiles by single stick method are to the observed temperatures herein the derived fit to actual temperatures are obtained by substituting the single stick estimations of q s q s s and x into eq 9 the ability of estimated q s q s s and x to reproduce a close fit to observed subsurface temperatures provides an additional mean of evaluating the validity of the mathematical solution and the matlab code 2 5 3 triplicate test three temperature monitoring sticks were installed in a lnapl area site 4 approximately 2 m apart in an equilateral triangle the triplicate values from single stick method and the values derived from the co2 trap method at a different field site mccoy 2015 are used to evaluate the coefficient of variation the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value due to local spatial variations and measurement accuracy 2 6 nszd rate 2 6 1 comparison of single stick and background correction methods the merits of the single stick computational approach are evaluated by comparing results from three field sites sites 1 2 and 3 using single stick and background correction methods background correction methods include methods presented in 1 sale et al 2015 2 warren and bekins 2015 and 3 karimi askarani et al 2018 background correction methods are predicated on using real time subsurface temperature data at a representative background no lnapl location to isolate heat associated with surface heating and cooling from heat associated with nszd in addition since each site considered in this study has two background locations applications of the background correction method include considering one background location as an lnapl impacted location and the other background location as a background location nszd rates at background locations using both background correction and single stick methods are calculated to provide a basis for evaluating the ability of all methods to capture ideally zero nszd rates at background locations 2 6 2 nszd rate at a lnapl impacted location in a site with no background data to show the main advantage of the single stick method using estimation of nszd rates in lnapl areas with no need for background correction the nszd rate at a lnapl impacted location in a former refinery site 5 where there is no background location is calculated this location has also been characterized and monitored by collecting cryogenic cores following the method described in kiaalhosseini et al 2016 2 6 3 negative rates site wide monthly averages of nszd rates calculated by the single stick method at site 3 are provided to show not only seasonal behavior of nszd rates but more importantly the occurrence of negative nszd rates through time in the study period 2 7 study sites data from five field sites are used to evaluate the single stick method relevant attributes of each site are presented in table 2 sites 1 2 and 3 are equipped with vertical strings referred to as sticks of type t copper constant thermocouples to fabricate the thermocouples copper and constantan wires of a pfa coated thermocouple wire tc direct hillside illinois were spot welded together at the end of the wire and the spot welds were enclosed in glass caps filled with epoxy the thermocouples were attached to 9 5 mm od pvc rods to control the depth of installation karimi askarani et al 2018 vertical position of the thermocouples in the subsurface and the period of data collection at each study site are provided in table 2 each thermocouple is connected to a datalogger cr1000

subsurface temperatures by the datalogger are sent once a day to a computer over a cellular network the estimated accuracy of the combined thermocouples and dataloggers based on laboratory tests is 0 1 c karimi askarani et al 2018 sites 4 and 5 were equipped with similar patent pending digital temperature sensor systems based on prior site investigations and studies the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of unsaturated and saturated areas in all the study sites are assumed to be 0 96 w m k 1 57 mj m3 k 1 46 w m k and 2 51 mj m3 k respectively stockwell 2015 the sediment density in the study sites is 2 65 g cm3 the heat of full oxidation of decane 6791 kj mol stockwell 2015 is used to convert nszd energy into estimates of lnapl depletion rates 3 results 3 1 confirmation of solution and algorithm 3 1 1 numerical model test fig 5 presents imposed and predicted values of q s and q s s for a 50 day computational test period predicted values are based on the single stick method a statistical analysis of imposed and predicted values is provided in table 3 favorable agreement between imposed and temperature derived q s and q s s values supports the validity of the single stick analytical solution and the computational algorithm 3 1 2 comparison of observed and single stick derived fitting temperature profiles fig 6 presents measured subsurface versus single stick derived fits to subsurface temperature at site 1 at three month intervals over a 1 year period the fits to observed temperatures are based on daily estimates of q s q s s and x obtained using the single stick method applied to eq 9 the estimated position of subsurface heat source by the single stick method ranged from 1 8 to 2 2 m bgs throughout the study period similarly close agreement between observed temperatures and derived temperatures using estimated q s q s s and x is seen for all other sites see table b1 in supplementary material 3 1 3 triplicate test table 4 presents tabulated nszd rates from three monitoring sticks at site 4 as noted in methods the sticks are approximately 2 m apart in an equilateral triangle and as such they are considered to be a triplicate data set from a single location table 4 indicates that the nszd rates from the single stick method range from 24 300 to 27 100 l ha year with a coefficient of variation equal to 6 in comparison a similar set of triplicate nszd rates is reported by mccoy et al 2015 based on co2 trap methods the coefficient of variation associated with the co2 trap triplicate test is 200 greater than the coefficient from the single stick method 3 2 nszd rate 3 2 1 comparison of single stick and background correction methods fig 7 presents nszd rates for the three sites using background correction and single stick methods in general all methods are in agreement at an order of magnitude basis on average estimated nszd rates at lnapl impacted locations using background correction methods advanced by sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 are respectively 11 and 44 lower and 155 greater than nszd rates obtained using the single stick method estimated nszd rates at all background locations using all methods are greater than the ideal value of zero liters per hectare per year the single stick method provides the lowest nszd rates at background locations it is plausible that non zero nszd rate at background locations is due to the heat associated with natural attenuation of dissolved phase petroleum compounds or unrecognized heat sources 3 2 2 nszd rate at a lnapl impacted location in a site with no background location at site 5 the average monthly nszd rates based on daily values derived by single stick method over a 100 day study period is 14 000 l ha year monthly nszd rates at this site from january 2019 to april 2019 are 3 000 12 000 22 000 and 20 000 l ha year respectively due to absence of a representative lnapl impacted location with no lnapl i e a background location the single stick method is the only applicable approach for estimation of nszd rates at this location 3 2 3 negative rates fig 8 illustrates the site wide monthly average of nszd rates from the single stick method in site 3 based on daily values the periodic behavior of nszd rates indicates the apparent nszd rates increase in warmer dryer seasons and decrease through the cooler wetter seasons the monthly average of nszd rates demonstrates apparent negative values of nszd rates through october 2017 to february 2018 when the monthly average of water content in shallow soil and evapotranspiration et reached their maximum and minimum values respectively fig 8 the water content and evapotranspiration data were obtained from giovanni online data system developed and maintained by the nasa ges disc xia et al 2012a 2012b 4 discussion 4 1 confirmation of the single stick solution and algorithm three lines of evidence were considered to evaluate the validity of the single stick method and supporting computational algorithms collectively close agreement is seen between 1 estimated and numerically synthesized q s and q s s values 2 observed and single stick derived fitting subsurface temperature profiles and 3 nszd rates at three co located sticks based on the three analyses it seems likely that the single stick method including underpinning assumptions mathematical formulations and computational algorithms are largely valid perhaps the most compelling argument for validity is that absent accurate estimates of q s q s s and x it seems improbable that the close agreement between the fit derived by single stick and observed subsurface temperatures in fig 6 and table b1 could be achieved notably the conclusions regarding the validity of the single stick method are predicated on limited number of sites specific conditions that could pose challenges to the single stick method include shallow water tables fractured media and low permeability settings 4 2 nszd rates development of the single stick method was motivated by concerns regarding occasionally 1 implausible nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl 2 negative nszd rates and or 3 improbably large nszd rates in areas with lnapl the ability of the single stick method to address these concerns is explored in the following discussion with respect to implausible nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl continuous cryogenic core following the methods of kiaalhosseini et al 2016 was collected at background location in site 2 no lnapl with dissolved phase hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater were observed at the background location in site 2 based on fig 7 temperature based estimates of annual average nszd rates for the background location in site 2 are 4 700 9 400 9 400 and 46 000 l ha year using the single stick method sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 respectively although the lowest nszd rate at the background location in site 2 is estimated by the single stick method the rates from background correction and single stick methods at this location are apparently high the high apparent nszd rates at the background location in site 2 can be explained by 1 warm water in the subsurface due to industrial processes occurring in an active refinery and 2 the heat produced through natural attenuation of dissolved phase petroleum compounds in groundwater fig 9 presents average predicted nszd rates from all background locations in sites 1 2 and 3 the data indicate that the estimated average nszd rate by the single stick method is 55 106 and 750 lower than nszd rates obtained using warren et al 2015 sale et al 2015 and karimi askarani et al 2018 respectively our hypothesis is that lower more plausible nszd results at background locations using the single stick method are attributed to elimination of background corrections that can be flawed in space and or time overall an ability to achieve low nszd rates at locations where lnapl is absent suggests that the single stick method is more valid than the background correction methods with respect to negative nszd rates negative rates have been a chronic concern with temperature based estimates of nszd rates a primary hypothesis for negative nszd rates has been flawed background correction wherein surface heating and cooling at background locations are occasionally significantly different than surface heating and cooling at impacted locations the method of karimi askarani et al 2018 addresses negative nszd rates by treating them as zero rates based on implausibility the methods of sale et al 2015 and warren et al 2015 include negative nszd rates in averaged rates inclusion of negative rates can be justified based on an assumed normal distribution of errors in the estimated nszd rates unfortunately per fig 8 the single stick method elimination of the background correction has not completely eliminated occasional negative nszd rates this result has led to an additional hypothetical explanation for negative nszd rates based on table 1 nszd consists of two reactions first methanogenesis is an endothermic reaction that occurs primarily in the lnapl zone second methane or other vocs are oxidized above the lnapl zones via an exothermic reaction occurring at an interface where oxygen encounters methane or vocs an argument can be advanced that sites and or times with negative nszd rates correlate to shallow soil with high water content including frozen ground that precludes oxygen entry into the subsurface fig 8 exclusion of oxygen could lead to methanogenesis being the primary reaction and endothermic cooling producing apparent negative nszd rates support for the hypothesis of endothermic cooling can be found in ongoing methanogenic laboratory column studies where the column soils are consistently 0 3 0 4 c cooler than room temperatures given endothermic cooling negative rates are not a basis for invalidating temperature based nszd rates and negative rates should be included in cumulative estimates of nszd rates further work is needed to fully resolve the basis for apparent negative nszd rates obtained from temperature data and the implications of negative rates with respect to the accuracy of temperature based estimates of nszd rates with respect to large nszd rates in areas with lnapl mean values from all data sets are 22 000 4 700 7 500 and 8400 l ha year using the methods of karimi askarani et al 2018 warren et al 2015 sale et al 2015 and the single stick method respectively the highest values coming from the methods of karimi askarani et al 2018 is attributed to exclusion of negative rates as described in the preceding paragraph on average the remaining three approaches provide lower and similar results unfortunately variation between high and low values at individual locations for the same time period as large as a factor of 4 4 to 18 5 fig 7 indicates that the methods of sale et al 2015 warren et al 2015 and the single stick method are not equivalent based on technical rigor including elimination of background correction errors an argument can be advanced that of the temperature methods the single stick method is likely to provide the best estimates of nszd rates unfortunately technical rigor alone is an insufficient basis for resolving which method provides the best estimates of nszd rates currently work is ongoing to collect and analyze cryogenic core at benchmark locations at all of the sites considered in this study observed changes in subsurface lnapl concentration over time will be used to independently verify nszd rates and further resolve the merits of available method for transforming temperature data into nszd rates 4 3 merits and limitations of the single stick method as stated in the introduction a primary objective of the paper is to resolve merits and limitations of the single stick method with respect to other temperature based methods of estimating nszd rates to the positive eliminating a need for background temperature is valuable background correction requires additional data collection at a sufficient number of locations to capture surface heating and cooling at impacted locations furthermore at many sites finding representative background locations is difficult or infeasible in addition eliminating background corrections removes the errors that are inherent to imperfect background correction lastly an ability to provide lower near zero estimates of nszd rates in areas where there is no lnapl is advantageous arguably methods that predict higher nszd rates where lnapl is absent are less valid than methods that yield lower nszd rates where lnapl is absent to the negative the single stick method is computationally complex as compared to the analytical methods of sale et al 2015 and warren et al 2015 currently the single stick code requires access to matlab and the code is not publicly available given the ambiguity as to the merits of the single stick method versus background correction methods it is difficult to argue that the benefits of the single stick method outweigh the costs of more complicated single stick computational method to resolve access to the single stick method efforts are ongoing to move collected data and the single stick code to cloud based computing space where it may be combined with soil redox water level and climate data to provide a comprehensive sensor based data set for real time monitoring subsurface conditions 5 conclusion herein a novel single stick computational approach is advanced for transforming subsurface temperature data from lnapl zones into nszd rates reliance on temperature data to resolve nszd rates has the advantage over surface gas flux methods of providing continuous nszd rates in potentially dynamic systems where sparse temporal data can be a poor indictor of average rates also the single stick method has the advantage over other thermal methods of not requiring background temperature data to resolve heat associated with nszd the benefits of eliminating background correction are two fold including eliminating 1 the need for collecting background data and 2 errors that can be inherent to background correction approaches arguments supporting the validity of the single stick method include its strong foundation in first principles favorable results from computational tests that show close agreement between imposed and predicted heating fluxes favorable agreement between observed and single stick derived fitting subsurface temperatures and lower nszd rates at background locations while the merits of the single stick method can be advanced it is difficult to argue that the single stick method is clearly the best approach for obtaining nszd rates certainly the methods for temperature data of sale et al 2015 and warren et al 2015 are computationally more practical and in the big picture tell a similar story of nszd rates of 1 000s to 10 000s of l ha year also noteworthy following arguments advanced in cohen 2013 a tendency is evident for averaged nszd rates to move to similar values using the methods described in this paper as the number of measured nszd rates gets large much work is ongoing to further resolve the accuracy of estimated nszd rates and processes including the use of cryogenic coring methods to validate independently measured nszd rates unfortunately it takes time for nszd to deplete enough lnapl for accurate quantification of nszd rates using cryogenic coring methods furthermore research is in progress to optimize the spatial and temporal scales of temperature measurements to provide an accurate and reliable estimate of nszd rates on another path nascent efforts are ongoing to combine soil oxidation reduction potential sorp data burge et al 2018 and water level data with temperature data synergistically in a world of big data artificial intelligence and machine learning interdependencies of sorp water level and temperature data are leading to a better understanding of nszd processes and the appropriate application of nszd

18357,unsafe disposal of faecal sludge from onsite sanitation in low income countries has detrimental effects on public health and the environment the production of biochar from faecal sludge offers complete destruction of pathogens and a value added treatment product to date research has been limited to the laboratory this study evaluates the biochars produced from the co treatment of faecal sludge from septic tanks and agricultural waste at two full scale treatment plants in india by determining their physical and chemical properties to establish their potential applications the process yielded macroporous powdery biochars that can be utilised for soil amendment or energy recovery average calorific values reaching 14 9 mj kg suggest use as solid fuel but are limited by a high ash content phosphorus and potassium are enriched in the biochar but their concentrations are restricted by the nutrient depleted nature of septic tank faecal sludge high concentrations of calcium and magnesium led to a liming potential of up to 20 1 calcium carbonate equivalents indicating suitability for use on acidic soils heavy metals present in faecal sludge were concentrated in the biochar and compliance for soil application will depend on local regulations nevertheless heavy metal mobility was considerably reduced especially for cu and zn by 51 2 65 2 and 48 6 59 6 respectively co treatment of faecal sludge with other carbon rich waste streams can be used to influence desired biochar properties in this case the addition of agricultural waste increased nutrient and fixed carbon concentrations as well as providing an additional source of energy this study is a proof of concept for biochar production achieving full scale faecal sludge treatment the findings will help inform appropriate use of the treatment products as this technology becomes more commonly applied graphical abstract image 1 keywords faecal sludge biochar co treatment sanitation 1 introduction it is estimated that 4 5 billion people are not using safely managed sanitation services unicef and who 2017 approximately 2 7 billion people rely on pit latrines septic tanks or other onsite sanitation facilities strande et al 2014 uncontrolled disposal of untreated faecal sludge fs from such systems to local water bodies is detrimental to both the environment and public health compared to municipal wastewater fs typically contains more than ten times the amount of organic and pathogenic contamination ingallinella et al 2002 finding workable solutions for fs treatment that offer a viable alternative to illegal dumping is therefore crucial recent research has investigated various thermochemical treatment technologies for fs treatment including combustion gold et al 2017 onabanjo et al 2016 gasification recalde et al 2018 and hydrothermal carbonisation fakkaew et al 2018 in particular the feasibility of biochar production for fs treatment has been suggested bond et al 2018 and the suitability of fs pyrolysis for solid fuel production assessed andriessen et al 2019 biochar is a charcoal like material that is obtained through a process called pyrolysis where an organic feedstock is heated in an oxygen limited or oxygen free environment at temperatures between 350 and 800 c biochars are produced for environmental applications such as soil improvement or to aid in carbon sequestration however pyrolysis is also an established method in waste management including the treatment of sludge and manure joseph and lehmann 2015 smith et al 2009 fig 1 outlines a concept for integrating this technology into the management of fs experimental studies have examined the characteristics of fs derived biochars as a soil amendment woldetsadik et al 2018 solid fuel ward et al 2014 and adsorbent koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 2017 or have assessed different uses simultaneously gold et al 2018 liu et al 2014 fs pyrolysis has also been the subject of thermodynamic modelling yacob et al 2018 table 1 provides an overview of advantages and disadvantages associated with biochar production from fs compared to other biological or physical treatment methods the short retention time of a continuous pyrolysis process allows for minimal space requirements the paucity of fs pyrolysis research is still a key drawback for this technology especially as the production of biochar in developing countries has been negatively connotated as a cause of air pollution lohri et al 2016 in thermal treatment processes including fs pyrolysis feedstock with high water content drastically reduces energy efficiency bond et al 2018 however the option to co treat other carbonaceous waste fractions even plastics can improve the energy balance ro et al 2014 this option to co treat fs for biochar production is missing from previous experimental studies considering that organic waste and low grade plastics both sources of carbon are a main concern in the waste management of low and middle income countries wilson and webster 2018 co treatment should be considered fs pyrolysis offers complete destruction of pathogens due to high processing temperatures ward et al 2014 this is a key advantage for the agricultural use of fs derived biochars adding to the value from any plant nutrients retained in the biochar gold et al 2018 and woldetsadik et al 2018 investigate the supply of such nutrients from fs biochars but do not assess the potential to alleviate acidic soil conditions as observed for biochars produced from animal manure singh et al 2017 gold et al 2018 found fs biochars to breach the total heavy metal concentration limits of international biochar guidelines while this is a main concern for any soil application there is also a need to understand how pyrolysis influences the fate of heavy metals in the environment a reduction in the mobility of heavy metals has been reported in biochars produced from contaminated soil wijesekara et al 2007 and should therefore also be considered for fs previously research on fs biochars has been at laboratory scale only there is a necessity to demonstrate fs treatment technologies for resource recovery at full scale andriessen et al 2019 diener et al 2014 and in light of the sanitation crisis for scaling to occur rapidly strande et al 2014 therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the biochar produced from the first fs treatment plants of their kind operating at full scale in india this encompassed the characterisation of the precursor material its thermal degradation the resulting biochar properties and their applicability as a soil amendment or solid fuel 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling warangal faecal sludge treatment plant 17 56 15 5 n 79 33 31 9 e narsapur faecal sludge treatment plant 16 25 38 2 n 81 42 01 2 e the biochar samples were taken at the fs treatment plants in warangal telangana and narsapur andhra pradesh india in october 2018 both plants receive fs collected from septic tanks in the local area before treatment the fs is stored in holding tanks allowing for homogenisation of its characteristics which vary considerably between individual containments strande et al 2018 it is then dewatered and thermally dried the fs is co treated with pellet fuel pf derived from agricultural waste 0 3 kg pf kg fs dry basis in india agricultural waste is the most frequently used raw material for pf production purohit and chaturvedi 2018 such pf is locally produced and sold but the product does not specify the origin of the agricultural residues the composition will most probably be influenced by the regional and seasonal crops which are available sampling was conducted by incremental cross stream sampling as suggested for continuously produced biochar singh et al 2017 three samples of biochar were collected daily over a four day period resulting in twelve samples from warangal w bc and twelve from narsapur n bc during this period a composite sample of dewatered fs was collected and thermally dried for feedstock characterisation at both warangal w fs and narsapur n fs two batches of control biochar cbc using only solar dried fs which was fed directly to the reactor without pf were produced both at warangal w cbc and narsapur n cbc solar drying was conducted on site for a 10 h period and facilitated by spreading the sludge in a thin layer of approximately 10 mm depth the control batches allow an assessment of the effects on biochar properties from co treated fs and pf compared to the production exclusively from fs 2 2 process configuration fig 2 shows the process configuration of the biomass controls biogenic refinery model 4018 biomass controls llc usa operational in warangal and narsapur the process is specified to treat 360 kg fs day dry basis a feedstock auger 1 transfers the dewatered and thermally dried fs and pf mixture to the reactor inlet above the main reaction chamber 2 where it is delivered into the reaction vessel 3 heat from the main reaction chamber will cause thermal degradation to start in the feedstock auger the chamber receives a limited supply of oxygen through an air fan 4 to allow for partial oxidation enabling autothermal operation the material migrates downwards through the reaction vessel and is removed by two char augers 5 at the base of the vessel which convey it to a collection box 6 2 3 analytical methods the biochar particle size class was determined on site by progressive dry sieving with 500 μm 1000 μm and 2000 μm mesh sizes schmidt et al 2015 all samples were subsequently manually ground sieved to 500 μm and dried to constant weight samples were analysed in triplicate and are reported as mean values the ph was measured by standard method 9045d usepa 2004 adjusting the sample to water ratio to 1 10 and the mixing period to 1 h as recommended for biochar singh et al 2017 caco3 equivalents cce were determined by adding standardised 0 5m hcl to the sample in a 1 20 solid liquid ratio mixing for 2 h followed by a 16 h resting period the suspension was then titrated to ph 7 with 0 25m naoh singh et al 2017 to analyse the inorganic composition of the samples 0 2 g of sample was dry ashed at 500 c according to standard method 3030j apha 1992 the samples were then digested at 95 c for 2 h according to standard method 3050b usepa 1996 to provide a stronger digestion aqua regia was used instead of nitric acid the addition of hydrogen peroxide was omitted due to the preceding dry ashing cycle the mobility of metals in the sample was determined by extraction in a 20 1 liquid solid ratio according to the toxicity standard leaching procedure tclp standard method 1311 usepa 1992 the extractant used for this procedure was 1m hcl to simultaneously determine the plant available fraction of potassium k available in biochars singh et al 2017 plant available phosphorus p available was determined by 2 formic acid extraction wang et al 2012 the analytes from the digestion and extractions were filtered through whatman no 41 filter paper and analysed by icp oes avio 500 perkinelmer usa quality control complied with the spike recovery requirements of standard method 6010d for icp oes analysis usepa 2018 the calorific values were determined by bomb calorimetry parr 6100 calorimeter proximate and thermal analysis was conducted on a pl thermal sciences simultaneous thermal analyser 1500 pl sta 1500 volatile matter fixed carbon and ash content were determined in an automated procedure comprising a drying phase at 105 c and continuous heating to 950 c in an inert nitrogen atmosphere followed by cooling and then combustion in air at 600 c curves for thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetry dtg were obtained by gradually heating 10 c min the sample to 1000 c under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere and recording the weight change for interpretation thermal analysis was conducted for pf and fs to analyse the feedstock s thermal degradation and for cbc to assess the effectiveness of the reactor in achieving full pyrolysis of the feedstock ultimate analysis for chns was performed by medac ltd surrey uk sem images were taken with a tm4000 tabletop microscope hitachi japan 2 4 heavy metal immobilisation the control samples w cbc and n cbc were assessed to quantify any changes in the mobility of heavy metals thus eliminating any inaccuracies stemming from heavy metal contamination through the pf it also avoided errors in the mass balance associated with the approximate mixing of pf and fs by the operators chromium cr copper cu manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn were selected as they have been reported as non labile they largely remain in the solid residue of sewage sludge and solid waste thermal treatment processes chanaka udayanga et al 2018 dong et al 2015 he et al 2010 kistler et al 1987 based on the assumption that these metals are retained shifts in the mobile heavy metal fractions between fs and char were evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 feedstock characterisation the feedstock characteristics are summarised in table 2 ultimate and proximate analysis showed higher levels of c h n volatile matter and fixed carbon in n fs this was attributed to a higher ash content in w fs compared to n fs 47 3 and 25 1 respectively also leading to a lower calorific value 18 3 and 12 3 mj kg respectively high ash contents in fs as in warangal are often associated with grit and sand originating from poorly lined containment structures niwagaba et al 2014 phosphorus p concentrations in w fs and n fs 1 54 and 0 81 g kg respectively were lower than in previous reports for fs e g 31 and 24 g kg in china and uganda respectively liu et al 2014 gold et al 2017 fs from septic tanks may have significantly lower p concentrations as p is largely not retained in the septic tank sludge septic tanks only separating the solid from the liquid fraction cairncross and feachem 1993 discharge soluble p only 20 30 of total p is expected to settle lusk et al 2017 further this organically bound and condensed p is hydrolysed over time to form soluble orthophosphate leaving in the effluent wilhelm et al 1994 gill et al 2009 the results from thermal analysis for pf w fs and n fs are shown in fig 3 any weight losses below 180 c seen for fs and pf are caused by drying and dehydration reactions magdziarz and werle 2014 pf shows the typical weight loss between 150 and 500 c caused by the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin basu 2010 while the weight loss for fs is also associated with the decomposition of carbohydrates protein and fats ward et al 2014 liu et al 2014 both pf and fs reach maximum weight loss rates between 340 and 350 c the cessation of weight loss from approximately 500 c onwards for fs and 400 c for pf indicates that the main pyrolysis reactions are complete from an energy standpoint this suggests that operating under conditions that expose the feedstock particles to 500 c would be sufficient for biochar production however the whole system must be considered to ensure enough heat is generated for thermal drying of the feedstock a further weight loss peak between 650 and 750 c was observed for the fs which has also been reported for sewage sludge and has been attributed to the decomposition of carbonates kwon et al 2018 in this temperature range calcium and magnesium carbonates decompose from caco3 and mgco3 to cao and mgo respectively the co2 formed in these reactions causes the observed weight loss 3 2 solid fuel characteristics among many other parameters the solid fuel characteristics of w bc and n bc are given in table 3 higher average hhvs of n bc compared to w bc are associated with a lower ash content in the char resulting from the lower ash content of the precursor material the hhvs reported here are in agreement with those reported for fs derived chars produced at temperatures between 450 and 750 c being 8 8 17 91 mj kg gold et al 2018 ward et al 2014 a comparison with the control samples shows that the omission of pf with its high fixed carbon and low ash content of 14 4 and 8 3 respectively decreased the derived char hhvs by 6 7 and 49 5 between n bc and n cbc and between w bc and w cbc respectively this finding supports recommendations to blend fs with other biomass before pyrolysis to lower the ash content improving the fuel quality of the derived chars andriessen et al 2019 the high average volatile matter of 20 3 in narsapur and 14 2 in warangal can be explained by three factors evident from the tga and dtg plots of w cbc and n cbc firstly non completion of the main pyrolysis reactions causes residual weight loss between 150 and 500 c secondly carbonates are only partially decomposed in the process as seen by the dtg peak between 650 and 750 c thirdly continued heating from 750 c to 1000 c as part of proximate analysis causes further continuous weight loss due to ongoing carbonisation at temperatures higher than those reached in the treatment process experience shows energy recovery from fs to be more profitable than the production of soil amendments diener et al 2014 dried fs in uganda and senegal with similar calorific values to n bc and w bc 10 9 13 4 mj kg was deemed suitable as an industrial fuel for brick kilns gold et al 2017 suggesting a similar use for these chars however the most suitable end use of the fs derived products will depend on local economic and social conditions and should be based upon market studies reymond 2014 3 3 agronomic value both n bc and w bc had alkaline ph values averaging 10 5 and 10 8 respectively biochars typically show an alkaline ph as the fraction of inorganic elements increases in pyrolysis relative to the feedstock novak et al 2009 and as acidic functional groups on the material s surface are lost mukherjee et al 2011 while these values indicate that the char might be suitable for liming acidic soils a more quantifiable method is the assessment of calcium carbonate equivalents cce ippolito et al 2015 average cce values of 13 8 and 20 1 were found for n bc and w bc respectively they lie in a similar range to the liming potential of biochars from other excreta derived feedstock including sewage sludge cattle and poultry manure wang et al 2012 singh et al 2017 the high liming potential is associated with high concentrations of ca and mg accordingly high cumulative concentrations of 72 2 and 115 4 g kg were found for n cbc and w cbc respectively and positive correlation r 2 0 806 between cce and cumulative ca and mg concentrations fig 4 the presence of carbonates in the biochars observed by tga may indicate that carbonate species were only partially thermally degraded to ca and mg oxides however it is likely that the carbonates were reformed upon cooling exposure to moisture and co2 cause ca and mg oxides to react to hydroxides and carbonates housecroft and sharpe 2012 the speciation of ca and mg is of subordinate importance to the product quality of the biochars their carbonates oxides and hydroxides may all be used for liming purposes as they all react with water and co2 to form the bicarbonates that help neutralise acidic soil conditions brady and weil 2008 nutrient concentrations of 1 2gp kg and 8 1gk kg were measured for n bc and 2 2gp kg and 11 7gk kg for w bc there remains a paucity of published data on the nutrient content of fs derived biochars as discussed for the feedstock the derived biochars also show considerably lower p concentrations compared to other fs derived biochars which are typically between 31 and 81gp kg gold et al 2018 liu et al 2014 woldetsadik et al 2018 in this case study the process is limited by the quality of the feedstock feeding material with higher p concentrations e g as reported in ghana nartey et al 2017 cofie et al 2009 would improve the fertilising value of the derived chars compared to p the k concentrations were in closer agreement to literature values between 19 and 29gk kg woldetsadik et al 2018 liu et al 2014 however the higher k concentrations in the pf compared to n fs and w fs indicate that the addition of pf improved the fertilising value of the resulting biochar a comparison between the control samples and those with addition of pf shows that all elements associated with the ash fraction ca mg k p increase in the control sample except for k potassium concentrations remain equal for n bc and n cbc and drop from w bc to w cbc confirming the benefit of co feeding pf to produce biochar for fertilising purposes p available and k available as a fraction of total concentrations were between 71 9 and 77 7 for k and 53 7 61 0 for p this partial availability of p caused by the transformation into more stable forms through pyrolysis has been deemed beneficial to agriculture as p is released over longer periods of time dai et al 2016 both pyrolysis temperature and biomass addition will influence p availability zwetsloot et al 2015 but the precise mechanisms of p transformation and consequences for p availability are still uncertain wang et al 2012 for many biochars available k is equivalent to total k schmidt et al 2015 which was not confirmed for fs derived biochars it has been suggested that entrapment of k into the carbon structure as well as bonding into more stable forms causes this immobilisation kong et al 2014 heavy metals in the feedstock are concentrated in the ash fraction of the derived biochars beesley et al 2015 caballero et al 1997 the origin of heavy metals in fs besides the excretion through humans include industrial effluents leachate infiltration from solid waste dumps or illegal disposal of hazardous materials such as batteries to latrines appiah effah et al 2015 the heavy metal concentrations found in this study are summarised in table 3 all heavy metal concentrations were within the ceiling concentration limits set out by the usepa walker et al 1994 and the limit values set by the eu eec 1986 for land application of sludge apart from pb in n bc w bc and n bc also comply with the biochar specific guidelines issued by the international biochar initiative ibi 2015 the chars did not comply with the stricter limits for biochar of the european biochar initiative ebc 2019 concentrations of zn pb ni and cu in n bc and w bc all breached ebc limits besides heavy metal contamination pathogenic contamination is a main concern when recovering resources from fs kengne et al 2014 especially in agriculture due to the high process temperatures pyrolysis is known to eliminate any pathogens within seconds liu et al 2014 therefore as in previous fs pyrolysis studies woldetsadik et al 2018 gold et al 2018 ward et al 2014 full pathogen destruction can be assumed 3 4 heavy metal mobility with respect to heavy metal concentrations notable variation was observed with relative standard deviations ranging between 10 3 and 30 5 in n bc and w bc given that fs is fed to the process in batches and the holding tanks allow for only limited homogenisation the batch delivery is likely to be one cause of these variations in addition the ratios of co treated pf are approximate regarding the heavy metal concentrations it should be considered that their bioavailability is influenced by pyrolysis sequential extractions of sewage sludge biochars showed that the majority of heavy metals were transformed from exchangeable and acid leachable forms to non bioavailable forms jin et al 2016 fig 5 compares the leachable fractions of heavy metals between fs and biochar to evaluate their mobility mobility is expressed as the fraction of the hcl extractable and acid digestible concentrations analysis showed for example that cd cr and cu were 10 4 20 0 and 28 1 leachable from n bc and 8 9 27 1 and 24 6 leachable from w bc respectively except for ni the mobility of all heavy metals was higher in the fs compared to the derived biochars as shown in fig 5 e g cu leachability dropped from 86 5 in n fs to 28 6 in n bc the comparison between fs and control samples avoids possible contamination introduced by the pf table 4 shows the shifts in mobility of non labile heavy metals induced by the treatment process leachable fractions 100 for zn are likely to be attributable to losses during the dry ashing step preceding acid digestion immobilisation is evident for all non labile heavy metals apart from ni the highest reductions in mobility were achieved for cu cr and zn which dropped by 51 2 59 2 and 59 6 in narsapur and by 55 0 65 2 and 48 6 in warangal respectively again no immobilisation was observed for ni confirming the observations for n bc and w bc these results agree with reductions of cu pb and zn mobility through pyrolysis reported for contaminated soil wijesekara et al 2007 further the addition of pf may have enhanced immobilisation co pyrolysis of contaminated soil with woody biomass was shown to decrease heavy metal mobility depending on process temperature type of heavy metal and extent of biomass addition debela et al 2012 this was attributed to encapsulation within the biochar structure 3 5 particle size distribution and structural analysis the particle size distribution of n bc and w bc showed the largest particle fraction to be 500 μm namely 43 8 and 60 0 respectively see fig 6 using the classification put forward by schmidt et al 2015 n bc can be described as blended powder w bc as fine powder particle size will be influenced not only by feedstock characteristics but also by the process itself cetin et al 2004 high heating rates in particular given in fast pyrolysis produce fine biochars bruun et al 2012 the combination of the high heating rates within a continuous reactor and the particulate nature of dried fs are likely to be responsible for the resulting fine particle classes additionally the handling mechanisms of the process contribute to a smaller particle size such as auger feeds breaking up particles fig 7 shows sem images of fs and biochars the compositional contrast causing elements heavier than c to appear lighter singh et al 2017 allows for differentiation between mineral and organic material the fs samples show agglomerates of carbonaceous material devoid of macroporous structures mineral constituents are covered with or incorporated into the organic matter in n bc and w bc volatile matter has been thermally degraded besides larger grains of sand that are now visible mineral matter is also shown to be attached to the surface of carbonaceous material and to be trapped in the carbonaceous structures fig 7e indicates that sintering of the material has occurred where mineral components are welded together into a solid aggregate sintering was clearly observable in the full scale process sintered mineral depositions had to be cleared from the reactor on a weekly basis the decomposition of the volatile matter leaves behind macroporous structures that are evident for both n bc and w bc these macropores of a biochar are derived from the cellular structure of the precursor material wildman and derbyshire 1991 and can be seen in cell wall structures preserved in the biochar see fig 7d fig 7f shows that in parts the cell wall structures have been damaged they are permeated by holes this could be explained by the nature of the reactor which admits a limited amount of oxygen to sustain the heat demand of the process the perforated structure suggests that the cell walls were partially oxidised which would have otherwise remained intact in an oxygen free environment the n cbc and w cbc also showed cellular macroporous structures indicating that these not only originate from the added pf but also from undigested fibrous food matter this suggests that higher amounts of fibrous food matter in fs lead to more macroporous structures in the derived biochars the composition of faeces is significantly influenced by the intake of indigestible fibre which is higher for vegetarian and low income country diets rose et al 2015 andhra pradesh has among the smallest fraction of vegetarians 1 75 of all the indian states yet this may suggest fs derived biochars to be more macroporous in states with a higher vegetarian population e g rajasthan punjab or madhya pradesh at 74 9 66 75 and 50 6 respectively statista 2016 biochar has been discussed as a soil amendment improving the physical properties of soil such as the water holding capacity ippolito et al 2015 the main mechanisms driving this improvement are the porous structures inherent to biochar and irregular biochar shapes causing increased void space between soil particles liu et al 2017 therefore soil physical properties are likely to benefit from the macroporosity found in n bc and w bc larger spaces between soil particles in sandy soils cause leaching losses eash et al 2016 the fine nature of these biochars could increase the water retention of such soils by decreasing void space between soil particles 4 conclusions this study assessed and compared the biochar produced by full scale pyrolytic fs treatment at two sites in india co treatment of fs with agricultural waste yielded macroporous powdery biochars whose physical and chemical properties suggest potential applications as solid fuel or soil amendment media the key findings of this study were calorific values were limited by high ash contents but average values as high as 14 9 mj kg in narsapur suggest potential for use as a solid fuel for energy recovery a high liming potential especially for biochars from warangal of 20 1 cce indicate suitability to alleviate acidic soil conditions biochar nutrient concentrations were restricted by the nutrient depleted nature of septic tank fs heavy metals present in fs were concentrated in the biochar however their mobility was considerably reduced especially in the case of cu and zn where mobility dropped by 51 2 65 2 and 48 6 59 6 respectively co processing of fs with other carbon rich waste streams can be used to influence desired biochar properties such as nutrient enrichment and fixed carbon concentrations as well as providing an additional source of energy biochar production for fs treatment has been demonstrated at scale and is now being adopted by an increasing number of municipalities in india this study reports for the first time a comprehensive study of the properties of fs biochar made using a commercial scale system and has provided preliminary evidence informing the end use of fs derived chars moving forward research should focus on possible organic contaminants in fs derived biochars its practical application as a solid fuel and its performance in crop growing trials

sludge from septic tanks and agricultural waste at two full scale treatment plants in india by determining their physical and chemical properties to establish their potential applications the process yielded macroporous powdery biochars that can be utilised for soil amendment or energy recovery average calorific values reaching 14 9 mj kg suggest use as solid fuel but are limited by a high ash

magnesium led to a liming potential of up to 20 1 calcium carbonate equivalents indicating suitability for use on acidic soils heavy metals present in faecal sludge were concentrated in the biochar

such nutrients from fs biochars but do not assess the potential to alleviate acidic soil conditions as observed for biochars produced from animal manure singh et al 2017 gold et al 2018 found fs biochars to breach the total heavy metal concentration limits of international biochar guidelines while this is a main concern for any soil application there is also a need to understand how pyrolysis influences the fate of heavy metals in the environment a reduction in the mobility of heavy metals has been reported in biochars produced from contaminated soil wijesekara et al 2007 and should therefore also be considered for fs previously research on fs biochars has been at laboratory scale only there is a necessity to demonstrate fs treatment technologies for resource recovery at full scale andriessen et al 2019 diener et al 2014 and in light of the sanitation crisis for scaling to occur rapidly strande et al 2014 therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the biochar produced from the first fs treatment plants of their kind operating at full scale in india this encompassed the characterisation of the precursor material its thermal degradation the resulting biochar properties and their applicability as a soil amendment or solid fuel 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling warangal faecal sludge treatment plant 17 56 15 5 n 79 33 31 9 e narsapur faecal sludge treatment plant 16 25 38 2 n 81 42 01 2 e the biochar samples were taken at the fs treatment plants in warangal telangana and narsapur andhra pradesh india in october 2018 both plants receive fs collected from septic tanks in the local area before treatment the fs is stored in holding tanks allowing for homogenisation of its characteristics which vary considerably between individual containments strande et al 2018 it is then dewatered and thermally dried the fs is co treated with pellet fuel pf derived from agricultural waste 0 3 kg pf kg fs dry basis in india agricultural waste is the most frequently used raw material for pf production purohit and chaturvedi 2018 such pf is locally produced and sold but the product does not specify the origin of the agricultural residues the composition will most probably be influenced by the regional and seasonal crops which are available sampling was conducted by incremental cross stream sampling as suggested for continuously produced biochar singh et al 2017 three samples of biochar were collected daily over a four day period resulting in twelve samples from warangal w bc and twelve from narsapur n bc during this period a composite sample of dewatered fs was collected and thermally dried for feedstock characterisation at both warangal w fs and narsapur n fs two batches of control biochar cbc using only solar dried fs which was fed directly to the reactor without pf were produced both at warangal w cbc and narsapur n cbc solar drying was conducted on site for a 10 h period and facilitated by spreading the sludge in a thin layer of approximately 10 mm depth the control batches allow an assessment of the effects on biochar properties from co treated fs and pf compared to the production exclusively from fs 2 2 process configuration fig 2 shows the process configuration of the biomass controls biogenic refinery model 4018 biomass controls llc usa operational in warangal and narsapur the process is specified to treat 360 kg fs day dry basis a feedstock auger 1 transfers the dewatered and thermally dried fs and pf mixture to the reactor inlet above the main reaction chamber 2 where it is delivered into the reaction vessel 3 heat from the main reaction chamber will cause thermal degradation to start in the feedstock auger the chamber receives a limited supply of oxygen through an air fan 4 to allow for partial oxidation enabling autothermal operation the material migrates downwards through the reaction vessel and is removed by two char augers 5 at the base of the vessel which convey it to a collection box 6 2 3 analytical methods the biochar particle size class was determined on site by progressive dry sieving with 500 μm 1000 μm and 2000 μm mesh sizes schmidt et al 2015 all samples were subsequently manually ground sieved to 500 μm and dried to constant weight samples were analysed in triplicate and are reported as mean values the ph was measured by standard method 9045d usepa 2004 adjusting the sample to water ratio to 1 10 and the mixing period to 1 h as recommended for biochar singh et al 2017 caco3 equivalents cce were determined by adding standardised 0 5m hcl to the sample in a 1 20 solid liquid ratio mixing for 2 h followed by a 16 h resting period the suspension was then titrated to ph 7 with 0 25m naoh singh et al 2017 to analyse the inorganic composition of the samples 0 2 g of sample was dry ashed at 500 c according to standard method 3030j apha 1992 the samples were then digested at 95 c for 2 h according to standard method 3050b usepa 1996 to provide a stronger digestion aqua regia was used instead of nitric acid the addition of hydrogen peroxide was omitted due to the preceding dry ashing cycle the mobility of metals in the sample was determined by extraction in a 20 1 liquid solid ratio according to the toxicity standard leaching procedure tclp standard method 1311 usepa 1992 the extractant used for this procedure was 1m hcl to simultaneously determine the plant available fraction of potassium k available in biochars singh et al 2017 plant available phosphorus p available was determined by 2 formic acid extraction wang et al 2012 the analytes from the digestion and extractions were filtered through whatman no 41 filter paper and analysed by icp oes avio 500 perkinelmer usa quality control complied with the spike recovery requirements of standard method 6010d for icp oes analysis usepa 2018 the calorific values were determined by bomb calorimetry parr 6100 calorimeter proximate and thermal analysis was conducted on a pl thermal sciences simultaneous thermal analyser 1500 pl sta 1500 volatile matter fixed carbon and ash content were determined in an automated procedure comprising a drying phase at 105 c and continuous heating to 950 c in an inert nitrogen atmosphere followed by cooling and then combustion in air at 600 c curves for thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetry dtg were obtained by gradually heating 10 c min the sample to 1000 c under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere and recording the weight change for interpretation thermal analysis was conducted for pf and fs to analyse the feedstock s thermal degradation and for cbc to assess the effectiveness of the reactor in achieving full pyrolysis of the feedstock ultimate analysis for chns was performed by medac ltd surrey uk sem images were taken with a tm4000 tabletop microscope hitachi japan 2 4 heavy metal immobilisation the control samples w cbc and n cbc were assessed to quantify any changes in the mobility of heavy metals thus eliminating any inaccuracies stemming from heavy metal contamination through the pf it also avoided errors in the mass balance associated with the approximate mixing of pf and fs by the operators chromium cr copper cu manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn were selected as they have been reported as non labile they largely remain in the solid residue of sewage sludge and solid waste thermal treatment processes chanaka udayanga et al 2018 dong et al 2015 he et al 2010 kistler et al 1987 based on the assumption that these metals are retained shifts in the mobile heavy metal fractions between fs and char were evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 feedstock characterisation the feedstock characteristics are summarised in table 2 ultimate and proximate analysis showed higher levels of c h n volatile matter and fixed carbon in n fs this was attributed to a higher ash content in w fs compared to n fs 47 3 and 25 1 respectively also leading to a lower calorific value 18 3 and 12 3 mj kg respectively high ash contents in fs as in warangal are often associated with grit and sand originating from poorly lined containment structures niwagaba et al 2014 phosphorus p concentrations in w fs and n fs 1 54 and 0 81 g kg respectively were lower than in previous reports for fs e g 31 and 24 g kg in china and uganda respectively liu et al 2014 gold et al 2017 fs from septic tanks may have significantly lower p concentrations as p is largely not retained in the septic tank sludge septic tanks only separating the solid from the liquid fraction cairncross and feachem 1993 discharge soluble p only 20 30 of total p is expected to settle lusk et al 2017 further this organically bound and condensed p is hydrolysed over time to form soluble orthophosphate leaving in the effluent wilhelm et al 1994 gill et al 2009 the results from thermal analysis for pf w fs and n fs are shown in fig 3 any weight losses below 180 c seen for fs and pf are caused by drying and dehydration reactions magdziarz and werle 2014 pf shows the typical weight loss between 150 and 500 c caused by the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin basu 2010 while the weight loss for fs is also associated with the decomposition of carbohydrates protein and fats ward et al 2014 liu et al 2014 both pf and fs reach maximum weight loss rates between 340 and 350 c the cessation of weight loss from approximately 500 c onwards for fs and 400 c for pf indicates that the main pyrolysis reactions are complete from an energy standpoint this suggests that operating under conditions that expose the feedstock particles to 500 c would be sufficient for biochar production however the whole system must be considered to ensure enough heat is generated for thermal drying of the feedstock a further weight loss peak between 650 and 750 c was observed for the fs which has also been reported for sewage sludge and has been attributed to the decomposition of carbonates kwon et al 2018 in this temperature range calcium and magnesium carbonates decompose from caco3 and mgco3 to cao and mgo respectively the co2 formed in these reactions causes the observed weight loss 3 2 solid fuel characteristics among many other parameters the solid fuel characteristics of w bc and n bc are given in table 3 higher average hhvs of n bc compared to w bc are associated with a lower ash content in the char resulting from the lower ash content of the precursor material the hhvs reported here are in agreement with those reported for fs derived chars produced at temperatures between 450 and 750 c being 8 8 17 91 mj kg gold et al 2018 ward et al 2014 a comparison with the control samples shows that the omission of pf with its high fixed carbon and low ash content of 14 4 and 8 3 respectively decreased the derived char hhvs by 6 7 and 49 5 between n bc and n cbc and between w bc and w cbc respectively this finding supports recommendations to blend fs with other biomass before pyrolysis to lower the ash content improving the fuel quality of the derived chars andriessen et al 2019 the high average volatile matter of 20 3 in narsapur and 14 2 in warangal can be explained by three factors evident from the tga and dtg plots of w cbc and n cbc firstly non completion of the main pyrolysis reactions causes residual weight loss between 150 and 500 c secondly carbonates are only partially decomposed in the process as seen by the dtg peak between 650 and 750 c thirdly continued heating from 750 c to 1000 c as part of proximate analysis causes further continuous weight loss due to ongoing carbonisation at temperatures higher than those reached in the treatment process experience shows energy recovery from fs to be more profitable than the production of soil amendments diener et al 2014 dried fs in uganda and senegal with similar calorific values to n bc and w bc 10 9 13 4 mj kg was deemed suitable as an industrial fuel for brick kilns gold et al 2017 suggesting a similar use for these chars however the most suitable end use of the fs derived products will depend on local economic and social conditions and should be based upon market studies reymond 2014 3 3 agronomic value both n bc and w bc had alkaline ph values averaging 10 5 and 10 8 respectively biochars typically show an alkaline ph as the fraction of inorganic elements increases in pyrolysis relative to the feedstock novak et al 2009 and as acidic functional groups on the material s surface are lost mukherjee et al 2011 while these values indicate that the char might be suitable for liming acidic soils a more quantifiable method is the assessment of calcium carbonate equivalents cce ippolito et al 2015 average cce values of 13 8 and 20 1 were found for n bc and w bc respectively they lie in a similar range to the liming potential of biochars from other excreta derived feedstock including sewage sludge cattle and poultry manure wang et al 2012 singh et al 2017 the high liming potential is associated with high concentrations of ca and mg accordingly high cumulative concentrations of 72 2 and 115 4 g kg were found for n cbc and w cbc respectively and positive correlation r 2 0 806 between cce and cumulative ca and mg concentrations fig 4 the presence of carbonates in the biochars observed by tga may indicate that carbonate species were only partially thermally degraded to ca and mg oxides however it is likely that the carbonates were reformed upon cooling exposure to moisture and co2 cause ca and mg oxides to react to hydroxides and carbonates housecroft and sharpe 2012 the speciation of ca and mg is of subordinate importance to the product quality of the biochars their carbonates oxides and hydroxides may all be used for liming purposes as they all react with water and co2 to form the bicarbonates that help neutralise acidic soil conditions brady and weil 2008 nutrient concentrations of 1 2gp kg and 8 1gk kg were measured for n bc and 2 2gp kg and 11 7gk kg for w bc there remains a paucity of published data on the nutrient content of fs derived biochars as discussed for the feedstock the derived biochars also show considerably lower p concentrations compared to other fs derived biochars which are typically between 31 and 81gp kg gold et al 2018 liu et al 2014 woldetsadik et al 2018 in this case study the process is limited by the quality of the feedstock feeding material with higher p concentrations e g as reported in ghana nartey et al 2017 cofie et al 2009 would improve the fertilising value of the derived chars compared to p the k concentrations were in closer agreement to literature values between 19 and 29gk kg woldetsadik et al 2018 liu et al 2014 however the higher k concentrations in the pf compared to n fs and w fs indicate that the addition of pf improved the fertilising value of the resulting biochar a comparison between the control samples and those with addition of pf shows that all elements associated with the ash fraction ca mg k p increase in the control sample except for k potassium concentrations remain equal for n bc and n cbc and drop from w bc to w cbc confirming the benefit of co feeding pf to produce biochar for fertilising purposes p available and k available as a fraction of total concentrations were between 71 9 and 77 7 for k and 53 7 61 0 for p this partial availability of p caused by the transformation into more stable forms through pyrolysis has been deemed beneficial to agriculture as p is released over longer periods of time dai et al 2016 both pyrolysis temperature and biomass addition will influence p availability zwetsloot et al 2015 but the precise mechanisms of p transformation and consequences for p availability are still uncertain wang et al 2012 for many biochars available k is equivalent to total k schmidt et al 2015 which was not confirmed for fs derived biochars it has been suggested that entrapment of k into the carbon structure as well as bonding into more stable forms causes this immobilisation kong et al 2014 heavy metals in the feedstock are concentrated in the ash fraction of the derived biochars beesley et al 2015 caballero et al 1997 the origin of heavy metals in fs besides the excretion through humans include industrial effluents leachate infiltration from solid waste dumps or illegal disposal of hazardous materials such as batteries to latrines appiah effah et al 2015 the heavy metal concentrations found in this study are summarised in table 3 all heavy metal concentrations were within the ceiling concentration limits set out by the usepa walker et al 1994 and the limit values set by the eu eec 1986 for land application of sludge apart from pb in n bc w bc and n bc also comply with the biochar specific guidelines issued by the international biochar initiative ibi 2015 the chars did not comply with the stricter limits for biochar of the european biochar initiative ebc 2019 concentrations of zn pb ni and cu in n bc and w bc all breached ebc limits besides heavy metal contamination pathogenic contamination is a main concern when recovering resources from fs kengne et al 2014 especially in agriculture due to the high process temperatures pyrolysis is known to eliminate any pathogens within seconds liu et al 2014 therefore as in previous fs pyrolysis studies woldetsadik et al 2018 gold et al 2018 ward et al 2014 full pathogen destruction can be assumed 3 4 heavy metal mobility with respect to heavy metal concentrations notable variation was observed with relative standard deviations ranging between 10 3 and 30 5 in n bc and w bc given that fs is fed to the process in batches and the holding tanks allow for only limited homogenisation the batch delivery is likely to be one cause of these variations in addition the ratios of co treated pf are approximate regarding the heavy metal concentrations it should be considered that their bioavailability is influenced by pyrolysis sequential extractions of sewage sludge biochars showed that the majority of heavy metals were transformed from exchangeable and acid leachable forms to non bioavailable forms jin et al 2016 fig 5 compares the leachable fractions of heavy metals between fs and biochar to evaluate their mobility mobility is expressed as the fraction of the hcl extractable and acid digestible concentrations analysis showed for example that cd cr and cu were 10 4 20 0 and 28 1 leachable from n bc and 8 9 27 1 and 24 6 leachable from w bc respectively except for ni the mobility of all heavy metals was higher in the fs compared to the derived biochars as shown in fig 5 e g cu leachability dropped from 86 5 in n fs to 28 6 in n bc the comparison between fs and control samples avoids possible contamination introduced by the pf table 4 shows the shifts in mobility of non labile heavy metals induced by the treatment process leachable fractions 100 for zn are likely to be attributable to losses during the dry ashing step preceding acid digestion immobilisation is evident for all non labile heavy metals apart from ni the highest reductions in mobility were achieved for cu cr and zn which dropped by 51 2 59 2 and 59 6 in narsapur and by 55 0 65 2 and 48 6 in warangal respectively again no immobilisation was observed for ni confirming the observations for n bc and w bc these results agree with reductions of cu pb and zn mobility through pyrolysis reported for contaminated soil wijesekara et al 2007 further the addition of pf may have enhanced immobilisation co pyrolysis of contaminated soil with woody biomass was shown to decrease heavy metal mobility depending on process temperature type of heavy metal and extent of biomass addition debela et al 2012 this was attributed to encapsulation within the biochar structure 3 5 particle size distribution and structural analysis the particle size distribution of n bc and w bc showed the largest particle fraction to be 500 μm namely 43 8 and 60 0 respectively see fig 6 using the classification put forward by schmidt et al 2015 n bc can be described as blended powder w bc as fine powder particle size will be influenced not only by feedstock characteristics but also by the process itself cetin et al 2004 high heating rates in particular given in fast pyrolysis produce fine biochars bruun et al 2012 the combination of the high heating rates within a continuous reactor and the particulate nature of dried fs are likely to be responsible for the resulting fine particle classes additionally the handling mechanisms of the process contribute to a smaller particle size such as auger feeds breaking up particles fig 7 shows sem images of fs and biochars the compositional contrast causing elements heavier than c to appear lighter singh et al 2017 allows for differentiation between mineral and organic material the fs samples show agglomerates of carbonaceous material devoid of macroporous structures mineral constituents are covered with or incorporated into the organic matter in n bc and w bc volatile matter has been thermally degraded besides larger grains of sand that are now visible mineral matter is also shown to be attached to the surface of carbonaceous material and to be trapped in the carbonaceous structures fig 7e indicates that sintering of the material has occurred where mineral components are welded together into a solid aggregate sintering was clearly observable in the full scale process sintered mineral depositions had to be cleared from the reactor on a weekly basis the decomposition of the volatile matter leaves behind macroporous structures that are evident for both n bc and w bc these macropores of a biochar are derived from the cellular structure of the precursor material wildman and derbyshire 1991 and can be seen in cell wall structures preserved in the biochar see fig 7d fig 7f shows that in parts the cell wall structures have been damaged they are permeated by holes this could be explained by the nature of the reactor which admits a limited amount of oxygen to sustain the heat demand of the process the perforated structure suggests that the cell walls were partially oxidised which would have otherwise remained intact in an oxygen free environment the n cbc and w cbc also showed cellular macroporous structures indicating that these not only originate from the added pf but also from undigested fibrous food matter this suggests that higher amounts of fibrous food matter in fs lead to more macroporous structures in the derived biochars the composition of faeces is significantly influenced by the intake of indigestible fibre which is higher for vegetarian and low income country diets rose et al 2015 andhra pradesh has among the smallest fraction of vegetarians 1 75 of all the indian states yet this may suggest fs derived biochars to be more macroporous in states with a higher vegetarian population e g rajasthan punjab or madhya pradesh at 74 9 66 75 and 50 6 respectively statista 2016 biochar has been discussed as a soil amendment improving the physical properties of soil such as the water holding capacity ippolito et al 2015 the main mechanisms driving this improvement are the porous structures inherent to biochar and irregular biochar shapes causing increased void space between soil particles liu et al 2017 therefore soil physical properties are likely to benefit from the macroporosity found in n bc and w bc larger spaces between soil particles in sandy soils cause leaching losses eash et al 2016 the fine nature of these biochars could increase the water retention of such soils by decreasing void space between soil particles 4 conclusions this study assessed and compared the biochar produced by full scale pyrolytic fs treatment at two sites in india co treatment of fs with agricultural waste yielded macroporous powdery biochars whose physical and chemical properties suggest potential applications as solid fuel or soil amendment media the key findings of this study were calorific values were limited by high ash contents but average values as high as 14 9 mj kg in narsapur suggest potential for use as a solid fuel for energy recovery a high liming potential especially for biochars from warangal of 20 1 cce indicate suitability to alleviate acidic soil conditions biochar nutrient concentrations were restricted by the nutrient depleted nature of septic tank fs heavy metals present in fs were concentrated in the biochar however their mobility was considerably reduced especially in the case of cu and zn where mobility dropped by 51 2 65 2 and 48 6 59 6 respectively co processing of fs with other carbon rich waste streams can be used to influence desired biochar properties such as nutrient enrichment and fixed carbon concentrations as well as providing an additional source of energy biochar production for fs treatment has been demonstrated at scale and is now being adopted by an increasing number of municipalities in india this study reports for the first time a comprehensive study of the properties of fs biochar made using a commercial scale system and has provided preliminary evidence informing the end use of fs derived chars moving forward research should focus on possible organic contaminants in fs derived biochars its practical application as a solid fuel and its performance in crop growing trials

18358,extracellular polymeric substances eps in wastewater sludge form a network structure that is highly hydrophilic and compressible thus chemical conditioning is always required to improve sludge dewaterability by changing the gelatinous structure of sludge flocs layered double hydroxides ldh are generally characterized by large surface area and high anion exchange capacity so we prepared three types of hydrotalcite like compounds ca mg al ldhs from a typical solid waste blast furnace slag using naoh precipitation giving ldha a hydrothermal method ldhb and naoh na2co3 precipitation ldhc the physicochemical properties of the three ldh were comprehensively characterized and their effectiveness as sludge conditioners was evaluated the results showed that ldh conditioning was able to promote sludge dewaterability and conditioning efficiency was strongly dependent on ldh structural properties ldh neutralized the negative charges onto sludge particles and interacted with eps to increase floc strength ldh also formed a skeletal structure that reduced sludge compressibility in addition there were interactions between the ldh surfaces and the oc oh in eps proteins which altered the secondary structure of protein molecules consequently increasing sludge dewaterability the biomolecules of low molecular weight fractions such as peptides and humic acids in soluble eps intercalated ldh both the surface complexation of organic matter containing carboxyl groups and the intercalation of small molecules in soluble eps were responsible for eps ldh interactions the combination of skeleton formation electrostatic interaction and eps ldh interactions resulted in compression of gel like structure and improved sludge dewatering performance we finally suggested a novel sludge treatment process that increases sludge dewaterability using slag derived ca mg al ldh to condition the sludge and it could be combined with pyrolysis to prepare multi functional

treatment technology and the treatment by product waste activated sludge was have attracted much attention you et al 2017 ai et al 2019 sludge is characterized by high moisture content and contains abundant organic matters niu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 therefore dewatering sludge is exceedingly important for reducing sludge volume to be disposed sludge is a heterogeneous colloidal system with non newtonian fluid properties and it has long been recognized that sludge dewaterability depends on the physicochemical properties of biocolloids mikkelsen and keiding 2002 zhang et al 2016 extracellular polymeric substances eps which account for 60 80 of sludge mass are important in floc structure its surface charge and floc stability lin et al 2019 eps is an extremely complex composite of proteins polysaccharides humic acids nucleic acids and other organic substances wingender et al 1999 flemming et al 2016 and proteins and polysaccharides constitute more than 70 of eps mass tsuneda et al 2003 chen et al 2017 the negatively charged eps form a gel like network so the sludge is viscoelastic and highly compressible many studies have demonstrated that the properties of eps affect sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2015a wu et al 2016 li et al 2018 a high level of proteins and polysaccharides in the eps matrix decreases sludge dewaterability higgins and novak 1997a 1997b lin et al 2019 and their complexes glycosylated proteins also form gels that create a barrier around cells and prevent them from dewatering christensen 1999 tan et al 2015 eps can be separated into five fractions by different methods depending on the strength of the bonds between biopolymers and microbial cells supernatant slime soluble eps loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellets zhang et al 2015b it has been found that sludge dewaterability is mainly influenced by soluble eps and lb eps fractions zhang et al 2015a more recently zhen et al 2019 showed that eps distribution and composition were highly variable and that protein concentration in the soluble eps fraction significantly affected sludge dewatering behaviour sludge is difficult to dewater because eps is highly hydrated so chemical conditioning is always required to improve the performance of mechanical dewatering processes yang et al 2019 various chemical conditioning treatments have been widely used to reduce the hydrophilia of was biopolymers and to improve sludge dewaterability including coagulation and flocculation zhang et al 2017 acidification zhang et al 2015c alkaline pretreatment liu et al 2019 and fenton oxidation faye et al 2019 coagulation flocculation is the most commonly used technique in sludge treatment due to its low cost and simplicity of operation inorganic coagulants are always included in sludge conditioners because the hydrolyzed products of inorganic salts can form skeletal structures consequently increasing sludge floc cohesion cao et al 2016 moreover surface complexation and charge neutralization during the conditioning process are mainly responsible for the compression of the gel like structure to improve sludge dewaterability layered double hydroxides ldh are a group of compounds derived from mineral brucite having the general formula m2 1 xm3 x oh 2 x an x n mh2o where m2 and m3 are divalent and trivalent metal cations in the octahedra of the brucite layer cavani et al 1991 divalent metal cations can be substituted by isomorphous trivalent metal cations so the outer layers acquire positive ions the an are the intercalated charge compensating anions which complete the formation of charge neutral ldh mallakpour and dinari 2015 ldh have a high specific surface area disperse effectively and possess excellent anion exchange capacities these properties make them good candidate material for the flocculation and adsorption of various pollutants wen et al 2013 santos et al 2017 kim et al 2017 investigated the relationships between ldh and algal flocculation and found that the positive surface charge density of ldh was of great importance in the interaction between algal cells and ldh minerals zou et al 2016 found that graphene oxide nanocomposites coagulated onto ldh cl and ldh co3 through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds sun et al 2017 incorporated anionic organic matter into as synthesized ldh by ion exchange and formed organo ldh which could be an efficient approach to remove surfactant from aqueous solution ldh can be synthesized from industrial wastes and their structure and function can be determined by varying the preparation conditions blast furnace slag bfs is a by product of steel and iron making it contains a high proportion of metal species ca mg al fe ti and mn making it an economical and effective adsorbent for large scale utilization yang et al 2013 ren et al 2014 yan 2012 more recently it was reported that bfs was used to synthesize ldh by extracting metal components via acidic treatment shi et al 2016 which could be economical and widely applicable for instance gao et al 2017a compared the effectiveness of various slag based functional materials in adsorbing methyl orange mo and found that ldh removed mo better than other materials through chemisorption in the interlayers the complex composition of metal hydroxide sheets and the specific anions within layers contribute to the excellent adsorption by ldh of organic pollutants in an aqueous environment in this work we synthesized three forms of ca mg al ldh from bfs and used them as chemical conditioners to increase the dewaterability of was the relationships between the ca mg al ldh structures and sludge conditioning efficiency were examined the changes in sludge eps and floc morphology due to different ca mg al ldhs conditioning were investigated the interactions between ca mg al ldhs and eps were investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm to identify the sludge conditioning mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials we obtained was from the north creek sewage treatment plant in beijing china the sludge characteristics are given in table 1 bfs was supplied by the zhongyang steel co ltd its elemental composition is shown in table s1 all chemical reagents used were analytical grade and were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd in china deionized water was used throughout the experiments 2 2 synthesis of ca mg al ldhs three different ca mg al ldhs ldhx x a b or c were synthesized by precipitation or hydrothermal treatment seida et al 1998 prior to preparation of ldha the bfs was first ground into powder using an agate mortar and screened using a 75 μm mesh the powdered slag 10 g was dispersed into 200 ml of 30 hcl and vigorously stirred at 100 rpm for 20 h at 85 c the suspension was then filtered to obtain a supernatant containing various metal cations the supernatant 100 ml was titrated with an alkaline solution naoh 2 mol l until the ph was near 11 5 and then it was aged for 24 h at 65 c the final product was collected by centrifugation washed several times with deionized water and powdered by freeze drying to prepare ldhb the supernatant was titrated with an alkaline solution naoh 2 mol l until the ph was near 11 5 and then it was aged for 24 h at 110 c likewise the supernatant containing metal cations was used to prepare carbonate intercalated ca mg al ldh denoted as ldhc generally the supernatant was slowly dropped into a na2co3 solution 100 ml 0 0375 mol l stirring at 80 rpm in the meanwhile the ph of the mixture was adjusted to 11 5 by adding naoh 2 mol l then the mixture was stirred for another 20 h at 85 c ldhc powder was formed and washed with deionized water for several times then centrifuged and freeze dried overnight for use 2 3 sludge conditioning procedure the effects of ldh on the dewaterability performance and structural properties of activated sludge were investigated using different ldhx dosage 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 g g tss each batch experiment was performed in 500 ml

gradient for 2 min followed by stirring at 62 25 s 1 for 10 min after addition of ldhx after that a certain amount of conditioned sludge was taken for further analysis 2 4 interactions between eps and ldh eps was extracted from the solids suspended in the sludge using a cation exchange resin frolund et al 1996 and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and the contents of protein and polysaccharide were measured chen et al 2015 standard adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanisms of the interactions between ldh and eps fractions the batch adsorption experiments were carried out using glass bottles that were shaken at 150 rpm at a temperature of 25 1 c the residual amounts of adsorbates were measured by uv spectrophotometry at 750 nm for proteins using the lowry folin method and at 630 nm for polysaccharides using the anthrone method xu et al 2018 the tests for isothermal adsorption were performed by adding the initial adsorbent doses 0 1 2 0 g l for ldhx into a 50 ml solution that was shaken for 24 h until the reaction equilibrium was reached and the most effective dose was selected for use in subsequent procedures 1 8 g l for ldha and 1 6 g l for ldhb and ldhc the kinetic adsorption tests were carried out at initial concentrations of 189 9 mg l protein and 63 3 mg l polysaccharide and the supernatants were sampled at various time intervals up to 24 h during the reaction time the eps ldh complexes were also characterized using xps ft ir and clsm 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 sludge dewaterability assessment sludge dewaterability was

minerals were detected using ft ir vertex 70 bruker co ltd germany deconvolution of protein amide i region was conducted by assuming a gaussian line shape for each separate peak by peakfit v4 12 curve fitting software the morphologies of ldhx before and after coagulation were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su8010 hitachi japan change in the surface composition of materials was detected using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds on a hitachi su8010 more detailed information about the materials and the coagulation mechanisms was obtained by xps thermo escalab 250 spectrometer usa zeta potential and sludge particle size were measured with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of materials was

and standard deviations were calculated means differences between the compressibility coefficients were compared using analysis of variance anova and tukey test p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of ldhx ldhx crystal morphologies were characterized by sem a typical layered structure was observed and the surface of each ldhx was clearly smooth fig 1 the ldha crystals were uneven and thin fig 1a aggregating with occasional overlapping and interleaving with a particle size of 2 10 μm particle size was shown in table s2 the ldhb crystals consisted of homogeneous sheets fig 1b with a particle size of 11 7 μm table s2 the ldhc crystals consisted of uniform sheets fig 1c with an average size of 27 5 μm table s2 most of ldhc plates were agglomerated which was attributed to the effects of the attachment of various solid phases such as caco3 to the layered structure zou et al 2017 the bet data table s2 suggested that the ldhx with better defined crystallinity had a higher specific surface area thus the distinct mineral morphology of the as prepared ldhx might show different flocculation behaviours in sludge conditioning the sharp peaks in xrd patterns also indicated that the ldhx were highly crystallized fig 2 a consistent with the sem images the xrd peaks were identified as the hydrotalcite like phases according to the standard diffraction patterns pdf 78 1219 and pdf 89 460 of the international center for diffraction data chen et al 2016 gao et al 2017a as indicated by the typical planes of 003 006 009 and 110 the xrd patterns of ldhx showed a layered structure and the diffraction peaks of 100 015 and 018 also showed the hydrotalcite like structure of the ldhx zhang et al 2012a the layer spacing of the ldhx was dependent on the basal spacing d 003 which was calculated as 7 84 å ldha 7 84 å ldhb and 7 91 å ldhc table s2 zhang et al 2012b gasser et al 2008 interestingly the larger particle size and lower bet surface area appeared simultaneously for ldhc table s2 and new peaks of 36 at 2θ were observed for ldhc this result implied that mixed carbonates of calcium magnesium and aluminium were formed and that they hindered the formation of the layered structure in synthesis shao et al 2011 xps and ft ir analysis were performed to investigate the element distribution and types of bonds of different ca mg al ldhs table s3 and fig 2c showed the phase composition of ca mg al ldhs that o c ca mg and al were the principal elements in ldhx the distribution of functional groups was explained by the xps o1s spectra resolution fig 2d f the o1s spectra of all ldhx could be deconvoluted into three metal oxide bonds ca o al o and mg o zou et al 2017 the bonds in ldhx were also shown by ft ir analysis fig 2b the common peaks observed around 3470 cm 1 were assigned to the o h stretching vibrations of interlayer water molecules shafiei et al 2013 and the bending vibrations of the interlayer water δh o h occurred at 1600 1650 cm 1 in the spectra of ldha and ldhb abdelkader et al 2011 meanwhile the peaks at 1500 cm 1 were related to the asymmetric stretching vibration of co3 2 lin et al 2013 and the strong peak of ldhc was mainly from the interlayer due to naoh na2co3 precipitation during ldhc synthesis in the low frequency region the peaks at 792 cm 1 and 582 cm 1 were assigned to m o vibrations and m o h bending m ca al or mg yu et al 2010 wen et al 2013 indicating the presence of layered metal hydroxides the results showed that the ca mg al ldhs with different structure were successfully synthesized by changing the reaction conditions 3 2 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on sludge properties 3 2 1 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on sludge dewaterability as shown in fig 3 and table 2 srf decreased and then reached an equilibrium when the ldhx dose was increased from 0 025 g g tss to 0 2 g g tss fig 3a the srf values decreased from 3 56 1013 m kg to 2 23 1013 m kg ldha 1 65 1013 m kg ldhb and 2 52 1013 m kg ldhc the change of cst is presented in fig 3b cst values gradually decreased as the ldhx dosage increased and that of sludge conditioned with ldhb reached a minimum of 80 6 s 0 2 g g tss from an initial 225 s for ldha and ldhc the decrease of cst values did not reach the equilibrium there results suggested that ldha and ldhc were less effective in sludge conditioning than ldhb the differences in the conditioning effects of ldhx were related to the structural properties of ldhx and the various processes that occurred during sludge conditioning with ldhx such as electrical neutralization surface complexation and interlayer anion exchange for example the abundant oxygen bonds and positive surface charges in ldhx provide many active sites probably increasing adsorption of eps through electrical neutralization and complexation seida and nakano 2000 the findings of this work on this matter are presented in subsequent sections the high compressibility of was results in sludge flocs being deformed during the compression stage which cause sludge cake voids closed and hold moisture resulting in sludge filterability deteriorated ning et al 2013 in order to understand the dewatering behaviour of non newtonian fluid it was crucial to evaluate the compressibility of sludge under chemical conditioning qi et al 2011 the effects of different ldhx on cake compressibility are presented in fig 3c the coefficient of compressibility of raw sludge was 1 632 and it decreased after chemical conditioning with ldh as presented in fig 3c at optimal ldh dosage of 0 2 g g tss the compressibility coefficient from ldhb conditioned 1 393 was lower than that from ldha 1 59 and ldhc 1 57 it was observed from table s4 to table s6 that the compressibility coefficients of sludge cake were reduced after conditioning by three ldhs and the cake compressibility coefficient of sludge treated by ldhb was significantly lower than that conditioned by ldha and ldhc this observation was consistent with cst tests cao et al 2016 suggested that the lower compressibility coefficient was always related to better dewatering property of sludge thus it was demonstrated that ldhx form skeletal structures during conditioning which increased floc strength and released moisture moreover it was clear that the sludge flocs conditioned by ldhb was more compact than that conditioned by ldha and ldhc 3 2 2 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on sludge floc properties sludge flocs are always negatively charged due to the ionization of anionic groups of carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphates in the constituents of eps wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 the negative charge prevents flocs from aggregating making the sludge highly compressible the zeta potential of sludge flocs for the different ldh treatments increased gradually as the ldhx dose increased see in fig 4 a table 2 ldhb conditioning led to a maximum increase in zeta potential from 28 1 mv to 12 26 mv conditioning with ldha which had the highest positive surface charge resulted in a lower increase to 14 6 mv thus it was reasonable to consider that there was another factor in stabilizing the negatively charged flocs and this inference was confirmed by the fact that the ldh showed high capacity in removing soluble oxyanions e g phosphates chlorides and sulfates through surface complexation fig s1 cheng et al 2009 these anions could be derived from the macromolecules of the eps matrix boleij et al 2018 thus two processes could cause charge neutralization neutralization between electronegative sludge flocs and the positively charged outer surface of ldh and the stabilization of anion groups in the sludge by outer surface active sites of ldh ldhc showed the least charge neutralization effect on sludge flocs table s2 because the ldhc was synthesized in a strongly alkaline environment kloprogge et al 2004 the mixed metal oxides were not soluble in the alkaline environment and competed in the formation of hydrotalcite like matter saha et al 2018 because of the solubility of mx m ca al or mg mixed metal oxides were the predominant phase precipitated at this high ph so the surface charge of the outer layers of ldhc was lower than that of the other two ldhx as shown in fig 4b and table 2 slight increase in sludge floc size were observed indicating that flocculation and bridging were not dominant mechanisms in ldh conditioning 3 2 3 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on microstructure of sludge floc sludge floc morphology after ldhx conditioning was observed by fe sem fig s2 the surface of the raw sludge cake was relatively smooth fig s2a but the floc structure became rough and porous after conditioning the floc aggregated slightly with the small flaky ldha platelets fig s2b in comparison the pores in sludge cake conditioned with ldhb and ldhc were well developed and exhibited clear floc aggregation where abundant granules were distributed and overlapping crystals were stacked figs s2c s2d these observations showed that both floc strength and cake porosity were increased with ca mg al ldh conditioning and the plentiful pores in the cake were helpful to release free water under mechanical compression 3 2 4 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on eps properties fig s3 showed the concentrations of different eps fractions under ldhx conditioning the s eps lb eps and tb eps content decreased and reached the minimum at a dose of 0 15 g g tss for different ldhx this was likely that hydrotalcite like compounds could bind with biopolymers consequently decreasing eps content through surface complexation and electrostatic interactions previous studies found that a decrease in both s eps and lb eps fractions increased floc cohesion and improved sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 the decreases in s eps and lb eps fractions after ldhx conditioning increased floc density thereby decreasing cake compressibility specifically ldhb performed best in binding eps fractions which was consistent with the sludge dewaterability tests by comparison ldhc showed less charge neutralization capacity and ldha had a lower specific surface area both of which reduced eps binding ability fig s4 showed the main fluorescent intensities of various components of eps fractions given by parallel factor parafac analysis there were three components in eps fractions with ex em peaks centered at 230 280 350 nm c1 235 315 405 nm c2 and 255 360 430 nm c3 chen et al 2003 c1 was related to tyrosine protein like substances and tryptophan protein like substances tpn c2 was associated with aromatic protein like ii substances apn ii and tpn and c3 was associated with humic like substances ha and fulvic like compounds fa changes in the maximum fluorescence intensities fimax of s eps and lb eps after conditioning with ldhx were shown in fig 5 there was no distinct change in the fluorescence intensity of lb eps implying that the biopolymers in lb eps hardly coagulated with ca mg al ldh the fimax levels of protein like substances c1 in s eps decreased as the ldhx dose increased while the fluorescence intensities of c2 and c3 showed no apparent changes under ldhx conditioning suggesting that ca mg al ldh coagulated well the protein like substances of high molecular weight ldhb adsorbed the protein like substances in eps more readily than ldha and ldhc confirming that the coagulation ability of hydrotalcite like materials were dependent on their structural properties the combination of organic matters with ldhx was attributed to charge neutralization surface complexation and anion exchange razani and dadkhah tehrani 2019 monash and pugazhenthi 2014 xia et al 2017 the amount of adsorbed matter on the surface of ldhx was correlated with bet surface area and the functional groups that were observed table s2 and fig 2b and exchange adsorption depended on the ionic strength of the different ldh vreysen and maes 2008 carbonate ions were retained by ldh much more than chloride or hydroxide anions miyata 1983 thus it was difficult for them to exchange with other anions therefore adsorption of organic matter onto ldhc was likely because of stronger surface complexation rather than by anion exchange in addition ldhc showed little surface electrostatic strength so its charge neutralization effectiveness as a sludge conditioner was limited by comparison the lower anionic strengths of ldha and ldhb contributed to a significant adsorption exchange and small organic molecules might be intercalated into the ldh yu et al 2010 thus it was reasonable to consider that less available surface area and poorer crystallinity of ldha resulted in a lack active sites on ldh surface to adsorb biopolymers while its abundant positive surface charge made it an efficient charge neutralizer during sludge conditioning fig 4 in contrast ldhb had better crystallinity and higher anion exchange capacity making it more effective in increasing sludge dewaterability than other ldhs 3 3 interactions between eps and ca mg al ldhs 3 3 1 adsorption of eps on different ca mg al ldhs 3 3 1 1 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of the main components of eps proteins and polysaccharides were obtained at 25 c to investigate ca mg al ldh adsorption the adsorption data were fitted using the langmuir eq 1 and freundlich eq 2 equations the two standard isotherm equations are 1 c e q e c e q m 1 b q m 2 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in eps mg l q e and q m are the quantities of adsorbate at equilibrium and maximum mg g b is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l mg and n and k f mg 1 n l1 n g are the freundlich adsorption equilibrium constants the langmuir isotherms for protein and polysaccharide adsorption onto ca mg al ldhs were shown in fig s5 and the relevant parameters computed from the two models are summarized in table 3 the adsorption capacities varied between the ldhx the maximum sorption capacity of proteins was calculated to be 24 68 mg g and of polysaccharides was 22 70 mg g on ldhb the langmuir equation better described the adsorption isotherms of proteins and polysaccharides onto ldhx with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 95 indicating that the adsorption was a monolayer coverage of the homogeneous surface sites 3 3 1 2 adsorption dynamics the kinetics of protein and polysaccharide adsorption onto ldhx were shown in fig 6 during the first stage abundant binding sites were available for the adsorption of both substances and adsorption increased rapidly from the time of initial contact the adsorption rates slowed down rapidly after 2 h because most of the active sites on the surface were occupied and adsorption continued in the ca mg al ldh interlayer fig 6a b protein adsorption reached equilibrium after 24 h for ldha and ldhb and 4 h for ldhc indicating that there was little adsorption due to ion exchange on the ldhc interlayer we attributed this to the initial concentration of polysaccharides 63 3 mg l being less than that of proteins 189 9 mg l the total adsorption efficiencies of proteins were 60 66 and 42 for ldha ldhb ldhc and that of polysaccharides were 46 54 and 39 for ldha ldhb ldhc fig 6c d confirming that ldhb was more effective in coagulating biopolymers these results suggested that ldhx were promising materials for the preparation of multi functional pyrolyzed sludge carbon because of the ability of calcined ldh ldo to remove anionic pollutants goh et al 2008 the pseudo first order eq 3 and pseudo second order eq 4 kinetic equations were used to model protein and polysaccharide adsorption onto ca mg al ldh the nonlinear fittings of the models are 3 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q t mg g and q e mg g are the quantities of proteins and polysaccharides adsorbed on ca mg al ldh at time t min and equilibrium e k 1 1 min and k 2 g mg min are constants of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models the values of q e k 1 and k 2 are obtained from the linear plots of ln q e q t vs t or t q t vs t the fitting results of the experimental data were shown in fig s6 and table 4 the highest r 2 values were observed in the pseudo second order model r 2 0 98 and the theoretical values of q e for ldhx which were calculated using the pseudo second order model were much closer to the experimental values of q e these results indicated that the adsorption of proteins and polysaccharides on ca mg al ldh was better fitted by the pseudo second order model many studies have suggested that the adsorption of organic matter on hydrotalcite like minerals involved the valence force through sharing or exchanging electrons barriga et al 2002 legrouri et al 2005 implying that the adsorption of eps on ca mg al ldh was dominated by chemical reactions which we investigated as described in the following sections 3 3 2 microstructure of eps ldh complexes the morphologies of eps and eps ldh complexes were characterized by sem fig s7a showed the presence of near plate crystallite and sharp particle edges in the original eps after ldhx flocculation figs s7b 7d eps was interconnected with many ldhx crystals to form aggregates showing a honeycomb structure most ldhx crystals maintained an identical layered morphology suggesting that eps was adsorbed on the external surface and interlayers of ldhx without destroying the hierarchical structure the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to explore the distribution of elements on the nanomaterials figs s7b 7d showed the elements adsorbed on the ldhx the three elements c n and o that represent organic matter were distributed on the layered structure in contrast to the raw eps fig s7a the organic substances were aggregately deposited on the surface of ldhx adsorbents in other words the high m o m ca al or mg content on the ldh surface promoted the flocculation of eps fractions seida and nakano 2000 which probably occurred in conjunction with other physicochemical processes of sludge conditioning 3 3 3 ft ir analysis of eps ldhx complexes ft ir was used to reveal the interaction between ldhx outer layers and the functional groups of eps the ft ir spectra of eps ldhx and eps ldhx complexes were shown in fig s8 the functional groups of eps were divided into four categories hydrocarbons amide groups in proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids as shown in table s7 badireddy et al 2008 the bands at 1654 1417 1067 869 and 792 cm 1 in the eps and eps ldhx complexes represent functional groups such as nh2 co c oh c o c co nh c n and n h and ring vibrations in eps fractions proteins polysaccharides and aromatic acids the bands at 1067 cm 1 1654 cm 1 and from 3650 cm 1 3400 cm 1 were related to polysaccharides proteins and hydrocarbons respectively these substances were also detected in all eps ldhx complexes revealing that ldhx were able to coagulate various macro biopolymers in eps a weaker band in comparison to the other two eps ldhx complexes at 1503 cm 1 was detected in the eps ldhb complexes indicating that ldhb bound better with co nh in protein like substances a new peak at 1417 cm 1 was observed in all in eps ldhx complexes which was associated with the surface complexation between abundant coo groups in proteins and humic like substances of eps and o h groups on the ldhx outer surface chen et al 2016 tombácz et al 2000 similarly polysaccharides are constituted of abundant uronic acids with one carboxyl group and multiple hydroxyl groups lin et al 2010 which suggested that surface complexation between uronic acids and m oh m al mg or ca on the ldh surface might be responsible for the interactions between polysaccharides and ldh but the interaction between ldh and polysaccharides was relatively weak li et al 2007 moreover the proteins and polysaccharides in eps are always presented in the form of complexes which are of great importance to the hydrogel like structure of the eps matrix seviour et al 2009 thus the high polysaccharide adsorption onto ldh was likely due to the interaction between glycoproteins and ldh to better understand the protein structure and the change of amide i groups in ldhx coagulation the protein secondary structures were fitted and determined using the methods described by hlady and buijs 1996 fig 7 showed the curve fitted amide i region in eps and eps ldhx complexes table 5 showed that eps was composed of β sheets and α helices with 3 turn helices antiparallel β sheets and aggregated strands as minor constituents yin et al 2015 after ldh coagulation the percentage of β sheets increased slightly in all eps ldhx complexes while the proportion of α helices decreased in all eps ldhx complexes hou et al 2015 demonstrated that the decreased α helix content and increased β sheet content of proteins formed a loose molecular structure which increased molecular hydrophobicity and thus enhanced sludge dewaterability bellezza et al 2012 also found that ldh induced conformational changes of proteins in the biomolecules which altered the amino acid environment thus the interaction between carboxyl groups and ldh changed the secondary structure of proteins and increased sludge dewaterability 3 3 4 xps analysis of eps ldh complexes semi quantitative xps imaging was used to identify the elements from the various ldh phases during intercalation zhou et al 2011 xu et al 2009 xps spectra were applied to determine the chemical bonds from samples collected before and after ldh coagulation the deconvolutions of c1s spectra of ldhx and eps ldhx complexes were shown in fig s9 eps ldhx complexes were deconvoluted into three components at 289 1 ev 286 6 ev and 284 7 ev which were assigned to oc or or oc oh c o and c c groups respectively yu et al 2013 littunen et al 2011 the c o groups and oc or indicated the presence of carbonyl carboxyl amide acetal or hemiacetal groups yin et al 2015 which were associated with the composition of proteins polysaccharides and humic acids the peak areas of c o and oc or increased after coagulation and the c o peak shifted to higher binding energy by about 0 4 ev there was no apparent change in c c peak area after coagulation these results showed that ldhx interacted with oxygen containing functional groups in eps in general the stability of the ldh structure was maintained by the balance between the positively charged layers and the ionic strength of interlayer anions however small molecule peptides and humic acids were negatively charged due to the ionization of their anionic functional groups so they competed with the interlayer anions for exchange sites liang et al 2007 resulting in the intercalation of eps into ldh layers the intercalation reaction of organic substances was related to the molecular weight and the interlayer spacing of the ldh meng et al 2010 demonstrated that soluble eps consisted of low molecular weight 100 kda polypeptides and humic substances while bound eps lb eps and tb eps consisted mainly of high molecular weight 100 kda 300 kda proteins as mentioned in section 3 1 the layers of the as prepared ldhx were closely spaced so the steric hindrance effect can inhibit the intercalation of high molecular weight of proteins and polysaccharides within the ldh interlayers while biomolecules of lower molecular weight fractions such as peptides and humic acids could be intercalated into the ldh ralla et al 2011 3 3 5 clsm analysis of ldh eps complexes clsm analysis was conducted to determine the effects of different ca mg al ldh conditioning on eps aggregates in fig 8 the green region showed protein like substances and the red region showed polysaccharide molecules fig 8a showed that the proteins and polysaccharides in eps fractions were distributed sporadically and unevenly the proteins and polysaccharides in the solid fractions increased in abundance and biomolecules aggregates were observed in different eps ldh complexes fig 8b d the same fluorescent images of proteins and polysaccharides confirmed that the eps matrix was rich in glycoprotein complexes boleij et al 2018 the proteins and polysaccharides were evenly distributed on the outer layers of ldha and ldhc by adsorption while those shown on ldhb were in the form of fluorescent clusters of high intensity this observation confirmed that ldhb was more effective in aggregating biopolymers 3 4 mechanisms of sludge conditioning with ca mg al ldhs hydrotalcite like minerals ca mg al ldh derived from bfs increased sludge dewaterability but different ca mg al ldh had different effects ldha which was positively charged was effective in charge neutralization and formed a skeleton to support sludge flocs ldhc was more effective in surface complexation because of its greater surface area and poor anion exchange properties ldhb was a better flocculant than ldha or ldhc because of its higher surface complexation and charge neutralization effects we concluded that ca mg al ldh combined with eps biopolymers to increase floc strength and aggregated with sludge flocs to form a skeleton during mechanical filtration the three forms of ca mg al ldh were used to coagulate the extracted eps our analysis enabled us to better understand the underlying mechanisms that determine the behaviour of organic molecules in ca mg al ldh sludge interactions two mechanisms principally governed the coagulation process in the first abundant o h groups on the outer surfaces of the ca mg al ldh interacted with macromolecular organic matter in eps through surface complexation and preferentially adsorbed high molecular weight proteins and humic substances containing carboxyl groups in addition many peptides and humic acids of low molecular weight underwent an anion exchange reaction with the intercalated anions of the ca mg al ldh this reaction depended on the ionic strength of the intercalated anions and the molecular structures of the biomolecules the interaction of soluble eps with ca mg al ldh was primarily through the surface complexation of proteins and the removal of soluble eps also improved sludge filterability skeleton formation and electrostatic interactions on the outer surfaces of ca mg al ldh also compressed the gelatinous structure of the floc and increased strength of sludge flocs 3 5 practical implications chemical conditioners mainly include organic polymers and inorganic coagulants the organic polymers such as polyacrylamide and natural organic polymers are commonly used in low pressure dewatering processes belt and centrifugal dewatering wang et al 2017 however due to the highly compressible nature of the sludge colloids the efficiency of the dewatering process is compromised and high solid content of sludge cake is difficult to be achieved by low pressure dewatering process polyaluminum chloride pacl is a typical inorganic coagulant and generally produced by two steps including acid dissolution of aluminum hydroxide and adding base to aluminum chloride until an empirical formula of al oh ncl3 n with n from 1 0 to 2 5 is achieved shen and dempsey 1998 in this work ldh coagulants were prepared using industrial waste bfs as raw material and the preparation procedure also included acid dissolution and base neutralization methods thus the preparation process of ldh coagulant is similar to that of pacl besides pacl conditioning always result in acidification of sludge due to the strong hydrolysis reaction of hydroxy aluminium and high content of chloride ions can be retained in dewatered cake after flocculation conditioning which adversely affect subsequent sludge disposal such as land use and incineration ldhs are synthesized under basic conditions and the surface of them is positively charged ldhs conditioning can improve sludge dewatering performance through charge neutralization and surface complexation and sludge acidification can be avoided in addition sludge pyrolysis is an efficient technology which can achieve synchronous sludge harmless treatment and resource utilization but the high energy consumption and low value of products limit its full scale application ldh is commonly used as a loading material of pyrolysis catalysts in pyrolysis treatment of biological wastes cao et al 2009 gao et al 2017a b fig 9 proposed a novel sludge treatment process that combined enhanced dewatering system and catalyzed pyrolysis using bfs based ldh this process could not only reduce the cake moisture content but also improve the pyrolysis efficiency of biomass in sludge for producing high value product ca mg al ldh conditioning in conjunction with catalytic pyrolysis may facilitate the recycling of wastewater sludge in two ways fig 9 multifunctional carbon based materials can be prepared from the sludge and used as adsorbents for removing the organic contaminants in water the sludge conditioned with ca mg al ldh incorporated with transition metals pyrolysis catalyst can be used to synthesize bio oil was dewaterability is increased by ldh conditioning and its energy density increases after mechanical dewatering after drying co pyrolysis slow and fast pyrolysis can recycle the sludge as useful products slow pyrolysis of was with hydrotalcite like minerals produces sludge biological carbon sbc with few leachable metal anions ca mg al resulting in the formation and fixation of hydrotalcite oxides ldo in the sbc under this condition co pyrolysis converts was containing ldh into a useful secondary composite adsorbent that contains carbon and ldo which may remove a wide variety of organic pollutants in water the alkaline metals are beneficial for the catalytic cracking of organic constituents at temperatures 400 c seif et al 2016 thus the incorporation of these metals into ca mg al ldh improves was liquefaction during fast pyrolysis park et al 2008 produced a maximum bio oil yield of 42 6 at 450 c through fast pyrolysis of sewage sludge with metal oxide catalysts thus demonstrating the feasibility of bio oil synthesis from sludge biomass catalyzed with ldh based minerals this process for bio oil production is capable of producing chemical products and reducing energy consumption hu et al 2014 syed hassan et al 2017 so ca mg al ldh conditioning is a promising treatment for sludge recycling 4 conclusions in this work the effects of chemical conditioning using three different hydrotalcite like compounds ca mg al ldhs from steel production waste bfs on sludge dewaterability were analyzed and evaluated changes in sludge morphology and eps coagulation were investigated to identify the processes initiated by conditioning we draw the following conclusions the structural properties of ca mg al ldh had important effects on sludge conditioning comparison of the three conditioners showed that ldhb had better crystallinity higher anion exchange capacity and more suitable physiochemical properties and was thus more effective than both ldha and ldhc in forming skeletal structures and neutralizing the negative charges onto sludge flocs the interactions between oc oh groups and ldh surfaces changed the secondary structure of proteins decrease in protein α helices and increase in protein β sheets loosened the molecular structure and improve molecular hydrophobicity resulting in sludge dewaterability increased the combination of skeleton formation electrostatic interactions and eps ldh interactions resulted in eps becoming compressed and floc cohesion increased thereby increasing sludge dewaterability declaration of competing interest the

18358,extracellular polymeric substances eps in wastewater sludge form a network structure that is highly hydrophilic and compressible thus chemical conditioning is always required to improve sludge dewaterability by changing the gelatinous structure of sludge flocs layered double hydroxides ldh are generally characterized by large surface area and high anion exchange capacity so we prepared three types of hydrotalcite like compounds ca mg al ldhs from a typical solid waste blast furnace slag using naoh precipitation giving ldha a hydrothermal method ldhb and naoh na2co3 precipitation ldhc the physicochemical properties of the three ldh were comprehensively characterized and their effectiveness as sludge conditioners was evaluated the results showed that ldh conditioning was able to promote sludge dewaterability and conditioning efficiency was strongly dependent on ldh structural properties ldh neutralized the negative charges onto sludge particles and interacted with eps to increase floc strength ldh also formed a skeletal structure that reduced sludge compressibility in addition there were interactions between the ldh surfaces and the oc oh in eps proteins which altered the secondary structure of protein molecules consequently increasing sludge dewaterability the biomolecules of low molecular weight fractions such as peptides and humic acids in soluble eps intercalated ldh both the surface complexation of organic matter containing carboxyl groups and the intercalation of small molecules in soluble eps were responsible for eps ldh interactions the combination of skeleton formation electrostatic interaction and eps ldh interactions resulted in compression of gel like structure and improved sludge dewatering performance we finally suggested a novel sludge treatment process that increases sludge dewaterability using slag derived ca mg al ldh to condition the sludge and it could be combined with pyrolysis to prepare multi functional

treatment technology and the treatment by product waste activated sludge was have attracted much attention you et al 2017 ai et al 2019 sludge is characterized by high moisture content and contains abundant organic matters niu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 therefore dewatering sludge is exceedingly important for reducing sludge volume to be disposed sludge is a heterogeneous colloidal system with non newtonian fluid properties and it has long been recognized that sludge dewaterability depends on the physicochemical properties of biocolloids mikkelsen and keiding 2002 zhang et al 2016 extracellular polymeric substances eps which account for 60 80 of sludge mass are important in floc structure its surface charge and floc stability lin et al 2019 eps is an extremely complex composite of proteins polysaccharides humic acids nucleic acids and other organic substances wingender et al 1999 flemming et al 2016 and proteins and polysaccharides constitute more than 70 of eps mass tsuneda et al 2003 chen et al 2017 the negatively charged eps form a gel like network so the sludge is viscoelastic and highly compressible many studies have demonstrated that the properties of eps affect sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2015a wu et al 2016 li et al 2018 a high level of proteins and polysaccharides in the eps matrix decreases sludge dewaterability higgins and novak 1997a 1997b lin et al 2019 and their complexes glycosylated proteins also form gels that create a barrier around cells and prevent them from dewatering christensen 1999 tan et al 2015 eps can be separated into five fractions by different methods depending on the strength of the bonds between biopolymers and microbial cells supernatant slime soluble eps loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellets zhang et al 2015b it has been found that sludge dewaterability is mainly influenced by soluble eps and lb eps fractions zhang et al 2015a more recently zhen et al 2019 showed that eps distribution and composition were highly variable and that protein concentration in the soluble eps fraction significantly affected sludge dewatering behaviour sludge is difficult to dewater because eps is highly hydrated so chemical conditioning is always required to improve the performance of mechanical dewatering processes yang et al 2019 various chemical conditioning treatments have been widely used to reduce the hydrophilia of was biopolymers and to improve sludge dewaterability including coagulation and flocculation zhang et al 2017 acidification zhang et al 2015c alkaline pretreatment liu et al 2019 and fenton oxidation faye et al 2019 coagulation flocculation is the most commonly used technique in sludge treatment due to its low cost and simplicity of operation inorganic coagulants are always included in sludge conditioners because the hydrolyzed products of inorganic salts can form skeletal structures consequently increasing sludge floc cohesion cao et al 2016 moreover surface complexation and charge neutralization during the conditioning process are mainly responsible for the compression of the gel like structure to improve sludge dewaterability layered double hydroxides ldh are a group of compounds derived from mineral brucite having the general formula m2 1 xm3 x oh 2 x an x n mh2o where m2 and m3 are divalent and trivalent metal cations in the octahedra of the brucite layer cavani et al 1991 divalent metal cations can be substituted by isomorphous trivalent metal cations so the outer layers acquire positive ions the an are the intercalated charge compensating anions which complete the formation of charge neutral ldh mallakpour and dinari 2015 ldh have a high specific surface area disperse effectively and possess excellent anion exchange capacities these properties make them good candidate material for the flocculation and adsorption of various pollutants wen et al 2013 santos et al 2017 kim et al 2017 investigated the relationships between ldh and algal flocculation and found that the positive surface charge density of ldh was of great importance in the interaction between algal cells and ldh minerals zou et al 2016 found that graphene oxide nanocomposites coagulated onto ldh cl and ldh co3 through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds sun et al 2017 incorporated anionic organic matter into as synthesized ldh by ion exchange and formed organo ldh which could be an efficient approach to remove surfactant from aqueous solution ldh can be synthesized from industrial wastes and their structure and function can be determined by varying the preparation conditions blast furnace slag bfs is a by product of steel and iron making it contains a high proportion of metal species ca mg al fe ti and mn making it an economical and effective adsorbent for large scale utilization yang et al 2013 ren et al 2014 yan 2012 more recently it was reported that bfs was used to synthesize ldh by extracting metal components via acidic treatment shi et al 2016 which could be economical and widely applicable for instance gao et al 2017a compared the effectiveness of various slag based functional materials in adsorbing methyl orange mo and found that ldh removed mo better than other materials through chemisorption in the interlayers the complex composition of metal hydroxide sheets and the specific anions within layers contribute to the excellent adsorption by ldh of organic pollutants in an aqueous environment in this work we synthesized three forms of ca mg al ldh from bfs and used them as chemical conditioners to increase the dewaterability of was the relationships between the ca mg al ldh structures and sludge conditioning efficiency were examined the changes in sludge eps and floc morphology due to different ca mg al ldhs conditioning were investigated the interactions between ca mg al ldhs and eps were investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform

collected by centrifugation washed several times with deionized water and powdered by freeze drying to prepare ldhb the supernatant was titrated with an alkaline solution naoh 2 mol l until the ph was near 11 5 and then it was aged for 24 h at 110 c likewise the supernatant containing metal cations was used to prepare carbonate intercalated ca mg al ldh denoted as ldhc generally the supernatant was slowly dropped into a na2co3 solution 100 ml 0 0375 mol l stirring at 80 rpm in the meanwhile the ph of the mixture was adjusted to 11 5 by adding naoh 2 mol l then the mixture was stirred for another 20 h at 85 c ldhc powder was formed and washed with deionized water for several times then centrifuged and freeze dried overnight for use 2 3 sludge conditioning procedure the effects of ldh on the dewaterability performance and structural properties of activated sludge were investigated using different ldhx dosage 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 g g tss each batch experiment was performed in 500 ml

gradient for 2 min followed by stirring at 62 25 s 1 for 10 min after addition of ldhx after that a certain amount of conditioned sludge was taken for further analysis 2 4 interactions between eps and ldh eps was extracted from the solids suspended in the sludge using a cation exchange resin frolund et al 1996 and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and the contents of protein and polysaccharide were measured chen et al 2015 standard adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanisms of the interactions between ldh and eps fractions the batch adsorption experiments were carried out using glass bottles that were shaken at 150 rpm at a temperature of 25 1 c the residual amounts of adsorbates were measured by uv spectrophotometry at 750 nm for proteins using the lowry folin method and at 630 nm for polysaccharides using the anthrone method xu et al 2018 the tests for isothermal adsorption were performed by adding the initial adsorbent doses 0 1 2 0 g l for ldhx into a 50 ml solution that was shaken for 24 h until the reaction equilibrium was reached and the most effective dose was selected for use in subsequent procedures 1 8 g l for ldha and 1 6 g l for ldhb and ldhc the kinetic adsorption tests were carried out at initial concentrations of 189 9 mg l protein and 63 3 mg l polysaccharide and the supernatants were sampled at various time intervals up to 24 h during the reaction time the eps ldh complexes were also characterized using xps ft ir and clsm 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 sludge dewaterability assessment sludge dewaterability was

and standard deviations were calculated means differences between the compressibility coefficients were compared using analysis of variance anova and tukey test p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of ldhx ldhx crystal morphologies were characterized by sem a typical layered structure was observed and the surface of each ldhx was clearly smooth fig 1 the ldha crystals were uneven and thin fig 1a aggregating with occasional overlapping and interleaving with a particle size of 2 10 μm particle size was shown in table s2 the ldhb crystals consisted of homogeneous sheets fig 1b with a particle size of 11 7 μm table s2 the ldhc crystals consisted of uniform sheets fig 1c with an average size of 27 5 μm table s2 most of ldhc plates were agglomerated which was attributed to the effects of the attachment of various solid phases such as caco3 to the layered structure zou et al 2017 the bet data table s2 suggested that the ldhx with better defined crystallinity had a higher specific surface area thus the distinct mineral morphology of the as prepared ldhx might show different flocculation behaviours in sludge conditioning the sharp peaks in xrd patterns also indicated that the ldhx were highly crystallized fig 2 a consistent with the sem images the xrd peaks were identified as the hydrotalcite like phases according to the standard diffraction patterns pdf 78 1219 and pdf 89 460 of the international center for diffraction data chen et al 2016 gao et al 2017a as indicated by the typical planes of 003 006 009 and 110 the xrd patterns of ldhx showed a layered structure and the diffraction peaks of 100 015 and 018 also showed the hydrotalcite like structure of the ldhx zhang et al 2012a the layer spacing of the ldhx was dependent on the basal spacing d 003 which was calculated as 7 84 å ldha 7 84 å ldhb and 7 91 å ldhc table s2 zhang et al 2012b gasser et al 2008 interestingly the larger particle size and lower bet surface area appeared simultaneously for ldhc table s2 and new peaks of 36 at 2θ were observed for ldhc this result implied that mixed carbonates of calcium magnesium and aluminium were formed and that they hindered the formation of the layered structure in synthesis shao et al 2011 xps and ft ir analysis were performed to investigate the element distribution and types of bonds of different ca mg al ldhs table s3 and fig 2c showed the phase composition of ca mg al ldhs that o c ca mg and al were the principal elements in ldhx the distribution of functional groups was explained by the xps o1s spectra resolution fig 2d f the o1s spectra of all ldhx could be deconvoluted into three metal oxide bonds ca o al o and mg o zou et al 2017 the bonds in ldhx were also shown by ft ir analysis fig 2b the common peaks observed around 3470 cm 1 were assigned to the o h stretching vibrations of interlayer water molecules shafiei et al 2013 and the bending vibrations of the interlayer water δh o h occurred at 1600 1650 cm 1 in the spectra of ldha and ldhb abdelkader et al 2011 meanwhile the peaks at 1500 cm 1 were related to the asymmetric stretching vibration of co3 2 lin et al 2013 and the strong peak of ldhc was mainly from the interlayer due to naoh na2co3 precipitation during ldhc synthesis in the low frequency region the peaks at 792 cm 1 and 582 cm 1 were assigned to m o vibrations and m o h bending m ca al or mg yu et al 2010 wen et al 2013 indicating the presence of layered metal hydroxides the results showed that the ca mg al ldhs with different structure were successfully synthesized by changing the reaction conditions 3 2 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on sludge properties 3 2 1 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on sludge dewaterability as shown in fig 3 and table 2 srf decreased and then reached an equilibrium when the ldhx dose was increased from 0 025 g g tss to 0 2 g g tss fig 3a the srf values decreased from 3 56 1013 m kg to 2 23 1013 m kg ldha 1 65 1013 m kg ldhb and 2 52 1013 m kg ldhc the change of cst is presented in fig 3b cst values gradually decreased as the ldhx dosage increased and that of sludge conditioned with ldhb reached a minimum of 80 6 s 0 2 g g tss from an initial 225 s for ldha and ldhc the decrease of cst values did not reach the equilibrium there results suggested that ldha and ldhc were less effective in sludge conditioning than ldhb the differences in the conditioning effects of ldhx were related to the structural properties of ldhx and the various processes that occurred during sludge conditioning with ldhx such as electrical neutralization surface complexation and interlayer anion exchange for example the abundant oxygen bonds and positive surface charges in ldhx provide many active sites probably increasing adsorption of eps through electrical neutralization and complexation seida and nakano 2000 the findings of this work on this matter are presented in subsequent sections the high compressibility of was results in sludge flocs being deformed during the compression stage which cause sludge cake voids closed and hold moisture resulting in sludge filterability deteriorated ning et al 2013 in order to understand the dewatering behaviour of non newtonian fluid it was crucial to evaluate the compressibility of sludge under chemical conditioning qi et al 2011 the effects of different ldhx on cake compressibility are presented in fig 3c the coefficient of compressibility of raw sludge was 1 632 and it decreased after chemical conditioning with ldh as presented in fig 3c at optimal ldh dosage of 0 2 g g tss the compressibility coefficient from ldhb conditioned 1 393 was lower than that from ldha 1 59 and ldhc 1 57 it was observed from table s4 to table s6 that the compressibility coefficients of sludge cake were reduced after conditioning by three ldhs and the cake compressibility coefficient of sludge treated by ldhb was significantly lower than that conditioned by ldha and ldhc this observation was consistent with cst tests cao et al 2016 suggested that the lower compressibility coefficient was always related to better dewatering property of sludge thus it was demonstrated that ldhx form skeletal structures during conditioning which increased floc strength and released moisture moreover it was clear that the sludge flocs conditioned by ldhb was more compact than that conditioned by ldha and ldhc 3 2 2 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on sludge floc properties sludge flocs are always negatively charged due to the ionization of anionic groups of carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphates in the constituents of eps wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 the negative charge prevents flocs from aggregating making the sludge highly compressible the zeta potential of sludge flocs for the different ldh treatments increased gradually as the ldhx dose increased see in fig 4 a table 2 ldhb conditioning led to a maximum increase in zeta potential from 28 1 mv to 12 26 mv conditioning with ldha which had the highest positive surface charge resulted in a lower increase to 14 6 mv thus it was reasonable to consider that there was another factor in stabilizing the negatively charged flocs and this inference was confirmed by the fact that the ldh showed high capacity in removing soluble oxyanions e g phosphates chlorides and sulfates through surface complexation fig s1 cheng et al 2009 these anions could be derived from the macromolecules of the eps matrix boleij et al 2018 thus two processes could cause charge neutralization neutralization between electronegative sludge flocs and the positively charged outer surface of ldh and the stabilization of anion groups in the sludge by outer surface active sites of ldh ldhc showed the least charge neutralization effect on sludge flocs table s2 because the ldhc was synthesized in a strongly alkaline environment kloprogge et al 2004 the mixed metal oxides were not soluble in the alkaline environment and competed in the formation of hydrotalcite like matter saha et al 2018 because of the solubility of mx m ca al or mg mixed metal oxides were the predominant phase precipitated at this high ph so the surface charge of the outer layers of ldhc was lower than that of the other two ldhx as shown in fig 4b and table 2 slight increase in sludge floc size were observed indicating that flocculation and bridging were not dominant mechanisms in ldh conditioning 3 2 3 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on microstructure of sludge floc sludge floc morphology after ldhx conditioning was observed by fe sem fig s2 the surface of the raw sludge cake was relatively smooth fig s2a but the floc structure became rough and porous after conditioning the floc aggregated slightly with the small flaky ldha platelets fig s2b in comparison the pores in sludge cake conditioned with ldhb and ldhc were well developed and exhibited clear floc aggregation where abundant granules were distributed and overlapping crystals were stacked figs s2c s2d these observations showed that both floc strength and cake porosity were increased with ca mg al ldh conditioning and the plentiful pores in the cake were helpful to release free water under mechanical compression 3 2 4 effects of ca mg al ldhs conditioning on eps properties fig s3 showed the concentrations of different eps fractions under ldhx conditioning the s eps lb eps and tb eps content decreased and reached the minimum at a dose of 0 15 g g tss for different ldhx this was likely that hydrotalcite like compounds could bind with biopolymers consequently decreasing eps content through surface complexation and electrostatic interactions previous studies found that a decrease in both s eps and lb eps fractions increased floc cohesion and improved sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 the decreases in s eps and lb eps fractions after ldhx conditioning increased floc density thereby decreasing cake compressibility specifically ldhb performed best in binding eps fractions which was consistent with the sludge dewaterability tests by comparison ldhc showed less charge neutralization capacity and ldha had a lower specific surface area both of which reduced eps binding ability fig s4 showed the main fluorescent intensities of various components of eps fractions given by parallel factor parafac analysis there were three components in eps fractions with ex em peaks centered at 230 280 350 nm c1 235 315 405 nm c2 and 255 360 430 nm c3 chen et al 2003 c1 was related to tyrosine protein like substances and tryptophan protein like substances tpn c2 was associated with aromatic protein like ii substances apn ii and tpn and c3 was associated with humic like substances ha and fulvic like compounds fa changes in the maximum fluorescence intensities fimax of s eps and lb eps after conditioning with ldhx were shown in fig 5 there was no distinct change in the fluorescence intensity of lb eps implying that the biopolymers in lb eps hardly coagulated with ca mg al ldh the fimax levels of protein like substances c1 in s eps decreased as the ldhx dose increased while the fluorescence intensities of c2 and c3 showed no apparent changes under ldhx conditioning suggesting that ca mg al ldh coagulated well the protein like substances of high molecular weight ldhb adsorbed the protein like substances in eps more readily than ldha and ldhc confirming that the coagulation ability of hydrotalcite like materials were dependent on their structural properties the combination of organic matters with ldhx was attributed to charge neutralization surface complexation and anion exchange razani and dadkhah tehrani 2019 monash and pugazhenthi 2014 xia et al 2017 the amount of adsorbed matter on the surface of ldhx was correlated with bet surface area and the functional groups that were observed table s2 and fig 2b and exchange adsorption depended on the ionic strength of the different ldh vreysen and maes 2008 carbonate ions were retained by ldh much more than chloride or hydroxide anions miyata 1983 thus it was difficult for them to exchange with other anions therefore adsorption of organic matter onto ldhc was likely because of stronger surface complexation rather than by anion exchange in addition ldhc showed little surface electrostatic strength so its charge neutralization effectiveness as a sludge conditioner was limited by comparison the lower anionic strengths of ldha and ldhb contributed to a significant adsorption exchange and small organic molecules might be intercalated into the ldh yu et al 2010 thus it was reasonable to consider that less available surface area and poorer crystallinity of ldha resulted in a lack active sites on ldh surface to adsorb biopolymers while its abundant positive surface charge made it an efficient charge neutralizer during sludge conditioning fig 4 in contrast ldhb had better crystallinity and higher anion exchange capacity making it more effective in increasing sludge dewaterability than other ldhs 3 3 interactions between eps and ca mg al ldhs 3 3 1 adsorption of eps on different ca mg al ldhs 3 3 1 1 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of the main components of eps proteins and polysaccharides were obtained at 25 c to investigate ca mg al ldh adsorption the adsorption data were fitted using the langmuir eq 1 and freundlich eq 2 equations the two standard isotherm equations are 1 c e q e c e q m 1 b q m 2 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in eps mg l q e and q m are the quantities of adsorbate at equilibrium and maximum mg g b is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l mg and n and k f mg 1 n l1 n g are the freundlich adsorption equilibrium constants the langmuir isotherms for protein and polysaccharide adsorption onto ca mg al ldhs were shown in fig s5 and the relevant parameters computed from the two models are summarized in table 3 the adsorption capacities varied between the ldhx the maximum sorption capacity of proteins was calculated to be 24 68 mg g and of polysaccharides was 22 70 mg g on ldhb the langmuir equation better described the adsorption isotherms of proteins and polysaccharides onto ldhx with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 95 indicating that the adsorption was a monolayer coverage of the homogeneous surface sites 3 3 1 2 adsorption dynamics the kinetics of protein and polysaccharide adsorption onto ldhx were shown in fig 6 during the first stage abundant binding sites were available for the adsorption of both substances and adsorption increased rapidly from the time of initial contact the adsorption rates slowed down rapidly after 2 h because most of the active sites on the surface were occupied and adsorption continued in the ca mg al ldh interlayer fig 6a b protein adsorption reached equilibrium after 24 h for ldha and ldhb and 4 h for ldhc indicating that there was little adsorption due to ion exchange on the ldhc interlayer we attributed this to the initial concentration of polysaccharides 63 3 mg l being less than that of proteins 189 9 mg l the total adsorption efficiencies of proteins were 60 66 and 42 for ldha ldhb ldhc and that of polysaccharides were 46 54 and 39 for ldha ldhb ldhc fig 6c d confirming that ldhb was more effective in coagulating biopolymers these results suggested that ldhx were promising materials for the preparation of multi functional pyrolyzed sludge carbon because of the ability of calcined ldh ldo to remove anionic pollutants goh et al 2008 the pseudo first order eq 3 and pseudo second order eq 4 kinetic equations were used to model protein and polysaccharide adsorption onto ca mg al ldh the nonlinear fittings of the models are 3 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q t mg g and q e mg g are the quantities of proteins and polysaccharides adsorbed on ca mg al ldh at time t min and equilibrium e k 1 1 min and k 2 g mg min are constants of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models the values of q e k 1 and k 2 are obtained from the linear plots of ln q e q t vs t or t q t vs t the fitting results of the experimental data were shown in fig s6 and table 4 the highest r 2 values were observed in the pseudo second order model r 2 0 98 and the theoretical values of q e for ldhx which were calculated using the pseudo second order model were much closer to the experimental values of q e these results indicated that the adsorption of proteins and polysaccharides on ca mg al ldh was better fitted by the pseudo second order model many studies have suggested that the adsorption of organic matter on hydrotalcite like minerals involved the valence force through sharing or exchanging electrons barriga et al 2002 legrouri et al 2005 implying that the adsorption of eps on ca mg al ldh was dominated by chemical reactions which we investigated as described in the following sections 3 3 2 microstructure of eps ldh complexes the morphologies of eps and eps ldh complexes were characterized by sem fig s7a showed the presence of near plate crystallite and sharp particle edges in the original eps after ldhx flocculation figs s7b 7d eps was interconnected with many ldhx crystals to form aggregates showing a honeycomb structure most ldhx crystals maintained an identical layered morphology suggesting that eps was adsorbed on the external surface and interlayers of ldhx without destroying the hierarchical structure the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to explore the distribution of elements on the nanomaterials figs s7b 7d showed the elements adsorbed on the ldhx the three elements c n and o that represent organic matter were distributed on the layered structure in contrast to the raw eps fig s7a the organic substances were aggregately deposited on the surface of ldhx adsorbents in other words the high m o m ca al or mg content on the ldh surface promoted the flocculation of eps fractions seida and nakano 2000 which probably occurred in conjunction with other physicochemical processes of sludge conditioning 3 3 3 ft ir analysis of eps ldhx complexes ft ir was used to reveal the interaction between ldhx outer layers and the functional groups of eps the ft ir spectra of eps ldhx and eps ldhx complexes were shown in fig s8 the functional groups of eps were divided into four categories hydrocarbons amide groups in proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids as shown in table s7 badireddy et al 2008 the bands at 1654 1417 1067 869 and 792 cm 1 in the eps and eps ldhx complexes represent functional groups such as nh2 co c oh c o c co nh c n and n h and ring vibrations in eps fractions proteins polysaccharides and aromatic acids the bands at 1067 cm 1 1654 cm 1 and from 3650 cm 1 3400 cm 1 were related to polysaccharides proteins and hydrocarbons respectively these substances were also detected in all eps ldhx complexes revealing that ldhx were able to coagulate various macro biopolymers in eps a weaker band in comparison to the other two eps ldhx complexes at 1503 cm 1 was detected in the eps ldhb complexes indicating that ldhb bound better with co nh in protein like substances a new peak at 1417 cm 1 was observed in all in eps ldhx complexes which was associated with the surface complexation between abundant coo groups in proteins and humic like substances of eps and o h groups on the ldhx outer surface chen et al 2016 tombácz et al 2000 similarly polysaccharides are constituted of abundant uronic acids with one carboxyl group and multiple hydroxyl groups lin et al 2010 which suggested that surface complexation between uronic acids and m oh m al mg or ca on the ldh surface might be responsible for the interactions between polysaccharides and ldh but the interaction between ldh and polysaccharides was relatively weak li et al 2007 moreover the proteins and polysaccharides in eps are always presented in the form of complexes which are of great importance to the hydrogel like structure of the eps matrix seviour et al 2009 thus the high polysaccharide adsorption onto ldh was likely due to the interaction between glycoproteins and ldh to better understand the protein structure and the change of amide i groups in ldhx coagulation the protein secondary structures were fitted and determined using the methods described by hlady and buijs 1996 fig 7 showed the curve fitted amide i region in eps and eps ldhx complexes table 5 showed that eps was composed of β sheets and α helices with 3 turn helices antiparallel β sheets and aggregated strands as minor constituents yin et al 2015 after ldh coagulation the percentage of β sheets increased slightly in all eps ldhx complexes while the proportion of α helices decreased in all eps ldhx complexes hou et al 2015 demonstrated that the decreased α helix content and increased β sheet content of proteins formed a loose molecular structure which increased molecular hydrophobicity and thus enhanced sludge dewaterability bellezza et al 2012 also found that ldh induced conformational changes of proteins in the biomolecules which altered the amino acid environment thus the interaction between carboxyl groups and ldh changed the secondary structure of proteins and increased sludge dewaterability 3 3 4 xps analysis of eps ldh complexes semi quantitative xps imaging was used to identify the elements from the various ldh phases during intercalation zhou et al 2011 xu et al 2009 xps spectra were applied to determine the chemical bonds from samples collected before and after ldh coagulation the deconvolutions of c1s spectra of ldhx and eps ldhx complexes were shown in fig s9 eps ldhx complexes were deconvoluted into three components at 289 1 ev 286 6 ev and 284 7 ev which were assigned to oc or or oc oh c o and c c groups respectively yu et al 2013 littunen et al 2011 the c o groups and oc or indicated the presence of carbonyl carboxyl amide acetal or hemiacetal groups yin et al 2015 which were associated with the composition of proteins polysaccharides and humic acids the peak areas of c o and oc or increased after coagulation and the c o peak shifted to higher binding energy by about 0 4 ev there was no apparent change in c c peak area after coagulation these results showed that ldhx interacted with oxygen containing functional groups in eps in general the stability of the ldh structure was maintained by the balance between the positively charged layers and the ionic strength of interlayer anions however small molecule peptides and humic acids were negatively charged due to the ionization of their anionic functional groups so they competed with the interlayer anions for exchange sites liang et al 2007 resulting in the intercalation of eps into ldh layers the intercalation reaction of organic substances was related to the molecular weight and the interlayer spacing of the ldh meng et al 2010 demonstrated that soluble eps consisted of low molecular weight 100 kda polypeptides and humic substances while bound eps lb eps and tb eps consisted mainly of high molecular weight 100 kda 300 kda proteins as mentioned in section 3 1 the layers of the as prepared ldhx were closely spaced so the steric hindrance effect can inhibit the intercalation of high molecular weight of proteins and polysaccharides within the ldh interlayers while biomolecules of lower molecular weight fractions such as peptides and humic acids could be intercalated into the ldh ralla et al 2011 3 3 5 clsm analysis of ldh eps complexes clsm analysis was conducted to determine the effects of different ca mg al ldh conditioning on eps aggregates in fig 8 the green region showed protein like substances and the red region showed polysaccharide molecules fig 8a showed that the proteins and polysaccharides in eps fractions were distributed sporadically and unevenly the proteins and polysaccharides in the solid fractions increased in abundance and biomolecules aggregates were observed in different eps ldh complexes fig 8b d the same fluorescent images of proteins and polysaccharides confirmed that the eps matrix was rich in glycoprotein complexes boleij et al 2018 the proteins and polysaccharides were evenly distributed on the outer layers of ldha and ldhc by adsorption while those shown on ldhb were in the form of fluorescent clusters of high intensity this observation confirmed that ldhb was more effective in aggregating biopolymers 3 4 mechanisms of sludge conditioning with ca mg al ldhs hydrotalcite like minerals ca mg al ldh derived from bfs increased sludge dewaterability but different ca mg al ldh had different effects ldha which was positively charged was effective in charge neutralization and formed a skeleton to support sludge flocs ldhc was more effective in surface complexation because of its greater surface area and poor anion exchange properties ldhb was a better flocculant than ldha or ldhc because of its higher surface complexation and charge neutralization effects we concluded that ca mg al ldh combined with eps biopolymers to increase floc strength and aggregated with sludge flocs to form a skeleton during mechanical filtration the three forms of ca mg al ldh were used to coagulate the extracted eps our analysis enabled us to better understand the underlying mechanisms that determine the behaviour of organic molecules in ca mg al ldh sludge interactions two mechanisms principally governed the coagulation process in the first abundant o h groups on the outer surfaces of the ca mg al ldh interacted with macromolecular organic matter in eps through surface complexation and preferentially adsorbed high molecular weight proteins and humic substances containing carboxyl groups in addition many peptides and humic acids of low molecular weight underwent an anion exchange reaction with the intercalated anions of the ca mg al ldh this reaction depended on the ionic strength of the intercalated anions and the molecular structures of the biomolecules the interaction of soluble eps with ca mg al ldh was primarily through the surface complexation of proteins and the removal of soluble eps also improved sludge filterability skeleton formation and electrostatic interactions on the outer surfaces of ca mg al ldh also compressed the gelatinous structure of the floc and increased strength of sludge flocs 3 5 practical implications chemical conditioners mainly include organic polymers and inorganic coagulants the organic polymers such as polyacrylamide and natural organic polymers are commonly used in low pressure dewatering processes belt and centrifugal dewatering wang et al 2017 however due to the highly compressible nature of the sludge colloids the efficiency of the dewatering process is compromised and high solid content of sludge cake is difficult to be achieved by low pressure dewatering process polyaluminum chloride pacl is a typical inorganic coagulant and generally produced by two steps including acid dissolution of aluminum hydroxide and adding base to aluminum chloride until an empirical formula of al oh ncl3 n with n from 1 0 to 2 5 is achieved shen and dempsey 1998 in this work ldh coagulants were prepared using industrial waste bfs as raw material and the preparation procedure also included acid dissolution and base neutralization methods thus the preparation process of ldh coagulant is similar to that of pacl besides pacl conditioning always result in acidification of sludge due to the strong hydrolysis reaction of hydroxy aluminium and high content of chloride ions can be retained in dewatered cake after flocculation conditioning which adversely affect subsequent sludge disposal such as land use and incineration ldhs are synthesized under basic conditions and the surface of them is positively charged ldhs conditioning can improve sludge dewatering performance through charge neutralization and surface complexation and sludge acidification can be avoided in addition sludge pyrolysis is an efficient technology which can achieve synchronous sludge harmless treatment and resource utilization but the high energy consumption and low value of products limit its full scale application ldh is commonly used as a loading material of pyrolysis catalysts in pyrolysis treatment of biological wastes cao et al 2009 gao et al 2017a b fig 9 proposed a novel sludge treatment process that combined enhanced dewatering system and catalyzed pyrolysis using bfs based ldh this process could not only reduce the cake moisture content but also improve the pyrolysis efficiency of biomass in sludge for producing high value product ca mg al ldh conditioning in conjunction with catalytic pyrolysis may facilitate the recycling of wastewater sludge in two ways fig 9 multifunctional carbon based materials can be prepared from the sludge and used as adsorbents for removing the organic contaminants in water the sludge conditioned with ca mg al ldh incorporated with transition metals pyrolysis catalyst can be used to synthesize bio oil was dewaterability is increased by ldh conditioning and its energy density increases after mechanical dewatering after drying co pyrolysis slow and fast pyrolysis can recycle the sludge as useful products slow pyrolysis of was with hydrotalcite like minerals produces sludge biological carbon sbc with few leachable metal anions ca mg al resulting in the formation and fixation of hydrotalcite oxides ldo in the sbc under this condition co pyrolysis converts was containing ldh into a useful secondary composite adsorbent that contains carbon and ldo which may remove a wide variety of organic pollutants in water the alkaline metals are beneficial for the catalytic cracking of organic constituents at temperatures 400 c seif et al 2016 thus the incorporation of these metals into ca mg al ldh improves was liquefaction during fast pyrolysis park et al 2008 produced a maximum bio oil yield of 42 6 at 450 c through fast pyrolysis of sewage sludge with metal oxide catalysts thus demonstrating the feasibility of bio oil synthesis from sludge biomass catalyzed with ldh based minerals this process for bio oil production is capable of producing chemical products and reducing energy consumption hu et al 2014 syed hassan et al 2017 so ca mg al ldh conditioning is a promising treatment for sludge recycling 4 conclusions in this work the effects of chemical conditioning using three different hydrotalcite like compounds ca mg al ldhs from steel production waste bfs on sludge dewaterability were analyzed and evaluated changes in sludge morphology and eps coagulation were investigated to identify the processes initiated by conditioning we draw the following conclusions the structural properties of ca mg al ldh had important effects on sludge conditioning comparison of the three conditioners showed that ldhb had better crystallinity higher anion exchange capacity and more suitable physiochemical properties and was thus more effective than both ldha and ldhc in forming skeletal structures and neutralizing the negative charges onto sludge flocs the interactions between oc oh groups and ldh surfaces changed the secondary structure of proteins decrease in protein α helices and increase in protein β sheets loosened the molecular structure and improve molecular hydrophobicity resulting in sludge dewaterability increased the combination of skeleton formation electrostatic interactions and eps ldh interactions resulted in eps becoming compressed and floc cohesion increased thereby increasing sludge dewaterability declaration of competing interest the

18359,as the protonated form of nitrite free nitrous acid fna is a renewable chemical that can be produced on site from the anaerobic digestion liquor by nitritation and has been widely employed to improve the fermentation of waste activated sludge was however it is not clear whether and how fna improves the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge ads this work therefore aims to provide such supports through comparing the dewaterability of ads treated by nitrite at different concentrations 0 250 mg l under three ph values 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 environmental results showed that nitrite was completely denitrified within 12 h and its addition improved the dewaterability of ads in all the cases the optimal normalized capillary suction time of 18 0 0 4 s l g vss was obtained at nitrite 50 mg l and ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 35 mg l fna in comparison with corresponding value of 23 2 0 4 s l g vss at ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 mg l fna under this scenario 80 5 2 0 of water content was obtained in the fna treated sample after press filtration while the corresponding value was 88 5 1 7 in the control the mechanism investigations showed that fna treatment reduced surface negative charge of ads flocs and caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances and release of intracellular substances which enhanced the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability but decreased the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads additionally fna treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond which led to a loose structure of protein benefiting the exposure of hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins the findings obtained deepen our understanding of fna affecting sludge dewatering and provide strong supports to sustainable operation of wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords in situ free nitrous acid fna anaerobically digested sludge ads dewaterability physicochemical properties extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction over the last few decades the volume of waste activated sludge was in wastewater treatment plants wwtp has increased many times due to the intensification of wastewater purification li et al 2019a wang et al 2018a b 2019b wei et al 2018c 2018b wu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the treatment and disposal of was consume substantial costs which account for up to 60 of the total operation cost of a wwtp wei et al 2018a therefore there is a strong economic incentive for water utilities to reduce was volume was is normally subjected to anaerobic digestion to achieve sludge reduction and energy recovery concurrently liu et al 2019 song et al 2016 wang et al 2019a 2019c yang et al 2019 this process can effectively reduce sludge volume stabilize organics in sludge kill pathogenic microorganisms and produce renewable energy in the form of methane wei et al 2018c after anaerobic digestion the anaerobically digested sludge ads needs to be dewatered before final disposal therefore the enhancement of ads dewaterability has recently attracted much attention in the past many treatment e g physical chemical and biological processes were tested to enhance the dewaterability of ads li et al 2019b masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 song et al 2016 for example na et al found the water content of sludge cake wcsc decreased to 64 0 after 447 kj g tss of ultrasonic energy was input to condition ads na et al 2007 song and his co workers found that the capillary suction time cst of ads decreased by approximately 90 when ads was treated by zero valent iron 2 0 g g ts activated persulfate 0 5 g g ts for 4 min song et al 2016 masihi et al demonstrated the dewaterability of ads could be improved by electrochemical fenton process due to the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps fractions by hydroxyl radical with wcsc of 59 0 being achieved after filter press under the optimum operational condition masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 although these tested approaches are effective they require substantial inputs of either energy or chemicals which are unsustainable in long term operation considering massive amount of ads produced worldwide any improvement in ads dewaterability with cost effective methods should have substantial environmental and economic benefits nitrite which can be produced on site from anaerobic digestion liquor by nitritation generally requires to be recirculated to the mainstream wastewater treatment line for removal sun et al recently found that the integration of nitrite and freezing treatment for 24 h enhanced the solubilization and dewatering of raw was sun et al 2017 wei et al observed that when raw was was pretreated by free nitrous acid fna the protonated species of nitrite for 24 h before being transferred into anaerobic digester wcsc of ads slightly decreased from 87 6 to 85 9 wei et al 2018c these two good attempts demonstrated a novel application of the intermediate product of the anaerobic digestion liquor i e nitrite opening a new door for sludge dewatering enhancement in an economic way in these two studies however all the treatments with nitrite or fna were enforced to raw was rather than ads it is known that the characteristics of ads are obviously different from those of raw was for instance the release of organics from sludge flocs during anaerobic digestion decreased particle size but increased specific surface area and surface negative charge which caused ads absorbing more bound water decreasing colloidal flocculability and forming more stable colloidal system pei et al 2007 wang et al 2018a to date it remains unknown whether fna treatment on ads could improve its dewaterability moreover the underlying mechanism of how fna treatment affects sludge dewatering has not been elucidated so far which makes such treatment process a black box with poor understanding this work aims to evaluate whether fna treatment on ads enhances its dewaterability and to deeply understand how fna treatment affects ads dewatering to differentiate the contributions of nitrite and fna to ads dewaterability the normalized cst and wcsc of ads were first compared in the presence of different nitrite levels 0 250 mg l at three ph values 5 5 6 3 and 7 2 then the mechanism of how fna improves ads dewatering were explored through analyzing the effect of fna on the physiochemical properties relevant to sludge dewatering such as the bound water content flocculability fractal dimension hydrophobicity and viscosity and the eps characteristics of ads flocs finally the benefits of this fna based ads treatment were discussed and demonstrated through a concept for further operation of a wwtp the schematic diagram of this study is outlined in fig 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of fna treated ads improving its dewaterability and revealing the relevant mechanism the findings achieved in this work not only provide insights into fna based sludge dewatering process but also supply strong supports to the operation of wwtps in sustainable ways in the future 2

used each beaker first received 500 ml ads then different volumes of nano2 stock solution 2 0 m were added into these beakers which led to the initial no2 n concentration of 0 50 150 or 250 mg l table 1 the ph in the beakers was controlled at the designed setpoints 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 by adding 2 0 m h2so4 or 2 0 m naoh the experiment conditions were detailed in table 1 after nitrite addition all the ads samples were homogenized with a mechanical stirrer 250 rpm for 24 h in a temperature controlled room 25 1 c during which nitrite concentration was measured periodically the no2 n concentration ph and temperature applied in the test gave rise to initial fna concentration ranging from 0 to 1 77 mg l in the beakers the concentration of fna was calculated according to eq s 1 wei et al 2018a b c after 24 h treatment 5 ml and 120 ml of mixtures were taken out from each beaker for the measurements of cst and wcsc under vacuum filtration respectively in the wcsc test the negative pressure and time of vacuum filtration were 0 05 mpa and 5 min respectively the obtained sludge cake was used for scanning electron microscope sem observation after vacuum freeze drying treatment at 60 c for 72 h besides another 125 ml of mixtures was equally divided into 5 parts and used for bound water measurement particle size analysis relative hydrophobicity measurement rheological property analysis or eps extraction the extracted eps were subjected to the measurements of zeta potential dissolved organic carbon doc three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra protein and polysaccharide content molecular weight and fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum while the centrate liquor before eps extraction was used for the measurements of zeta potential doc and potassium concentration the residual pellets after eps extraction were employed for the measurements of ftir spectrum and the content of intracellular materials at last the remaining ads was used for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis after removing the centrate liquor 2 3 ads treatment and dewatering in the presence of different nitrite levels at ph 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 with fecl3 addition in real word situations ads is generally conditioned by fecl3 before the final dewatering process thus the dewatering performances of fna treated ads conditioned by fecl3 were also measured in this work in this section the experiment conditions were the same as those described above except that each treated sample was added with 40 mg g tss dosage of fecl3 and subsequently homogenized with a mechanical stirrer 150 rpm for 0 5 h in a temperature controlled room 25 1 c before dewatering the dosage of 40 mg g tss fecl3 was selected according to the literature wei et al 2018b to further examine whether fna treatment could reduce the dosage of fecl3 the following test was also carried out eight replicate plastic drums with a working volume of 30 6 l each were conducted according to the results obtained above 0 35 mg l of initial fna concentration was selected in the test the dosage of fecl3 in these fna treatment samples was controlled at 0 10 20 30 or 40 mg g tss the ph in the five samples was controlled at 5 5 for comparison the other three samples without fna treatment i e ph 7 2 ph 5 5 and ph 7 2 40 mg g tss fecl3 were also conducted the other experimental methods were the same as those depicted above 2 4 analytical methods wc tss vss and cod were measured according to standard methods apha 1998 biochemical oxygen demand bod was measured with bod meter 2173b hach usa cst was measured with a cst instrument model 304b triton uk equipped with 10 mm diameter funnel a sem s 4800 hitach japan was employed to observe the morphology of ads cake the floc size and fractal dimension of ads were measured by a mastersizer mastersizer 2000 malvern uk based on the method in previous study chen et al 2016 relative hydrophobicity was measured as adherence to hydrocarbons jin et al 2004 bound water content measurement was determined using a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer q 20 ta usa guo et al 2017 briefly the temperature of ads first decreased to 20 c at a rate of 10 c min and then increased to 20 c at the same rate the free water content can be calculated by the peak area of the endothermic curve below the baseline that represented the heat required to melt the frozen free water while the bound water content was calculated by the difference of the free water content to the total water content eq s 2 rheological tests were performed with a rotational rheometer mcr 301 anton par austria based on the method documented in our previous publication li et al 2018 in brief the rheometer was equipped with a cup and bob geometry the temperature was maintained at 25 c before each rheological measurement the sludge mixture was pre sheared for 5 min at a shear rate of 200 s 1 then allowed to rest for 5 min prior to conducting a shear stress sweep the shear rate linearly increased from 0 to 200 s 1 for 5 min to obtain the relationship between the shear rate and shear stress li et al 2018 for the measurement of wcsc under vacuum filtration the negative pressure and time of vacuum filtration were 0 05 mpa and 5 min respectively to simulate the practical dewatering process wcsc under press filtration in some representative samples was also measured the sketch and photo map of the diaphragm filter press is shown in fig s1 briefly the diaphragm filter press was equipped with 8 diaphragm plates 250 mm length 250 mm width 10 mm height the dewatering procedure consisted of a feeding pressing phase 0 6 mpa for 30 min and a diaphragm pressing phase 1 0 mpa for 15 min the sludge mixture 30 l before and after treatment was dewatered with this diaphragm filter press system a heat extraction method was modified to extract different eps fractions from ads zhang et al 2014 the intracellular substances of ads were extracted by a heated tris method zhen et al 2012a the doc in the centrate liquor lb eps tb eps and intracellular substances was measured with a toc analyser toc vcph shimadzu japan 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4500 hitachi japan was utilized to characterize the changes of lb eps and tb eps and 3d eem spectra were delineated into five regions with details being described in table s1 proteins and polysaccharides in both the lb eps and tb eps were measured by the anthrone based and modified lowry method respectively li et al 2012 zeta potential of lb eps and tb eps was measured by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk potassium concentration in the centrate liquor was measured by inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icap 6300 thermo fisher scientific us molecular weight distribution of lb eps and tb eps was determined by a waters liquid chromatography system the ftir spectroscopy of ads was measured with a ftir spectrometer nicolet 8700 thermo fisher scientific usa leng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the absorbance and transmittance spectroscopy was obtained over a frequency range from 4000 to 400 cm 1 to analyze the functional groups in ads to gain insights into the secondary structures of proteins the amide i region of the protein spectrum at 1700 1600 cm 1 was further analyzed you et al 2017 deconvolution was conducted to separate the overlapping peaks by using the peakfit v4 12 software and the second derivative spectra were obtained by employing the nine point savitzky golay derivative function subsequently the amide i band was fitted from the second derivative spectra you et al 2017 xps was employed to identify the chemical states of o and n in ads by a phi quantera sxm phi 5300 esca kyoto japan zhen et al 2018 2 5 statistical analysis all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 ads dewaterability in the presence of different nitrite levels at different ph fig 2 shows the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration of ads in the presence of different initial levels of nitrite 0 250 mg l at different ph 5 5 6 3 and 7 2 with or without fecl3 addition it can be seen that the presence of nitrite affected the normalized cst and wcsc to some extents no matter what level of ph was controlled in the absence of fecl3 with an increase of initial nitrite concentration increasing from 0 to 250 mg l the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration decreased from 34 0 0 7 s l g vss and 97 0 0 3 to 32 1 0 5 s l g vss and 96 5 0 3 at ph 7 2 and 28 0 0 6 s l g vss and 96 5 0 2 to 24 1 0 6 s l g vss and 95 4 0 2 at ph 6 3 respectively at ph 5 5 the normalized cst and wcsc decreased from 23 2 0 4 s l g vss and 95 2 0 2 to 18 0 0 4 s l g vss and 92 9 0 1 with nitrite increasing from 0 mg l to 50 mg l further increase of nitrite to 250 mg l caused increases in these two parameters to 20 1 0 5 s l g vss and to 94 5 0 3 respectively when 40 mg l fecl3 was added into these samples before dewatering the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration in all the scenarios further decreased as compared with those without fecl3 addition at ph 5 5 and initial nitrite concentration 50 mg l for example the normalized cst of 11 0 0 5 s l g vss and wcsc of 83 1 0 4 were measured similar observations were also made on other samples when press filtration was applied 65 7 2 4 of wcsc was measured at ph 5 5 and initial nitrite concentration 50 mg l fig s2 this value is superior to that treated by either electrochemical or fenton process and is slightly higher than that treated by electrochemical fenton process masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 masihi et al demonstrated that 91 5 and 71 0 of wcsc press filtration were respectively measured when ads was treated by electrochemical process under 11 v for 20 min and by fenton process under the condition of 50 g g tss fe2 75 g g tss h2o2 and 30 g g tss lime for 40 min respectively masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 when electrochemical and fenton process were combined to treat ads 59 0 of wcsc was measured under the optimal condition of 15 g g tss fe2 25 g g tss h2o2 and 11 v for electrolysis for 20 min masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 the enhancement of ads dewaterability by nitrite addition could be supported by the photographs of ads cakes after press filtration sludge cakes with nitrite addition were more rigid than those without nitrite addition fig s3 sem photos further present the microstructure of sludge dewatered cakes after press filtration with different conditionings fig s4 in the control the surface of sludge cake without substantial openings is relatively smooth and compact in the sample with 50 mg l nitrite addition ph 5 5 the surface of sludge cake exhibits flake like and crisscross networked structure and substantial pores and channels are distributed on the surface which could function as a draining media for the withdrawal of water dai et al 2018a when 40 mg g tss fecl3 was added the number and size of drainage channels in the surface of sludge cake further increased which ulteriorly benefited the dewatering process fig s4 all the results demonstrated that the dewaterability of ads could be improved by the addition of pertinent nitrite levels compared with neutral condition e g ph 7 2 acidic conditions e g ph 5 5 were more beneficial to the dewatering process even at the same nitrite concentration this is probably due to that acidic conditions benefit the disruption of eps and protonation of anionic functional groups which enhance the release of bound water and destabilization of sludge particles cai et al 2018 as acidic conditions caused higher fna formed than neutral condition at the same nitrite concentration please see table 1 for details an alternative explanation might be due to that fna instead of nitrite was the major reason for the improved dewaterability of ads the differentiation of the contributions of nitrite and fna to the enhancement of ads dewatering and the mechanisms of how nitrite addition improves the dewaterability of ads were therefore made in the following text 3 2 differentiating the contributions of nitrite and fna to the enhancement of ads dewatering ads contained large numbers of soluble organics e g 725 25 mg l scod measured in this work which could be supplied as electron donors for denitrifiers to denitrify the added nitrite it was found in this work that the added nitrite was completely denitrified within 12 h in all the cases fig s5 which was consistent with the results reported previously wang et al 2018a b the added nitrite results in substantial generation of fna especially under acidic conditions please see table 1 for details and the variation of fna concentration with the treatment time in all the cases is presented in fig s5 sun et al found that the addition of nitrite enhanced the dewatering of raw was sun et al 2017 whereas wei et al thought that the protonated species of nitrite i e fna was the true contributor for the enhancement of was dewatering wei et al 2018c since nitrite and fna are coexisted in the systems no evidence has been provided to clarify this point so far to differentiate their contributions we correlated the normalized cst with the initial nitrite and fna concentration respectively it can be seen that the correlation between the normalized cst and the initial nitrite was not strong fig s6 however with an increase of the initial fna the normalized cst decreased exponentially with r2 being 0 8591 or 0 8001 without or with 40 mg g tss fecl3 addition fig s6 the results indicated that fna rather than nitrite was the major contributor to the improvement of ads dewaterability which supported the deduction made by wei and his coworkers wei et al 2018c 3 3 details of how fna treatment affects physicochemical properties relevant to ads dewatering it was documented that sludge dewaterability is mainly relevant to several physicochemical properties of sludge mixture such as bound water floc size fractal dimension relative hydrophobicity and rheological property jin et al 2003a li and yang 2007 liu et al 2016a wilén et al 2003 zhen et al 2012b therefore the effect of fna treatment on these physicochemical properties was first investigated water in sludge can be classified into free water interstitial water surface water and hydration intracellular water and bound water typically refers to the sum of the latter three types of water it is known that bound water is arduous to be dewatered by mechanical force because it is tightly bound to eps or other sludge components by adhesive forces and or chemical bonds cai et al 2018 fig 3a i presents the variation of bound water content in ads samples after treatment with fna at different levels the quantity of bound water was calculated by the equation please see eq s 2 for details documented in the literature guo et al 2017 and h used in the equation was obtained from differential scanning calorimetry measurement fig 3a ii it can be seen that the bound water content in ads treated by fna was lower than that without treatment for example 1 72 0 04 g g tss of bound water was measured in the ads sample treated by 0 35 mg fna l whereas the corresponding value was 2 05 0 04 g g tss in the ads without fna treatment fig 3a i this indicated that a portion of interstitial water surface water or hydration water was transformed into free water by fna treatment which increased the amount of easily removable water for subsequent mechanical dewatering process fig 3 b presents the variations of average floc size d0 5 and fractal dimension in ads samples after treatment by different fna concentrations compared with the control fna treatment increased the floc size but decreased the fractal dimension for example 0 35 mg l fna treatment increased the floc size from 39 12 0 80 to 43 04 0 90 μm but decreased the fractal dimension from 2 24 0 005 to 2 21 0 004 it is reported that an increase of floc size reduces the exposure of sludge surface weakens the hydrophilicity of sludge and prevents the fine sludge particles from clogging filter medium and cake layer during filtration zhen et al 2012b while a decrease of fractal dimension is related to a reduction of compact and dense surface structure dai et al 2018a the results suggest that fna treatment caused ads flocs to grow larger and become looser than their original state thereby elevating the dewatering performance the data presented in fig 3b could be further supported by the variation of sludge hydrophobicity it was measured that fna treatment improved the hydrophobicity of ads fig 3c for instance 0 35 mg l initial fna treatment increased the relative hydrophobicity of ads from 62 1 1 0 to 67 0 0 9 fig 3c the enhancement of ads hydrophobicity could lead to the decrease of water binding and facilitate the flocculation of ads which in turn improved its dewaterability liu and fang 2003 yang et al 2017 it was demonstrated that sludge flocculability was mainly affected by hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging wilén et al 2003 yang et al 2017 sludge viscosity reflecting the deformation of flocs is another essential parameter relevant to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016a it can be found that the relationship between shear rate and shear stress in all the ads samples was non liner fig 3d showing a non newtonian behavior liu et al 2016a further investigations showed that the rheological behavior of these ads samples could be well described by the herschel bulkley model fig 3d which was consistent with our previous publication li et al 2018 according to the calculations based on the model eq s 3 it can be seen that fna treatment increased the flow behavior index n but decreased the consistency of sludge k fig 3d an increase of n value indicates that the rheological behavior of the sludge tends to be a newtonian behavior feng et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 while a decrease of k value indicates a reduction of apparent viscosity liu et al 2016b xiao et al 2017 some scientists pointed out that the decrease of apparent viscosity was majorly derived from the disintegration of sludge flocs which efficiently decreased the resistance of flow and compressive forces in dewatering yuan et al 2011 moreover the decrease of apparent viscosity further indicated that the structure of ads flocs which was mainly maintained by eps was disrupted all these physicochemical properties in fig 3 were consistent with the normalized cst and wcsc data shown in fig 1 3 4 how does fna treatment affect the eps of ads sludge flocs contain a cluster of microbial colonies embedded in a cloud of eps which mainly originate from metabolism or lysis of microorganisms sheng et al 2010 eps which generally consist of several organic and inorganic components such as proteins polysaccharides humic substances lipids and nucleic acids li and yang 2007 sheng et al 2010 have a dynamic double layered structure i e lb eps and tb eps with lb eps being diffused from tb eps that surround the sludge cells directly li and yang 2007 as a key structural material of microbial aggregates eps bind with cells through complex interactions to form a vast net like structure with plenty of water that protect cells against dewatering and toxic substances sheng et al 2010 the variations in eps surface charge spatial distribution composition and chemical structure were demonstrated to affect sludge physicochemical properties basuvaraj et al 2015 jin et al 2003b li and yang 2007 wei et al 2018a thus the effect of fna treatment on the variations of eps was assessed secondly fig 4 a shows the measured zeta potential of ads centrate liquor and eps fractions after treatment by different fna concentrations it can be seen that the zeta potential of tb eps was affected slightly by fna treatment whereas fna treatment at pertinent levels e g 0 35 mg l increased the zeta potential of lb eps and centrate liquor possibly owing to their easy contact with fna for example 0 35 mg l fna treatment increased zeta potential of centrate liquor lb eps and tb eps from 19 5 0 6 mv 18 6 0 6 mv and 14 2 0 5 mv to 14 3 0 6 mv 12 3 0 7 mv and 12 6 0 6 mv respectively it is demonstrated that an increase of zeta potential reflects a reduction of electrostatic repulsive interactions which contributes to an enhancement of sludge flocculability li et al 2016b you et al 2017 the increase of zeta potential in lb eps might be due to that fna treatment decreased the content in lb eps fig 4b it is known that lb eps contain many anionic groups such as carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphoric acid groups xu et al 2018 thus decreases of these compositions benefited the increase of zeta potential in addition some scientists reported that some mono protic organic acids were substantially produced in the fna treatment process li et al 2016a it was observed that fna treatment increased the peak at 200 da in molecule weight distribution of centrate liquor and lb eps fig s7 and the substances at peak 200 da were thought as mono protic organic acids such as acetic acids xiao et al 2016 thus an alternative reason was that fna enhanced organics in ads mixtures to produce mono protic organic acids which donated protons to neutralize a part of negative charges in centrate liquor and lb eps dai et al 2018b li et al 2016a xiao et al 2016 it can be seen from fig 4b that fna treatment decreased doc concentration in lb eps and tb eps for example 0 35 mg l fna treatment decreased doc concentration in lb eps and tb eps from 60 2 2 1 mg l and 66 1 1 9 mg l to 46 0 2 0 mg l and 52 1 2 5 mg l respectively similar to doc the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in eps fractions also decreased in the fna treated samples fig 4c for example 0 35 mg l fna reduced the concentration of proteins in lb eps tb eps from 53 0 2 0 mg l 62 1 1 8 mg l to 46 1 2 3 mg l 52 1 2 4 mg l 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy further indicated that the contents of fulvic and humic substances reduced in both the lb eps and tb eps fig s8 with the decrease of organic content in eps the organic concentration in centrate liquor increased consequently fig s9 all the results suggested that fna treatment facilitated the disruption of eps fractions in ads lb eps diffuse from the surface of sludge flocs to water solution and can bind much water through their highly porous structure with low density due to strong affinity between water molecule and organics in lb eps sheng et al 2010 an effective breakdown of lb eps not only reduces the relative hydrophilicity and lb eps bound water but also benefits flocculation zhen et al 2018 as tb eps are located in the inner layer of sludge flocs and adhered to cell walls the disruption of tb eps reduces the amount of tb eps bound water and also increases the potential of intracellular water release zhen et al 2018 as the major compositions of eps proteins and polysaccharides contain hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic functional groups which favor water molecule attachment neyens et al 2004 previous investigations showed that the reductions of proteins and polysaccharides in eps indicated less stickiness lower hydrophily and better sludge flocculability qian et al 2016 to obtain more information about the effect of fna on the variations in other substances in eps ftir was used ftir spectra of eps samples can mainly indicate six organics i e hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids aromatic amino acids and nucleotides with their specific wavenumber or wavenumber range being detailed in table s2 it was found that fna treatment enhanced the transmission intensities of all the characteristic peaks in both lb eps and tb eps fig 5 a suggesting that all the contents of these six substances in eps were reduced by fna treatment further investigation showed that the transmittance of these peaks of sludge pellets after eps extraction were also increased by fna suggesting that fna treatment caused intracellular substance release as well fig s10 the data can be well supported by xps measurement fig 5b it is documented that the peaks at 399 6 ev and 400 8 ev in the n 1s high resolution spectrum and the peak at 532 3 ev in the o 1s high resolution spectrum are assigned to co nh bond of amino acid zhen et al 2018 the peaks at 530 8 and 531 5 ev in the o 1s high resolution spectrum are indicated as o h and co respectively the co nh and co reflect proteins while o h represents polysaccharides zhen et al 2018 it can be seen that fna treatment reduced the relative intensities of all those peaks in ads flocs fig 5b confirming reductions of proteins and polysaccharides in fna treated ads flocs again all the facts were in accord with the data presented in fig 3 it was also seen from fig 5a that fna treatment induced the peak shift in position of co and c n stretching amide ⅰ implying that the secondary structure of eps proteins were altered you et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the secondary structure of eps proteins played a significant role in sludge hydrophobicity you et al 2017 which was closely relevant to sludge dewatering to fully understand how fna treatment alters the secondary structure of eps proteins second derivative spectra in amide ⅰ band 1700 1600 cm 1 with or without fna treatment were further explored the second derivative spectra were subsequently carried with curve fitting based on the known structure of peptide and protein models gbsa et al 2016 you et al 2017 the fitting results showed that fna treatment decreased the value of α helix β sheet random coil from 67 27 to 60 16 in lb eps and 72 56 to 66 44 in tb eps fig 6 it is reported that α helix is retained by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 β sheet has a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet while random coil is other random conformations with no definite structure victorovich et al 2013 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 it was previously demonstrated that the protein molecule presented a loose structure when the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil was low you et al 2017 the results suggested that fna treatment destroyed the hydrogen bond maintaining α helix structure of eps proteins and then advanced the transformation of α helix to β sheet structure which caused a loose structure of protein molecules you et al 2017 as a result hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins are exposed easily which leads to strong surface hydrophobicity these results were consistent with the data in fig 3 3 5 why do high fna levels deteriorate rather than further improve ads dewatering in this work the lowest wcsc was measured at treatment by initial 0 35 mg l fna sample i e ph 5 5 and nitrite 50 mg l and at this level 83 1 0 4 or 92 9 0 1 of wcsc was determined after vacuum filtration in the presence or absence of 40 mg l fecl3 fig 2 further increase of initial fna to 0 70 i e ph 5 5 and nitrite 100 mg l and 1 77 mg l i e ph 5 5 and nitrite 250 mg l decreased wcsc vacuum filtration to 84 1 0 4 or 93 4 0 3 and 85 0 0 4 or 94 5 0 3 under the same conditions respectively fig 2 it was also observed that with an increase of initial fna concentration from 0 35 to 1 77 mg l the bound water content fractal dimension apparent viscosity increased while the relative hydrophobicity and floc size decreased fig 3 confirming that compared with 0 35 mg l fna treatment at high levels e g 1 77 mg l deteriorated ads dewaterability thus one might want to know why high fna levels deteriorate rather than further improve ads dewatering potassium is a representative intracellular element of microbial cells and the integrity of microbial cell wall could be reflected by potassium concentration in centrate liquor sun et al 2017 it was determined that 0 35 mg l initial fna slightly increased the potassium concentration in centrate liquor from 42 3 1 3 to 44 7 1 3 mg l whereas the corresponding value was measured at 55 2 1 5 mg l when 1 77 mg l initial fna was applied fig s11 moreover the content of intracellular substances only decreased from 97 5 4 1 to 90 3 4 0 mg l with initial fna increasing from 0 to 0 35 mg l however further increase of initial fna to 1 77 mg l caused this value to 40 7 2 4 mg l fig s12 these results suggested that the disruption of cell envelope at high fna levels e g 1 77 mg l was much severer than that at low fna levels e g 0 35 mg l which caused the release of intracellular substances in the former much greater than that in the latter it is known that the intracellular substances are negatively charged and hydrophilic sheng et al 2010 wei et al 2018a zhen et al 2018 their large releases at high fna levels are inevitably poured into eps fractions and captured by the dynamic net like eps this increases eps content and surface negative charge fig 4 which induces recombination of released water with eps and increase of electrostatic repulsion between sludge flocs as a result the hydrophobicity and flocculability of sludge flocs decreased while fractal dimension apparent viscosity and increased fig 3 leading to the deterioration of ads dewaterability 3 6 overall understanding according to the analyses above the mechanism of how fna improves ads dewaterability was clearly revealed which was summarized in fig 7 in the fna treatment unit fna could readily contact with eps of sludge flocs and even enter into intracellular cells two major derivatives i e reactive nitrogen species rns and reactive oxygen species ros would be formed fang and hazlitt 2004 laloo et al 2018 rns and ros intermediates are antimicrobial molecules that can cause oxidative damage to a variety of cell components such as damage of dna or rna oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids oxidation of amino acids in proteins and oxidative deactivation of specific enzymes laloo et al 2018 it was found in this study that fna and or its derivatives enhanced the disruption of eps fractions in ads fig 4 which reduced the amount of bound water the relative hydrophilicity the surface negative charge fractal dimension and the apparent viscosity but enhanced sludge flocculability it was also observed that fna treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond which maintains α helix structure of eps proteins the destruction of the hydrogen bond advanced the transformation of α helix to β sheet structure which caused proteins molecules loosely therefore hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins are exposed easily which leads to strong surface hydrophobicity besides eps fna treatment also caused a portion of intracellular substance release figs s11 and s12 reducing bound water content as well it should be emphasized however that large releases of intracellular substances at high fna levels deteriorated instead of improved ads dewatering as discussed above after 24 h treatment more substances such as proteins and polysaccharides were measured in the liquid phase in the fna added units table s3 which supported the strong damage of fna to sludge flocs well 3 7 implications this work assessed comprehensively the effect of fna treatment on ads dewatering and revealed the relevant effect mechanism for the first time the findings not only expand the application of fna but also provide insights into fna or nitrite based sludge dewatering systems moreover the findings have important implications to further operation of was treatment and disposal as demonstrated before fna treatment could substantially reduce wcsc press filtration of ads conditioned by fecl3 which is often employed in real word situations for example 0 35 mg l initial fna concentration reduced wcsc press filtration of ads from 75 4 2 5 to 65 7 2 4 fig s2 which was supported by improvements of physico chemical property and compression of eps fractions fig s13 this indicates that such level of fna treatment decreases the volume of dewatered ads treated with fecl3 by 34 4 which largely reduces the costs for its transportation and final disposal it should be noted that fna treatment could reduce the dosage of fecl3 without deterioration of ads dewaterability compared with 40 mg g tss when 30 mg g tss of fecl3 was used to condition the ads treated by 0 35 mg l initial fna for 24 h no significant variation in wcsc press filtration was determined 65 7 2 4 vs 66 8 2 1 fig s14 this suggests that fna treatment could save 25 of fecl3 dosage in practical applications besides fna treatment also enhanced the biodegradability of the centrate liquor table s3 which required to be recirculated to the mainstream wastewater treatment line for appropriate treatment this enhancement of biodegradability could provide more available organics for microbes relevant to nutrient removal benefiting to obtain cleaner effluent in wastewater treatment line sun et al 2017 wei et al 2018c considering that fna is a waste generated renewable chemical that can be readily obtained in situ in wwtps as a byproduct of wastewater treatment by nitritation of the anaerobic digestion liquor this fna based approach for the enhancement of ads dewatering has substantial economic benefits by integrating this fna based ads treatment in ads dewatering line the preliminary costs for ads dewatering transportation and final disposal could be largely reduced please see one concept in fig s15 for an example based on the experimental results achieved in this work 315 850 will be saved per year in a full scale wwtp with a 100 000 population equivalent which was preliminarily estimated by a desktop scaling up study please see table s5 for details therefore the fna based approach is economically and technically attractive 4 conclusion this work investigated the effects of free nitrous acid fna as the protonated form of nitrite on the dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge ads through comparing the dewaterability of ads treated by nitrite at different concentrations 0 250 mg l under three ph values 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 environmental results exhibited that nitrite was denitrified within 12 h and its addition facilitated ads dewatering in all the cases the optimal normalized capillary suction time of 18 0 0 6 s l g vss was acquired at nitrite 50 mg l and ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 35 mg l fna in comparison with corresponding value of 23 2 0 5 s l g vss at ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 mg l fna mechanism studies showed that fna treatment reduced surface negative charge of ads and caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances and release of intracellular substances which enhanced the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability but decreased the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads moreover fna treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond which led to a loose structure of protein benefiting the exposure of hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins as a result the physicochemical and biological properties of ads were modified to facilitate

18359,as the protonated form of nitrite free nitrous acid fna is a renewable chemical that can be produced on site from the anaerobic digestion liquor by nitritation and has been widely employed to improve the fermentation of waste activated sludge was however it is not clear whether and how fna improves the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge ads this work therefore aims to provide such supports through comparing the dewaterability of ads treated by nitrite at different concentrations 0 250 mg l under three ph values 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 environmental results showed that nitrite was completely denitrified within 12 h and its addition improved the dewaterability of ads in all the cases the optimal normalized capillary suction time of 18 0 0 4 s l g vss was obtained at nitrite 50 mg l and ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 35 mg l fna in comparison with corresponding value of 23 2 0 4 s l g vss at ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 mg l fna under this scenario 80 5 2 0 of water content was obtained in the fna treated sample after press filtration while the corresponding value was 88 5 1 7 in the control the mechanism investigations showed that fna treatment reduced surface negative charge of ads flocs and caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances and release of intracellular substances which enhanced the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability but decreased the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads additionally fna treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond which led to a loose structure of protein benefiting the exposure of hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins the findings obtained deepen our understanding of fna affecting sludge dewatering and provide strong supports to sustainable operation of wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords in situ free nitrous acid fna anaerobically digested sludge ads dewaterability physicochemical properties extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction over the last few decades the volume of waste activated sludge was in wastewater treatment plants wwtp has increased many times due to the intensification of wastewater purification li et al 2019a wang et al 2018a b 2019b wei et al 2018c 2018b wu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the treatment and disposal of was consume substantial costs which account for up to 60 of the total operation cost of a wwtp wei et al 2018a therefore there is a strong economic incentive for water utilities to reduce was volume was is normally subjected to anaerobic digestion to achieve sludge reduction and energy recovery concurrently liu et al 2019 song et al 2016 wang et al 2019a 2019c yang et al 2019 this process can effectively reduce sludge volume stabilize organics in sludge kill pathogenic microorganisms and produce renewable energy in the form of methane wei et al 2018c after anaerobic digestion the anaerobically digested sludge ads needs to be dewatered before final disposal therefore the enhancement of ads dewaterability has recently attracted much attention in the past many treatment e g physical chemical and biological processes were tested to enhance the dewaterability of ads li et al 2019b masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 song et al 2016 for example na et al found the water content of sludge cake wcsc decreased to 64 0 after 447 kj g tss of ultrasonic energy was input to condition ads na et al 2007 song and his co workers found that the capillary suction time cst of ads decreased by approximately 90 when ads was treated by zero valent iron 2 0 g g ts activated persulfate 0 5 g g ts for 4 min song et al 2016 masihi et al demonstrated the dewaterability of ads could be improved by electrochemical fenton process due to the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps fractions by hydroxyl radical with wcsc of 59 0 being achieved after filter press under the optimum operational condition masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 although these tested approaches are effective they require substantial inputs of either energy or chemicals which are unsustainable in long term operation considering massive amount of ads produced worldwide any improvement in ads dewaterability with cost effective methods should have substantial environmental and economic benefits nitrite which can be produced on site from anaerobic digestion liquor by nitritation generally requires to be recirculated to the mainstream wastewater treatment line for removal sun et al recently found that the integration of nitrite and freezing treatment for 24 h enhanced the solubilization and dewatering of raw was sun et al 2017 wei et al observed that when raw was was pretreated by free nitrous acid fna the protonated species of nitrite for 24 h before being transferred into anaerobic digester wcsc of ads slightly decreased from 87 6 to 85 9 wei et al 2018c these two good attempts demonstrated a novel application of the intermediate product of the anaerobic digestion liquor i e nitrite opening a new door for sludge dewatering enhancement in an economic way in these two studies however all the treatments with nitrite or fna were enforced to raw was rather than ads it is known that the characteristics of ads are obviously different from those of raw was for instance the release of organics from sludge flocs during anaerobic digestion decreased particle size but increased specific surface area and surface negative charge which caused ads absorbing more bound water decreasing colloidal flocculability and forming more stable colloidal system pei et al 2007 wang et al 2018a to date it remains unknown whether fna treatment on ads could improve its dewaterability moreover the underlying mechanism of how fna treatment affects sludge dewatering has not been elucidated so far which makes such treatment process a black box with poor understanding this work aims to evaluate whether fna treatment on ads enhances its dewaterability and to deeply understand how fna treatment affects ads dewatering to differentiate the contributions of nitrite and fna to ads dewaterability the normalized cst and wcsc of ads were first compared in the presence of different nitrite levels 0 250 mg l at three ph values 5 5 6 3 and 7 2 then the mechanism of how fna improves ads dewatering were explored through analyzing the effect of fna on the physiochemical properties relevant to sludge dewatering such as the bound water content flocculability fractal dimension hydrophobicity and viscosity and the eps characteristics of ads flocs finally the benefits of this fna based ads treatment were discussed and demonstrated through a concept for further operation of a wwtp the schematic diagram of this study is outlined in fig 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of fna treated ads improving its dewaterability and revealing the relevant mechanism the findings achieved in this work not only provide insights into fna based sludge dewatering process but also supply strong supports to the operation of wwtps in sustainable ways in the future 2

used each beaker first received 500 ml ads then different volumes of nano2 stock solution 2 0 m were added into these beakers which led to the initial no2 n concentration of 0 50 150 or 250 mg l table 1 the ph in the beakers was controlled at the designed setpoints 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 by adding 2 0 m h2so4 or 2 0 m naoh the experiment conditions were detailed in table 1 after nitrite addition all the ads samples were homogenized with a mechanical stirrer 250 rpm for 24 h in a temperature controlled room 25 1 c during which nitrite concentration was measured periodically the no2 n concentration ph and temperature applied in the test gave rise to initial fna concentration ranging from 0 to 1 77 mg l in the beakers the concentration of fna was calculated according to eq s 1 wei et al 2018a b c after 24 h treatment 5 ml and 120 ml of mixtures were taken out from each beaker for the measurements of cst and wcsc under vacuum filtration respectively in the wcsc test the negative pressure and time of vacuum filtration were 0 05 mpa and 5 min respectively the obtained sludge cake was used for scanning electron microscope sem observation after vacuum freeze drying treatment at 60 c for 72 h besides another 125 ml of mixtures was equally divided into 5 parts and used for bound water measurement particle size analysis relative hydrophobicity measurement rheological property analysis or eps extraction the extracted eps were subjected to the measurements of zeta potential dissolved organic carbon doc three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra protein and polysaccharide content molecular weight and fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum while the centrate liquor before eps extraction was used for the measurements of zeta potential doc and potassium concentration the residual pellets after eps extraction were employed for the measurements of ftir spectrum and the content of intracellular materials at last the remaining ads was used for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis after removing the centrate liquor 2 3 ads treatment and dewatering in the presence of different nitrite levels at ph 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 with fecl3 addition in real word situations ads is generally conditioned by fecl3 before the final dewatering process thus the dewatering performances of fna treated ads conditioned by fecl3 were also measured in this work in this section the experiment conditions were the same as those described above except that each treated sample was added with 40 mg g tss dosage of fecl3 and subsequently homogenized with a mechanical stirrer 150 rpm for 0 5 h in a temperature controlled room 25 1 c before dewatering the dosage of 40 mg g tss fecl3 was selected according to the literature wei et al 2018b to further examine whether fna treatment could reduce the dosage of fecl3 the following test was also carried out eight replicate plastic drums with a working volume of 30 6 l each were conducted according to the results obtained above 0 35 mg l of initial fna concentration was selected in the test the dosage of fecl3 in these fna treatment samples was controlled at 0 10 20 30 or 40 mg g tss the ph in the five samples was controlled at 5 5 for comparison the other three samples without fna treatment i e ph 7 2 ph 5 5 and ph 7 2 40 mg g tss fecl3 were also conducted the other experimental methods were the same as

bound water content measurement was determined using a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer q 20 ta usa guo et al 2017 briefly the temperature of ads first decreased to 20 c at a rate of 10 c min and then increased to 20 c at the same rate the free water content can be calculated by the peak area of the endothermic curve below the baseline that represented the heat required to melt the frozen free water while the bound water content was calculated by the difference of the free water content to the total water content eq s 2 rheological tests were performed with a rotational rheometer mcr 301 anton par austria based on the method documented in our previous publication li et al 2018 in brief the rheometer was equipped with a cup and bob geometry the temperature was maintained at 25 c before each rheological measurement the sludge mixture was pre sheared for 5 min at a shear rate of 200 s 1 then allowed to rest for 5 min prior to conducting a shear stress sweep the shear rate linearly increased from 0 to 200 s 1 for 5 min to obtain the relationship between the shear rate and shear stress li et al 2018 for the measurement of wcsc under vacuum filtration the negative pressure and time of vacuum filtration were 0 05 mpa and 5 min respectively to simulate the practical dewatering process wcsc under press filtration in some representative samples was also measured the sketch and photo map of the diaphragm filter press is shown in fig s1 briefly the diaphragm filter press was equipped with 8 diaphragm plates 250 mm length 250 mm width 10 mm height the dewatering procedure consisted of a feeding pressing phase 0 6 mpa for 30 min and a diaphragm pressing phase 1 0 mpa for 15 min the sludge mixture 30 l before and after treatment was dewatered with this diaphragm filter press system a heat extraction method was modified to extract different eps fractions from ads zhang et al 2014 the intracellular substances of ads were extracted by a heated

proteins the amide i region of the protein spectrum at 1700 1600 cm 1 was further analyzed you et al 2017 deconvolution was conducted to separate the overlapping peaks by using the peakfit v4 12 software and the second derivative spectra were obtained by employing the nine point savitzky golay derivative function subsequently the amide i band was fitted from the second derivative spectra you et al 2017 xps was employed to identify the chemical states of o and n in ads by a phi quantera sxm phi 5300 esca kyoto japan zhen et al 2018 2 5 statistical analysis all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 ads dewaterability in the presence of different nitrite levels at different ph fig 2 shows the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration of ads in the presence of different initial levels of nitrite 0 250 mg l at different ph 5 5 6 3 and 7 2 with or without fecl3 addition it can be seen that the presence of nitrite affected the normalized cst and wcsc to some extents no matter what level of ph was controlled in the absence of fecl3 with an increase of initial nitrite concentration increasing from 0 to 250 mg l the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration decreased from 34 0 0 7 s l g vss and 97 0 0 3 to 32 1 0 5 s l g vss and 96 5 0 3 at ph 7 2 and 28 0 0 6 s l g vss and 96 5 0 2 to 24 1 0 6 s l g vss and 95 4 0 2 at ph 6 3 respectively at ph 5 5 the normalized cst and wcsc decreased from 23 2 0 4 s l g vss and 95 2 0 2 to 18 0 0 4 s l g vss and 92 9 0 1 with nitrite increasing from 0 mg l to 50 mg l further increase of nitrite to 250 mg l caused increases in these two parameters to 20 1 0 5 s l g vss and to 94 5 0 3 respectively when 40 mg l fecl3 was added into these samples before dewatering the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration in all the scenarios further decreased as compared with those without fecl3 addition at ph 5 5 and initial nitrite concentration 50 mg l for example the normalized cst of 11 0 0 5 s l g vss and wcsc of 83 1 0 4 were measured similar observations were also made on other samples when press filtration was applied 65 7 2 4 of wcsc was measured at ph 5 5 and initial nitrite concentration 50 mg l fig s2 this value is superior to that treated by either electrochemical or fenton process and is slightly higher than that treated by electrochemical fenton process masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 masihi et al demonstrated that 91 5 and 71 0 of wcsc press filtration were respectively measured when ads was treated by electrochemical process under 11 v for 20 min and by fenton process under the condition of 50 g g tss fe2 75 g g tss h2o2 and 30 g g tss lime for 40 min respectively masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 when electrochemical and fenton process were combined to treat ads 59 0 of wcsc was measured under the optimal condition of 15 g g tss fe2 25 g g tss h2o2 and 11 v for electrolysis for 20 min masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 the enhancement of ads dewaterability by nitrite addition could be supported by the photographs of ads cakes after press filtration sludge cakes with nitrite addition were more rigid than those without nitrite addition fig s3 sem photos further present the microstructure of sludge dewatered cakes after press filtration with different conditionings fig s4 in the control the surface of sludge cake without substantial openings is relatively smooth and compact in the sample with 50 mg l nitrite addition ph 5 5 the surface of sludge cake exhibits flake like and crisscross networked structure and substantial pores and channels are distributed on the surface which could function as a draining media for the withdrawal of water dai et al 2018a when 40 mg g tss fecl3 was added the number and size of drainage channels in the surface of sludge cake further increased which ulteriorly benefited the dewatering process fig s4 all the results demonstrated that the dewaterability of ads could be improved by the addition of pertinent nitrite levels compared with neutral condition e g ph 7 2 acidic conditions e g ph 5 5 were more beneficial to the dewatering process even at the same nitrite concentration this is probably due to that acidic conditions benefit the disruption of eps and protonation of anionic functional groups which enhance the release of bound water and destabilization of sludge particles cai et al 2018 as acidic conditions caused higher fna formed than neutral condition at the same nitrite concentration please see table 1 for details an alternative explanation might be due to that fna instead of nitrite was the major reason for the improved dewaterability of ads the differentiation of the contributions of nitrite and fna to the enhancement of ads dewatering and the mechanisms of how nitrite addition improves the dewaterability of ads were therefore made in the following text 3 2 differentiating the contributions of nitrite and fna to the enhancement of ads dewatering ads contained large numbers of soluble organics e g 725 25 mg l scod measured in this work which could be supplied as electron donors for denitrifiers to denitrify the added nitrite it was found in this work that the added nitrite was completely denitrified within 12 h in all the cases fig s5 which was consistent with the results reported previously wang et al 2018a b the added nitrite results in substantial generation of fna especially under acidic conditions please see table 1 for details and the variation of fna concentration with the treatment time in all the cases is presented in fig s5 sun et al found that the addition of nitrite enhanced the dewatering of raw was sun et al 2017 whereas wei et al thought that the protonated species of nitrite i e fna was the true contributor for the enhancement of was dewatering wei et al 2018c since nitrite and fna are coexisted in the systems no evidence has been provided to clarify this point so far to differentiate their contributions we correlated the normalized cst with the initial nitrite and fna concentration respectively it can be seen that the correlation between the normalized cst and the initial nitrite was not strong fig s6 however with an increase of the initial fna the normalized cst decreased exponentially with r2 being 0 8591 or 0 8001 without or with 40 mg g tss fecl3 addition fig s6 the results indicated that fna rather than nitrite was the major contributor to the improvement of ads dewaterability which supported the deduction made by wei and his coworkers wei et al 2018c 3 3 details of how fna treatment affects physicochemical properties relevant to ads dewatering it was documented that sludge dewaterability is mainly relevant to several physicochemical properties of sludge mixture such as bound water floc size fractal dimension relative hydrophobicity and rheological property jin et al 2003a li and yang 2007 liu et al 2016a wilén et al 2003 zhen et al 2012b therefore the effect of fna treatment on these physicochemical properties was first investigated water in sludge can be classified into free water interstitial water surface water and hydration intracellular water and bound water typically refers to the sum of the latter three types of water it is known that bound water is arduous to be dewatered by mechanical force because it is tightly bound to eps or other sludge components by adhesive forces and or chemical bonds cai et al 2018 fig 3a i presents the variation of bound water content in ads samples after treatment with fna at different levels the quantity of bound water was calculated by the equation please see eq s 2 for details documented in the literature guo et al 2017 and h used in the equation was obtained from differential scanning calorimetry measurement fig 3a ii it can be seen that the bound water content in ads treated by fna was lower than that without treatment for example 1 72 0 04 g g tss of bound water was measured in the ads sample treated by 0 35 mg fna l whereas the corresponding value was 2 05 0 04 g g tss in the ads without fna treatment fig 3a i this indicated that a portion of interstitial water surface water or hydration water was transformed into free water by fna treatment which increased the amount of easily removable water for subsequent mechanical dewatering process fig 3 b presents the variations of average floc size d0 5 and fractal dimension in ads samples after treatment by different fna concentrations compared with the control fna treatment increased the floc size but decreased the fractal dimension for example 0 35 mg l fna treatment increased the floc size from 39 12 0 80 to 43 04 0 90 μm but decreased the fractal dimension from 2 24 0 005 to 2 21 0 004 it is reported that an increase of floc size reduces the exposure of sludge surface weakens the hydrophilicity of sludge and prevents the fine sludge particles from clogging filter medium and cake layer during filtration zhen et al 2012b while a decrease of fractal dimension is related to a reduction of compact and dense surface structure dai et al 2018a the results suggest that fna treatment caused ads flocs to grow larger and become looser than their original state thereby elevating the dewatering performance the data presented in fig 3b could be further supported by the variation of sludge hydrophobicity it was measured that fna treatment improved the hydrophobicity of ads fig 3c for instance 0 35 mg l initial fna treatment increased the relative hydrophobicity of ads from 62 1 1 0 to 67 0 0 9 fig 3c the enhancement of ads hydrophobicity could lead to the decrease of water binding and facilitate the flocculation of ads which in turn improved its dewaterability liu and fang 2003 yang et al 2017 it was demonstrated that sludge flocculability was mainly affected by hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging wilén et al 2003 yang et al 2017 sludge viscosity reflecting the deformation of flocs is another essential parameter relevant to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016a it can be found that the relationship between shear rate and shear stress in all the ads samples was non liner fig 3d showing a non newtonian behavior liu et al 2016a further investigations showed that the rheological behavior of these ads samples could be well described by the herschel bulkley model fig 3d which was consistent with our previous publication li et al 2018 according to the calculations based on the model eq s 3 it can be seen that fna treatment increased the flow behavior index n but decreased the consistency of sludge k fig 3d an increase of n value indicates that the rheological behavior of the sludge tends to be a newtonian behavior feng et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 while a decrease of k value indicates a reduction of apparent viscosity liu et al 2016b xiao et al 2017 some scientists pointed out that the decrease of apparent viscosity was majorly derived from the disintegration of sludge flocs which efficiently decreased the resistance of flow and compressive forces in dewatering yuan et al 2011 moreover the decrease of apparent viscosity further indicated that the structure of ads flocs which was mainly maintained by eps was disrupted all these physicochemical properties in fig 3 were consistent with the normalized cst and wcsc data shown in fig 1 3 4 how does fna treatment affect the eps of ads sludge flocs contain a cluster of microbial colonies embedded in a cloud of eps which mainly originate from metabolism or lysis of microorganisms sheng et al 2010 eps which generally consist of several organic and inorganic components such as proteins polysaccharides humic substances lipids and nucleic acids li and yang 2007 sheng et al 2010 have a dynamic double layered structure i e lb eps and tb eps with lb eps being diffused from tb eps that surround the sludge cells directly li and yang 2007 as a key structural material of microbial aggregates eps bind with cells through complex interactions to form a vast net like structure with plenty of water that protect cells against dewatering and toxic substances sheng et al 2010 the variations in eps surface charge spatial distribution composition and chemical structure were demonstrated to affect sludge physicochemical properties basuvaraj et al 2015 jin et al 2003b li and yang 2007 wei et al 2018a thus the effect of fna treatment on the variations of eps was assessed secondly fig 4 a shows the measured zeta potential of ads centrate liquor and eps fractions after treatment by different fna concentrations it can be seen that the zeta potential of tb eps was affected slightly by fna treatment whereas fna treatment at pertinent levels e g 0 35 mg l increased the zeta potential of lb eps and centrate liquor possibly owing to their easy contact with fna for example 0 35 mg l fna treatment increased zeta potential of centrate liquor lb eps and tb eps from 19 5 0 6 mv 18 6 0 6 mv and 14 2 0 5 mv to 14 3 0 6 mv 12 3 0 7 mv and 12 6 0 6 mv respectively it is demonstrated that an increase of zeta potential reflects a reduction of electrostatic repulsive interactions which contributes to an enhancement of sludge flocculability li et al 2016b you et al 2017 the increase of zeta potential in lb eps might be due to that fna treatment decreased the content in lb eps fig 4b it is known that lb eps contain many anionic groups such as carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphoric acid groups xu et al 2018 thus decreases of these compositions benefited the increase of zeta potential in addition some scientists reported that some mono protic organic acids were substantially produced in the fna treatment process li et al 2016a it was observed that fna treatment increased the peak at 200 da in molecule weight distribution of centrate liquor and lb eps fig s7 and the substances at peak 200 da were thought as mono protic organic acids such as acetic acids xiao et al 2016 thus an alternative reason was that fna enhanced organics in ads mixtures to produce mono protic organic acids which donated protons to neutralize a part of negative charges in centrate liquor and lb eps dai et al 2018b li et al 2016a xiao et al 2016 it can be seen from fig 4b that fna treatment decreased doc concentration in lb eps and tb eps for example 0 35 mg l fna treatment decreased doc concentration in lb eps and tb eps from 60 2 2 1 mg l and 66 1 1 9 mg l to 46 0 2 0 mg l and 52 1 2 5 mg l respectively similar to doc the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in eps fractions also decreased in the fna treated samples fig 4c for example 0 35 mg l fna reduced the concentration of proteins in lb eps tb eps from 53 0 2 0 mg l 62 1 1 8 mg l to 46 1 2 3 mg l 52 1 2 4 mg l 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy further indicated that the contents of fulvic and humic substances reduced in both the lb eps and tb eps fig s8 with the decrease of organic content in eps the organic concentration in centrate liquor increased consequently fig s9 all the results suggested that fna treatment facilitated the disruption of eps fractions in ads lb eps diffuse from the surface of sludge flocs to water solution and can bind much water through their highly porous structure with low density due to strong affinity between water molecule and organics in lb eps sheng et al 2010 an effective breakdown of lb eps not only reduces the relative hydrophilicity and lb eps bound water but also benefits flocculation zhen et al 2018 as tb eps are located in the inner layer of sludge flocs and adhered to cell walls the disruption of tb eps reduces the amount of tb eps bound water and also increases the potential of intracellular water release zhen et al 2018 as the major compositions of eps proteins and polysaccharides contain hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic functional groups which favor water molecule attachment neyens et al 2004 previous investigations showed that the reductions of proteins and polysaccharides in eps indicated less stickiness lower hydrophily and better sludge flocculability qian et al 2016 to obtain more information about the effect of fna on the variations in other substances in eps ftir was used ftir spectra of eps samples can mainly indicate six organics i e hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids aromatic amino acids and nucleotides with their specific wavenumber or wavenumber range being detailed in table s2 it was found that fna treatment enhanced the transmission intensities of all the characteristic peaks in both lb eps and tb eps fig 5 a suggesting that all the contents of these six substances in eps were reduced by fna treatment further investigation showed that the transmittance of these peaks of sludge pellets after eps extraction were also increased by fna suggesting that fna treatment caused intracellular substance release as well fig s10 the data can be well supported by xps measurement fig 5b it is documented that the peaks at 399 6 ev and 400 8 ev in the n 1s high resolution spectrum and the peak at 532 3 ev in the o 1s high resolution spectrum are assigned to co nh bond of amino acid zhen et al 2018 the peaks at 530 8 and 531 5 ev in the o 1s high resolution spectrum are indicated as o h and co respectively the co nh and co reflect proteins while o h represents polysaccharides zhen et al 2018 it can be seen that fna treatment reduced the relative intensities of all those peaks in ads flocs fig 5b confirming reductions of proteins and polysaccharides in fna treated ads flocs again all the facts were in accord with the data presented in fig 3 it was also seen from fig 5a that fna treatment induced the peak shift in position of co and c n stretching amide ⅰ implying that the secondary structure of eps proteins were altered you et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the secondary structure of eps proteins played a significant role in sludge hydrophobicity you et al 2017 which was closely relevant to sludge dewatering to fully understand how fna treatment alters the secondary structure of eps proteins second derivative spectra in amide ⅰ band 1700 1600 cm 1 with or without fna treatment were further explored the second derivative spectra were subsequently carried with curve fitting based on the known structure of peptide and protein models gbsa et al 2016 you et al 2017 the fitting results showed that fna treatment decreased the value of α helix β sheet random coil from 67 27 to 60 16 in lb eps and 72 56 to 66 44 in tb eps fig 6 it is reported that α helix is retained by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 β sheet has a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet while random coil is other random conformations with no definite structure victorovich et al 2013 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 it was previously demonstrated that the protein molecule presented a loose structure when the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil was low you et al 2017 the results suggested that fna treatment destroyed the hydrogen bond maintaining α helix structure of eps proteins and then advanced the transformation of α helix to β sheet structure which caused a loose structure of protein molecules you et al 2017 as a result hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins are exposed easily which leads to strong surface hydrophobicity these results were consistent with the data in fig 3 3 5 why do high fna levels deteriorate rather than further improve ads dewatering in this work the lowest wcsc was measured at treatment by initial 0 35 mg l fna sample i e ph 5 5 and nitrite 50 mg l and at this level 83 1 0 4 or 92 9 0 1 of wcsc was determined after vacuum filtration in the presence or absence of 40 mg l fecl3 fig 2 further increase of initial fna to 0 70 i e ph 5 5 and nitrite 100 mg l and 1 77 mg l i e ph 5 5 and nitrite 250 mg l decreased wcsc vacuum filtration to 84 1 0 4 or 93 4 0 3 and 85 0 0 4 or 94 5 0 3 under the same conditions respectively fig 2 it was also observed that with an increase of initial fna concentration from 0 35 to 1 77 mg l the bound water content fractal dimension apparent viscosity increased while the relative hydrophobicity and floc size decreased fig 3 confirming that compared with 0 35 mg l fna treatment at high levels e g 1 77 mg l deteriorated ads dewaterability thus one might want to know why high fna levels deteriorate rather than further improve ads dewatering potassium is a representative intracellular element of microbial cells and the integrity of microbial cell wall could be reflected by potassium concentration in centrate liquor sun et al 2017 it was determined that 0 35 mg l initial fna slightly increased the potassium concentration in centrate liquor from 42 3 1 3 to 44 7 1 3 mg l whereas the corresponding value was measured at 55 2 1 5 mg l when 1 77 mg l initial fna was applied fig s11 moreover the content of intracellular substances only decreased from 97 5 4 1 to 90 3 4 0 mg l with initial fna increasing from 0 to 0 35 mg l however further increase of initial fna to 1 77 mg l caused this value to 40 7 2 4 mg l fig s12 these results suggested that the disruption of cell envelope at high fna levels e g 1 77 mg l was much severer than that at low fna levels e g 0 35 mg l which caused the release of intracellular substances in the former much greater than that in the latter it is known that the intracellular substances are negatively charged and hydrophilic sheng et al 2010 wei et al 2018a zhen et al 2018 their large releases at high fna levels are inevitably poured into eps fractions and captured by the dynamic net like eps this increases eps content and surface negative charge fig 4 which induces recombination of released water with eps and increase of electrostatic repulsion between sludge flocs as a result the hydrophobicity and flocculability of sludge flocs decreased while fractal dimension apparent viscosity and increased fig 3 leading to the deterioration of ads dewaterability 3 6 overall understanding according to the analyses above the mechanism of how fna improves ads dewaterability was clearly revealed which was summarized in fig 7 in the fna treatment unit fna could readily contact with eps of sludge flocs and even enter into intracellular cells two major derivatives i e reactive nitrogen species rns and reactive oxygen species ros would be formed fang and hazlitt 2004 laloo et al 2018 rns and ros intermediates are antimicrobial molecules that can cause oxidative damage to a variety of cell components such as damage of dna or rna oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids oxidation of amino acids in proteins and oxidative deactivation of specific enzymes laloo et al 2018 it was found in this study that fna and or its derivatives enhanced the disruption of eps fractions in ads fig 4 which reduced the amount of bound water the relative hydrophilicity the surface negative charge fractal dimension and the apparent viscosity but enhanced sludge flocculability it was also observed that fna treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond which maintains α helix structure of eps proteins the destruction of the hydrogen bond advanced the transformation of α helix to β sheet structure which caused proteins molecules loosely therefore hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins are exposed easily which leads to strong surface hydrophobicity besides eps fna treatment also caused a portion of intracellular substance release figs s11 and s12 reducing bound water content as well it should be emphasized however that large releases of intracellular substances at high fna levels deteriorated instead of improved ads dewatering as discussed above after 24 h treatment more substances such as proteins and polysaccharides were measured in the liquid phase in the fna added units table s3 which supported the strong damage of fna to sludge flocs well 3 7 implications this work assessed comprehensively the effect of fna treatment on ads dewatering and revealed the relevant effect mechanism for the first time the findings not only expand the application of fna but also provide insights into fna or nitrite based sludge dewatering systems moreover the findings have important implications to further operation of was treatment and disposal as demonstrated before fna treatment could substantially reduce wcsc press filtration of ads conditioned by fecl3 which is often employed in real word situations for example 0 35 mg l initial fna concentration reduced wcsc press filtration of ads from 75 4 2 5 to 65 7 2 4 fig s2 which was supported by improvements of physico chemical property and compression of eps fractions fig s13 this indicates that such level of fna treatment decreases the volume of dewatered ads treated with fecl3 by 34 4 which largely reduces the costs for its transportation and final disposal it should be noted that fna treatment could reduce the dosage of fecl3 without deterioration of ads dewaterability compared with 40 mg g tss when 30 mg g tss of fecl3 was used to condition the ads treated by 0 35 mg l initial fna for 24 h no significant variation in wcsc press filtration was determined 65 7 2 4 vs 66 8 2 1 fig s14 this suggests that fna treatment could save 25 of fecl3 dosage in practical applications besides fna treatment also enhanced the biodegradability of the centrate liquor table s3 which required to be recirculated to the mainstream wastewater treatment line for appropriate treatment this enhancement of biodegradability could provide more available organics for microbes relevant to nutrient removal benefiting to obtain cleaner effluent in wastewater treatment line sun et al 2017 wei et al 2018c considering that fna is a waste generated renewable chemical that can be readily obtained in situ in wwtps as a byproduct of wastewater treatment by nitritation of the anaerobic digestion liquor this fna based approach for the enhancement of ads dewatering has substantial economic benefits by integrating this fna based ads treatment in ads dewatering line the preliminary costs for ads dewatering transportation and final disposal could be largely reduced please see one concept in fig s15 for an example based on the experimental results achieved in this work 315 850 will be saved per year in a full scale wwtp with a 100 000 population equivalent which was preliminarily estimated by a desktop scaling up study please see table s5 for details therefore the fna based approach is economically and technically attractive 4 conclusion this work investigated the effects of free nitrous acid fna as the protonated form of nitrite on the dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge ads through comparing the dewaterability of ads treated by nitrite at different concentrations 0 250 mg l under three ph values 5 5 6 3 or 7 2 environmental results exhibited that nitrite was denitrified within 12 h and its addition facilitated ads dewatering in all the cases the optimal normalized capillary suction time of 18 0 0 6 s l g vss was acquired at nitrite 50 mg l and ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 35 mg l fna in comparison with corresponding value of 23 2 0 5 s l g vss at ph 5 5 equivalent of 0 mg l fna mechanism studies showed that fna treatment reduced surface negative charge of ads and caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances and release of intracellular substances which enhanced the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability but decreased the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads moreover fna treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond which led to a loose structure of protein benefiting the exposure of hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins as a result the physicochemical and biological properties of ads were modified to facilitate
