24125,the coawst coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport modelling system is used in different configurations to simulate the iberian upwelling during the 2012 summer aiming to assess the atmosphere ocean feedbacks in the upwelling dynamics when model results are compared with satellite measurements and in situ data two way coupling is found to have a moderate impact in data model statistics a significant reinforcement of atmosphere ocean coupling coefficients is however observed in the two way coupled run and in the wrf and roms runs forced by previously simulated sst and wind fields respectively the increasing in the coupling coefficient is associated with slight but potentially important changes in the low level coastal jet in the atmospheric marine boundary layer while these results do not imply the need for fully coupled simulations in many applications they show that in seasonal numerical studies such simulations do not degrade the overall model performance and contribute to produce better dynamical fields keywords upwelling modelling coupled air sea iberia 1 introduction because of their relevance for marine ecosystems upwelling zones have been the focus of extensive modeling efforts for many years these studies have typically been done with ocean models forced by atmospheric fields one way offline coupling in the terminology that follows it has been recently recognized however that air sea interactions may induce notable differences in surface winds a correlation between wind stress curl and cross wind sst sea surface temperature gradient has been observed in open ocean frontal zones chelton et al 2004 o neill et al 2005 o neill 2010 xie 2004 as well as in coastal upwelling regions chelton et al 2007 castelão 2012 desbiolles et al 2014 oerder et al 2016 concurrently atmosphere ocean coupled models are being developed not only as the main tool for climate change studies at the global scale but also as the state of the art for regional assessments coupled models consider atmosphere ocean feedbacks such as i the behavior of boundary layers at ocean margins including the wind drop off capet et al 2004 renault et al 2016a ii the change of wind stress across sst fronts jin et al 2009 iii the joint effect of sst and coastal orography in shaping mesoscale wind structures boé et al 2011 perlin et al 2011 and iv the ocean surface current feedback to the atmosphere renault et al 2016b at the regional scale coupled modelling studies were mostly focused on the us west coast and often limited to a few weeks i e short time ranges thus modeling systems such as coawst coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport are still in need of further validation in this work we address the wind sst coupling in an upwelling system where air sea interactions are known to be significant and evaluate how far a fully coupled system two way outperforms one way offline coupling we test the sensitivity of the coawst modeling toolbox to different degrees of atmosphere ocean coupling and analyze the cost and benefits of the different approaches along the iberian west margin upwelling occurs during the summer months when the joint contribution of the favorably positioning of the azores anticyclone and of the iberian thermal low lead to strong and persistent northerly winds bakun and nelson 1991 alves and miranda 2013 the iberian margin is less studied than other upwelling regions but it is known that during the peak of upwelling activity this margin develops mesoscale structures eddies and filaments that introduce an additional degree of complexity into the air sea coupling e g peliz et al 2002 relvas et al 2009 in this article section 2 describes the set up of the two numerical models that comprise coawst section 3 describes the observational data used and section 4 presents an analysis of simulated surface wind and sst in terms of error statistics against observations the coupling coefficients between wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient are also analyzed in this section a discussion of the results is presented in section 5 2 numerical tools numerical simulations were produced with the coawst modelling system a very advanced and comprehensive numerical toolbox coawst has been used in numerous applications namely to study atmosphere ocean interface phenomena in an enclosed basin for a period of three years bruneau and toumi 2016 and mostly during hurricane and storm events renault et al 2012 nelson et al 2014 olabarrieta et al 2012 zambon et al 2014a b this numerical tool combines three open source widely used numerical models the atmospheric weather research and forecast wrf model the regional ocean modeling system roms and the surface wave model simulating waves nearshore swan in this study the coawst configuration has only considered coupling between the wrf and roms models briefly wrf is fully compressible and non hydrostatic with a hydrostatic option the model is conservative for scalar variables and uses a terrain following hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate with the top of the model at a constant pressure surface it uses an arakawa c horizontal grid for time integration it uses a third order runge kutta scheme while for spatial discretization it uses a fifth order in horizontal and a third order in vertical advection scheme a detailed description of the wrf model can be found in skamarock et al 2008 the following options were chosen cloud microphysics use the wrf single moment 3 class scheme hong et al 2004 longwave radiation uses the rapid radiative transfer model mlawer et al 1997 shortwave radiation uses the dudhia scheme dudhia 1989 the surface layer follows the eta similarity scheme janjic 1996 2002 and the planetary boundary layer the mellor yamada janjic scheme janjic 1990 1994 roms is a free surface terrain following primitive equations model that uses the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations it uses split explicit advection where a short time step is applied to advance free surface vertically integrated momentum equations a larger time step is applied for temperature salinity and baroclinic momentum equations in the numerical simulations discussed herein roms uses a third order upstream biased advection scheme the time discretization is based on a third order leap frog predictor and a third order adams moulton corrector method roms uses a stretched terrain following vertical coordinate radiation and nudging boundary conditions were imposed for tracers temperature and salinity and baroclinic velocities marchesiello et al al 2001 a flather condition for barotropic velocities flather 1976 and a chapman condition for free surface height chapman 1985 vertical turbulent mixing was parameterized with the gls generic length scale scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 using a k kl closure where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and l is the length scale the model state variables are staggered on an arakawa c grid a detailed description of the roms model is presented in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 2009 the coupling is performed using the modelling coupling toolkit mct larson

pressure relative humidity atmospheric surface temperature cloud fraction precipitation net shortwave and longwave fluxes to roms the ocean model provides sst to the atmosphere model the momentum and heat fluxes at the ocean atmosphere interface are computed by wrf ensuring that both models wrf and roms use the same fluxes the surface roughness is parameterized with charnock s formula charnock

warner et al 2008a b 2010 to avoid the need of horizontal interpolation in the coupler models were configured with a common horizontal mercator grid with approximately 6 km resolution wrf uses 40 vertical levels and roms uses 32 terrain following sigma layers with increasing vertical resolution near the ocean surface θs 5 0 but not near the seafloor θb 0 0 in the results shown below the

h h below 0 2 haidvogel and beckmann 1999 2 1 experimental set up a summer 20 june to 31 august 2012 is analyzed these dates include the iberia coastal upwelling most active period in 2012 as seen in fig 2 showing the sst measured by satellite later described before during and after the most dynamic coastal upwelling period this study is comprised by four different coawst configurations table 1 in a domain that encloses western iberia fig 3 all simulations started on may 20 allowing for 30 days of model spin up the simulations include 4 runs namely a w0 where wrf is forced by ncep reanalysis including sst every 6 hours b wr1 where roms is one way forced by surface wind net shortwave and longwave radiation surface air temperature surface pressure relative humidity and precipitation every 3 hours from w0 c w01 similar to w0 but using sst every 3 hours from wr1 d wr2 the two way coupled wrf roms run exchanging data every 5 minutes the w01 run was conducted to assess the impact of a better resolved coastal sst on surface wind comparing it with w0 the interactions between surface wind and sst was assessed by comparing the one way offline coupled runs to the coupled run although the sst in w0 is retrieved from a reanalysis and not from a numerical simulation as in the other experiments the initial sst pattern in all experiments is quite similar as seen in fig 4 this shows that the different sources used to initialize the experiments are not the cause of the output differences except for the spatial resolution issue 3 remote sensing and in situ observations 3 1 data used for model validation remote sensed and in situ data were used to assess the quality of the numerical simulations satellite sst hereafter sstsat were obtained from avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer v5 2 daily gap free data l4 product at a 0 0417 resolution pisano et al 2016 it should be noted however that while these data are directly based on observations optimally interpolated sst datasets have some known limitations namely the impact of the gap filling method in the cloud contaminated pixels an analysis of the quality flags in the avhrr database indicates that near the coast only 1 3 of interpolated data has acceptable values the remaining being inferred by the interpolation method on the other hand the characteristics of time and spatial sampling of microwave sensors used to retrieve 10 m wind do not have such strong limitation although they may be affected by rain and are unavailable near the coast daily surface wind were obtained from the ascat advanced scatterometer l3 product bentamy and croize fillon 2011 at 0 25 spatial resolution in addition to remote sensed data in situ sst were taken from the silleiro and porto buoys see location in fig 3 these buoys are located in the offshore part of the upwelling region 600 m depth there is also a quality control implemented in this operational dataset which verifies correct functioning of the equipment as well as flags added to non valid measurements i e anomalously high low measurements hourly averaged data is provided 4 results 4 1 surface wind and sea surface temperature the simulated wind and sst fields for the whole period 20 june 31 august 2012 are shown in figs 5 11 in the w0 run the sst field was obtained from the ncep reanalysis and in w01 from the wr1 run in wr1 the wind field corresponds to the w0 output the most obvious difference in fig 5 consists in the weak coastal cooling in the w0 simulation an indication of the lack of resolution of sst in ncep 1 reanalysis the two simulations with numerically simulated sst wr1 wr2 produce broadly comparable sst fields with a good representation of the coastal upwelling regarding the mean wind field the four simulations w0 w01 wr1 wr2 have a similar mean flow with the surface wind blowing from nw increasing in intensity and veering n in the south of iberia to assess the quality of simulated wind a comparison between simulations and ascat daily data is shown in fig 6 the plots show the zonally averaged wind speed over a band 300 km off the coast data were also averaged every 0 5 in latitude each data point corresponds to the difference between the simulations averaged over simulation period and the ascat product the satellite data were interpolated to the model grid using only valid data a band of nearly 25 km off the coast was excluded the model data available every 3 h was also integrated on the daily means to match the satellite dataset the simulations show similar error patterns with negative bias in the north turning into positive in the south however the coupling of roms leads to a reduction by half of the absolute mean wind error from 0 31 m s 1 in the w0 run to 0 15 m s 1 in wr2 run the w01 simulation forced with a one way offline coupled roms simulated sst also has a mean absolute error comparable to the one of the coupled run 0 19 m s 1 to test the statistical significance of the computed mean absolute error a bootstrapping test was performed by sampling with replacement the mean absolute error values 1000 times which gives at a 95 confidence level values between 0 19 0 42 for w0 0 16 0 23 for w01 and 0 09 0 24 for wr2 confirming a strong separation between w0 one way offline coupled and the other simulations and the more modest improvement due to the two way coupling wr2 when compared with w01 the reduction of the wind intensity in the two way coupled and w01 simulations may result from a cooler coastal sst developed in those runs which reduces vertical mixing within the marine atmospheric boundary layer and consequently the mean surface wind the differences in variability of the surface winds the ratio of the standard deviation of each simulation to the standard deviation of the satellite data fig 6b show that on average all simulations overestimate the observed variability although simulations tend to slightly underestimate zonal wind component not shown the overestimated variability may be partially explained with a lack of variability in satellite wind because of the strong space and time averaging to further analyze the model s performance the time series of simulated surface wind are compared in fig 7 against satellite scatterometer wind data at eight points offshore cf fig 3 each representing a box of 18 by 18 km 3 by 3 computational cells in all cases one finds a very good agreement with satellite data during the studied period considering two locations such as silleiro north and sines south the computed statistics detailed in table 2 indicate high correlations of daily mean values 0 86 to 0 92 low bias and a normalized standard deviation close to 1 in terms of sea surface temperature fig 8 compares simulated and satellite sst bias and normalized standard deviation after averaging a 300 km offshore box as for the wind data fig 6 the sst in w0 simulation blue line in fig 8a is 0 39 k warmer than sstsat the mean absolute computed error for both runs with numerically simulated sst is very similar 0 17 k for wr1 0 16 k for wr2 but it is noted that south of about 40 n the fully coupled run wr2 is clearly closer to satellite data the bootstrapping method provided values intervals at a 95 confidence level of 0 11 0 25 for wr1 and 0 09 0 25 for wr2 confirming the similarity of the mean absolute error with marginally lower values for wr2 the ncep sst based simulation w0 shows an underestimation of the observed sst variability avhrr whereas roms simulated sst on average increases this variability error statistics with reference satellite and buoy data computed at silleiro and porto shown in table 3 indicate a reduction of the bias a similar correlation and an excess of variability in the coupled run wr2 when compared with the wr1 for both satellite and buoy datasets the time evolution of sst in the eight offshore locations fig 9 helps to understand the time mean error patterns the different runs followed a similar general trend although with much larger differences between models and between models and observations than those found for wind speed the coupled run improved model observations comparisons in some instances but not in others and or in some locations and not so much in others nevertheless it is noted that the variability associated with satellite data represented in fig 9 by the red shaded region between sst 2 standard deviation or the variability associated with buoy data green shaded region comprises the wr1 and wr2 daily time series in fact with respect to correlation runs w01 and wr2 compare marginally better r 0 8 with data measured by the porto buoy located in a region of strong upwelling activity see fig 2b than with satellite data looking at the coastal sst zonal distribution fig 10c it is observed the coastal upwelling characteristic drop off in both wr2 and wr1 fig 10c this pattern is however produced by different mechanisms in both runs in the coupled simulation wr2 the drop off is mostly due to ekman pumping wind curl fig 10b on the other hand in wr1 the cross shore sst change is mainly owed to coastal upwelling forced by the stronger coastal wind fig 10a in order to quantify these two mechanisms we computed vertical velocity due to wind stress curl ekman pumping as w τ ρ f where τ is wind stress ρ is mean seawater density and f is the coriolis parameter and compared it with the mean vertical velocity numerical simulated in wr1 and wr2 near the surface approximately in the upper 74 m on average at sines latitude and within the 50 km closer to coastline excluding depths lower than 74 m the wr1 vertical velocity due to wind stress curl accounts for about 11 but this value increases in wr2 to 40 4 2 the atmospheric low level jet it is known that the wind sst interaction effect is not confined to the surface and may influence the atmosphere above the marine atmospheric boundary layer in some cases previous studies noticed vertical wind anomalies that reach the tropopause associated with intense air sea interaction in western north atlantic minobe et al 2008 and nelson and he 2012 thus atmosphere ocean interaction and feedbacks are relevant not only to define the coastal sst and its evolution but also to specify the vertical structure of the overlying atmospheric boundary layer such structure will respond and interact with the upwelling episodes in different timescales fig 11 shows the mean distribution of wind and potential temperature in the vertical cross section at the latitude of sines near the core of the coastal jet which gains intensity in the iberia sw sector the potential temperature cross section shows a clear intensification of coastal cooling in the fully coupled simulation wr2 when compared with the reference forced by reanalysis w0 such intensification leads to a stronger jet in the atmospheric boundary layer with a slightly stronger mean core at about 250 m of height resulting from a thermal wind effect but a weaker surface wind resulting from an increase in stratification in the surface layer so a stronger shear in top of the surface layer near 100 m coastal jets are an important feature of all major upwelling systems ranjha et al 2013 and their sensitivity to changes in the local environment may be an important component of the response of upwelling to climate change semedo et al 2016 miranda et al 2013 or to low frequency variability in the climate system 4 3 atmosphere ocean coupling several studies have identified evidence of the feedback of sst on the low level atmosphere flow in particular in cases where strong sst gradients modify the vertical mixing in the overlying atmosphere surface layer chelton and xie 2010 found reduced wind speeds over cold water associated with increased atmospheric stability decoupling the surface layer from the free atmospheric flow aloft and the opposite over warm waters in the presence of a sst front such response will lead to a curl in the low level wind proportional to the crosswind component of the sst gradient e g castelão 2012 in the present study results shown and discussed from fig 11 do suggest relevant atmosphere ocean feedbacks that lead to sensitive changes and justify the importance of the two way coupled simulations to gain insight on the coupling process one needs to look at the co distributions of 10 m wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient it is well known that surface wind sst and heat fluxes are strongly inter dependent variables for instance near the gulf stream region off eastern us nelson et al 2014 observed enhanced wind over a warm sea inducing large surface heat fluxes and cooling the upper ocean in the wr2 and w01 runs low coastal sensible and latent heat fluxes and downward shortwave radiation fluxes were noted in a narrow coastal band where a high cloud cover region was numerically simulated not shown coinciding with the region where the lowest values of sst and surface wind over the coastal ocean were observed however the resolution of available satellite products does not support a detailed validation of such features in western iberia due to the combined effect of cool coastal sst coastline orientation and increasing coastal drag the local wind stress curl is not uniformly distributed along the coast as noted by monteiro et al 2016 for instance maximums are present particularly in the regions sheltered from the northerly wind south of the main capes as also previously reported by perlin et al 2004 for the western us coast fig 12 shows the zonal and time averaged surface wind stress curl within the 300 km offshore band it is important to note that satellite scatterometer data was previously interpolated onto the model grid and that the satellite data lower resolution 25 km vs 6 km in the models often underestimate the coastal curl capet 2004 weakening the comparisons between models and remote sensed observations but as before for wind and sst exactly the same area is taken into account in the analysis of wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient variables considering the different numerical experiments the w0 simulation underestimates wind stress curl along the coast fig 12 a with a mean absolute error of 0 54 n m 2 100 km 0 43 0 68 values within brackets are the intervals at a 95 confidence level of the bootstrapping statistical test the coupled simulation wr2 and w01 reduce this anomaly and associated intervals of confidence to respectively 0 15 0 10 0 20 and 0 23 0 18 0 29 all runs overestimate the variability of curl fig 12b again probably due to its underestimations by satellite data the higher coastal wind stress curl values in the two way coupled simulation and w01 are consistent with the effect of cooler sst on coastal wind decelerating the wind near the coast and consequently intensifying the wind stress curl by this process the negative mean bias shown by the w0 run is reduced in the two way coupled and w01 simulations to further analyze the impacts of the different coupling settings on wind sst coupling cross wind sst gradients were computed according to sst k sst sin θ where k is the unit vector aligned with the direction of the wind stress and θ is the counterclockwise angle between vectors sst and k as expected sst ncep used in w0 run has a negative bias of crosswind sst gradient 0 31 c 100 km fig 13 a both runs with numerically simulated sst exhibit a mean absolute latitudinal error of 0 30 0 21 0 43 for wr1 and 0 35 0 22 0 55 for wr2 the crosswind sst gradient mean absolute errors and intervals at a 95 confidence level of the bootstrapping statistical test are broadly the same but slightly higher in wr2 than wr1 which is probably due to the dependence of this variable on wind direction gradient sst direction and intensity thus of more degrees of freedom that are simultaneously simulated in wr2 in agreement with the excess of wind curl variability shown in fig 12 it was also noted an excess of variability in crosswind sst gradient fig 13b keeping in mind the scatterometer data limitations and that interpolated sstsat data might also be underestimating the coastal sst gradients we may consider that this is overall a consistent set of results the covariation of wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient fields will now be analyzed with overlapping 29 day means at 7 day intervals data in a band 300 km offshore excluding the first 25 km not detected by the satellite data points are binned for different values of the crosswind sst gradient for each bin data includes 98 of all instances between quantiles 1 and 99 in fig 14 the red line represents the mean value of every bin and the bars indicate the location of its 1 standard deviation from all selected data points the slope of the linear regression blue line was computed representing the coupling coefficient chelton et al 2004 together with the correlation coefficient bootstrapping tests were used to compute the coupling coefficient at the 95 confidence level in the intervals 0 88 0 90 for satellite 0 89 0 92 for wr2 0 28 0 30 for wr1 0 57 0 64 for w0 and 0 85 0 86 for w01 only the estimates based on the satellite data wr2 and w01 are comparable with results obtained for other upwelling systems as shown in table 4 as shown in fig 14 the best match is observed between satellite data and the two way coupled run wr2 with identical correlation coefficients 0 72 very similar coupling coefficients 0 89 vs 0 90 and with overlapping ranges in the statistical test w01 shows slightly less coupling 0 86 but an even higher correlation 0 80 the control run w0 has a very weak correlation 0 16 and a reduced coupling coefficient 0 60 whereas wr1 one way offline coupling presents the weakest coupling 0 29 with an intermediate correlation 0 48 the fact that wr2 is only marginally better than w01 deserves some discussion both runs use high resolution coastal wind given by wrf at the same resolution w01 requires two wrf simulations one downscaling the reanalysis data and used to force one way roms the second forced one way by roms so that this second simulation sees a high resolution sst as did wr2 so w01 is a rather expensive way to simulate the atmosphere ocean interaction which seems to work for a period of a few months but is always a less satisfactory approach especially given that the full two way coupling produces better results at a lower cost the good comparison between w01 and wr2 and with observations also suggests that the coastal wind field may be obtained by a single high resolution atmospheric simulation if it is forced by an available high resolution ocean sst something that is seldom possible especially in climate studies the offshore structure of the coupling coefficient and correlation are shown in fig 15 with both values increasing away from the coast as noted by boé et al 2011 desbiolles et al 2014 and renault et al 2016a these authors attributed such increase to the progressive reduction of the influence of the coastal orography and or coastline geometry and consequent increase influence of sst on surface wind it is noted that the satellite coupling coefficient and correlation values are almost like those computed with wr2 and w01 runs indicating a good co distribution of wind curl and crosswind sst gradient in time and space it is just within the 120 km coastal band that the satellite values have a mismatch with those computed from the simulations probably due to interpolation issues in a region where sst gradients are often strong 5 discussion and conclusions coupled atmosphere ocean modelling systems such as coawst will soon become the standard approach to the study of most atmosphere and ocean processes as they are the best way to represent the mutual forcing and feedbacks between those systems in the present study focused on the dynamics of coastal upwelling offshore western iberia in summer 2012 it was shown that such approach is feasible with immediate benefits on the representation of the mean fields in both the upper ocean and lower atmosphere by using a set of simulations with an increased degree of coupling from one way offline coupled to two way coupled it was shown that coupling leads to a progressive improvement of the simulation statistics rather substantial when it is associated with an improved representation of the coastal wind more modest but still in the right sense when it includes the two way feedback possible in the fully coupled simulations many studies of coastal upwelling have used reanalysis winds or large scale wind produced by global atmospheric models to force regional ocean models such as roms the same approach used in the present study indicated that it does produce coastal upwelling but its results suffer from a lack of spatial detail in the wind data which can only be obtained by regional atmospheric modelling by performing an iterative simulation starting by an atmospheric downscaling followed by the regional ocean simulation an approach which does not include the full two way coupling it was possible to obtain results that were only marginally worse than those of the fully coupled run but at a higher computational cost and with a much more complex procedure the clear conclusion is that the fully coupled run is a better approach the positive impact of two way atmosphere ocean coupling were found directly on mean variable statistics such as 10 m wind and sst but more importantly in improved balanced fields as given by the coupling coefficients chelton et al 2004 such fields are difficult to validate in detail but the present results compare very well with published analyses concerning the canary benguela desbiolles et al 2014 and california chelton et al 2007 systems indeed there seems to be no indication of a system dependency if the coefficients derived from satellite are smaller than those in the california system those produced by the models without considering anomaly fields are of the same magnitude the reinforcement of the coupling coefficients suggests that coupled simulations may be able to represent the atmosphere ocean co variability not only in upwelling but in other more transient processes such as ocean based atmospheric storms furthermore the present results also suggest an impact in the atmospheric circulation away from the ocean surface which may improve the representation of important atmospheric phenomena such as the coastal jets semedo et al 2016 there are some limitations in the present study resulting from the properties of the observational data which is mostly based on satellite products and is affected by limited spatial and time resolution and by artificial smoothing introduced by the optimum interpolation scheme some discrepancies between simulated and observed fields may result from a lack of variability or bias in the satellite data and will only be addressed with new observing systems on the other hand the use of one single 3 month simulation is still a first step towards the validation of a system usable for climate downscaling the coawst modelling system has evolved since its initial release by warner et al 2010 and it can now be successfully used to simulate complex coastal upwelling processes while many processes can still be analyzed with one way offline simulations two way coupling is a desirable tool in many studies and is indeed more computationally efficient when

24125,the coawst coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport modelling system is used in different configurations to simulate the iberian upwelling during the 2012 summer aiming to assess the atmosphere ocean feedbacks in the upwelling dynamics when model results are compared with satellite measurements and in situ data two way coupling is found to have a moderate impact in data model statistics a significant reinforcement of atmosphere ocean coupling coefficients is however observed in the two way coupled run and in the wrf and roms runs forced by previously simulated sst and wind fields respectively the increasing in the coupling coefficient is associated with slight but potentially important changes in the low level coastal jet in the atmospheric marine boundary layer while these results do not imply the need for fully coupled simulations in many applications they show that in seasonal numerical studies such simulations do not degrade the overall model performance and contribute to produce better dynamical fields keywords upwelling modelling coupled air sea iberia 1 introduction because of their relevance for marine ecosystems upwelling zones have been the focus of extensive modeling efforts for many years these studies have typically been done with ocean models forced by atmospheric fields one way offline coupling in the terminology that follows it has been recently recognized however that air sea interactions may induce notable differences in surface winds a correlation between wind stress curl and cross wind sst sea surface temperature gradient has been observed in open ocean frontal zones chelton et al 2004 o neill et al 2005 o neill 2010 xie 2004 as well as in coastal upwelling regions chelton et al 2007 castelão 2012 desbiolles et al 2014 oerder et al 2016 concurrently atmosphere ocean coupled models are being developed not only as the main tool for climate change studies at the global scale but also as the state of the art for regional assessments coupled models consider atmosphere ocean feedbacks such as i the behavior of boundary layers at ocean margins including the wind drop off capet et al 2004 renault et al 2016a ii the change of wind stress across sst fronts jin et al 2009 iii the joint effect of sst and coastal orography in shaping mesoscale wind structures boé et al 2011 perlin et al 2011 and iv the ocean surface current feedback to the atmosphere renault et al 2016b at the regional scale coupled modelling studies were mostly focused on the us west coast and often limited to a few weeks i e short time ranges thus modeling systems such as coawst coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport are still in need of further validation in this work we address the wind sst coupling in an upwelling system where air sea interactions are known to be significant and evaluate how far a fully coupled system two way outperforms one way offline coupling we test the sensitivity of the coawst modeling toolbox to different degrees of atmosphere ocean coupling and analyze the cost and benefits of the different approaches along the iberian west margin upwelling occurs during the summer months when the joint contribution of the favorably positioning of the azores anticyclone and of the iberian thermal low lead to strong and persistent northerly winds bakun and nelson 1991 alves and miranda 2013 the iberian margin is less studied than other upwelling regions but it is known that during the peak of upwelling activity this margin develops mesoscale structures eddies and filaments that introduce an additional degree of complexity into the air sea coupling e g peliz et al 2002 relvas et al 2009 in this article section 2 describes the set up of the two numerical models that comprise coawst section

modelling system a very advanced and comprehensive numerical toolbox coawst has been used in numerous applications namely to study atmosphere ocean interface phenomena in an enclosed basin for a period of three years bruneau and toumi 2016 and mostly during hurricane and storm events renault et al 2012 nelson et al 2014 olabarrieta et al 2012 zambon et al 2014a b this numerical tool combines three open source widely used numerical models the atmospheric weather research and forecast wrf model the regional ocean modeling system roms and the surface wave model simulating waves nearshore swan in this study the coawst configuration has only considered coupling between the wrf and roms models briefly wrf is fully compressible and non hydrostatic with a hydrostatic option the model is conservative for scalar variables and uses a terrain following hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate with the top of the model at a constant pressure surface it uses an arakawa c horizontal grid for time integration it uses a third order runge kutta scheme while for spatial discretization it uses a fifth order in horizontal and a third order in vertical advection scheme a detailed description of the wrf model can be found in skamarock et al 2008 the following options were chosen cloud microphysics use the wrf single moment 3 class scheme hong et al 2004 longwave radiation uses the rapid radiative transfer model mlawer et al 1997 shortwave radiation uses the dudhia scheme dudhia 1989 the surface layer follows the eta similarity scheme janjic 1996 2002 and the planetary boundary layer the mellor yamada janjic scheme janjic 1990 1994 roms is a free surface terrain following primitive equations model that uses the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations it uses split explicit advection where a short time step is applied to advance free surface vertically integrated momentum equations a larger time step is applied for temperature salinity and baroclinic momentum equations in the numerical simulations discussed herein roms uses a third order upstream biased advection scheme the time discretization is based on a third order leap frog predictor and a third order adams moulton corrector method roms uses a stretched terrain following vertical coordinate radiation and nudging boundary conditions were imposed for tracers temperature and salinity and baroclinic velocities marchesiello et al al 2001 a flather condition for barotropic velocities flather 1976 and a chapman condition for free surface height chapman 1985 vertical turbulent mixing was parameterized with the gls generic length scale scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 using a k kl closure where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and l is the length scale the model state variables are staggered on an arakawa c grid a detailed description of the roms model is presented in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 2009 the coupling is performed using the modelling coupling toolkit mct larson

pressure relative humidity atmospheric surface temperature cloud fraction precipitation net shortwave and longwave fluxes to roms the ocean model provides sst to the atmosphere model the momentum and heat fluxes at the ocean atmosphere interface are computed by wrf ensuring that both models wrf and roms use the same fluxes the surface roughness is parameterized with charnock s formula charnock

warner et al 2008a b 2010 to avoid the need of horizontal interpolation in the coupler models were configured with a common horizontal mercator grid with approximately 6 km resolution wrf uses 40 vertical levels and roms uses 32 terrain following sigma layers with increasing vertical resolution near the ocean surface θs 5 0 but not near the seafloor θb 0 0 in the results shown below the

fig 2 showing the sst measured by satellite later described before during and after the most dynamic coastal upwelling period this study is comprised by four different coawst configurations table 1 in a domain that encloses western iberia fig 3 all simulations started on may 20 allowing for 30 days of model spin up the simulations include 4 runs namely a w0 where wrf is forced by ncep reanalysis including sst every 6 hours b wr1 where roms is one way forced by surface wind net shortwave and longwave radiation surface air temperature surface pressure relative humidity and precipitation every 3 hours from w0 c w01 similar to w0 but using sst every 3 hours from wr1 d wr2 the two way coupled wrf roms run exchanging data every 5 minutes the w01 run was conducted to assess the impact of a better resolved coastal sst on surface wind comparing it with w0 the interactions between surface wind and sst was assessed by comparing the one way offline coupled runs to the coupled run although the sst in w0 is retrieved from a reanalysis and not from a numerical simulation as in the other experiments the initial sst pattern in all experiments is quite similar as seen in fig 4 this shows that the different sources used to initialize the experiments are not the cause of the output differences except for the spatial resolution issue 3 remote sensing and in situ observations 3 1 data used for model validation remote sensed and in situ data were used to assess the quality of the numerical simulations satellite sst hereafter sstsat were obtained from avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer v5 2 daily gap free data l4 product at a 0 0417 resolution pisano et al 2016 it should be noted however that while these data are directly based on observations optimally interpolated sst datasets have some known limitations namely the impact of the gap filling method in the cloud contaminated pixels an analysis of the quality flags in the avhrr database indicates that near the coast only 1 3 of interpolated data has acceptable values the remaining being inferred by the interpolation method on the other hand the characteristics of time and spatial sampling of microwave sensors used to retrieve 10 m wind do not have such strong limitation although they may be affected by rain and are unavailable near the coast daily surface wind were obtained from the ascat advanced scatterometer l3 product bentamy and croize fillon 2011 at 0 25 spatial resolution in addition to remote sensed data in situ sst were taken from the silleiro and porto buoys see location in fig 3 these buoys are located in the offshore part of the upwelling region 600 m depth there is also a quality control implemented in this operational dataset which verifies correct functioning of the equipment as well as flags added to non valid measurements i e anomalously high low measurements hourly averaged data is provided 4 results 4 1 surface wind and sea surface temperature the simulated wind and sst fields for the whole period 20 june 31 august 2012 are shown in figs 5 11 in the w0 run the sst field was obtained from the ncep reanalysis and in w01 from the wr1 run in wr1 the wind field corresponds to the w0 output the most obvious difference in fig 5 consists in the weak coastal cooling in the w0 simulation an indication of the lack of resolution of sst in ncep 1 reanalysis the two simulations with numerically simulated sst wr1 wr2 produce broadly comparable sst fields with a good representation of the coastal upwelling regarding the mean wind field the four simulations w0 w01 wr1 wr2 have a similar mean flow with the surface wind blowing from nw increasing in intensity and veering n in the south of iberia to assess the quality of simulated wind a comparison between simulations and ascat daily data is shown in fig 6 the plots show the zonally averaged wind speed over a band 300 km off the coast data were also averaged every 0 5 in latitude each data point corresponds to the difference between the simulations averaged over simulation period and the ascat product the satellite data were interpolated to the model grid using only valid data a band of nearly 25 km off the coast was excluded the model data available every 3 h was also integrated on the daily means to match the satellite dataset the simulations show similar error patterns with negative bias in the north turning into positive in the south however the coupling of roms leads to a reduction by half of the absolute mean wind error from 0 31 m s 1 in the w0 run to 0 15 m s 1 in wr2 run the w01 simulation forced with a one way offline coupled roms simulated sst also has a mean absolute error comparable to the one of the coupled run 0 19 m s 1 to test the statistical significance of the computed mean absolute error a bootstrapping test was performed by sampling with replacement the mean absolute error values 1000 times which gives at a 95 confidence level values between 0 19 0 42 for w0 0 16 0 23 for w01 and 0 09 0 24 for wr2 confirming a strong separation between w0 one way offline coupled and the other simulations and the more modest improvement due to the two way coupling wr2 when compared with w01 the reduction of the wind intensity in the two way coupled and w01 simulations may result from a cooler coastal sst developed in those runs which reduces vertical mixing within the marine atmospheric boundary layer and consequently the mean surface wind the differences in variability of the surface winds the ratio of the standard deviation of each simulation to the standard deviation of the satellite data fig 6b show that on average all simulations overestimate the observed variability although simulations tend to slightly underestimate zonal wind component not shown the overestimated variability may be partially explained with a lack of variability in satellite wind because of the strong space and time averaging to further analyze the model s performance the time series of simulated surface wind are compared in fig 7 against satellite scatterometer wind data at eight points offshore cf fig 3 each representing a box of 18 by 18 km 3 by 3 computational cells in all cases one finds a very good agreement with satellite data during the studied period considering two locations such as silleiro north and sines south the computed statistics detailed in table 2 indicate high correlations of daily mean values 0 86 to 0 92 low bias and a normalized standard deviation close to 1 in terms of sea surface temperature fig 8 compares simulated and satellite sst bias and normalized standard deviation after averaging a 300 km offshore box as for the wind data fig 6 the sst in w0 simulation blue line in fig 8a is 0 39 k warmer than sstsat the mean absolute computed error for both runs with numerically simulated sst is very similar 0 17 k for wr1 0 16 k for wr2 but it is noted that south of about 40 n the fully coupled run wr2 is clearly closer to satellite data the bootstrapping method provided values intervals at a 95 confidence level of 0 11 0 25 for wr1 and 0 09 0 25 for wr2 confirming the similarity of the mean absolute error with marginally lower values for wr2 the ncep sst based simulation w0 shows an underestimation of the observed sst variability avhrr whereas roms simulated sst on average increases this variability error statistics with reference satellite and buoy data computed at silleiro and porto shown in table 3 indicate a reduction of the bias a similar correlation and an excess of variability in the coupled run wr2 when compared with the wr1 for both satellite and buoy datasets the time evolution of sst in the eight offshore locations fig 9 helps to understand the time mean error patterns the different runs followed a similar general trend although with much larger differences between models and between models and observations than those found for wind speed the coupled run improved model observations comparisons in some instances but not in others and or in some locations and not so much in others nevertheless it is noted that the variability associated with satellite data represented in fig 9 by the red shaded region between sst 2 standard deviation or the variability associated with buoy data green shaded region comprises the wr1 and wr2 daily time series in fact with respect to correlation runs w01 and wr2 compare marginally better r 0 8 with data measured by the porto buoy located in a region of strong upwelling activity see fig 2b than with satellite data looking at the coastal sst zonal distribution fig 10c it is observed the coastal upwelling characteristic drop off in both wr2 and wr1 fig 10c this pattern is however produced by different mechanisms in both runs in the coupled simulation wr2 the drop off is mostly due to ekman pumping wind curl fig 10b on the other hand in wr1 the cross shore sst change is mainly owed to coastal upwelling forced by the stronger coastal wind fig 10a in order to quantify these two mechanisms we computed vertical velocity due to wind stress curl ekman pumping as w τ ρ f where τ is wind stress ρ is mean seawater density and f is the coriolis parameter and compared it with the mean vertical velocity numerical simulated in wr1 and wr2 near the surface approximately in the upper 74 m on average at sines latitude and within the 50 km closer to coastline excluding depths lower than 74 m the wr1 vertical velocity due to wind stress curl accounts for about 11 but this value increases in wr2 to 40 4 2 the atmospheric low level jet it is known that the wind sst interaction effect is not confined to the surface and may influence the atmosphere above the marine atmospheric boundary layer in some cases previous studies noticed vertical wind anomalies that reach the tropopause associated with intense air sea interaction in western north atlantic minobe et al 2008 and nelson and he 2012 thus atmosphere ocean interaction and feedbacks are relevant not only to define the coastal sst and its evolution but also to specify the vertical structure of the overlying atmospheric boundary layer such structure will respond and interact with the upwelling episodes in different timescales fig 11 shows the mean distribution of wind and potential temperature in the vertical cross section at the latitude of sines near the core of the coastal jet which gains intensity in the iberia sw sector the potential temperature cross section shows a clear intensification of coastal cooling in the fully coupled simulation wr2 when compared with the reference forced by reanalysis w0 such intensification leads to a stronger jet in the atmospheric boundary layer with a slightly stronger mean core at about 250 m of height resulting from a thermal wind effect but a weaker surface wind resulting from an increase in stratification in the surface layer so a stronger shear in top of the surface layer near 100 m coastal jets are an important feature of all major upwelling systems ranjha et al 2013 and their sensitivity to changes in the local environment may be an important component of the response of upwelling to climate change semedo et al 2016 miranda et al 2013 or to low frequency variability in the climate system 4 3 atmosphere ocean coupling several studies have identified evidence of the feedback of sst on the low level atmosphere flow in particular in cases where strong sst gradients modify the vertical mixing in the overlying atmosphere surface layer chelton and xie 2010 found reduced wind speeds over cold water associated with increased atmospheric stability decoupling the surface layer from the free atmospheric flow aloft and the opposite over warm waters in the presence of a sst front such response will lead to a curl in the low level wind proportional to the crosswind component of the sst gradient e g castelão 2012 in the present study results shown and discussed from fig 11 do suggest relevant atmosphere ocean feedbacks that lead to sensitive changes and justify the importance of the two way coupled simulations to gain insight on the coupling process one needs to look at the co distributions of 10 m wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient it is well known that surface wind sst and heat fluxes are strongly inter dependent variables for instance near the gulf stream region off eastern us nelson et al 2014 observed enhanced wind over a warm sea inducing large surface heat fluxes and cooling the upper ocean in the wr2 and w01 runs low coastal sensible and latent heat fluxes and downward shortwave radiation fluxes were noted in a narrow coastal band where a high cloud cover region was numerically simulated not shown coinciding with the region where the lowest values of sst and surface wind over the coastal ocean were observed however the resolution of available satellite products does not support a detailed validation of such features in western iberia due to the combined effect of cool coastal sst coastline orientation and increasing coastal drag the local wind stress curl is not uniformly distributed along the coast as noted by monteiro et al 2016 for instance maximums are present particularly in the regions sheltered from the northerly wind south of the main capes as also previously reported by perlin et al 2004 for the western us coast fig 12 shows the zonal and time averaged surface wind stress curl within the 300 km offshore band it is important to note that satellite scatterometer data was previously interpolated onto the model grid and that the satellite data lower resolution 25 km vs 6 km in the models often underestimate the coastal curl capet 2004 weakening the comparisons between models and remote sensed observations but as before for wind and sst exactly the same area is taken into account in the analysis of wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient variables considering the different numerical experiments the w0 simulation underestimates wind stress curl along the coast fig 12 a with a mean absolute error of 0 54 n m 2 100 km 0 43 0 68 values within brackets are the intervals at a 95 confidence level of the bootstrapping statistical test the coupled simulation wr2 and w01 reduce this anomaly and associated intervals of confidence to respectively 0 15 0 10 0 20 and 0 23 0 18 0 29 all runs overestimate the variability of curl fig 12b again probably due to its underestimations by satellite data the higher coastal wind stress curl values in the two way coupled simulation and w01 are consistent with the effect of cooler sst on coastal wind decelerating the wind near the coast and consequently intensifying the wind stress curl by this process the negative mean bias shown by the w0 run is reduced in the two way coupled and w01 simulations to further analyze the impacts of the different coupling settings on wind sst coupling cross wind sst gradients were computed according to sst k sst sin θ where k is the unit vector aligned with the direction of the wind stress and θ is the counterclockwise angle between vectors sst and k as expected sst ncep used in w0 run has a negative bias of crosswind sst gradient 0 31 c 100 km fig 13 a both runs with numerically simulated sst exhibit a mean absolute latitudinal error of 0 30 0 21 0 43 for wr1 and 0 35 0 22 0 55 for wr2 the crosswind sst gradient mean absolute errors and intervals at a 95 confidence level of the bootstrapping statistical test are broadly the same but slightly higher in wr2 than wr1 which is probably due to the dependence of this variable on wind direction gradient sst direction and intensity thus of more degrees of freedom that are simultaneously simulated in wr2 in agreement with the excess of wind curl variability shown in fig 12 it was also noted an excess of variability in crosswind sst gradient fig 13b keeping in mind the scatterometer data limitations and that interpolated sstsat data might also be underestimating the coastal sst gradients we may consider that this is overall a consistent set of results the covariation of wind stress curl and crosswind sst gradient fields will now be analyzed with overlapping 29 day means at 7 day intervals data in a band 300 km offshore excluding the first 25 km not detected by the satellite data points are binned for different values of the crosswind sst gradient for each bin data includes 98 of all instances between quantiles 1 and 99 in fig 14 the red line represents the mean value of every bin and the bars indicate the location of its 1 standard deviation from all selected data points the slope of the linear regression blue line was computed representing the coupling coefficient chelton et al 2004 together with the correlation coefficient bootstrapping tests were used to compute the coupling coefficient at the 95 confidence level in the intervals 0 88 0 90 for satellite 0 89 0 92 for wr2 0 28 0 30 for wr1 0 57 0 64 for w0 and 0 85 0 86 for w01 only the estimates based on the satellite data wr2 and w01 are comparable with results obtained for other upwelling systems as shown in table 4 as shown in fig 14 the best match is observed between satellite data and the two way coupled run wr2 with identical correlation coefficients 0 72 very similar coupling coefficients 0 89 vs 0 90 and with overlapping ranges in the statistical test w01 shows slightly less coupling 0 86 but an even higher correlation 0 80 the control run w0 has a very weak correlation 0 16 and a reduced coupling coefficient 0 60 whereas wr1 one way offline coupling presents the weakest coupling 0 29 with an intermediate correlation 0 48 the fact that wr2 is only marginally better than w01 deserves some discussion both runs use high resolution coastal wind given by wrf at the same resolution w01 requires two wrf simulations one downscaling the reanalysis data and used to force one way roms the second forced one way by roms so that this second simulation sees a high resolution sst as did wr2 so w01 is a rather expensive way to simulate the atmosphere ocean interaction which seems to work for a period of a few months but is always a less satisfactory approach especially given that the full two way coupling produces better results at a lower cost the good comparison between w01 and wr2 and with observations also suggests that the coastal wind field may be obtained by a single high resolution atmospheric simulation if it is forced by an available high resolution ocean sst something that is seldom possible especially in climate studies the offshore structure of the coupling coefficient and correlation are shown in fig 15 with both values increasing away from the coast as noted by boé et al 2011 desbiolles et al 2014 and renault et al 2016a these authors attributed such increase to the progressive reduction of the influence of the coastal orography and or coastline geometry and consequent increase influence of sst on surface wind it is noted that the satellite coupling coefficient and correlation values are almost like those computed with wr2 and w01 runs indicating a good co distribution of wind curl and crosswind sst gradient in time and space it is just within the 120 km coastal band that the satellite values have a mismatch with those computed from the simulations probably due to interpolation issues in a region where sst gradients are often strong 5 discussion and conclusions coupled atmosphere ocean modelling systems such as coawst will soon become the standard approach to the study of most atmosphere and ocean processes as they are the best way to represent the mutual forcing and feedbacks between those systems in the present study focused on the dynamics of coastal upwelling offshore western iberia in summer 2012 it was shown that such approach is feasible with immediate benefits on the representation of the mean fields in both the upper ocean and lower atmosphere by using a set of simulations with an increased degree of coupling from one way offline coupled to two way coupled it was shown that coupling leads to a progressive improvement of the simulation statistics rather substantial when it is associated with an improved representation of the coastal wind more modest but still in the right sense when it includes the two way feedback possible in the fully coupled simulations many studies of coastal upwelling have used reanalysis winds or large scale wind produced by global atmospheric models to force regional ocean models such as roms the same approach used in the present study indicated that it does produce coastal upwelling but its results suffer from a lack of spatial detail in the wind data which can only be obtained by regional atmospheric modelling by performing an iterative simulation starting by an atmospheric downscaling followed by the regional ocean simulation an approach which does not include the full two way coupling it was possible to obtain results that were only marginally worse than those of the fully coupled run but at a higher computational cost and with a much more complex procedure the clear conclusion is that the fully coupled run is a better approach the positive impact of two way atmosphere ocean coupling were found directly on mean variable statistics such as 10 m wind and sst but more importantly in improved balanced fields as given by the coupling coefficients chelton et al 2004 such fields are difficult to validate in detail but the present results compare very well with published analyses concerning the canary benguela desbiolles et al 2014 and california chelton et al 2007 systems indeed there seems to be no indication of a system dependency if the coefficients derived from satellite are smaller than those in the california system those produced by the models without considering anomaly fields are of the same magnitude the reinforcement of the coupling coefficients suggests that coupled simulations may be able to represent the atmosphere ocean co variability not only in upwelling but in other more transient processes such as ocean based atmospheric storms furthermore the present results also suggest an impact in the atmospheric circulation away from the ocean surface which may improve the representation of important atmospheric phenomena such as the coastal jets semedo et al 2016 there are some limitations in the present study resulting from the properties of the observational data which is mostly based on satellite products and is affected by limited spatial and time resolution and by artificial smoothing introduced by the optimum interpolation scheme some discrepancies between simulated and observed fields may result from a lack of variability or bias in the satellite data and will only be addressed with new observing systems on the other hand the use of one single 3 month simulation is still a first step towards the validation of a system usable for climate downscaling the coawst modelling system has evolved since its initial release by warner et al 2010 and it can now be successfully used to simulate complex coastal upwelling processes while many processes can still be analyzed with one way offline simulations two way coupling is a desirable tool in many studies and is indeed more computationally efficient when

24126,this study presents simulations of the global ocean wave climate corresponding to the surface winds and sea ice concentrations as simulated by five cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 climate models for the historical 1979 2005 and rcp8 5 scenario future 2081 2100 periods to tackle the numerical complexities associated with the inclusion of the north pole the wavewatch iii ww3 wave model was used with a customized unstructured spherical multi cell grid of 100 km offshore and 50 km along coastlines the climate model simulated wind and sea ice data and the corresponding ww3 simulated wave data were evaluated against reanalysis and hindcast data the results show that all the five sets of wave simulations projected lower waves in the north atlantic corresponding to decreased surface wind speeds there in the warmer climate the selected cmip5 models also consistently projected an increase in the surface wind speed in the southern hemisphere sh mid high latitudes which translates in an increase in the ww3 simulated significant wave height hs there the higher waves are accompanied with increased peak wave period and increased wave age in the east pacific and indian oceans and a significant counterclockwise rotation in the mean wave direction in the southern oceans the latter is caused by more intense waves from the sh traveling equatorward and developing into swells future wave climate in the arctic ocean in summer is projected to be predominantly of mixed sea states with the climatological mean of september maximum hs ranging mostly 3 4 m the new waves approaching arctic coasts will be less fetch limited as ice retreats since a predominantly southwards mean wave direction is projected in the surrounding seas keywords surface ocean waves climate change cmip5 smc grid arctic ice retreat 1 introduction climate change has become a major focus of attention for the scientific community due to the potential impacts on the environment in the near future ipcc 2013 global warming is not homogeneous over the earth leading to changes in the atmospheric meridional temperature gradients that have direct consequences on the pressure and wave forcing wind patterns e g weisse and von storch 2010 using a multi model ensemble hemer et al 2013 assessed the projected changes and uncertainties in ocean surface wave climate at a global scale 1979 2009 vs 2070 2100 using 20 members for the significant wave height hs including both statistical and dynamical simulations 4 members for the mean wave period tm and 5 members for the mean wave direction θm they found that a decrease increase in hs over 25 8 7 1 of the global ocean area was consistently projected by all the ensemble members they analyzed the increase was predominantly found in the southern ocean which in turn influenced a larger proportion of the global ocean as swell propagates northwards into the other oceans leading to an increase in the annual mean tm over 30 2 of the global ocean and a rotation of the annual mean wave direction clockwise in the tropical pacific and tropical atlantic about 30 s 30 n and anticlockwise in most of the other regions however they did not include the arctic ocean as in the majority of the previous global wave climate studies e g dobrynin et al 2012 hemer and trenham 2016 fan et al 2012 semedo et al 2013 wang et al 2014 which typically have a latitude range that covers up to 80 n at the maximum the major obstacle to extending physical wave models to the north pole is the rapidly diminishing cell size at high latitudes when using regular latitude longitude lat lon grids in global wave climate studies such smaller cells lead to a computationally unaffordable time step due to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl restriction applying to the numerical schemes used in most wave models another problem is the increased curvature of the parallels at high latitudes since wave models commonly follow the scalar assumption for which the local east of a cell is considered to be the same as the neighboring cells which is erroneous at high latitudes li 2012 this explains why even in regional wave modeling studies for the arctic the north pole grid point s is usually left out of the modeling domain e g khon et al 2014 rogers and orzech 2013 in statistical wave modeling one of the main reasons to avoid the arctic ocean is the lack of measurements reanalysis to properly calibrate the relationship between predictors and predictands especially in the new open water areas these arctic challenges have received little attention from the scientific community since historically the extent of waves was rather limited given that the basin was mostly ice covered year round therefore the arctic ocean wave climate is poorly known despite the few recent studies in addition the challenges that wave sea ice interaction poses are still to be solved and lead to an additional source of uncertainty in the context of climate change which is especially accentuated in the arctic ipcc 2013 it is becoming more important to properly evaluate the present and future arctic ocean wave climate at different temporal and spatial scales the arctic sea ice extent has been declining drastically over the past few years with the ice coverage shrinking to as high as 86 in the summers of 2007 and 2012 li 2012 in addition despite the large uncertainty among climate models ipcc 2013 most of their projections agree that the arctic ocean will be ice free in the summer months by sometime between the mid and end of this century gagné et al 2015 laliberté et al 2016 khon et al 2014 were one of the first regional studies on the future wave climate in the arctic ocean they examined the relative importance of the two main drivers affecting the wave climate in the arctic surface wind and sea ice cover they concluded that the role of surface wind is very important in the areas where waves currently exist but as expected sea ice is the main factor explaining changes in the wave climate in areas presently ice covered most of the year like the inner arctic in a similar way wang et al 2015a found that historical changes based on 1970 2013 reanalysis in the beaufort chukchi seas waves cannot be explained by changes in the wind field alone based on another 1992 2014 reanalysis stopa et al 2016 also concluded that the increasing waves in the beaufort chukchi sea are related to declining sea ice however by analyzing altimeter data for the period 1996 2015 liu et al 2016 reported a significant increase in both wind speed and hs in that area nonetheless the influence of sea ice retreat on wave height was manifested in the laptev sea where changes of wind speed could not explain the significant trends of wave height liu et al 2016 therefore despite the regional uncertainty in quantifying the wind and sea ice influence on waves it is evident that they will both play a role in the future wave climate in the arctic ocean ice retreat affects the wave climate in a number of ways the first consequence is the opening of new water areas for wave generation and growth secondly sea ice retreat affects areas with currently existing waves even far from the ice edge by means of increasing the fetch a larger fetch entails a reduction in the fetch limited wave conditions and thus results in larger waves it also favors the development of swell waves thomson and rogers 2014 in addition sea ice also affects waves in the sea ice margin zone wave energy is not instantly dissipated when encountering sea ice tolman 2003 instead waves can penetrate into ice covered seas while being attenuated as a function of the wave period sea ice concentration thickness and floe size distribution moreover the wave frequency the ice floe distribution and the ratio of wave length to ice floe length will determine the ratio of wave scattering tolman 2003 i e wave energy spread to other areas potential wave driven impacts on the arctic environment and activities comprise a broad range of aspects safety and risk have been identified as key factors affecting the building of future shipping routes in the emerging arctic ocean shyu and ding 2016 which has raised economical interest melia et al 2016 but also environmental awareness due to the potential risks posed to the arctic wildlife and habitat huntington 2009 miller and ruiz 2014 in determining efficient and safe navigability conditions future wave conditions will undoubtedly play a role in addition the changing wave conditions have important implications for the upper ocean dynamics and rich biological cycle of the arctic overeem et al 2011 changes in wave effects can have an impact on the upper ocean mixing and hence on the sea surface temperature and surface climate song et al 2012 such increase in heat can in turn result in increasing ice melting rates leading to a positive feedback vihma et al 2014 higher waves can also mechanically accelerate the ice retreat by breaking up the ice thomson and rogers 2014 and can also lead to coastal impacts such as erosion overeem et al 2011 actually the arctic coast is already experiencing an average rate of erosion of 0 5 m year with the highest rates being observed in the laptev east siberian and beaufort seas lantuit et al 2012 which puts arctic coastal infrastructure and cultural and archeological sites at a vulnerable position radosavljevic et al 2016 likewise an increase in the long wavelength waves swell can threaten coastal vulnerability in terms of flooding because they have the potential to be a significant driver of extreme sea levels along the coastline hoeke et al 2013 this study presents projected changes in ocean surface waves by the late 21st century in the global oceans including the entire arctic ocean to simulate waves the wavewatch iii ww3 wave model was forced by the surface winds and sea ice concentrations simulated by five coupled model intercomparison phase 5 cmip5 climate models for the historical period 1979 2005 and the rcp8 5 forcing scenario ipcc 2013 future period 2081 2100 to tackle the aforementioned challenges regarding ocean wave modeling at high latitudes a customized spherical multiple cell smc grid li 2012 was implemented the simulated wave and wave forcing fields wind speed and sea ice concentration for the historical period were also evaluated against reanalysis hindcast to provide an insight into how the skill of the selected cmip5 models in simulating surface winds and sea ice concentration manifests in the corresponding wave simulations using ww3 the rest of the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology used the resulting wave simulations are analyzed and discussed in section 3 finally section 4 summarizes the main conclusions 2 methodology and data 2 1 wave model and forcing data version 4 18 of the wavewatch iii wave model tolman and the wavewatch iii development group 2014 was employed to simulate the wave climate using the smc grid detailed in section 2 2 below the conventional parametrizations of wave physics in ww3 st4 nl1 switches were used ardhuin et al 2010 hasselmann and hasselman 1985 as in khon et al 2014 the methodology of tolman 2003 for considering the ice effect was followed namely two critical ice concentrations 25 and 75 define initial and total impediment of wave propagation ic0 switch between those two cut off concentrations waves progressively loose energy while traveling through the ice field by partially obstructed grid points as a function of the sea ice concentration tolman 2003 since waves are generated propagated when sea ice concentration sic is below 75 we refer to the condition of sic below 75 as ice free conditions in this study as opposite to non existence of waves the computational global time step in ww3 was set to one hour using 29 and 24 frequency and direction bins respectively hourly values of the following output spectrum derived parameters were obtained and stored for each grid cell of the computational grid hs fp and θm the peak wave period tp is computed as the inverse of the peak frequency fp the ww3 was forced by the 3 hourly surface 10 m winds and daily sics produced by the following cmip5 models bcc csm1 1 miroc5 gfdl esm2m ec earth only one run per model is used here we chose these models because we want to include as wide a range of model uncertainty as possible to include climate models of the best to worst performance for historical wind simulations and of the smallest to the largest projected changes following the recommendation of the coordinated ocean wave climate project cowclip wang et al 2015b we also added the inmcm4 model ipcc 2013 that was also used by erikson et al 2015 to ease the planned cowclip phase ii inter comparison wang et al 2015b hemer et al 2014 simulations were carried out for two periods 1979 2005 historical and 2081 2100 future which are similar to the periods identified as of common interest by the cowclip project wang et al 2015b the cmip5 historical and rcp8 5 scenario simulations of the forcing winds and sic were used respectively the rcp8 5 forcing scenario ipcc 2013 assumes a continued increase in greenhouse emissions throughout the 21st century for each variable all the forcing data have the same temporal resolution but different spatial resolutions and therefore they were spatially interpolated onto a common lat lon grid of about 100 km resolution nonetheless the original spatial resolution of the climate model still plays a role in the model performance as shown later in section 3 table 1 describes the original resolution of the cmip5 models regarding surface wind and sic fields for the wind field atmospheric model grids are almost regular longitude latitude grids some deviation may occur for the latitude resolution at higher latitudes for the sic ocean model grids are non regular lat lon grids of finer resolutions 2 2 the smc grid the smc grid li 2011 was developed to tackle the aforementioned polar problems in ocean surface wave models see section 1 it was implemented in the ww3 for the first time in version 4 18 which is used in this study despite being an unstructured grid it retains the conventional lat lon grid cells so minimal changes to lat lon grid finite difference schemes are required and its implementation is easier than other unstructured grids the smc grid relaxes the cfl restriction at high latitudes by merging the longitudinal cells towards the poles enabling to efficiently extend global wave simulations to include the north pole see fig s1 in the supplementary material sm in addition the smc grid introduces a round polar cell to remove the singularity of the spherical coordinate system at the north pole by using a fixed reference direction to define vector components within a limited arctic part which slightly overlaps with the global part see fig s1 this reduces the error caused by the invalid scalar assumption for vector components defined relative to the local east direction at high latitudes moreover an interesting feature of the smc grid is that it can also handle multiple resolutions within the same grid so that coastlines for instance can be resolved at high resolutions while the open oceans are kept at an affordable coarser resolution li 2012 although the arctic part of the smc grid typically northward of approximately 85 n has not been fully validated due to the lack of observations in the polar region it has been recently tested by comparing the simulations of an expanded arctic part northward of 65 n approx with available satellite measurements li 2016 in this study the smc grid was generated with a coarse resolution of about 100 km offshore and 50 km along the coastlines fig s1 hereafter referred to as smc100 it was based on the naval research laboratory digital bathymetry data base 2 minute resolution nrl dbdb2 covering the full range of latitudes from 90 s to 90 n the merging of cells was implemented at latitudes poleward of 60 see fig s1 this leads to a total of 32 516 cells the arctic part and global part of the grid slightly overlaps which leads to 96 overlapped grid cells in the computation in addition to the 32 516 cells for comparison purposes note that the number of cells resulted from using smc100 is still lower than the number of grid cells that a traditional lat lon grid would involve with the same coarse resolution but without any coastal refinement 35 000 water cells approx 2 3 data post processing the output wave data was filtered prior to analysis due to some discrepancies found in the land sea masks of the sea ice simulations some near coastline water grid points in the smc100 grid did not have sea ice information since they were considered as land in the cmip5 simulated sic field probably due to spatial resolution differences in ww3 missing sic data as such is understood as zero sic which is not necessarily true especially in the arctic and antarctic regions and can lead to waves being simulated in probably ice covered areas to avoid these misleading results that could entail a bias in the statistics of the simulations such particular cases have been filtered out using the following procedure for each output time step and each wave grid point poleward of 40 the 10 closest grid points were checked to determine whether or not the target grid point was in the vicinity of ice the wave parameters associated to that time step and grid point were discarded set to missing if i at least one of such neighboring 10 cells in the interpolated sic field was ice covered in terms of wave generation i e sic is above 75 and ii either of the two closest grid points of the land sea mask of the given climate model is defined as land this is to make sure these are near the coast where the land sea mask discrepancy occurs by removing only particular time steps instead of the whole time series this enables us to provide statistics for warm periods when there is no ice cover and therefore land sea mask inaccuracies are not an issue however as explained in section 2 5 statistics are only computed when all time steps corresponding to the time window of analysis annual monthly have wave information to avoid considering suspicious values around the filtered out time steps after a detailed visual inspection with using different numbers of nearby points in the filtering procedure we chose the method with 10 nearby points rather than the perhaps more natural 8 points because it gives better results for irregular coastlines however for a few areas with a very irregular bathymetry pronounced sticking in out coastline the 10 closest grid points which are based on the lon lat distance that does not account for obstacles were not representative of the sea surroundings to determine whether or not that target point is ice covered in such cases the closest wave grid point obtained by visual inspection accounting by the topographical obstacles was used to determine the ice conditions in the vicinity an example is the shelikhov gulf located at the sea of okhotsk at the north east russian coast near the bering sea 2 4 data and methodology for evaluating the historical climate simulations we used the latest wave hindcast by the national centre for environmental prediction ncep released this year http polar ncep noaa gov waves hindcasts nopp phase2 php last accessed june 2017 to evaluate the cmip5 based wave simulations for the historical period 1979 2005 this wave hindcast hereafter denoted as cfsrc provides 3 hourly data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 it uses corrected surface winds from the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 which was obtained using a coupled atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice modeling system and provides hourly data of a spatial resolution ranging from 0 25 in the tropics to 0 5 in the polar regions lon lat dimensions of 1152 576 for comparison with table 1 the important advances of cfsr in comparison to its predecessors consist not only of the coupling between the ocean atmosphere land surface and sea ice model but also assimilation in three dimensions of satellite radiances and its increased horizontal and vertical resolution saha et al 2010 jakobson et al 2012 validated five atmospheric reanalysis datasets over the central arctic ocean including cfsr and recommended cfsr especially for all near surface variables like the surface wind speed they added that the better performance of cfsr near the surface might be explained by the sophisticated treatment of sea ice including its fractional coverage and prognostic ice and snow thickness saha et al 2010 stopa et al 2016 also chose to use cfsr winds to generate an arctic wave climate hindcast dataset partly because of the better performance for extremes despite the reported relatively good performance of cfsr winds ncep has conducted a bias correction based on collocated altimeter data to reduce the bias in the strongest winds especially over the southern ocean http polar ncep noaa gov waves hindcasts nopp phase2 php last accessed june 2017 the corrected winds show notably weaker annual maximum wind speeds at mid and high latitudes e g arctic ocean than the uncorrected cfsr winds fig 1 in terms of annual mean wind the corrected winds are stronger than the uncorrected winds at high latitudes near antarctica and over the arctic ocean but they are similar elsewhere in the evaluation below we define bias as the difference in the climatological mean value of a wave parameter annual mean hs annual maximum hs and annual mean tp between an ensemble member of wave simulations and the cfsrc wave hindcast in order to evaluate the seasonal variability of model skill at a regional scale we also computed the bias in the spatially averaged climatological mean for each calendar month between the two data sets for the 13 regions shown in fig s2 similar regions were used by wang et al 2014 and hemer and trenham 2016 but in this study we have added the arctic ar and antarctic an regions for each of these regions we also derived the spatial pattern correlation i e the pearson correlation coefficient between the simulated and cfsrc monthly climatological mean wave fields over the given region one correlation coefficient for each calendar month in the presence of sea ice in ar and an regions the climatological means of a wave parameter are computed only when ice free conditions exist for the whole period of analysis evaluation hemer and trenham 2016 pointed out that high performance of climate models for standard climate variables does not necessarily imply high performance for climate model forced wave simulations they stressed the need to evaluate the performance of a climate model for the marine meteorological climate independently of its performance for the standard climate variables however the standard variables they considered include air temperature and precipitation but not the surface wind speed the variable most directly related to ocean wave generation growth and propagation nevertheless in addition to the effect of counteracting processes nonlinearities might attenuate or exaggerate biases from driving to driven fields casas prat et al 2016 a deeper insight into this can be obtained by comparing the performance of climate models for surface wind speed and sic with the performance seen in the corresponding wave parameters such skill comparison can also lead to better understanding of the cause of biases in the cmip5 based wave simulations moreover studies on comparing the skill of cmip5 models for non standard climate variables especially the surface wind speed over the ocean are scarce hemer and trenham 2016 for example kumar et al 2015 analyzed cmip5 simulated surface wind speed extremes over land only lee et al 2013 evaluated the performance of a subset of cmip3 and cmip5 models for wind stress over the ocean but including only two models inmcm4 and miroc5 that we analyzed in this study thus an evaluation of the wave forcing fields i e surface wind speed and sic simulated by the five cmip5 models is also included in this study see section 3 1 2 below the performance of cmip5 models for simulating sic has received relatively more attention than for simulating surface winds for example shu et al 2015 evaluated sea ice simulations by all cmip5 models for both the arctic and antarctica however for completeness and consistency this study also evaluated the sic simulations by the five cmip5 models against the cfsr reanalysis data we used the 95 percentile of sic rather than the maximum value analyzing the performance of the maximum sic would give little information about model performance since this variable is constrained by definition and most of the grid points in high latitudes actually do achieve the maximum 100 ice concentration at some point the pearson correlation coefficient linear regression assumes normally distributed data however sic is a bounded variable its values range from 0 to 1 or 100 the data is a type of compositional data and is not normally distributed thus it is not suitable to directly apply a statistical method that assumes a normal distribution for the data for the sic data a logit transformation can be used to alleviate the violation of the assumption of normal distribution pawlowsky glahn and egozcue 2006 such data transformation becomes even more crucial in avoiding spurious effects when computing correlation among parts of the same whole i e among different categories of the same compositional data ortego and egozcue 2016 it also prevents from obtaining extrapolated unrealistic values outside the boundaries when performing trend analysis in this study we applied logit transformation to the sic data however the resulting model skill ranking shows no major differences with or without the transformation therefore for simplicity we opted to show the results obtained without the transformation see section 3 1 below 2 5 method for analyzing the projected climate changes the simulated statistics of hs tp tp 1 fp θm were analyzed in this study unless stated otherwise the nautical convention is used to qualitatively describe the wave direction e g s meaning waves coming from the south i e going northwards but the cartesian convention is used to quantitatively illustrate θm results in section 3 e g 90 means waves going from south to north in order to estimate the wind sea or swell predominance as in casas prat and sierra 2013 charles et al 2012 hanley et al 2010 and guo et al 2015 we also computed the inverse wave age a 1 as 1 a 1 u 10 cos θ wave θ wind c p with c p g t p 2 π where cp is the wave celerity θ wave the wave direction θ wind the wind direction and u 10 the surface wind speed as in hanley et al 2010 we used θ m as θ wave to compute the relative angle between the wind and the waves högström et al 2010 argued the suitability of the cosine of the relative angle between the wind and wave directions see eq 1 they objected that at low latitudes the angle difference might easily be close to 90 and therefore the cosine close to zero artificially altering the inverse wave age and particularly the wave age they suggested to use only the celerity ratio i e a 1 u 10 c p when wind and waves are not aligned which is a clear case of non equilibrium sea states the estimation of swell wind sea might be less accurate when using only the velocity ratio in this case the inclusion of the wave direction if available provides additional relevant information hanley et al 2011 nevertheless hanley et al 2011 showed that this disparity in the definition of a 1 does not seem to significantly affect the results of the mean a 1 climatology thus we prefer to include the angle difference to calculate a 1 in this study supporting the counterpoints given by hanley et al 2011 in this study a 1 was used to define the following three basic wave regimes i swell for a 1 0 15 ii mixed waves for 0 15 a 1 0 83 and iii wind sea for a 1 0 83 hanley et al 2010 a 1 can also be used to assess the degree of local coupling between surface winds and waves swell interacts with the airflow by giving momentum to the wind and inducing wave driven wind as opposed to pure wind driven waves in the wind sea states hanley et al 2010 in seas with varying ice cover the method to describe wave statistics becomes important however discrepancies between existing approaches are minimized when wave statistics are seasonally or monthly stratified tuomi et al 2011 in this study we used the ice free time approach as described by tuomi et al 2011 i e only the part of the year when the sea is ice free see section 2 1 is taken into account when calculating wave statistics as in wang et al 2015a statistics for a time window annual monthly are computed only for a grid point that is ice free in that time window over the whole period of analysis wave projections will be presented and discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 mainly in terms of the ensemble average which has been found to be more skillful than the individual ensemble members e g hemer and trenham 2016 the range of inter model variability will also be discussed briefly with the figures for individual ensemble members being shown in the supplementary material sm note that the inter model variability in waves in this study refers to the variability among the five ensemble members of wave simulations i e the variability arising from five different climate models being used to simulate the wave forcing fields rather than from different wave models being used to simulate waves all the five ensemble members of wave simulations were produced using the same wave model ww3 in this study a democracy approach was used to calculate the ensemble average knutti 2010 which was for simplicity and motivated by the lack of evidence that a climate model of better performance in simulating the historical climate will necessarily produce better projections of future climate déqué and somot 2010 the student t test von storch and zwiers 2001 was conducted at 5 significance level to determine whether or not the ensemble average of projected changes is statistically significantly different from zero i e stands out of the inter model variability in the new emerging sea areas the projected changes are non negative and do not have a normal probability distribution their statistical significance cannot be appropriately determined by the t test which is for normally distributed data in addition the projected changes are conditioned to the probability of wave occurrence the variability is difficult to estimate with an ensemble of size five thus a simple approach is adopted the projected changes are simply considered statistically significant when all five climate models projected ice free below 75 sic conditions the t test for comparing the means of two samples that might have different variances von storch and zwiers 2001 was also used in this study to determine the statistical significance at 5 level of changes projected by each individual ensemble member for simplicity changes in new emerging sea areas projected in an ensemble member are considered statistically significant in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation results for the historical climate simulations 3 1 1 evaluation results for the historical wave simulations fig 2 shows the 1979 2005 mean of the annual mean hs maximum hs and mean tp as derived from the cfsrc data along with biases in the ensemble average of the corresponding wave statistics as simulated using ww3 forced by the surface winds and sic simulated by five cmip5 climate models see section 2 1 here the bias is calculated as the ensemble average minus the corresponding cfsrc quantity the simulated ensemble average of annual mean hs is generally larger than the corresponding cfsrc quantity which is manifested as mostly positive biases in fig 2b although some negative values up to 5 m are seen in the atlantic in particular larger positive biases are seen in the low latitudes with biases of 0 5 1 m in the surroundings of small islands in the pacific ocean i e aleutian and tropical islands this partly arises from the differences in wave model resolution the smc100 grid for the ensemble simulations vs 0 5 for cfsrc wave hindcast the smc100 grid fig s1 is unable to properly capture many of these small islands leading to overestimation of wave heights in this region due to the poor representation of existing obstacles this is corroborated by the fact that the ensemble average agrees better with the era interim wave reanalysis dee et al 2011 in the vicinity of these tropical islands see fig s3 in the sm which used a wave model of similar spatial frequency and directional resolutions to the smc100 grid for offshore areas but the wave model resolution alone cannot completely explain the biases because the larger biases are still visible when compared to era interim fig s3b this is probably also related to the resolution of the underlying wave forcing fields both era interim and cfsrc have significantly finer resolutions for the atmospheric part than those of the cmip5 models see table 1 in addition large positive biases are seen in the mid latitudes of the sh only when compared to the era interim wave hindcast fig s3 in other words the ensemble average of annual mean hs for the southern mid latitudes is more comparable to the cfsrc wave hindcast than to the era interim as shown in fig 2d biases in annual maximum hs are also extensively positive and the largest positive biases are seen in the storm track regions of both hemispheres this is also true when era interim was used as reference see fig s3 with some notable negative biases in the eastern caribbean region and in the region from east china sea to south of japan unlike the annual mean hs the ensemble average of annual maximum hs does not have larger positive biases around the small pacific islands compare fig 2b and d the individual ensemble members show similar bias patterns to that of the ensemble average for both annual mean and maximum hs but the magnitude and extension of positive biases vary considerably from one member to another in particular extreme waves derived from using miroc5 simulated surface winds and sic as forcing are more different from the corresponding cfsrc quantity showing positive biases of up to 5 m or 20 in annual maximum hs at the mid latitudes see fig s4 in sm the spatial pattern of biases in annual mean tp is similar to that in annual mean hs fig 2f but with more extensive and larger positive biases especially in the pacific and indian oceans the pattern of the larger biases are indicative of the bias being spread by swell waves which are notably present in these areas see section 3 2 1 seasonality is present in the skill of the wave simulations it also varies from region to region and from one ensemble member to another as shown in fig 3 in almost all regions in the nh a weaker spatial pattern correlation is seen for the warmer months fig 3 the only exception is the north indian ocean nio which shows a notably larger seasonal fluctuation of skill showing better correlations in summer which is likely related to the regional monsoon phenomena in this area in the sh some regions like tropical south indian ocean tsio and tropical south pacific tsp show weaker correlation for summer months whereas others like south pacific sp and antarctic an regions show the opposite however different ensemble members reproduced similar courses of seasonal fluctuation within a region but the amplitude of the fluctuations can vary considerably with polar regions showing considerably larger fluctuations than most of the other regions except some tropical areas fig 3 as is the case for the wave forcing fields see section 3 1 2 the larger model uncertainty in the polar regions can be linked to the strongly interactive physical processes in the atmosphere sea ice and ocean on different scales that make climate modeling for these regions challenging vihma et al 2014 in terms of the correlation skill score the ec earth based wave simulations perform best overall among the five models particularly in the sh correlations 0 90 the gfdl esm2m based wave simulations come in second place showing the best score in the northern regions except arctic however the least biased wave simulations are those based on either the bcc csm1 1 or gfdl esm2m simulated winds and sic for most regions and on the ec earth simulated winds and sic for the arctic and antarctic regions the skill seen in the wave simulations might have resulted from several factors in the climate models used to simulate surface winds and sic one factor seems to be the resolution at which surface winds are simulated the climate model with the highest resolution for surface winds the ec earth in this case corresponds to the best correlation skill in the wave simulations but not necessarily the smallest bias although ec earth simulated surface wind speeds were found to be the best in terms of both the correlation score and bias section 3 1 2 3 1 2 evaluation results for the historical winds and sic simulations as described in section 3 1 1 the surface wind speed and sic as simulated by the five cmip5 models for the historical period were also evaluated in this study fig 4 shows the 1979 2005 mean field of annual mean and maximum surface wind speed derived from the cfsrc along with the biases in the corresponding ensemble average of the simulations by the five cmip5 models biases in the individual ensemble members are shown in fig s5 in sm as shown in fig 4b the ensemble average wind speed is weaker negatively biased than the corresponding cfsrc quantity for most regions globally it is stronger positively biased only in some tropical areas of limited extension mostly located near the tropics in the pacific and atlantic oceans the positive biases in the wind speed are considerably less extensive than those in the corresponding mean hs fig 2 this is because biases in waves can be spread out by swell waves in particular the cmip5 models tend to simulate a stronger eastward component of wind stress at mid latitude westerly wind regions lee et al 2013 see also fig 4f and fig s6 which are the most important areas for wave generation an overestimation of the zonal winds which might not be necessarily manifested in the total surface winds could produce positive hs biases which are then spread out by swell waves the pattern of bias in annual maximum wind speed fig 4d is similar to that in annual maximum hs although the relative bias i e bias divided by the corresponding cfsr c climatological mean value not shown has a smaller positive range there is also a very large wind speed bias in the arctic region and also in antarctica which was not seen in maximum hs because it was masked off by sea ice coverage at annual scale the seasonality of the cmip5 models performance for the surface wind speed see fig s7 in sm is similar to that of the derived hs but with lower correlation coefficients and biases shifted towards lower or even negative values in agreement with what was discussed earlier at annual scale for each of the 13 regions and globally fig 5 compares the annual averages of the correlation skill scores and of the relative biases for hs and wind speed showing the relative biases here enables better comparison of the bias magnitude between these two different variables in fig 5 we also used the cmip5 model names to refer to the corresponding ensemble members of hs because the differences between the ensemble members of hs which was produced using the same wave model ww3 primarily arise from differences in the surface winds and sic simulated by the five cmip5 models in terms of the correlation score the cmip5 models are ranked similarly whether they are ranked directly for the skill in simulating surface winds or indirectly for the skill in the hs derived using surface winds to force ww3 this suggests that the skill of climate models for simulating the spatial pattern of surface winds is largely passed onto the skill seen in the corresponding derived hs however as described before a positive shift is observed between biases in surface winds and the derived hs which affects the cmip5 models ranking in other words large negative biases observed for the cmip5 simulated surface winds tend to result in lower negative biases for the corresponding hs but low negative positive biases observed for the cmip5 simulated surface winds tend to result in larger positive biases for hs for example miroc5 is the least biased model for maximum wind speed but the corresponding derived maximum hs has the largest bias fig 6 shows the spatial correlation scores of monthly sic patterns and the regionally averaged biases for the arctic and antarctic regions for the arctic region the correlation score are higher in july september fig 6 this is because the correlation score is less sensitive to the model performance in simulating sic in the season of largely reduced sea ice coverage interestingly the bias in arctic sic becomes more negative it even changes from positive to negative for some models in september reaching the largest amplitude of negative biases in october the bias magnitude reduces gradually from november to may reaching the minimum biases in may august fig 6 for the antarctica the sic bias pattern is similar to that in the arctic considering that the austral warm period occurs at the beginning of the year but the correlation score shows larger disparity among the models and do not show the clear seasonality seen for the arctic for all the five cmip5 models the correlation scores are lower for the antarctica than for the arctic region this is in agreement with the report that cmip5 models offer much better sea ice simulations for the arctic than for the antarctic shu et al 2015 in terms of the correlation score model skill ranking for the arctic sic is similar to that for the corresponding surface winds and derived hs from best to worst ec earth miroc5 inmcm4 gfdl esm2m and bcc csm1 1 gfdl esm2m and inmcm4 switch places for hs and wind speed considering that the best model for surface wind speed is the model with the highest atmospheric model resolution one could expect the best model for sic to be the model with the highest ocean model resolution at which the sic is computed however the model with the highest atmospheric model resolution is still the best model for sic see table 1 this seems to indicate that the resolution of the atmospheric part of the cmip5 models rather than the ocean model resolution has played a greater role in simulating the sic arguably this is because better quality winds in a higher resolution atmospheric model can result in better sea ice advection in terms of model skill for simulating sea ice the results of this study are in agreement with those of shu et al 2015 the top two models for simulating arctic sic identified in this study ec earth and miroc5 are among the top 10 models out of 49 models for simulating the sea ice volume and sea ice extent in the arctic ocean as identified by shu et al 2015 similarly the top two models for simulating antarctica sic identified in this study bcc csm1 1 and ec earth are also among the top 10 models for simulating antarctica sea ice as identified by shu et al 2015 3 2 future projections 3 2 1 global wave climate projections in this section the projected future changes in the global hs tp and θm are presented the projected changes by 2081 2100 are expressed as the differences between the climatological means for the future 2081 2100 and historical 1979 2005 periods i e the 2081 2100 mean minus the 1979 2005 mean of the variable or statistic in question we also discuss the projected relative changes which are the projected changes divided by the 1979 2005 mean value of the variable or statistic in question considering the causal physical relationship between surface winds and waves the ensemble average of the projected relative changes in surface wind speed are also shown in fig 7 and discussed below figs 7 11 show the ensemble average of the projected changes for each variable analyzed with the results for the individual ensemble members being shown in figs s8 s13 in the sm for the global wave field we focus on the areas where waves already existed over the historical period i e statistics were computed only for ice free sic 75 areas for both the historical and future periods therefore results are not shown for the new open water areas indicated in light gray as for the ensemble average two shades of gray were used to show the minimum and maximum ice coverage i e ice coverage that was simulated by all the five models and by at least one model respectively all the five cmip5 models simulated a similar large scale pattern of the historical climate of annual mean surface wind speed with stronger winds in the mid high latitudes of the sh and of the north atlantic pacific fig 7a and the highest annual maximum winds up to 30 m s not shown over the north atlantic pacific which is consistent with the historical climate storm conditions erikson et al 2015 however the magnitude and areal extension of the projected changes vary considerably from one model to another fig s8 and the arctic ocean is one of the regions of the largest inter model variability showing the largest ensemble average increases that are however mostly insignificant statistically fig 7b the pattern of relative changes projected by ec earth fig s8 the model that best simulated surface winds for the historical period see section 3 1 2 is most similar to that of the ensemble average fig 7b which shows statistically significant decreases in the mid latitudes of the north atlantic pacific and in the sh low mid latitudes with significant increases projected for the sh storm track region the relative changes projected by miroc5 and gfdl esm2m deviate most from the ensemble average as shown in fig s8 miroc5 projected a larger area of negative changes near the equator while gfdl esm2m projected notably smaller increases both in extension and magnitude in the arctic region than did the other models fig 8 shows the ensemble average of the 1979 2005 mean of annual mean hs and of the corresponding projected relative changes by 2081 2100 which are reminiscent of the corresponding patterns for the annual mean wind speed over the ice free oceanic areas fig 7 the magnitude of projected relative changes is slightly larger in annual mean hs than in surface wind speed especially for the miroc5 and gfdl esm2m based simulations fig s9 the wave simulations that are based on miroc5 and gfdl esm2m simulations of surface winds and sic show changes decreases and increases of greater magnitude than those based on the other three models just like the corresponding changes projected for wind speed fig s8 the annual mean and maximum hs share similar large scale patterns of projected changes but annual maximum hs shows smaller areas of statistically significant changes and a larger spatial variability figs 8 and 9 as would be expected because typically the mean climate is smoother than the extreme climate the miroc5 based wave projections show a wider range of projected changes larger decreases and increases than the projections based on the other four models fig s10 the gfdl esm2m based wave simulations also projected a large increase in annual maximum hs fig s10 fig 10 shows the ensemble average of the 1979 2005 mean of annual mean tp and of the projected changes by 2081 2100 a longitudinal gradient can be seen in all three large basins pacific atlantic and indian oceans the largest tp values are seen in the tropical eastern pacific rather than in the area of the climatological maximum hs values annual mean tp was projected to increase significantly in most oceanic areas except the western tropical part of the pacific and atlantic where some significant decreases were projected fig 10b the extensive increase in tp clearly entails an increase in swell predominance as already reported by hemer et al 2013 although hemer et al 2013 used cmip3 models and slightly different time periods their results show some similarities to those of the current study for both the historical simulations and future projections like in the case of annual mean hs the tp projections based on the miroc5 and gfdl esm2m projections of surface winds and sic also show larger changes than those based on the other three models especially inmcm4 see fig s11 nevertheless tp variability among the five ensemble members fig s11 is notably lower showing more extensively significant change in the ensemble average than that in the corresponding hs and wind speed the projected tp changes are mostly within 0 5 s 10 consistent spatial patterns are obtained for the inverse wave age see fig s12 all the five ensemble members of wave simulations show a consistent climatological pattern of the annual mean wave direction θm for the period 1979 2005 fig s13 which is similar to that shown in fig 11a and also agrees with the ensemble average pattern of hemer et al 2013 despite the different experiments and models used at high latitudes especially the sh high latitudes θm is predominantly eastward being influenced by the westerlies in the tropics as getting closer to the equator θm becomes nw sw n s and ne se in the nh sh ending with a swirl of westward waves in the tropical pacific and atlantic in accordance with the trade winds in other words most of the w directions at mid high latitudes develops into sw nw as going equatorward which explains the aforementioned swell presence and large tp in the eastern part of atlantic and pacific the ensemble average projected changes in annual mean θm are shown in fig 11 positive changes are anticlockwise and negative changes clockwise the mean wave direction is projected to rotate up to about 10 in most areas in such a way that accentuates the turning from eastward waves at high latitudes to westward waves in the tropics strengthening the swell component at the east side of the large ocean basins in addition the wave rotation zone in the mid latitude north pacific waves turning from nw to ne is projected to narrow having greater rotational gradients reflected as the narrow zone of positive change bordering the extensive area of negative change in the mid latitude north pacific see fig 11b the projected θm changes are more extensively significant in the sh indicating higher consistency among ensemble members of wave simulations fig s13 3 2 2 arctic ocean wave climate projections in this section we present the results for the arctic region i e the region north of 50 n which includes more than just the arctic ocean and was chosen to get an insight into the interaction of the arctic ocean waves with those in the surrounding atlantic and pacific areas including the hudson bay due to the seasonal variations of sea ice coverage it is better and necessary to analyze waves in each calendar month which diminishes the potential issues in computing statistics in areas affected by sea ice tuomi et al 2011 the results are shown mainly for september the month of typically the smallest sea ice coverage as for the global results we present and discuss the ensemble average of the simulated historical climate and of the projected changes in hs tp θm a 1 and surface winds in addition we also present the projected changes in the new open water areas in the arctic ocean which was not done in section 3 2 1 the results are shown for the ensemble average but the results of the individual ensemble members for march and september are included in figs s14 s19 in sm as shown in fig 12 the climatological maximum surface wind speeds in this region are located in the north atlantic and the bering sea in contrast to the lower latitudes the monthly mean wind speeds over the inner arctic for september and march are similar with values ranging from 4 to 7 m s 1 to 3 m s for bcc csm1 1 model and the most notable small seasonal variations being seen in the chukchi and barents seas see fig s14 such lower seasonal variability of wind speeds in the inner arctic was also reported by przybylak 2003 as revealed in section 3 1 ec earth is the best model in simulating the historical surface wind speeds in this region and bcc csm1 1 is the worst in march bcc csm1 1 and miroc5 projected wind speed decreases in the inner arctic especially bcc csm1 1 while the other three models projected increases fig s14 in september the projected changes show a different pattern and are sometimes out of phase to that of the march counterpart e g miroc5 model see fig s14 all models except gfdl esm2m projected increases in surface wind speed over the inner arctic thus the increases are also seen in the ensemble average fig 12b although they are not statistically significant the feedback process between arctic ice retreat and surface wind speed increase could be as follows less sea ice can cause larger heat flux to atmosphere reduced stratification and enhanced cyclogenesis vihma 2014 over the arctic ocean the ensemble average projected changes in surface wind speed are also generally similar to those projected by ec earth although the larger biases in the bcc csm1 1 simulations for the arctic are discernible in the ensemble average see figs s5 and s7 the ensemble average of the 1979 2005 and 2081 2100 means of september mean hs and of the corresponding projected changes are shown in fig 13 during the historical period fig 13a the inner arctic was mostly ice covered in september and hence had no ocean surface waves the higher waves in the north atlantic and norwegian sea are consistent with the simulated climatological wind field fig 12 and with the results of previous studies e g przybylak 2003 serreze and barry 2005 liu et al 2016 as expected ice retreat towards the end of the century yields new open water areas for wave generation in both winter and summer but especially in summer in september bcc csm1 1 miroc5 and ec earth projected a sic of below 75 for almost the whole arctic basin which leads to waves being generated there according to the methodology used in this study see fig s15 for the rcp8 5 future 2081 2100 the ensemble average projected mostly 1 2 m of september mean hs in the inner arctic fig 13b table 2 lists the spatial maximum value of changes in the annual mean hs projected by each ensemble member for the arctic region which range is 2 2 2 7 m for september however the ensemble average of the projected changes are mostly 1 1 75 m in the new open water areas fig 13c in the historical open water areas the ensemble average projected some significant increases up to 15 in the barents sea fig 13d which can be related to the local increase in surface wind there fig 12b in general the projected changes in the mean hs can be related to the projected changes in surface wind speed see also figs s14 and s15 the projected ice retreat and stronger winds result in more extensive area of waves and higher waves being projected for the arctic ocean the september mean and maximum hs were projected to have a very similar spatial pattern of changes by 2081 2100 figs 13 and 14 but the projected changes in the climatological mean of maximum hs are expectedly larger its spatial maximum poleward of 50 n ranging from 4 8 to 6 4 m among the five ensemble members table 3 however the ensemble average of the projected changes in the inner arctic are mostly 3 4 m fig 14c in the historical open water areas the september maximum hs was projected to have statistically significant increases up to 15 or 0 5 m only in the hudson bay and the bering sea fig 14d fig 15 shows the projected changes in the peak wave period tp for the historical period larger tp values are seen in the northeastern pacific fig 15a which agrees with the swell predominance in that area section 3 2 1 this spatial pattern is projected to strengthen in the future fig 15b as statistically significant increases were projected in the pacific part of the domain fig 15c the climatological mean values of tp are projected to be mostly 4 7 s in the inner arctic see fig 15b and s17 in the historical open water area of the inner arctic statistically significant tp increases are projected for the chukchi and barents seas with significant decreases in the region off labrador fig 15d fig 16 shows the ensemble average of the climatological mean θm for the historical and future periods respectively here the projected future mean wave direction is shown and discussed rather than the corresponding changes to ease the interpretation of the projected future θm climate in the historical period all the five ensemble members simulated prevailing sw s se waves in the bering sea for both september and march figs 16a and s18 reflecting the influence of the aleutian low in winter bilello 1973 and of the swell waves coming from lower latitudes interestingly southward waves prevail in the chukchi sea although northward waves prevail in the bering sea figs 16 this can be explained by the influence of the local winds and the bering strait acting as a barrier for swells traveling from the pacific to the chukchi sea in the northeast atlantic to the norwegian sea the climatological mean wave direction reflects the climatological cyclone traveling direction in this region and the influence of the icelandic low bilello 1973 the ensemble average projected future θm is predominantly southward in the arctic ocean and northeastward in the davis straight baffin bay area fig 16b the southward mean wave direction in the arctic ocean indicates that waves approaching the arctic coasts have an increasing fetch as ice retreats in summer such projected changes entail increased coastal vulnerability e g coastal flooding and erosion in terms of projected θm there is also some variability among the five ensemble members for example the inmcm4 miroc5 and gfdl esm2m based wave simulations show a predominant southward wave direction in the region between greenland and norway while the bcc csm1 1 and ec earth based projections show two predominant wave directions southward northward waves in the western eastern part of this region fig s19 due to the lack of barrier as sea ice retreats in the atlantic domain greater interaction is projected between the arctic and atlantic ocean waves than between the arctic and pacific ocean waves fig 16b the projected θm forced by winds and sic simulated by the cmip5 models which projected an ice free september in the inner arctic show a slight clockwise rotation near the north pole which is in agreement with typical wind dynamics in the region fig s18 in the historical open water areas of the arctic region the projected changes of the mean θm are statistically insignificant as shown in fig 17 a the monthly mean a 1 simulated for the historical period is between 0 3 and 0 5 over most area of the domain indicating that mixed sea states prevail in the wave climate a predominance of pure wind sea states is only seen in very limited sheltered areas e g hudson bay note that here we are analyzing the climatological mean which does not imply that pure wind sea states never occur in the arctic region from the climatological perspective pure swell waves are also rare in the arctic ocean due to the limited fetch the projected changes reveal a tendency for the inverse wave age to decrease in a relatively large area of the north atlantic in winter and summer see fig s19 but the ensemble average changes are statistically significant only in limited areas there are differences between the five ensemble members near the ice edge which can be explained by the aforementioned differences in θm ice retreat can notably contribute to increasing swell conditions only when waves predominantly grow and travel from the ice edge seawards waves traveling in the opposite direction might contribute to accelerate ice breaking instead this can explain for example the projected a 1 increase more wind sea conditions near the ice edge in the north atlantic seen in the bcc csm1 1 based wave simulations for september see figs s18 and s19 4 conclusions in this study we have conducted and analyzed global wave climate simulations using the ww3 wave model forced by surface winds and sic simulated by five cmip5 models for the historical period 1979 2005 and rcp8 5 future period 2081 2100 a customized smc grid li 2012 with increased resolution along coastlines was used to enable the inclusion of the whole arctic ocean the simulated forcing surface winds and sea ice concentration and waves for the historical period were evaluated against cfsrc and era interim reanalysis data our results suggest that the resolution of the atmospheric part of climate model is positively correlated with the models skill in simulating surface wind and sic in terms of spatial pattern correlation score the skill of the five cmip5 models in simulating surface winds and sic is largely reflected in the skill in the corresponding wave simulations especially in the areas dominated by wind sea states however biases in the derived wave simulations differ from those in the corresponding surface winds this disparity arises at least in part from positive biases in hs being spread out by swell waves in addition the bias of the zonal wind component alone not necessarily related to the bias of the total wind speed seems to partially explain the bias in hs because this wind component plays an important role in the wave formation in mid high latitudes note that the results for the region of small islands in the pacific must be interpreted with care because the topographical obstacles in this region are not properly represented in the smc100 grid used in this study which resulted in overestimation of wave heights in this region all ensemble members projected a statistically significant increase in the annual mean hs in the sh mid high latitudes whereas ensemble average decreases of statistical significance are seen in the north atlantic this pattern of projected changes in hs is similar to that projected for the corresponding surface winds all the five ensemble members projected significant tp increases in the eastern part of the pacific and indian oceans but similar changes were not projected for the corresponding surface winds this is arguably related to the increase of swell waves resulted from the higher waves projected for the sh mid high latitudes that propagate and turn towards the equator hemer et al 2013 the latter is consistent with the projected changes in mean θm for the rcp8 5 scenario three of the five cmip5 models projected an ice free arctic in summer by the end of 21st century and almost all the five models except gfdl esm2m projected an increase in mean surface wind speed over the inner ice free arctic in september although the ensemble average projected changes are not statistically significant which indicates high model uncertainty in this region the projected stronger winds alone could result in higher waves in the open water area of the arctic ocean the rcp8 5 scenario future wave climate in the arctic ocean in summer is projected to be predominantly of mixed sea states with the climatological mean of september maximum hs of up to 6 4 m table 3 but mostly 3 4m in the inner arctic as shown in fig 14b and a predominantly southward mean wave direction the latter indicates that the new waves approaching the arctic coasts will be less fetch limited as ice retreats therefore the projected changes in waves suggest that the arctic coasts alaska canada and siberia which are already experiencing coastal retreat will likely subject to an increase in coastal vulnerability it is also worth pointing out the uncertainty in the results of this study because the simulations are based on only five cmip5 climate models out of dozens available for one greenhouse scenario and one run per climate model the variability among the five ensemble members presented in this study could include internal climate variability which we cannot assess with only one run per model while the method for deriving an ensemble average is still under debate in this study we have adopted a simple approach the democracy approach we included all models with the same weight regardless of their skill in simulating the historical climate this study does not mean to provide a guideline for choosing climate models to use in wave related impact studies it aims to provide useful information data as input for impact assessment studies in which the biases can be further propagated as seen in casas prat et al 2016 for wave driven coastal sediment transport dynamics increasing the sample size in future studies as dynamical modeling becomes more affordable will help better evaluate the uncertainty in wave projections especially for the emerging arctic ocean in addition an improvement in climate model performance for this area is needed and hopeful as pointed out by vihma et al 2014 a major challenge for the arctic research community is to reduce the dominating model uncertainty which is still relatively higher in this region than in the lower latitude areas acknowledgments the authors are

24126,this study presents simulations of the global ocean wave climate corresponding to the surface winds and sea ice concentrations as simulated by five cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 climate models for the historical 1979 2005 and rcp8 5 scenario future 2081 2100 periods to tackle the numerical complexities associated with the inclusion of the north pole the wavewatch iii ww3 wave model was used with a customized unstructured spherical multi cell grid of 100 km offshore and 50 km along coastlines the climate model simulated wind and sea ice data and the corresponding ww3 simulated wave data were evaluated against reanalysis and hindcast data the results show that all the five sets of wave simulations projected lower waves in the north atlantic corresponding to decreased surface wind speeds there in the warmer climate the selected cmip5 models also consistently projected an increase in the surface wind speed in the southern hemisphere sh mid high latitudes which translates in an increase in the ww3 simulated significant wave height hs there the higher waves are accompanied with increased peak wave period and increased wave age in the east pacific and indian oceans and a significant counterclockwise rotation in the mean wave direction in the southern oceans the latter is caused by more intense waves from the sh traveling equatorward and developing into swells future wave climate in the arctic ocean in summer is projected to be predominantly of mixed sea states with the climatological mean of september maximum hs ranging mostly 3 4 m the new waves approaching arctic coasts will be less fetch limited as ice retreats since a predominantly southwards mean wave direction is projected in the surrounding seas keywords surface ocean waves climate change cmip5 smc grid arctic ice retreat 1 introduction climate change has become a major focus of attention for the scientific community due to the potential impacts on the environment in the near future ipcc 2013 global warming is not homogeneous over the earth leading to changes in the atmospheric meridional temperature gradients that have direct consequences on the pressure and wave forcing wind patterns e g weisse and von storch 2010 using a multi model ensemble hemer et al 2013 assessed the projected changes and uncertainties in ocean surface wave climate at a global scale 1979 2009 vs 2070 2100 using 20 members for the significant wave height hs including both statistical and dynamical simulations 4 members for the mean wave period tm and 5 members for the mean wave direction θm they found that a decrease increase in hs over 25 8 7 1 of the global ocean area was consistently projected by all the ensemble members they analyzed the increase was predominantly found in the southern ocean which in turn influenced a larger proportion of the global ocean as swell propagates northwards into the other oceans leading to an increase in the annual mean tm over 30 2 of the global ocean and a rotation of the annual mean wave direction clockwise in the tropical pacific and tropical atlantic about 30 s 30 n and anticlockwise in most of the other regions however they did not include the arctic ocean as in the majority of the previous global wave climate studies e g dobrynin et al 2012 hemer and trenham 2016 fan et al 2012 semedo et al 2013 wang et al 2014 which typically have a latitude range that covers up to 80 n at the maximum the major obstacle to extending physical wave models to the north pole is the rapidly diminishing cell size at high latitudes when using regular latitude longitude lat lon grids in global wave climate studies such smaller cells lead to a computationally unaffordable time step due to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl restriction applying to the numerical schemes used in most wave models another problem is the increased curvature of the parallels at high latitudes since wave models commonly follow the scalar assumption for which the local east of a cell is considered to be the same as the neighboring cells which is erroneous at high latitudes li 2012 this explains why even in regional wave modeling studies for the arctic the north pole grid point s is usually left out of the modeling domain e g khon et al 2014 rogers and orzech 2013 in statistical wave modeling one of the main reasons to avoid the arctic ocean is the lack of measurements reanalysis to properly calibrate the relationship between predictors and predictands especially in the new open water areas these arctic challenges have received little attention from the scientific community since historically the extent of waves was rather limited given that the basin was mostly ice covered year round therefore the arctic ocean wave climate is poorly known despite the few recent studies in addition the challenges that wave sea ice interaction poses are still to be solved and lead to an additional source of uncertainty in the context of climate change which is especially accentuated in the arctic ipcc 2013 it is becoming more important to properly evaluate the present and future arctic ocean wave climate at different temporal and spatial scales the arctic sea ice extent has been declining drastically over the past few years with the ice coverage shrinking to as high as 86 in the summers of 2007 and 2012 li 2012 in addition despite the large uncertainty among climate models ipcc 2013 most of their projections agree that the arctic ocean will be ice free in the summer months by sometime between the mid and end of this century gagné et al 2015 laliberté et al 2016 khon et al 2014 were one of the first regional studies on the future wave climate in the arctic ocean they examined the relative importance of the two main drivers affecting the wave climate in the arctic surface wind and sea ice cover they concluded that the role of surface wind is very important in the areas where waves currently exist but as expected sea ice is the main factor explaining changes in the wave climate in areas presently ice covered most of the year like the inner arctic in a similar way wang et al 2015a found that historical changes based on 1970 2013 reanalysis in the beaufort chukchi seas waves cannot be explained by changes in the wind field alone based on another 1992 2014 reanalysis stopa et al 2016 also concluded that the increasing waves in the beaufort chukchi sea are related to declining sea ice however by analyzing altimeter data for the period 1996 2015 liu et al 2016 reported a significant increase in both wind speed and hs in that area nonetheless the influence of sea ice retreat on wave height was manifested in the laptev sea where changes of wind speed could not explain the significant trends of wave height liu et al 2016 therefore despite the regional uncertainty in quantifying the wind and sea ice influence on waves it is evident that they will both play a role in the future wave climate in the arctic ocean ice retreat affects the wave climate in a number of ways the first consequence is the opening of new water areas for wave generation and growth secondly sea ice retreat affects areas with currently existing waves even far from the ice edge by means of increasing the fetch a larger fetch entails a reduction in the fetch limited wave conditions and thus results in larger waves it also favors the development of swell waves thomson and rogers 2014 in addition sea ice also affects waves in the sea ice margin zone wave energy is not instantly dissipated when encountering sea ice tolman 2003 instead waves can penetrate into ice covered seas while being attenuated as a function of the wave period sea ice concentration thickness and floe size distribution moreover the wave frequency the ice floe distribution and the ratio of wave length to ice floe length will determine the ratio of wave scattering tolman 2003 i e wave energy spread to other areas potential wave driven impacts on the arctic environment and activities comprise a broad range of aspects safety and risk have been identified as key factors affecting the building of future shipping routes in the emerging arctic ocean shyu and ding 2016 which has raised economical interest melia et al 2016 but also environmental awareness due to the potential risks posed to the arctic wildlife and habitat huntington 2009 miller and ruiz 2014 in determining efficient and safe navigability conditions future wave conditions will undoubtedly play a role in addition the changing wave conditions have important implications for the upper ocean dynamics and rich biological cycle of the arctic overeem et al 2011 changes in wave effects can have an impact on the upper ocean mixing and hence on the sea surface temperature and surface climate song et al 2012 such increase in heat can in turn result in increasing ice melting rates leading to a positive feedback vihma et al 2014 higher waves can also mechanically accelerate the ice retreat by breaking up the ice thomson and rogers 2014 and can also lead to coastal impacts such as erosion overeem et al 2011 actually the arctic coast is already experiencing an average rate of erosion of 0 5 m year with the highest rates being observed in the laptev east siberian and beaufort seas lantuit et al 2012 which puts arctic coastal infrastructure and cultural and archeological sites at a vulnerable position radosavljevic et al 2016 likewise an increase in the long wavelength waves swell can threaten coastal vulnerability in terms of flooding because they have the potential to be a significant driver of extreme sea levels along the coastline hoeke et al 2013 this study presents projected changes in ocean surface waves by the late 21st century in the global oceans including the entire arctic ocean to simulate waves the wavewatch iii ww3 wave model was forced by the surface winds and sea ice concentrations simulated by five coupled model intercomparison phase 5 cmip5 climate models for the historical period 1979 2005 and the rcp8 5 forcing scenario ipcc 2013 future period 2081 2100 to tackle the aforementioned challenges regarding ocean wave modeling at high latitudes a customized spherical multiple cell smc grid li 2012 was implemented the simulated wave and wave forcing fields wind speed and sea ice concentration for the historical period were also evaluated against reanalysis hindcast to provide an insight into how the skill of the selected cmip5 models in simulating surface winds and sea ice concentration manifests in the corresponding wave simulations using ww3 the rest of the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology used the resulting wave simulations are analyzed and discussed in section 3 finally section 4 summarizes the main conclusions 2 methodology and data 2 1 wave model and forcing data version 4 18 of the wavewatch iii wave model tolman and the wavewatch iii development group 2014 was employed to simulate the wave climate using the smc grid detailed in section 2 2 below the conventional parametrizations of wave physics in ww3 st4 nl1 switches were used ardhuin et al 2010 hasselmann and hasselman 1985 as in khon et al 2014 the methodology of tolman 2003 for considering the ice effect was followed namely two critical ice concentrations 25 and 75 define initial and total impediment of wave propagation ic0 switch between those two cut off concentrations waves progressively loose energy while traveling through the ice field by partially obstructed grid points as a function of the sea ice concentration tolman 2003 since waves are generated propagated when sea ice concentration sic is below 75 we refer to the condition of sic below 75 as ice free conditions in this study as opposite to non existence of waves the computational global time step in ww3 was set to one hour using 29 and 24 frequency and direction bins respectively hourly values of the following output spectrum derived parameters were obtained and stored for each grid cell of the computational grid hs fp and θm the peak wave period tp is computed as the inverse of the peak frequency fp the ww3 was forced by the 3 hourly surface 10 m winds and daily sics produced by the following cmip5 models bcc csm1 1 miroc5 gfdl esm2m ec earth only one run per model is used here we chose these models because we want to include as wide a range of model uncertainty as possible to include climate models of the best to worst performance for historical wind simulations and of the smallest to the largest projected changes following the recommendation of the coordinated ocean wave climate project cowclip wang et al 2015b we also added the inmcm4 model ipcc 2013 that was also used by erikson et al 2015 to ease the planned cowclip phase ii inter comparison wang et al 2015b hemer et al 2014 simulations were carried out for two periods 1979 2005 historical and 2081 2100 future which are similar to the periods identified as of common interest by the cowclip project wang et al 2015b the cmip5 historical and rcp8 5 scenario simulations of the forcing winds and sic were used respectively the rcp8 5 forcing scenario ipcc 2013 assumes a continued increase in greenhouse emissions throughout the 21st century for each variable all the forcing data have the same temporal resolution but different spatial resolutions and therefore they were spatially interpolated onto a common lat lon grid of about 100 km resolution nonetheless the original spatial resolution of the climate model still plays a role in the model performance as shown later in section 3 table 1 describes the original resolution of the cmip5 models regarding surface wind and sic fields for the wind field atmospheric model grids are almost regular longitude latitude grids some deviation may occur for the latitude resolution at higher latitudes for the sic ocean model grids are non regular lat lon grids of finer resolutions 2 2 the smc grid the smc grid li 2011 was developed to tackle the aforementioned polar problems in ocean surface wave models see section 1 it was implemented in the ww3 for the first time in version 4 18 which is used in this study despite being an unstructured grid it retains the conventional lat lon grid cells so minimal changes to lat lon grid finite difference schemes are required and its implementation is easier than other unstructured grids the smc grid relaxes the cfl restriction at high latitudes by merging the longitudinal cells towards the poles enabling to efficiently extend global wave simulations to include the north pole see fig s1 in the supplementary material sm in addition the smc grid introduces a round polar cell to remove the singularity of the spherical coordinate system at the north pole by using a fixed reference direction to define vector components within a limited arctic part which slightly overlaps with the global part see fig s1 this reduces the error caused by the invalid scalar assumption for vector components defined relative to the local east direction at high latitudes moreover an interesting feature of the smc grid is that it can also handle multiple resolutions within the same grid so that coastlines for instance can be resolved at high resolutions while the open oceans are kept at an affordable coarser resolution li 2012 although the arctic part of the smc grid typically northward of approximately 85 n has not been fully validated due to the lack of observations in the polar region it has been recently tested by comparing the simulations of an expanded arctic part northward of 65 n approx with available satellite measurements li 2016 in this study the smc grid was generated with a coarse resolution of about 100 km offshore and 50 km along the coastlines fig s1 hereafter referred to as smc100 it was based on the naval research laboratory digital bathymetry data base 2 minute resolution nrl dbdb2 covering the full range of latitudes from 90 s to 90 n the merging of cells was implemented at latitudes poleward of 60 see fig s1 this leads to a total of 32 516 cells the arctic part and global part of the grid slightly overlaps which leads to 96 overlapped grid cells in the computation in addition to the 32 516 cells for comparison purposes note that the number of cells resulted from using smc100 is still lower than the number of grid cells that a traditional lat lon grid would involve with the same coarse resolution but without any coastal refinement 35 000 water cells approx 2 3 data post processing the output wave data was filtered prior to analysis due to some discrepancies found in the land sea masks of the sea ice simulations some near coastline water grid points in the smc100 grid did not have sea ice information since they were considered as land in the cmip5 simulated sic field probably due to spatial resolution differences in ww3 missing sic data as such is understood as zero sic which is not necessarily true especially in the arctic and antarctic regions and can lead to waves being simulated in probably ice covered areas to avoid these misleading results that could entail a bias in the statistics of the simulations such particular cases have been filtered out using the following procedure for each output time step and each wave grid point poleward of 40 the 10 closest grid points were checked to determine whether or not the target grid point was in the vicinity of ice the wave parameters associated to that time step and grid point were discarded set to missing if i at least one of such neighboring 10 cells in the interpolated sic field was ice covered in terms of wave generation i e sic is above 75 and ii either of the two closest grid points of the land sea mask of the given climate model is defined as land this is to make sure these are near the coast where the land sea mask discrepancy occurs by removing only particular time steps instead of the whole time series this enables us to provide statistics for warm periods when there is no ice cover and therefore land sea mask inaccuracies are not an issue however as explained in section 2 5 statistics are only computed when all time steps corresponding to the time window of analysis annual monthly have wave information to avoid considering suspicious values around the filtered out time steps after a detailed visual inspection with using different numbers of nearby points in the filtering procedure we chose the method with 10 nearby points rather than the perhaps more natural 8 points because it gives better results for irregular coastlines however for a few areas with a very irregular bathymetry pronounced sticking in out coastline the 10 closest grid points which are based on the lon lat distance that does not account for obstacles were not representative of the sea surroundings to determine whether or not that target point is ice covered in such cases the closest wave grid point obtained by visual inspection accounting by the topographical obstacles was used to determine the ice conditions in the vicinity an example is the shelikhov gulf located at the sea of okhotsk at the north east russian coast near the bering sea 2 4 data and methodology for evaluating the historical climate simulations we used the latest wave hindcast by the national centre for environmental prediction ncep released this year http polar ncep noaa gov waves hindcasts nopp phase2 php last accessed june 2017 to evaluate the cmip5 based wave simulations for the historical period 1979 2005 this wave hindcast hereafter denoted as cfsrc provides 3 hourly data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 it uses corrected surface winds from the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 which was obtained using a coupled atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice modeling system and provides hourly data of a spatial resolution ranging from 0 25 in the tropics to 0 5 in the polar regions lon lat dimensions of 1152 576 for comparison with table 1 the important advances of cfsr in comparison to its predecessors consist not only of the coupling between the ocean atmosphere land surface and sea ice model but also assimilation in three dimensions of satellite radiances and its increased horizontal and vertical resolution saha et al 2010 jakobson et al 2012 validated five atmospheric reanalysis datasets over the central arctic ocean including cfsr and recommended cfsr especially for all near surface variables like the surface wind speed they added that the better performance of cfsr near the surface might be explained by the sophisticated treatment of sea ice including its fractional coverage and prognostic ice and snow thickness saha et al 2010 stopa et al 2016 also chose to use cfsr winds to generate an arctic wave climate hindcast dataset partly because of the better performance for extremes despite the reported relatively good performance of cfsr winds ncep has conducted a bias correction based on collocated altimeter data to reduce the bias in the strongest winds especially over the southern ocean http polar ncep noaa gov waves hindcasts nopp phase2 php last accessed june 2017 the corrected winds show notably weaker annual maximum wind speeds at mid and high latitudes e g arctic ocean than the uncorrected cfsr winds fig 1 in terms of annual mean wind the corrected winds are stronger than the uncorrected winds at high latitudes near antarctica and over the arctic ocean but they are similar elsewhere in the evaluation below we define bias as the difference in the climatological mean value of a wave parameter annual mean hs annual maximum hs and annual mean tp between an ensemble member of wave simulations and the cfsrc wave hindcast in order to evaluate the seasonal variability of model skill at a regional scale we also computed the bias in the spatially averaged climatological mean for each calendar month between the two data sets for the 13 regions shown in fig s2 similar regions were used by wang et al 2014 and hemer and trenham 2016 but in this study we have added the arctic ar and antarctic an regions for each of these regions we also derived the spatial pattern correlation i e the pearson correlation coefficient between the simulated and cfsrc monthly climatological mean wave fields over the given region one correlation coefficient for each calendar month in the presence of sea ice in ar and an regions the climatological means of a wave parameter are computed only when ice free conditions exist for the whole period of analysis evaluation hemer and trenham 2016 pointed out that high performance of climate models for standard climate variables does not necessarily imply high performance for climate model forced wave simulations they stressed the need to evaluate the performance of a climate model for the marine meteorological climate independently of its performance for the standard climate variables however the standard variables they considered include air temperature and precipitation but not the surface wind speed the variable most directly related to ocean wave generation growth and propagation nevertheless in addition to the effect of counteracting processes nonlinearities might attenuate or exaggerate biases from driving to driven fields casas prat et al 2016 a deeper insight into this can be obtained by comparing the performance of climate models for surface wind speed and sic with the performance seen in the corresponding wave parameters such skill comparison can also lead to better understanding of the cause of biases in the cmip5 based wave simulations moreover studies on comparing the skill of cmip5 models for non standard climate variables especially the surface wind speed over the ocean are scarce hemer and trenham 2016 for example kumar et al 2015 analyzed cmip5 simulated surface wind speed extremes over land only lee et al 2013 evaluated the performance of a subset of cmip3 and cmip5 models for wind stress over the ocean but including only two models inmcm4 and miroc5 that we analyzed in this study thus an evaluation of the wave forcing fields i e surface wind speed and sic simulated by the five cmip5 models is also included in this study see section 3 1 2 below the performance of cmip5 models for simulating sic has received relatively more attention than for simulating surface winds for example shu et al 2015 evaluated sea ice simulations by all cmip5 models for both the arctic and antarctica however for completeness and consistency this study also evaluated the sic simulations by the five cmip5 models against the cfsr reanalysis data we used the 95 percentile of sic rather than the maximum value analyzing the performance of the maximum sic would give little information about model performance since this variable is constrained by definition and most of the grid points in high latitudes actually do achieve the maximum 100 ice concentration at some point the pearson correlation coefficient linear regression assumes normally distributed data however sic is a bounded variable its values range from 0 to 1 or 100 the data is a type of compositional data and is not normally distributed thus it is not suitable to directly apply a statistical method that assumes a normal distribution for the data for the sic data a logit transformation can be used to alleviate the violation of the assumption of normal distribution pawlowsky glahn and egozcue 2006 such data transformation becomes even more crucial in avoiding spurious effects when computing correlation among parts of the same whole i e among different categories of the same compositional data ortego and egozcue 2016 it also prevents from obtaining extrapolated unrealistic values outside the boundaries when performing trend analysis in this study we applied logit transformation to the sic data however the resulting model skill ranking shows no major differences with or without the transformation therefore for simplicity we opted to show the results obtained without the transformation see section 3 1 below 2 5 method for analyzing the projected climate changes the simulated statistics of hs tp tp 1 fp θm were analyzed in this study unless stated otherwise the nautical convention is used to qualitatively describe the wave direction e g s meaning waves coming from the south i e going northwards but the cartesian convention is used to quantitatively illustrate θm results in section 3 e g 90 means waves going from south to north in order to estimate the wind sea or swell predominance as in casas prat and sierra 2013 charles et al 2012 hanley et al 2010 and guo et al 2015 we also computed the inverse wave age a 1 as 1 a 1 u 10 cos θ wave θ wind c p with c p g t p 2 π where cp is the wave celerity θ wave the wave direction θ wind the wind direction and u 10 the surface wind speed as in hanley et al 2010 we used θ m as θ wave to compute the relative angle between the wind and the waves högström et al 2010 argued the suitability of the cosine of the relative angle between the wind and wave directions see eq 1 they objected that at low latitudes the angle difference might easily be close to 90 and therefore the cosine close to zero artificially altering the inverse wave age and particularly the wave age they suggested to use only the celerity ratio i e a 1 u 10 c p when wind and waves are not aligned which is a clear case of non equilibrium sea states the estimation of swell wind sea might be less accurate when using only the velocity ratio in this case the inclusion of the wave direction if available provides additional relevant information hanley et al 2011 nevertheless hanley et al 2011 showed that this disparity in the definition of a 1 does not seem to significantly affect the results of the mean a 1 climatology thus we prefer to include the angle difference to calculate a 1 in this study supporting the counterpoints given by hanley et al 2011 in this study a 1 was used to define the following three basic wave regimes i swell for a 1 0 15 ii mixed waves for 0 15 a 1 0 83 and iii wind sea for a 1 0 83 hanley et al 2010 a 1 can also be used to assess the degree of local coupling between surface winds and waves swell interacts with the airflow by giving momentum to the wind and inducing wave driven wind as opposed to pure wind driven waves in the wind sea states hanley et al 2010 in seas with varying ice cover the method to describe wave statistics becomes important however discrepancies between existing approaches are minimized when wave statistics are seasonally or monthly stratified tuomi et al 2011 in this study we used the ice free time approach as described by tuomi et al 2011 i e only the part of the year when the sea is ice free see section 2 1 is taken into account when calculating wave statistics as in wang et al 2015a statistics for a time window annual monthly are computed only for a grid point that is ice free in that time window over the whole period of analysis wave projections will be presented and discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 mainly in terms of the ensemble average which has been found to be more skillful than the individual ensemble members e g hemer and trenham 2016 the range of inter model variability will also be discussed briefly with the figures for individual ensemble members being shown in the supplementary material sm note that the inter model variability in waves in this study refers to the variability among the five ensemble members of wave simulations i e the variability arising from five different climate models being used to simulate the wave forcing fields rather than from different wave models being used to simulate waves all the five ensemble members of wave simulations were produced using the same wave model ww3 in this study a democracy approach was used to calculate the ensemble average knutti 2010 which was for simplicity and motivated by the lack of evidence that a climate model of better performance in simulating the historical climate will necessarily produce better projections of future climate déqué and somot 2010 the student t test von storch and zwiers 2001 was conducted at 5 significance level to determine whether or not the ensemble average of projected changes is statistically significantly different from zero i e stands out of the inter model variability in the new emerging sea areas the projected changes are non negative and do not have a normal probability distribution their statistical significance cannot be appropriately determined by the t test which is for normally distributed data in addition the projected changes are conditioned to the probability of wave occurrence the variability is difficult to estimate with an ensemble of size five thus a simple approach is adopted the projected changes are simply considered statistically significant when all five climate models projected ice free below 75 sic conditions the t test for comparing the means of two samples that might have different variances von storch and zwiers 2001 was also used in this study to determine the statistical significance at 5 level of changes projected by each individual ensemble member for simplicity changes in new emerging sea areas projected in an ensemble member are considered statistically significant in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation results for the historical climate simulations 3 1 1 evaluation results for the historical wave simulations fig 2 shows the 1979 2005 mean of the annual mean hs maximum hs and mean tp as derived from the cfsrc data along with biases in the ensemble average of the corresponding wave statistics as simulated using ww3 forced by the surface winds and sic simulated by five cmip5 climate models see section 2 1 here the bias is calculated as the ensemble average minus the corresponding cfsrc quantity the simulated ensemble average of annual mean hs is generally larger than the corresponding cfsrc quantity which is manifested as mostly positive biases in fig 2b although some negative values up to 5 m are seen in the atlantic in particular larger positive biases are seen in the low latitudes with biases of 0 5 1 m in the surroundings of small islands in the pacific ocean i e aleutian and tropical islands this partly arises from the differences in wave model resolution the smc100 grid for the ensemble simulations vs 0 5 for cfsrc wave hindcast the smc100 grid fig s1 is unable to properly capture many of these small islands leading to overestimation of wave heights in this region due to the poor representation of existing obstacles this is corroborated by the fact that the ensemble average agrees better with the era interim wave reanalysis dee et al 2011 in the vicinity of these tropical islands see fig s3 in the sm which used a wave model of similar spatial frequency and directional resolutions to the smc100 grid for offshore areas but the wave model resolution alone cannot completely explain the biases because the larger biases are still visible when compared to era interim fig s3b this is probably also related to the resolution of the underlying wave forcing fields both era interim and cfsrc have significantly finer resolutions for the atmospheric part than those of the cmip5 models see table 1 in addition large positive biases are seen in the mid latitudes of the sh only when compared to the era interim wave hindcast fig s3 in other words the ensemble average of annual mean hs for the southern mid latitudes is more comparable to the cfsrc wave hindcast than to the era interim as shown in fig 2d biases in annual maximum hs are also extensively positive and the largest positive biases are seen in the storm track regions of both hemispheres this is also true when era interim was used as reference see fig s3 with some notable negative biases in the eastern caribbean region and in the region from east china sea to south of japan unlike the annual mean hs the ensemble average of annual maximum hs does not have larger positive biases around the small pacific islands compare fig 2b and d the individual ensemble members show similar bias patterns to that of the ensemble average for both annual mean and maximum hs but the magnitude and extension of positive biases vary considerably from one member to another in particular extreme waves derived from using miroc5 simulated surface winds and sic as forcing are more different from the corresponding cfsrc quantity showing positive biases of up to 5 m or 20 in annual maximum hs at the mid latitudes see fig s4 in sm the spatial pattern of biases in annual mean tp is similar to that in annual mean hs fig 2f but with more extensive and larger positive biases especially in the pacific and indian oceans the pattern of the larger biases are indicative of the bias being spread by swell waves which are notably present in these areas see section 3 2 1 seasonality is present in the skill of the wave simulations it also varies from region to region and from one ensemble member to another as shown in fig 3 in almost all regions in the nh a weaker spatial pattern correlation is seen for the warmer months fig 3 the only exception is the north indian ocean nio which shows a notably larger seasonal fluctuation of skill showing better correlations in summer which is likely related to the regional monsoon phenomena in this area in the sh some regions like tropical south indian ocean tsio and tropical south pacific tsp show weaker correlation for summer months whereas others like south pacific sp and antarctic an regions show the opposite however different ensemble members reproduced similar courses of seasonal fluctuation within a region but the amplitude of the fluctuations can vary considerably with polar regions showing considerably larger fluctuations than most of the other regions except some tropical areas fig 3 as is the case for the wave forcing fields see section 3 1 2 the larger model uncertainty in the polar regions can be linked to the strongly interactive physical processes in the atmosphere sea ice and ocean on different scales that make climate modeling for these regions challenging vihma et al 2014 in terms of the correlation skill score the ec earth based wave simulations perform best overall among the five models particularly in the sh correlations 0 90 the gfdl esm2m based wave simulations come in second place showing the best score in the northern regions except arctic however the least biased wave simulations are those based on either the bcc csm1 1 or gfdl esm2m simulated winds and sic for most regions and on the ec earth simulated winds and sic for the arctic and antarctic regions the skill seen in the wave simulations might have resulted from several factors in the climate models used to simulate surface winds and sic one factor seems to be the resolution at which surface winds are simulated the climate model with the highest resolution for surface winds the ec earth in this case corresponds to the best correlation skill in the wave simulations but not necessarily the smallest bias although ec earth simulated surface wind speeds were found to be the best in terms of both the correlation score and bias section 3 1 2 3 1 2 evaluation results for the historical winds and sic simulations as described in section 3 1 1 the surface wind speed and sic as simulated by the five cmip5 models for the historical period were also evaluated in this study fig 4 shows the 1979 2005 mean field of annual mean and maximum surface wind speed derived from the cfsrc along with the biases in the corresponding ensemble average of the simulations by the five cmip5 models biases in the individual ensemble members are shown in fig s5 in sm as shown in fig 4b the ensemble average wind speed is weaker negatively biased than the corresponding cfsrc quantity for most regions globally it is stronger positively biased only in some tropical areas of limited extension mostly located near the tropics in the pacific and atlantic oceans the positive biases in the wind speed are considerably less extensive than those in the corresponding mean hs fig 2 this is because biases in waves can be spread out by swell waves in particular the cmip5 models tend to simulate a stronger eastward component of wind stress at mid latitude westerly wind regions lee et al 2013 see also fig 4f and fig s6 which are the most important areas for wave generation an overestimation of the zonal winds which might not be necessarily manifested in the total surface winds could produce positive hs biases which are then spread out by swell waves the pattern of bias in annual maximum wind speed fig 4d is similar to that in annual maximum hs although the relative bias i e bias divided by the corresponding cfsr c climatological mean value not shown has a smaller positive range there is also a very large wind speed bias in the arctic region and also in antarctica which was not seen in maximum hs because it was masked off by sea ice coverage at annual scale the seasonality of the cmip5 models performance for the surface wind speed see fig s7 in sm is similar to that of the derived hs but with lower correlation coefficients and biases shifted towards lower or even negative values in agreement with what was discussed earlier at annual scale for each of the 13 regions and globally fig 5 compares the annual averages of the correlation skill scores and of the relative biases for hs and wind speed showing the relative biases here enables better comparison of the bias magnitude between these two different variables in fig 5 we also used the cmip5 model names to refer to the corresponding ensemble members of hs because the differences between the ensemble members of hs which was produced using the same wave model ww3 primarily arise from differences in the surface winds and sic simulated by the five cmip5 models in terms of the correlation score the cmip5 models are ranked similarly whether they are ranked directly for the skill in simulating surface winds or indirectly for the skill in the hs derived using surface winds to force ww3 this suggests that the skill of climate models for simulating the spatial pattern of surface winds is largely passed onto the skill seen in the corresponding derived hs however as described before a positive shift is observed between biases in surface winds and the derived hs which affects the cmip5 models ranking in other words large negative biases observed for the cmip5 simulated surface winds tend to result in lower negative biases for the corresponding hs but low negative positive biases observed for the cmip5 simulated surface winds tend to result in larger positive biases for hs for example miroc5 is the least biased model for maximum wind speed but the corresponding derived maximum hs has the largest bias fig 6 shows the spatial correlation scores of monthly sic patterns and the regionally averaged biases for the arctic and antarctic regions for the arctic region the correlation score are higher in july september fig 6 this is because the correlation score is less sensitive to the model performance in simulating sic in the season of largely reduced sea ice coverage interestingly the bias in arctic sic becomes more negative it even changes from positive to negative for some models in september reaching the largest amplitude of negative biases in october the bias magnitude reduces gradually from november to may reaching the minimum biases in may august fig 6 for the antarctica the sic bias pattern is similar to that in the arctic considering that the austral warm period occurs at the beginning of the year but the correlation score shows larger disparity among the models and do not show the clear seasonality seen for the arctic for all the five cmip5 models the correlation scores are lower for the antarctica than for the arctic region this is in agreement with the report that cmip5 models offer much better sea ice simulations for the arctic than for the antarctic shu et al 2015 in terms of the correlation score model skill ranking for the arctic sic is similar to that for the corresponding surface winds and derived hs from best to worst ec earth miroc5 inmcm4 gfdl esm2m and bcc csm1 1 gfdl esm2m and inmcm4 switch places for hs and wind speed considering that the best model for surface wind speed is the model with the highest atmospheric model resolution one could expect the best model for sic to be the model with the highest ocean model resolution at which the sic is computed however the model with the highest atmospheric model resolution is still the best model for sic see table 1 this seems to indicate that the resolution of the atmospheric part of the cmip5 models rather than the ocean model resolution has played a greater role in simulating the sic arguably this is because better quality winds in a higher resolution atmospheric model can result in better sea ice advection in terms of model skill for simulating sea ice the results of this study are in agreement with those of shu et al 2015 the top two models for simulating arctic sic identified in this study ec earth and miroc5 are among the top 10 models out of 49 models for simulating the sea ice volume and sea ice extent in the arctic ocean as identified by shu et al 2015 similarly the top two models for simulating antarctica sic identified in this study bcc csm1 1 and ec earth are also among the top 10 models for simulating antarctica sea ice as identified by shu et al 2015 3 2 future projections 3 2 1 global wave climate projections in this section the projected future changes in the global hs tp and θm are presented the projected changes by 2081 2100 are expressed as the differences between the climatological means for the future 2081 2100 and historical 1979 2005 periods i e the 2081 2100 mean minus the 1979 2005 mean of the variable or statistic in question we also discuss the projected relative changes which are the projected changes divided by the 1979 2005 mean value of the variable or statistic in question considering the causal physical relationship between surface winds and waves the ensemble average of the projected relative changes in surface wind speed are also shown in fig 7 and discussed below figs 7 11 show the ensemble average of the projected changes for each variable analyzed with the results for the individual ensemble members being shown in figs s8 s13 in the sm for the global wave field we focus on the areas where waves already existed over the historical period i e statistics were computed only for ice free sic 75 areas for both the historical and future periods therefore results are not shown for the new open water areas indicated in light gray as for the ensemble average two shades of gray were used to show the minimum and maximum ice coverage i e ice coverage that was simulated by all the five models and by at least one model respectively all the five cmip5 models simulated a similar large scale pattern of the historical climate of annual mean surface wind speed with stronger winds in the mid high latitudes of the sh and of the north atlantic pacific fig 7a and the highest annual maximum winds up to 30 m s not shown over the north atlantic pacific which is consistent with the historical climate storm conditions erikson et al 2015 however the magnitude and areal extension of the projected changes vary considerably from one model to another fig s8 and the arctic ocean is one of the regions of the largest inter model variability showing the largest ensemble average increases that are however mostly insignificant statistically fig 7b the pattern of relative changes projected by ec earth fig s8 the model that best simulated surface winds for the historical period see section 3 1 2 is most similar to that of the ensemble average fig 7b which shows statistically significant decreases in the mid latitudes of the north atlantic pacific and in the sh low mid latitudes with significant increases projected for the sh storm track region the relative changes projected by miroc5 and gfdl esm2m deviate most from the ensemble average as shown in fig s8 miroc5 projected a larger area of negative changes near the equator while gfdl esm2m projected notably smaller increases both in extension and magnitude in the arctic region than did the other models fig 8 shows the ensemble average of the 1979 2005 mean of annual mean hs and of the corresponding projected relative changes by 2081 2100 which are reminiscent of the corresponding patterns for the annual mean wind speed over the ice free oceanic areas fig 7 the magnitude of projected relative changes is slightly larger in annual mean hs than in surface wind speed especially for the miroc5 and gfdl esm2m based simulations fig s9 the wave simulations that are based on miroc5 and gfdl esm2m simulations of surface winds and sic show changes decreases and increases of greater magnitude than those based on the other three models just like the corresponding changes projected for wind speed fig s8 the annual mean and maximum hs share similar large scale patterns of projected changes but annual maximum hs shows smaller areas of statistically significant changes and a larger spatial variability figs 8 and 9 as would be expected because typically the mean climate is smoother than the extreme climate the miroc5 based wave projections show a wider range of projected changes larger decreases and increases than the projections based on the other four models fig s10 the gfdl esm2m based wave simulations also projected a large increase in annual maximum hs fig s10 fig 10 shows the ensemble average of the 1979 2005 mean of annual mean tp and of the projected changes by 2081 2100 a longitudinal gradient can be seen in all three large basins pacific atlantic and indian oceans the largest tp values are seen in the tropical eastern pacific rather than in the area of the climatological maximum hs values annual mean tp was projected to increase significantly in most oceanic areas except the western tropical part of the pacific and atlantic where some significant decreases were projected fig 10b the extensive increase in tp clearly entails an increase in swell predominance as already reported by hemer et al 2013 although hemer et al 2013 used cmip3 models and slightly different time periods their results show some similarities to those of the current study for both the historical simulations and future projections like in the case of annual mean hs the tp projections based on the miroc5 and gfdl esm2m projections of surface winds and sic also show larger changes than those based on the other three models especially inmcm4 see fig s11 nevertheless tp variability among the five ensemble members fig s11 is notably lower showing more extensively significant change in the ensemble average than that in the corresponding hs and wind speed the projected tp changes are mostly within 0 5 s 10 consistent spatial patterns are obtained for the inverse wave age see fig s12 all the five ensemble members of wave simulations show a consistent climatological pattern of the annual mean wave direction θm for the period 1979 2005 fig s13 which is similar to that shown in fig 11a and also agrees with the ensemble average pattern of hemer et al 2013 despite the different experiments and models used at high latitudes especially the sh high latitudes θm is predominantly eastward being influenced by the westerlies in the tropics as getting closer to the equator θm becomes nw sw n s and ne se in the nh sh ending with a swirl of westward waves in the tropical pacific and atlantic in accordance with the trade winds in other words most of the w directions at mid high latitudes develops into sw nw as going equatorward which explains the aforementioned swell presence and large tp in the eastern part of atlantic and pacific the ensemble average projected changes in annual mean θm are shown in fig 11 positive changes are anticlockwise and negative changes clockwise the mean wave direction is projected to rotate up to about 10 in most areas in such a way that accentuates the turning from eastward waves at high latitudes to westward waves in the tropics strengthening the swell component at the east side of the large ocean basins in addition the wave rotation zone in the mid latitude north pacific waves turning from nw to ne is projected to narrow having greater rotational gradients reflected as the narrow zone of positive change bordering the extensive area of negative change in the mid latitude north pacific see fig 11b the projected θm changes are more extensively significant in the sh indicating higher consistency among ensemble members of wave simulations fig s13 3 2 2 arctic ocean wave climate projections in this section we present the results for the arctic region i e the region north of 50 n which includes more than just the arctic ocean and was chosen to get an insight into the interaction of the arctic ocean waves with those in the surrounding atlantic and pacific areas including the hudson bay due to the seasonal variations of sea ice coverage it is better and necessary to analyze waves in each calendar month which diminishes the potential issues in computing statistics in areas affected by sea ice tuomi et al 2011 the results are shown mainly for september the month of typically the smallest sea ice coverage as for the global results we present and discuss the ensemble average of the simulated historical climate and of the projected changes in hs tp θm a 1 and surface winds in addition we also present the projected changes in the new open water areas in the arctic ocean which was not done in section 3 2 1 the results are shown for the ensemble average but the results of the individual ensemble members for march and september are included in figs s14 s19 in sm as shown in fig 12 the climatological maximum surface wind speeds in this region are located in the north atlantic and the bering sea in contrast to the lower latitudes the monthly mean wind speeds over the inner arctic for september and march are similar with values ranging from 4 to 7 m s 1 to 3 m s for bcc csm1 1 model and the most notable small seasonal variations being seen in the chukchi and barents seas see fig s14 such lower seasonal variability of wind speeds in the inner arctic was also reported by przybylak 2003 as revealed in section 3 1 ec earth is the best model in simulating the historical surface wind speeds in this region and bcc csm1 1 is the worst in march bcc csm1 1 and miroc5 projected wind speed decreases in the inner arctic especially bcc csm1 1 while the other three models projected increases fig s14 in september the projected changes show a different pattern and are sometimes out of phase to that of the march counterpart e g miroc5 model see fig s14 all models except gfdl esm2m projected increases in surface wind speed over the inner arctic thus the increases are also seen in the ensemble average fig 12b although they are not statistically significant the feedback process between arctic ice retreat and surface wind speed increase could be as follows less sea ice can cause larger heat flux to atmosphere reduced stratification and enhanced cyclogenesis vihma 2014 over the arctic ocean the ensemble average projected changes in surface wind speed are also generally similar to those projected by ec earth although the larger biases in the bcc csm1 1 simulations for the arctic are discernible in the ensemble average see figs s5 and s7 the ensemble average of the 1979 2005 and 2081 2100 means of september mean hs and of the corresponding projected changes are shown in fig 13 during the historical period fig 13a the inner arctic was mostly ice covered in september and hence had no ocean surface waves the higher waves in the north atlantic and norwegian sea are consistent with the simulated climatological wind field fig 12 and with the results of previous studies e g przybylak 2003 serreze and barry 2005 liu et al 2016 as expected ice retreat towards the end of the century yields new open water areas for wave generation in both winter and summer but especially in summer in september bcc csm1 1 miroc5 and ec earth projected a sic of below 75 for almost the whole arctic basin which leads to waves being generated there according to the methodology used in this study see fig s15 for the rcp8 5 future 2081 2100 the ensemble average projected mostly 1 2 m of september mean hs in the inner arctic fig 13b table 2 lists the spatial maximum value of changes in the annual mean hs projected by each ensemble member for the arctic region which range is 2 2 2 7 m for september however the ensemble average of the projected changes are mostly 1 1 75 m in the new open water areas fig 13c in the historical open water areas the ensemble average projected some significant increases up to 15 in the barents sea fig 13d which can be related to the local increase in surface wind there fig 12b in general the projected changes in the mean hs can be related to the projected changes in surface wind speed see also figs s14 and s15 the projected ice retreat and stronger winds result in more extensive area of waves and higher waves being projected for the arctic ocean the september mean and maximum hs were projected to have a very similar spatial pattern of changes by 2081 2100 figs 13 and 14 but the projected changes in the climatological mean of maximum hs are expectedly larger its spatial maximum poleward of 50 n ranging from 4 8 to 6 4 m among the five ensemble members table 3 however the ensemble average of the projected changes in the inner arctic are mostly 3 4 m fig 14c in the historical open water areas the september maximum hs was projected to have statistically significant increases up to 15 or 0 5 m only in the hudson bay and the bering sea fig 14d fig 15 shows the projected changes in the peak wave period tp for the historical period larger tp values are seen in the northeastern pacific fig 15a which agrees with the swell predominance in that area section 3 2 1 this spatial pattern is projected to strengthen in the future fig 15b as statistically significant increases were projected in the pacific part of the domain fig 15c the climatological mean values of tp are projected to be mostly 4 7 s in the inner arctic see fig 15b and s17 in the historical open water area of the inner arctic statistically significant tp increases are projected for the chukchi and barents seas with significant decreases in the region off labrador fig 15d fig 16 shows the ensemble average of the climatological mean θm for the historical and future periods respectively here the projected future mean wave direction is shown and discussed rather than the corresponding changes to ease the interpretation of the projected future θm climate in the historical period all the five ensemble members simulated prevailing sw s se waves in the bering sea for both september and march figs 16a and s18 reflecting the influence of the aleutian low in winter bilello 1973 and of the swell waves coming from lower latitudes interestingly southward waves prevail in the chukchi sea although northward waves prevail in the bering sea figs 16 this can be explained by the influence of the local winds and the bering strait acting as a barrier for swells traveling from the pacific to the chukchi sea in the northeast atlantic to the norwegian sea the climatological mean wave direction reflects the climatological cyclone traveling direction in this region and the influence of the icelandic low bilello 1973 the ensemble average projected future θm is predominantly southward in the arctic ocean and northeastward in the davis straight baffin bay area fig 16b the southward mean wave direction in the arctic ocean indicates that waves approaching the arctic coasts have an increasing fetch as ice retreats in summer such projected changes entail increased coastal vulnerability e g coastal flooding and erosion in terms of projected θm there is also some variability among the five ensemble members for example the inmcm4 miroc5 and gfdl esm2m based wave simulations show a predominant southward wave direction in the region between greenland and norway while the bcc csm1 1 and ec earth based projections show two predominant wave directions southward northward waves in the western eastern part of this region fig s19 due to the lack of barrier as sea ice retreats in the atlantic domain greater interaction is projected between the arctic and atlantic ocean waves than between the arctic and pacific ocean waves fig 16b the projected θm forced by winds and sic simulated by the cmip5 models which projected an ice free september in the inner arctic show a slight clockwise rotation near the north pole which is in agreement with typical wind dynamics in the region fig s18 in the historical open water areas of the arctic region the projected changes of the mean θm are statistically insignificant as shown in fig 17 a the monthly mean a 1 simulated for the historical period is between 0 3 and 0 5 over most area of the domain indicating that mixed sea states prevail in the wave climate a predominance of pure wind sea states is only seen in very limited sheltered areas e g hudson bay note that here we are analyzing the climatological mean which does not imply that pure wind sea states never occur in the arctic region from the climatological perspective pure swell waves are also rare in the arctic ocean due to the limited fetch the projected changes reveal a tendency for the inverse wave age to decrease in a relatively large area of the north atlantic in winter and summer see fig s19 but the ensemble average changes are statistically significant only in limited areas there are differences between the five ensemble members near the ice edge which can be explained by the aforementioned differences in θm ice retreat can notably contribute to increasing swell conditions only when waves predominantly grow and travel from the ice edge seawards waves traveling in the opposite direction might contribute to accelerate ice breaking instead this can explain for example the projected a 1 increase more wind sea conditions near the ice edge in the north atlantic seen in the bcc csm1 1 based wave simulations for september see figs s18 and s19 4 conclusions in this study we have conducted and analyzed global wave climate simulations using the ww3 wave model forced by surface winds and sic simulated by five cmip5 models for the historical period 1979 2005 and rcp8 5 future period 2081 2100 a customized smc grid li 2012 with increased resolution along coastlines was used to enable the inclusion of the whole arctic ocean the simulated forcing surface winds and sea ice concentration and waves for the historical period were evaluated against cfsrc and era interim reanalysis data our results suggest that the resolution of the atmospheric part of climate model is positively correlated with the models skill in simulating surface wind and sic in terms of spatial pattern correlation score the skill of the five cmip5 models in simulating surface winds and sic is largely reflected in the skill in the corresponding wave simulations especially in the areas dominated by wind sea states however biases in the derived wave simulations differ from those in the corresponding surface winds this disparity arises at least in part from positive biases in hs being spread out by swell waves in addition the bias of the zonal wind component alone not necessarily related to the bias of the total wind speed seems to partially explain the bias in hs because this wind component plays an important role in the wave formation in mid high latitudes note that the results for the region of small islands in the pacific must be interpreted with care because the topographical obstacles in this region are not properly represented in the smc100 grid used in this study which resulted in overestimation of wave heights in this region all ensemble members projected a statistically significant increase in the annual mean hs in the sh mid high latitudes whereas ensemble average decreases of statistical significance are seen in the north atlantic this pattern of projected changes in hs is similar to that projected for the corresponding surface winds all the five ensemble members projected significant tp increases in the eastern part of the pacific and indian oceans but similar changes were not projected for the corresponding surface winds this is arguably related to the increase of swell waves resulted from the higher waves projected for the sh mid high latitudes that propagate and turn towards the equator hemer et al 2013 the latter is consistent with the projected changes in mean θm for the rcp8 5 scenario three of the five cmip5 models projected an ice free arctic in summer by the end of 21st century and almost all the five models except gfdl esm2m projected an increase in mean surface wind speed over the inner ice free arctic in september although the ensemble average projected changes are not statistically significant which indicates high model uncertainty in this region the projected stronger winds alone could result in higher waves in the open water area of the arctic ocean the rcp8 5 scenario future wave climate in the arctic ocean in summer is projected to be predominantly of mixed sea states with the climatological mean of september maximum hs of up to 6 4 m table 3 but mostly 3 4m in the inner arctic as shown in fig 14b and a predominantly southward mean wave direction the latter indicates that the new waves approaching the arctic coasts will be less fetch limited as ice retreats therefore the projected changes in waves suggest that the arctic coasts alaska canada and siberia which are already experiencing coastal retreat will likely subject to an increase in coastal vulnerability it is also worth pointing out the uncertainty in the results of this study because the simulations are based on only five cmip5 climate models out of dozens available for one greenhouse scenario and one run per climate model the variability among the five ensemble members presented in this study could include internal climate variability which we cannot assess with only one run per model while the method for deriving an ensemble average is still under debate in this study we have adopted a simple approach the democracy approach we included all models with the same weight regardless of their skill in simulating the historical climate this study does not mean to provide a guideline for choosing climate models to use in wave related impact studies it aims to provide useful information data as input for impact assessment studies in which the biases can be further propagated as seen in casas prat et al 2016 for wave driven coastal sediment transport dynamics increasing the sample size in future studies as dynamical modeling becomes more affordable will help better evaluate the uncertainty in wave projections especially for the emerging arctic ocean in addition an improvement in climate model performance for this area is needed and hopeful as pointed out by vihma et al 2014 a major challenge for the arctic research community is to reduce the dominating model uncertainty which is still relatively higher in this region than in the lower latitude areas acknowledgments the authors are

24127,wave setup corresponds to the increase in mean water level along the coast associated with the breaking of short waves and is of key importance for coastal dynamics as it contributes to storm surges and the generation of undertows although overall well explained by the divergence of the momentum flux associated with short waves in the surf zone several studies reported substantial underestimations along the coastline this paper investigates the impacts of the wave induced circulation that takes place in the surf zone on wave setup based on the analysis of 3d modelling results a 3d phase averaged modelling system using a vortex force formalism is applied to hindcast an unpublished field experiment carried out at a dissipative beach under moderate to very energetic wave conditions h m 0 6 m at breaking and t p 22 s when using an adaptive wave breaking parameterisation based on the beach slope model predictions for water levels short waves and undertows improved by about 30 with errors reducing to 0 10 m 0 10 m and 0 09 m s respectively the analysis of model results suggests a very limited impact of the vertical circulation on wave setup at this dissipative beach when extending this analysis to idealized simulations for different beach slopes ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 it shows that the contribution of the vertical circulation horizontal and vertical advection and vertical viscosity terms becomes more and more relevant as the beach slope increases in contrast for a given beach slope the wave height at the breaking point has a limited impact on the relative contribution of the vertical circulation on the wave setup for a slope of 0 05 the contribution of the terms associated with the vertical circulation accounts for up to 17 i e a 20 increase of the total setup at the shoreline which provides a new explanation for the underestimations reported in previously published studies keywords wave setup numerical model vortex force undertow wave breaking 1 introduction wave setup corresponds to the increase in mean water level along the coast that accompanies the breaking of short waves being one of the components of storm surges wave setup is of key importance during storms and can contribute to storm induced damage and flooding along the coast under energetic wave conditions wave setup can even dominate the storm surge along coasts bordered by narrow to moderately wide shelves e g nicolae lerma et al 2017 or at volcanic islands kennedy et al 2012 over the last decade several studies also revealed that wave breaking over the ebb shoals of shallow inlets malhadas et al 2009 dodet et al 2013 and large estuaries bertin et al 2015 fortunato et al 2017 bertin et al 2017 drives a setup that can propagate at the scale of the whole backbarrier lagoon or estuary and contribute to the flooding of low lying zones through the tilting of the free surface elevation wave setup also causes a barotropic pressure gradient the local imbalance between vertically varying wave forces and this pressure gradient contributes to the development of a bed return current also referred to as undertow garcez faria et al 2000 during storms undertows are responsible for large offshore sand transport thereby contributing to beach erosion thornton et al 1996 aagaard et al 2013 for these reasons there is a clear need to understand the physical processes that drive wave setup and to predict it accurately in numerical models the first experimental observations of wave setup were made by saville 1961 on a laboratory beach of constant slope longuet higgins and stewart 1964 then proposed a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by introducing the concept of radiation stress which correspond to the momentum flux associated with short wave propagation in the nearshore depth limited wave dissipation causes a gradient of radiation stress which acts as a horizontal pressure force and tilts the water level until a balance is reached with the subsequent barotropic pressure gradient there is an overall agreement that the wave setup is quantitatively well predicted in the outer part of the surf zone typically in water depths greater than a few meters but remains underpredicted at the shoreline e g raubenheimer et al 2001 the study of apotsos et al 2007 proposed an explanation to this underestimation suggesting that this problem can be solved by adding both the bottom stress due to the offshore directed mean flow or undertow and the wave roller in the balance equation between the cross shore radiation stress gradient and the pressure gradient associated with the wave setup michallet et al 2011 applied a 1d model that solves coupled equations representing wave roller water level and undertow to hindcast a barred beach laboratory experiment and showed that accounting for wave skewness increased undertows and wave setup along the coast substantially the numerical modelling study of bennis et al 2014 supports the hypothesis according to which the bottom stress may impact the setup and showed that the wave induced turbulent mixing can also increase the wave setup through an increase of the bottom shear stress in the present study the effect of the wave induced circulation on the setup is further explored by using a 3d phase averaged modelling system with the vortex force formalism of ardhuin et al 2008a first the modelling system is validated through a high resolution hindcast of water levels waves and bottom current measurements obtained at a dissipative beach under moderate to storm conditions second the case of an idealized beach with a constant slope is considered in order to analyse the impact of the wave induced circulation on the wave setup for steeper slopes the study area and the modelling system are described in the following sections sections 2 and 3 the results are presented in section 4 followed by an extensive discussion on the model limitations the impact of the wave breaking parameterisation and the role of the wave induced circulation on the setup section 5 finally the main findings are summarised in the conclusions and perspectives are also presented section 6 2 study area and field campaign 2 1 study area the saint trojan beach is located in the central part of the french atlantic coast fig 1 along the south west part of the oléron island which corresponds to a 8 km long sandspit bound to the south by the maumusson inlet bertin et al 2005 the continental shelf in front of the study area is about 150 km wide with a very gently sloping shoreface the isobath 20 m being found about 10 km to the west of the beach the tidal regime in this region is semi diurnal and macrotidal with a tidal range varying between about 2 m during neap tides and 5 5 m during spring tides tidal currents remain weak at the studied beach and tidal impact is mostly restricted to water level variations according to bertin et al 2008b and bertin et al 2015 yearly mean deep water wave conditions are characterized by a significant height hs of 2 m a peak period tp of 10 s and a mean direction of 285 n during storms hs can reach episodically 8 10 m in deep water with a tp exceeding 20 s and a westerly direction bertin et al 2005 2015 due to the very gently sloping shoreface and the wide continental shelf the most energetic waves suffer strong dissipation and their hs hardly exceeds 5 m at the breaking point bertin et al 2008a this beach is mainly made of fine and well sorted sands d 50 0 18 0 22 mm which together with the energetic wave climate and the macrotidal range cause its morphology to be non barred and dissipative small amplitude intertidal bars can only develop after the persistence of fair weather conditions its slope typically ranges from about 0 0015 at the shoreface to 0 015 in the intertidal area bertin et al 2008b although a berm usually develops in the course of the summer period with a slope reaching 0 04 due to the persistence of low to moderate energy wave conditions in autumn 2016 and early winter 2017 such a berm was still present during our field campaign this gently sloping morphology and the presence of a shallow shoreface induce a strong wave refraction so that the wave angle at breaking is usually small typically less than 10 bertin et al 2008a 2 2 field campaign and data processing a field campaign was carried out in early february 2017 under offshore waves characterized by hs reaching 10 m which corresponds to a return period on the order of one year nicolae lerma et al 2015 such conditions were awaited for the whole winter because they were expected to drive large setup along the coast which is the main purpose of this study an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp with a frequency of 600 khz and equipped with a pressure sensor was deployed about 3 km offshore fig 1 b in the intertidal zone 9 pressure transducers pt were deployed fig 1 c as well as a second adcp with a head frequency of 2 mhz mounted with a pressure sensor at the location of pt3 these pressure sensores were buried between 0 05 and 0 10 m of sand in order to avoid dynamic pressure errors unfortunately only 6 pts could be used for further analysis since the pt9 was not continuously submerged during a sufficiently long time while the recorded signals of pt2 and pt5 presented unrealistic drifting probably due to sand infilling below the transducer membrane and were therefore discarded for the present study the measurement period covered four tidal cycles from february 1st to 3rd characterized by a tidal range of 3 5 4 m deep water wave conditions measured at the biscay buoy show that hs increased from 2 0 m at the beginning of the campaign to 9 5 m on the 3rd of february fig 2 for each sensor bottom pressure measurements were first corrected for sea level atmospheric pressure measured at the nearby meteorological station of chassiron fig 1 b the entire record was split into consecutive bursts of 20 min and the bursts in which the sensor was alternatively dry were not considered bottom pressure energy density spectra ep f were computed using a fast fourier transform with 19 hanning windowed segments 38 degrees of freedom these pressure spectra were then converted into elevation spectra e f considering linear wave theory the significant wave height hs was computed as 1 h s 4 m 0 with 2 m 0 f m i n f m a x e f d f where fmax was set to 0 4 hz a value for which the pressure correction reaches about 13 by 3 m water depth which is well below the threshold of 100 to 1000 recommended by bishop and donelan 1987 fmin is time varying and defined following roelvink and stive 1989 or hamm and peronnard 1997 as half of the continuous peak frequency fp the latter being computed at the offshore adcp as 3 f p m 0 2 m 2 m 1 where 4 m k f m i n f m a x f k e f d f the continuous peak frequency was preferred to the discrete one because it is a more stable parameter particularly when locally generated wind waves are superimposed to remote swells the time varying approach was related to the doubling of the incident peak period during the field campaign with a very high level of energy in the infragravity hereafter ig band which must be separated properly from the gravity band in order to compute wave setup as accurately as possible the position of each sensor was carefully measured with a differential gnss using a post processing technique with a base station settled on the dune crest in front of the instrumented profile the application of this methodology to known geodetic points revealed vertical errors ranging from 0 03 to 0 05 m the pressure sensors having a resolution of 0 003 m and a 0 3 accuracy a conservative error propagation results in errors on wave setup smaller than 0 06 m finally the intertidal beach topography was surveyed at each low tide using the differential gnss described above but surprisingly revealed very small morphological changes lower than 0 1 m along the cross shore profile of the instruments 3 the modelling system 3 1 overview of the modelling system the core of the modelling system used in this study is the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism of zhang et al 2016 which is an upgrade from the model selfe of zhang and baptista 2008 it is a 3d parallelized unstructured grid model and presents the main feature of combining an eulerian lagrangian method to treat the advection in the momentum equations with semi implicit schemes which relaxes the numerical stability constraints of the model the coupling with other modules is made at the source code level which share the same unstructured grid and domain decomposition and exchange variables directly through memory in this study the circulation model is coupled with an upgrade version of the third generation spectral wind wave model wwm of roland et al 2012 it simulates gravity wave generation and propagation by solving the wave action equation komen et al 1996 which reads 5 n t x x n σ n σ θ n θ s t o t where σ is the relative wave frequency θ is the wave direction n e σ is the wave action with e being the variance density of the surface elevation x is the horizontal gradient operator x is the propagation velocity in space σ and θ are respectively the propagation velocities in frequency and direction and stot is the sum of the source terms i e including energy input due to wind and nonlinear wave wave interactions and energy dissipation due to whitecapping depth induced breaking and bottom friction wwm is coupled to schism and shares the same unstructured grid and domain decomposition 3 2 vortex force formalism in order to represent the 3d wave induced circulation in our modelling system the vortex force formalism proposed by ardhuin et al 2008a and based on a generalized lagrangian mean approach andrews and mcintyre 1978 has been implemented in the model following bennis et al 2011 since mellor 2003 first developed a different three dimensional approach for explaining the wave current coupling some intense debate took place during the last decade e g ardhuin et al 2008b mellor 2016 however the vortex force theory has already been shown to be accurate in adiabatic conditions bennis et al 2011 and cf appendix appendix a but also in conditions dominated by wave dissipation such as surf zones uchiyama et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 moghimi et al 2013 the vortex force framework considers the so called quasi eulerian velocity u u v w which equals the mean lagrangian velocity u u v w minus the stokes velocity u s u s v s w s and satisfies the continuity equation 6 u 0 with x y z as for the momentum equation resolved at each sigma level it reads 7 d u d t f v 1 ρ p h x z ν u z f w a v e x along the x axis and 8 d v d t f u 1 ρ p h y z ν v z f w a v e y along the y axis f is the coriolis parameter ρ is the water density ph is the hydrostatic pressure and ν is the vertical eddy viscosity following bennis et al 2011 the two components of the wave force term read 9 f w a v e x v s f v x u y w s u z j x f d x f r x and 10 f w a v e y u s f v x u y w s v z j y f d y f r y where j is the wave induced mean pressure and f d and f r are the sources of quasi eulerian momentum due to depth induced wave breaking and wave surface roller respectively the latter terms are described in more detail in the following subsections 3 3 depth induced wave breaking the energy dissipation due to depth limited wave breaking is computed according to the model of thornton and guza 1983 adapted to the wave action equation as described in the swan spectral wave model the swan team 2014 which gives the following expression for the energy dissipation dtot in m 2 s 1 11 d t o t 3 b 3 σ 32 π h q b h r m s 3 where h d η is the total water depth with d and η being the bathymetry and the mean surface elevation in m msl respectively σ is the mean wave frequency q b h r m s γ h 4 represents the fraction of broken waves where γ is a breaker index that corresponds to the maximum hrms to water depth ratio in the inner surf zone as explained by apotsos et al 2008 the parameters γ and b are interdependent in this wave transformation model and the corresponding best fit values on the wave height and energy dissipation profiles will vary from one field site to another several studies also showed that considering a constant γ in the surf zone is often a too simplistic assumption since it tends to increase with the bed slope tan β e g sallenger and holman 1985 raubenheimer et al 1996 salmon et al 2015 based on our experimental data located in the inner surf zone we computed hrms h and observed that it increases with the beach slope from about 0 32 at the offshore adcp location i e where tan β 0 001 until about 0 53 at the shoreline i e where tan β 0 04 at the same time it has been shown that the wave dissipation rate represented by b is higher on steep slopes than on mild slopes cacina 1989 these two parameters were therefore computed in the model as a linear function of the bed slope as in sallenger and holman 1985 12 γ a γ tan β w b γ b a b tan β w b b where tan βw is the bed slope along the peak wave direction propagation computed at each grid node with the neighboring elements using shape functions and aγ bγ ab bb are calibrated to give the best fit wave height and energy dissipation profiles i e when comparing with measurements of hs and bottom current note that our model γ was adjusted based on the observed hrms to water depth ratio in the inner surf zone and assuming that all waves had broken although this hypothesis might be more questionable for steep beaches extending this dissipation model to a spectral model following the same approach of eldeberky and battjes 1996 the energy dissipation corresponding to one energy bin reads 13 d σ θ d t o t e t o t e σ θ 3 b 3 σ 4 π h q b h r m s e σ θ where e t o t h r m s 2 8 and e σ θ are the total and discrete variance density of the surface elevation respectively the source of quasi eulerian momentum due to depth induced wave breaking in m s 2 also called breaking acceleration is then computed at each vertical level as 14 f d x z f d y z g f z 0 2 π 0 cos θ sin θ k σ σ 2 d σ θ d σ d θ which can be expressed using the wave action n σ θ as 15 f d x z f d y z g f z 0 2 π 0 cos θ sin θ k σ σ d t o t e t o t n σ θ d σ d θ and where k σ is the wavenumber and f z is an empirical vertical distribution function quantifying the vertical penetration of momentum related to wave breaking computed following uchiyama et al 2010 as 16 f z cosh k b z d d η cosh k b z d d z where k b 0 2 h r m s 1 is a decay parameter controlling the penetration depth 3 4 wave roller the source of momentum due the wave roller f r is computed following the approach of saied and tsanis 2008 which is based on dally and osiecki 1995 17 f r x z ρ 1 f z r x x x r x y y 18 f r y z ρ 1 f z r y y y r y x x with 19 r x x 2 e r cos 2 θ p r y y 2 e r sin 2 θ p r x y r y x e r sin 2 θ p where θp is the peak wave direction the computation of the roller energy er is based on the work of svendsen 1984 20 e r 1 2 ρ c p 0 9 h r m s 2 t p where cp is the peak phase velocity and tp is the peak period 3 5 wave enhanced turbulence the inclusion of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking is implemented in our turbulence closure scheme based on umlauf and burchard 2003 following the method of moghimi et al 2013 through the sea surface boundary condition 21 k z η 1 2 b 1 3 2 τ w ρ β s s d where k is the turbulent kinetic energy b 1 is a constant τ w τ w x τ w y is the wind stress in kg m 1 s 2 s d s x d s y d f z 1 f d x z f d y z is the source of momentum due to wave breaking integrated over the water column i e in m 2 s 2 and can be seen here as a density normalized stress related to breaking βs is a coefficient that relates the amount of the energy dissipated by wave breaking that is transformed into turbulent kinetic energy and is set to 0 15 according to the study of feddersen 2012 the length scale of the surface injected turbulence or surface roughness z 0 s is eventually set to 0 6hs as proposed by terray et al 1996 and also used by bennis et al 2014 and moghimi et al 2016 and imposed as a surface boundary condition for the turbulent mixing length l 22 l z η κ z 0 s where κ is the von karman s constant 3 6 bottom friction the model of grant and madsen 1979 is used to handle the bottom friction in the model under combined wave and current this approach provides an apparent roughness length z 0 b which is a function of the grain roughness set to 1 67 e 5 d 50 12 the current and wave orbital velocities and the angle between both similarly to the surface roughness length this wave current apparent bottom roughness is then injected into the turbulence closure model through the bottom boundary condition for the turbulent mixing length 23 l z d κ z 0 b 3 7 model implementation the unstructured computational grid used for the saint trojan beach case is characterized by a spatial resolution ranging from 4 5 km at the offshore boundary see fig 1 b for its extension down to 20 m in the surf zone 11 sigma levels are used for the vertical discretisation and the time step is set to 10 s for both the hydrodynamic and the wave module the tidal forcing is computed by considering the 16 main tidal constituents linearly interpolated from the regional tidal model of bertin et al 2012 wind and pressure sea level fields originate from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr for the atmospheric forcing 1 h time resolution and spatial resolutions of 0 2 and 0 5 for the wind and the atmospheric pressure respectively the wave forcing is obtained from a regional application of the wavewatchiii spectral wave model configured as described in bertin et al 2013 and forced with the cfsr wind fields described above finally the spectral space is discretized according to 30 directions and 30 frequencies ranging from 0 036 to 0 4 hz 4 model validation 4 1 introduction model data comparisons were done by computing the averaged measured value for each burst i e 20 min average and comparing it to the corresponding time averaged modelled value for wave heights the model spectra were integrated over the same frequency range as the data due to the presence of very large ig waves the hydrodynamics was dominated by periods of about 100 s so that velocity profiles averaged over 2 min were aliased alternatively the undertows considered in this section correspond to 20 min average during the wave cycle of the adcp where currents were measured within a cell of 0 5 m starting 0 2 m above the bed mean bias root mean square discrepancy rmsd and normalized rmsd nrmsd were then computed for every parameter this last parameter corresponds to the rmsd normalized by the mean value of the observations considering the spatial resolution of our grid as well as the presence of low frequency fluctuations in observed water levels we only considered samples where the mean water depth was higher than 0 3 m 4 2 water levels and short waves the first comparison between observed and simulated wave conditions is done at the deep water biscay buoy fig 2 which is located approximately at 5 00 w 45 23 n and in 4500 m water depth as this buoy is located outside the computational domain of the local grid this comparison is made with our regional wwiii model and aims to validate the wave forcing that we employed to force the local model very energetic conditions are reached near the end of the studied period with h s reaching 9 5 m deepwater wave conditions were very well reproduced by the model during the field experiment with nrmsd of 10 for h s and 6 for the mean wave period fig 2 at the shoreface wave conditions were moderate during the first two tidal cycles with h m0 and t p on the order of 2 m and 13 s at the offshore adcp respectively wave energy increased substantially during the two following tidal cycles where h m0 reached 6 m and t p reached 21 s at the offshore adcp location fig 3 water levels and wave conditions are fairly well reproduced by the model except during the last tidal cycle where the tp and t m0 2 remain underestimated by 1 to 2 s nevertheless a normalized root mean square error inferior to 11 is obtained for all parameters when for the water level we compute nrmsd as the rmsd divided by the mean tidal range which corresponds to the state of the art considering recently published studies using phase averaged approaches e g olabarrieta et al 2011 bruneau et al 2011 delpey et al 2014 at the intertidal stations the simulated water level is globally very well reproduced during the two day period but it remains underestimated at the end of the last one fig 4 the latter bias being mainly due to the underestimated wind surge probably because of the atmospheric forcing which is not accurate enough in all stations both field measurements and model results show that the short waves were depth limited and therefore tidally modulated fig 5 in more details the wave height always increases as and when the water depth increases which suggests that the sensors were always located inside the surf zone good predictions are obtained for the wave heights fig 5 although hs is only constrained by the water depth and the γ parameter which was adjusted based on field measurements see section 3 3 4 3 undertow consistent comparisons between measured and simulated currents were only feasible at the surf zone adcp location and for the first measurement cell along the vertical starting from the bottom since the bursts for the other cells were not temporally long enough to low pass filter the effect of ig waves which cause the cross shore velocity to be alternatively onshore and offshore directed fig 6 shows the comparison between the measured cross shore velocity which was computed by time averaging the cross shore velocity signal for each 20 min burst and the simulated quasi eulerian velocity at z 0 47 m from the bed i e the center of the measurement cell the measured bottom velocity is almost always negative indicating the presence of an undertow the positive values correspond mainly to times where the measurement cell is not limited to the lower part of the water column due to relatively low water levels and one can note that it only reaches about 0 3 m s 1 even under very energetic conditions very probably because the location of the instrument remains close to the shoreline in comparison to the large surf zone width this hypothesis is supported by model results which suggest that undertows up to 0 7 m s 1 developed 500 to 1000 m from the shoreline an overall good agreement is obtained between measured and simulated bottom cross shore velocity though an unexplained bias is observed during the third tidal cycle 4 4 setup comparisons between the total surge computed from measurements and from the model at the different intertidal stations are shown in fig 7 where it can be seen that a good overall agreement is obtained between both it is important to note that the atmospheric surge only reached a maximum of about 10 cm during almost the full measurement period meaning that the essential part of the total surge is due to the setup except during the last 1 5 h which has been removed for the present comparison because of partly inaccurate atmospheric forcing for this particular time in more details the joint analysis of fig 4 and 7 reveals that the accuracy of setup predictions does not deteriorate in shallow water with a nil to very small negative bias at pt7 and pt8 where the water depth is lower than 1 0 m 5 discussion 5 1 model predictive skills and limitations in this study an existing 3d phase averaged modelling system was improved to adequately represent the main effects of short waves on the hydrodynamic circulation in the nearshore namely the wave breaking and roller accelerations the enhanced bottom stress and vertical mixing this modelling system was applied to hindcast a field experiment carried out at a dissipative beach under moderate energy to extreme wave conditions with offshore h m0 exceeding 9 0 m and h m0 at breaking reaching 6 0 m model data comparison for wave parameters water levels and undertows showed predictive skills within the state of the art moghimi et al 2013 kumar et al 2012 which should be highlighted because high resolution hindcasts of surf zones under this range of wave heights is very scarce in the literature the comparison between observed and modelled total surge showed that the improved modelling system was able to reproduce the surge with a nrmsd of the order of 20 and with a negative mean bias of about 5 cm which remains in the error margin of the measurements while model data comparisons of wave setup under storm conditions are very limited in the literature probably owing to the inherent difficulty to collect measurements under such conditions the results obtained in this study are of similar accuracy compared to wave setup predictions obtained for low to moderate wave conditions and with a 1d analytical model e g apotsos et al 2007 or under high energetic conditions but with a 3d phase resolving wave model e g nicolae lerma et al 2017 in order to analyse the impact of the different wave induced effects on the results except for the wave breaking parameterisation which will be discussed in the next section some sensitivity tests were carried out it first appears that βs which relates the amount of the energy dissipated by wave breaking that is transformed into turbulent kinetic energy did not impact the results substantially when varying it from 15 i e the best fit value corresponding to the study of feddersen 2012 to 100 probably due to the relative weakness of the wave induced circulation that is present even without wave induced turbulence similarly the consideration in the turbulence closure model of an increased bottom mixing length due to the presence of waves did not reveal much impact on the water levels results while the inclusion of the roller effect slightly increased the wave setup predictions which corroborates the findings of apotsos et al 2007 this effect remained weak probably due to the unbarred morphology of the saint trojan beach however we employed a simplified approach to represent roller effects which might be questionable for barred beaches where the roller would have a larger contribution further research is needed for instance regarding the parameterisation of the roller area as a function of the breaking regime another process that might influence the observed setup is the presence of very large ig waves during the measurement period with h m0 ig exceeding 1 8 m in the nearshore during the last tidal cycle while the analysis of these ig waves is outside the scope of this paper and deserves a specific study one can wonder what would be the impact of not representing this phenomenon in our modelling system firstly across the surf zone a substantial amount of energy is transferred from the gravity to the ig band through non linear interactions in the present modelling system short wave energy loss across the surf zone is represented mainly through depth limited breaking which is then injected in the momentum equations of the circulation model it is therefore possible that the amount of energy that is injected in the momentum equations is overestimated secondly the measured current velocities associated with the most energetic ig waves were seen to be asymmetric and to reach about 2 m s 1 in the very nearshore which can potentially cause a non zero resulting bottom stress over an ig wave period and thus impact the wave setup 5 2 importance of wave breaking parameterisation the studied beach has already been the subject of several modelling studies which aimed at computing the annual longshore transport bertin et al 2008b and validating a modelling system bertin et al 2009 in these studies the beach displayed a very flat morphology with a constant slope on the order of 0 015 and significant wave heights were well reproduced nrmsd of the order of 15 using a constant γ parameter in the wave breaking model and set to 0 39 equivalent to 0 55 based on hs in bertin et al 2009 when applied to the present dataset this parameterisation only allowed obtaining fair wave height predictions in the beach lower part fig 8 a in the beach upper part where the bottom slope increases by a factor of 2 to 3 wave heights were underestimated by a factor of two this problem led us to implement an adaptive breaking parameterisation which improved our wave height predictions from the gently sloping lower beach to the steep upper beach fig 8 b as shown by the decrease of the rmsd from 0 13 m to 0 09 m as the wave setup is controlled mainly by wave dissipation the surge predictions are also substantially improved with the adaptive breaking parameterisation fig 9 the nrmsd for the whole dataset decreases from 31 to 22 while the bias is reduced by a factor of 2 when switching from constant to variable breaking parameterisation while the main improvements are found where the beach slope exceeds 0 03 as shown by for instance barthelemy 2017 these results suggest that an adaptive wave breaking parameterisation is particularly relevant in coastal environments where the bottom slope varies strongly such as barred beaches or tidal inlets 5 3 impact of the beach slope on the wave setup as proposed in the study of apotsos et al 2007 the wave setup can be increased by representing a bottom stress term associated with the undertow into the classical 1d cross shore balance equation between the wave momentum flux gradient i e the radiation stress gradient when following longuet higgins and stewart 1964 and the barotropic pressure gradient associated with the setup a first test to verify this hypothesis in saint trojan is to simply compare 3d and 2dh runs since the depth varying wave induced circulation is not represented when using a 2dh configuration the comparison between the surge simulated with these two configurations can be seen on the scatter plot of fig 10 which reveals only very marginal improvements with the 3d approach compared to the 2dh approach this behaviour could appear to be in disagreement with the conclusions of apotsos et al 2007 or suggest that other parameters differ between both studies interestingly the surf zone integrated beach slope of the two field sites studied by apotsos et al 2007 i e beaches near duck in north carolina and near egmond in the netherlands is substantially higher than the one of our field site which ranges from 0 003 at low tide during the storm peak to 0 015 during the first high tide we thus applied the model to the case of an idealized beach with different constant slopes in order to analyse the extent to which the vertical circulation can affect the difference between 2dh and 3d simulated wave setup for this idealized case we used a computational grid 1 85 km long and 1 5 km wide a grid resolution ranging from 15 m along the open boundary to 2 m along the coast a time step of 5 s and 41 sigma levels constant normally incident waves were considered with t p 12 s and h m0 at breaking hereafter hb of 1 0 3 0 and 5 0 m without tidal nor atmospheric forcing the roller acceleration was turned off for these idealized test cases in order to focus only on the contribution of the wave induced circulation on the setup since no specific wave breaking parameterisation is adequate for all considered beach slope the approach of apotsos et al 2008 is used here by holding b constant to 1 and considering their highest mean best fit value for γ which equals 0 51 for the thornton and guza 1983 model the corresponding momentum equation along the cross shore axis satisfies 24 d u d t 1 ρ p h x z ν u z f w a v e x which once the steady state is reached and depth integrated is equivalent to 25 g η x 1 h d η u u x v u y w u z z ν u z f w a v e x d z aiming to analyse the contribution of each term of the right hand side rhs of eq 25 to its left hand side which gives the wave setup we use the model outputs i e quasi eulerian velocity vertical viscosity and wave force outputs to compute the partial change in mean elevation or setup contribution associated with each rhs term the total wave setup can thus be written 26 η η u η v η w η ν η w a f o where η u η v η w η ν and ηwafo are the setup contributions associated with the cross shore advection the longshore advection the vertical advection the vertical viscosity and the wave force terms respectively each term is computed in a similar manner as for instance 27 η u x 1 g h 0 x d η u u x d z d x for the setup contribution due to the cross shore advection the results of these 9 simulations are synthesized on fig 11 which reveals firstly that for a given wave height at breaking hereafter hb maximum wave setup along the coast increases with the beach slope the contribution of wave forces varies very little with the beach slope or hb and induces a maximum setup on the order of 10 12 of hb however one should note that this behaviour might be related to the constant breaking parameterisation used in these idealized tests in contrast to the wave force the contribution of the vertical circulation to the maximum setup increases with the beach slope from about 10 for β 0 01 to about 17 for β 0 05 in more details among the terms associated with the wave induced circulation the vertical viscosity term appears more relevant for a gently sloping beach while the cross shore horizontal advection term becomes dominant for more sloping beaches interestingly for a given beach slope the respective contribution of each term varies very little with hb in order to illustrate how these different mechanisms vary spatially we computed each term along a cross shore profile located at mid grid width for the steepest considered beach slope β 0 05 with h b 5 m fig 12 in this figure the sum of the contribution of the different terms is called ηrhs and is also plotted in order to verify that it approximately equals the simulated wave setup η the remaining disparity between the two being due to the post processing of model results which doesn t match exactly the model algorithm moreover one can note that the longshore advection term η v is zero as it can be expected for shore normal waves while the wave setup simulated using a 2dh configuration is only due to the wave force term i e η η w a f o it can be clearly seen on fig 12 that this is not the case when using a 3d configuration the contribution of the advection terms η u and η w and the vertical viscosity term ην become positive 50 80 m from the shoreline which causes an increase of the wave setup compared to the case where only the wave force term is taken into account i e in a 2dh configuration these results could explain the underestimated setup along the shoreline found in raubenheimer et al 2001 and apotsos et al 2007 it is also interesting to note that the advection terms contribute slightly to increase the set down compared to the simulation where only the wave force term is considered 6 conclusions a yet unpublished dataset of water levels wave parameters and bottom currents was obtained at the dissipative beach of saint trojan france during early february 2017 under storm conditions with offshore h m0 exceeding 9 0 m and h m0 at breaking reaching 6 0 m an existing 3d phase averaged modelling system was improved to adequately represent the main effects of short waves on the hydrodynamic circulation and revealed good predictive skills and stability even for a range of wave heights for which high resolution model applications are very scarce the comparison between a constant and an adaptive wave breaking parameterisation revealed that wave height and setup predictions in the surf zone are substantially improved with the second approach which suggests that adaptive parameterisations should be relevant for coastal zones with varying bottom slopes such as barred beaches and tidal inlets the comparison between a 2dh and a 3d run revealed only very marginal improvements with the second approach which suggests that the impact of the vertical circulation on wave setup is very weak at the studied dissipative beach however the application of the model at idealized beaches with varying slopes and wave heights revealed that the relative contribution of the horizontal and vertical advection terms and the vertical viscosity term to the total setup increase with the beach slope reaching about 17 i e a 20 increase for β 0 05 moreover this analysis suggests that the respective contribution of each term varies little with the wave height at breaking previously published studies relying on 1d models raubenheimer et al 1996 apotsos et al 2007 reported substantial underestimations of wave setup in shallow water the mechanisms presented in

aron roland and antoine dumon are also greatly acknowledged for their contribution to the development of the model baptiste mengual explored the first ideas of this study during his m sc internship at lienss finally kevin martins provided valuable comments about the parameterisation of wave dissipation and roller contribution appendix a adiabatic case the adiabatic test case presented in bennis et al 2011 was considered as a first test to validate the implementation of the vortex force formalism in our modelling system this test case consists of steady monochromatic waves shoaling and deshoaling over a bump without wave breaking and for an inviscid fluid using an incident wave height h 1 02 m and a wave period t 5 24 s the analytical solution for the decrease in mean elevation over the bump is given by longuet higgins 1967 28 η a n a k 0 e 0 sinh 2 k 0 h 0 k e sinh 2 k h where k is the wavenumber h is the water depth e is the variance of the surface elevation and the subscript 0 indicates that the value is taken at x 0 the configuration of our model for this test case consists of a grid length and width of 800 m and 250 m respectively a spatial resolution of 5 m 11 vertical sigma levels and a time step of 10 s fig 13 shows that the change in surface elevation over the bump is correctly reproduced by the model once the steady state is reached this change being simply due to the change in wave induced mean pressure j in the framework of the vortex force formalism 
24127,wave setup corresponds to the increase in mean water level along the coast associated with the breaking of short waves and is of key importance for coastal dynamics as it contributes to storm surges and the generation of undertows although overall well explained by the divergence of the momentum flux associated with short waves in the surf zone several studies reported substantial underestimations along the coastline this paper investigates the impacts of the wave induced circulation that takes place in the surf zone on wave setup based on the analysis of 3d modelling results a 3d phase averaged modelling system using a vortex force formalism is applied to hindcast an unpublished field experiment carried out at a dissipative beach under moderate to very energetic wave conditions h m 0 6 m at breaking and t p 22 s when using an adaptive wave breaking parameterisation based on the beach slope model predictions for water levels short waves and undertows improved by about 30 with errors reducing to 0 10 m 0 10 m and 0 09 m s respectively the analysis of model results suggests a very limited impact of the vertical circulation on wave setup at this dissipative beach when extending this analysis to idealized simulations for different beach slopes ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 it shows that the contribution of the vertical circulation horizontal and vertical advection and vertical viscosity terms becomes more and more relevant as the beach slope increases in contrast for a given beach slope the wave height at the breaking point has a limited impact on the relative contribution of the vertical circulation on the wave setup for a slope of 0 05 the contribution of the terms associated with the vertical circulation accounts for up to 17 i e a 20 increase of the total setup at the shoreline which provides a new explanation for the underestimations reported in previously published studies keywords wave setup numerical model vortex force undertow wave breaking 1 introduction wave setup corresponds to the increase in mean water level along the coast that accompanies the breaking of short waves being one of the components of storm surges wave setup is of key importance during storms and can contribute to storm induced damage and flooding along the coast under energetic wave conditions wave setup can even dominate the storm surge along coasts bordered by narrow to moderately wide shelves e g nicolae lerma et al 2017 or at volcanic islands kennedy et al 2012 over the last decade several studies also revealed that wave breaking over the ebb shoals of shallow inlets malhadas et al 2009 dodet et al 2013 and large estuaries bertin et al 2015 fortunato et al 2017 bertin et al 2017 drives a setup that can propagate at the scale of the whole backbarrier lagoon or estuary and contribute to the flooding of low lying zones through the tilting of the free surface elevation wave setup also causes a barotropic pressure gradient the local imbalance between vertically varying wave forces and this pressure gradient contributes to the development of a bed return current also referred to as undertow garcez faria et al 2000 during storms undertows are responsible for large offshore sand transport thereby contributing to beach erosion thornton et al 1996 aagaard et al 2013 for these reasons there is a clear need to understand the physical processes that drive wave setup and to predict it accurately in numerical models the first experimental observations of wave setup were made by saville 1961 on a laboratory beach of constant slope longuet higgins and stewart 1964 then proposed a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by introducing the concept of radiation stress which correspond to the momentum flux associated with short wave propagation in the nearshore depth limited wave dissipation causes a gradient of radiation stress which acts as a horizontal pressure force and tilts the water level until a balance is reached with the subsequent barotropic pressure gradient there is an overall agreement that the wave setup is quantitatively well predicted in the outer part of the surf zone typically in water depths greater than a few meters but remains underpredicted at the shoreline e g raubenheimer et al 2001 the study of apotsos et al 2007 proposed an explanation to this underestimation suggesting that this problem can be solved by adding both the bottom stress due to the offshore directed mean flow or undertow and the wave roller in the balance equation between the cross shore radiation stress gradient and the pressure gradient associated with the wave setup michallet et al 2011 applied a 1d model that solves coupled equations representing wave roller water level and undertow to hindcast a barred beach laboratory experiment and showed that accounting for wave skewness increased undertows and wave setup along the coast substantially the numerical modelling study of bennis et al 2014 supports the hypothesis according to which the bottom stress may impact the setup and showed that the wave induced turbulent mixing can also increase the wave setup through an increase of the bottom shear stress in the present study the effect of the wave induced circulation on the setup is further explored by using a 3d phase averaged modelling system with the vortex force formalism of ardhuin et al 2008a first the modelling system is validated through a high resolution hindcast of water levels waves and bottom current measurements obtained at a dissipative beach under moderate to storm conditions second the case of an idealized beach with a constant slope is considered in order to analyse the impact of the wave induced circulation on the wave setup for steeper slopes the study area and the modelling system are described in the following sections sections 2 and 3 the results are presented in section 4 followed by an extensive discussion on the model limitations the impact of the wave breaking parameterisation and the role of the wave induced circulation on the setup section 5 finally the main findings are summarised in the conclusions and perspectives are also presented section 6 2 study area and field campaign 2 1 study area the saint trojan beach is located in the central part of the french atlantic coast fig 1 along the south west part of the oléron island which corresponds to a 8 km long sandspit bound to the south by the maumusson inlet bertin et al 2005 the continental shelf in front of the study area is about 150 km wide with a very gently sloping shoreface the isobath 20 m being found about 10 km to the west of the beach the tidal regime in this region is semi diurnal and macrotidal with a tidal range varying between about 2 m during neap tides and 5 5 m during spring tides tidal currents remain weak at the studied beach and tidal impact is mostly restricted to water level variations according to bertin et al 2008b and bertin et al 2015 yearly mean deep water wave conditions are characterized by a significant height hs of 2 m a peak period tp of 10 s and a mean direction of 285 n during storms hs can reach episodically 8 10 m in deep water with a tp exceeding 20 s and a westerly direction bertin et al 2005 2015 due to the very gently sloping shoreface and the wide continental shelf the most energetic waves suffer strong dissipation and their hs hardly exceeds 5 m at the breaking point bertin et al 2008a this beach is mainly made of fine and well sorted sands d 50 0 18 0 22 mm which together with the energetic wave climate and the macrotidal range cause its morphology to be non barred and dissipative small amplitude intertidal bars can only develop after the persistence of fair weather conditions its slope typically ranges from about 0 0015 at the shoreface to 0 015 in the intertidal area bertin et al 2008b although a berm usually develops in the course of the summer period with a slope reaching 0 04 due to the persistence of low to moderate energy wave conditions in autumn 2016 and early winter 2017 such a berm was still present during our field campaign this gently sloping morphology and the presence of a shallow shoreface induce a strong wave refraction so that the wave angle at breaking is usually small typically less than 10 bertin et al 2008a 2 2 field campaign and data processing a field campaign was carried out in early february 2017 under offshore waves characterized by hs reaching 10 m which corresponds to a return period on the order of one year nicolae lerma et al 2015 such conditions were awaited for the whole winter because they were expected to drive large setup along the coast which is the main purpose of this study an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp with a frequency of 600 khz and equipped with a pressure sensor was deployed about 3 km offshore fig 1 b in the intertidal zone 9 pressure transducers pt were deployed fig 1 c as well as a second adcp with a head frequency of 2 mhz mounted with a pressure sensor at the location of pt3 these pressure sensores were buried between 0 05 and 0 10 m of sand in order to avoid dynamic pressure errors unfortunately only 6 pts could be used for further analysis since the pt9 was not continuously submerged during a sufficiently long time while the recorded signals of pt2 and pt5 presented unrealistic drifting probably due to sand infilling below the transducer membrane and were therefore discarded for the present study the measurement period covered four tidal cycles from february 1st to 3rd characterized by a tidal range of 3 5 4 m deep water wave conditions measured at the biscay buoy show that hs increased from 2 0 m at the beginning of the campaign to 9 5 m on the 3rd of february fig 2 for each sensor bottom pressure measurements were first corrected for sea level atmospheric pressure measured at the nearby meteorological station of chassiron fig 1 b the entire record was split into consecutive bursts of 20 min and the bursts in which the sensor was alternatively dry were not considered bottom pressure energy density spectra ep f were computed using a fast fourier transform with 19 hanning windowed segments 38 degrees of freedom these pressure spectra were then converted into elevation spectra e f considering linear wave theory the significant wave height hs was computed as 1 h s 4 m 0 with 2 m 0 f m i n f m a x e f d f where fmax was set to 0 4 hz a value for which the pressure correction reaches about 13 by 3 m water depth which is well below the threshold of 100 to 1000 recommended by bishop and donelan 1987 fmin is time varying and defined following roelvink and stive 1989 or hamm and peronnard 1997 as half of the continuous peak frequency fp the latter being computed at the offshore adcp as 3 f p m 0 2 m 2 m 1 where 4 m k f m i n f m a x f k e f d f the continuous peak frequency was preferred to the discrete one because it is a more stable parameter particularly when locally generated wind waves are superimposed to remote swells the time varying approach was related to the doubling of the incident peak period during the field campaign with a very high level of energy in the infragravity hereafter ig band which must be separated properly from the gravity band in order to compute wave setup as accurately as possible the position of each sensor was carefully measured with a differential gnss using a post processing technique with a base station settled on the dune crest in front of the instrumented profile the application of this methodology to known geodetic points revealed vertical errors ranging from 0 03 to 0 05 m the pressure sensors having a resolution of 0 003 m and a 0 3 accuracy a conservative error propagation results in errors on wave setup smaller than 0 06 m finally the intertidal beach topography was surveyed at each low tide using the differential gnss described above but surprisingly revealed very small morphological changes lower than 0 1 m along the cross shore profile of the instruments 3 the modelling system 3 1 overview of the modelling system the core of the modelling system used in this study is the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism of zhang et al 2016 which is an upgrade from the model selfe of zhang and baptista 2008 it is a 3d parallelized unstructured grid model and presents the main feature of combining an eulerian lagrangian method to treat the advection in the momentum equations with semi implicit schemes which relaxes the numerical stability constraints of the model the coupling with other modules is made at the source code level which share the same unstructured grid and domain decomposition and exchange variables directly through memory in this study the circulation model is coupled with an upgrade version of the third generation spectral wind wave model wwm of roland et al 2012 it simulates gravity wave generation and propagation by solving the wave action equation komen et al 1996 which reads 5 n t x x n σ n σ θ n θ s t o t where σ is the relative wave frequency θ is the wave direction n e σ is the wave action with e being the variance density of the surface elevation x is the horizontal gradient operator x is the propagation velocity in space σ and θ are respectively the propagation velocities in frequency and direction and stot is the sum of the source terms i e including energy input due to wind and nonlinear wave wave interactions and energy dissipation due to whitecapping depth induced breaking and bottom friction wwm is coupled to schism and shares the same unstructured grid and domain decomposition 3 2 vortex force formalism in order to represent the 3d wave induced circulation in our modelling system the vortex force formalism proposed by ardhuin et al 2008a and based on a generalized lagrangian mean approach andrews and mcintyre 1978 has been implemented in the model following bennis et al 2011 since mellor 2003 first developed a different three dimensional approach for explaining the wave current coupling some intense debate took place during the last decade e g ardhuin et al 2008b mellor 2016 however the vortex force theory has already been shown to be accurate in adiabatic conditions bennis et al 2011 and cf appendix appendix a but also in conditions dominated by wave dissipation such as surf zones uchiyama et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 moghimi et al 2013 the vortex force framework considers the so called quasi eulerian velocity u u v w which equals the mean lagrangian velocity u u v w minus the stokes velocity u s u s v s w s and satisfies the continuity equation 6 u 0 with x y z as for the momentum equation resolved at each sigma level it reads 7 d u d t f v 1 ρ p h x z ν u z f w a v e x along the x axis and 8 d v d t f u 1 ρ p h y z ν v z f w a v e y along the y axis f is the coriolis parameter ρ is the water density ph is the hydrostatic pressure and ν is the vertical eddy viscosity following bennis et al 2011 the two components of the wave force term read 9 f w a v e x v s f v x u y w s u z j x f d x f r x and 10 f w a v e y u s f v x u y w s v z j y f d y f r y where j is the wave induced mean pressure and f d and f r are the sources of quasi eulerian momentum due to depth induced wave breaking and wave surface roller respectively the latter terms are described in more detail in the following subsections 3 3 depth induced wave breaking the energy dissipation due to depth limited wave breaking is computed according to the model of thornton and guza 1983 adapted to the wave action equation as described in the swan spectral wave model the swan team 2014 which gives the following expression for the energy dissipation dtot in m 2 s 1 11 d t o t 3 b 3 σ 32 π h q b h r m s 3 where h d η is the total water depth with d and η being the bathymetry and the mean surface elevation in m msl respectively σ is the mean wave frequency q b h r m s γ h 4 represents the fraction of broken waves where γ is a breaker index that corresponds to the maximum hrms to water depth ratio in the inner surf zone as explained by apotsos et al 2008 the parameters γ and b are interdependent in this wave transformation model and the corresponding best fit values on the wave height and energy dissipation profiles will vary from one field site to another several studies also showed that considering a constant γ in the surf zone is often a too simplistic assumption since it tends to increase with the bed slope tan β e g sallenger and holman 1985 raubenheimer et al 1996 salmon et al 2015 based on our experimental data located in the inner surf zone we computed hrms h and observed that it increases with the beach slope from about 0 32 at the offshore adcp location i e where tan β 0 001 until about 0 53 at the shoreline i e where tan β 0 04 at the same time it has been shown that the wave dissipation rate represented by b is higher on steep slopes than on mild slopes cacina 1989 these two parameters were therefore computed in the model as a linear function of the bed slope as in sallenger and holman 1985 12 γ a γ tan β w b γ b a b tan β w b b where tan βw is the bed slope along the peak wave direction propagation computed at each grid node with the neighboring elements using shape functions and aγ bγ ab bb are calibrated to give the best fit wave height and energy dissipation profiles i e when comparing with measurements of hs and bottom current note that our model γ was adjusted based on the observed hrms to water depth ratio in the inner surf zone and assuming that all waves had broken although this hypothesis might be more questionable for steep beaches extending this dissipation model to a spectral model following the same approach of eldeberky and battjes 1996 the energy dissipation corresponding to one energy bin reads 13 d σ θ d t o t e t o t e σ θ 3 b 3 σ 4 π h q b h r m s e σ θ where e t o t h r m s 2 8 and e σ θ are the total and discrete variance density of the surface elevation respectively the source of quasi eulerian momentum due to depth induced wave breaking in m s 2 also called breaking acceleration is then computed at each vertical level as 14 f d x z f d y z g f z 0 2 π 0 cos θ sin θ k σ σ 2 d σ θ d σ d θ which can be expressed using the wave action n σ θ as 15 f d x z f d y z g f z 0 2 π 0 cos θ sin θ k σ σ d t o t e t o t n σ θ d σ d θ and where k σ is the wavenumber and f z is an empirical vertical distribution function quantifying the vertical penetration of momentum related to wave breaking

implementation the unstructured computational grid used for the saint trojan beach case is characterized by a spatial resolution ranging from 4 5 km at the offshore boundary see fig 1 b for its extension down to 20 m in the surf zone 11 sigma levels are used for the vertical discretisation and the time step is set to 10 s for both the hydrodynamic and the wave module the tidal forcing is computed by considering the 16 main tidal constituents linearly interpolated from the regional tidal model of bertin et al 2012 wind and pressure sea level fields originate from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr for the atmospheric forcing 1 h time resolution and spatial resolutions of 0 2 and 0 5 for the wind and the atmospheric pressure respectively the wave forcing is obtained from a regional application of the wavewatchiii spectral wave model configured as described in bertin et al 2013 and forced with the cfsr wind fields described above finally the spectral space is discretized according to 30 directions and 30 frequencies ranging from 0 036 to 0 4 hz 4 model validation 4 1 introduction model data comparisons were done by computing the averaged measured value for each burst i e 20 min average and comparing it to the corresponding time averaged modelled value for wave heights the model spectra were integrated over the same frequency range as the data due to the presence of very large ig waves the hydrodynamics was dominated by periods of about 100 s so that velocity profiles averaged over 2 min were aliased alternatively the undertows considered in this section correspond to 20 min average during the wave cycle of the adcp where currents were measured within a cell of 0 5 m starting 0 2 m above the bed mean bias root mean square discrepancy rmsd and normalized rmsd nrmsd were then computed for every parameter this last parameter corresponds to the rmsd normalized by the mean value of the observations considering the spatial resolution of our grid as well as the presence of low frequency fluctuations in observed water levels we only considered samples where the mean water depth was higher than 0 3 m 4 2 water levels and short waves the first comparison between observed and simulated wave conditions is done at the deep water biscay buoy fig 2 which is located approximately at 5 00 w 45 23 n and in 4500 m water depth as this buoy is located outside the computational domain of the local grid this comparison is made with our regional wwiii model and aims to validate the wave forcing that we employed to force the local model very energetic conditions are reached near the end of the studied period with h s reaching 9 5 m deepwater wave conditions were very well reproduced by the model during the field experiment with nrmsd of 10 for h s and 6 for the mean wave period fig 2 at the shoreface wave conditions were moderate during the first two tidal cycles with h m0 and t p on the order of 2 m and 13 s at the offshore adcp respectively wave energy increased substantially during the two following tidal cycles where h m0 reached 6 m and t p reached 21 s at the offshore adcp location fig 3 water levels and wave conditions are fairly well reproduced by the model except during the last tidal cycle where the tp and t m0 2 remain underestimated by 1 to 2 s nevertheless a normalized root mean square error inferior to 11 is obtained for all parameters when for the water level we compute nrmsd as the rmsd divided by the mean tidal range which corresponds to the state of the art considering recently published studies using phase averaged approaches e g olabarrieta et al 2011 bruneau et al 2011 delpey et al 2014 at the intertidal stations the simulated water level is globally very well reproduced during the two day period but it remains underestimated at the end of the last one fig 4 the latter bias being mainly due to the underestimated wind surge probably because of the atmospheric forcing which is not accurate enough in all stations both field measurements and model results show that the short waves were depth limited and therefore tidally modulated fig 5 in more details the wave height always increases as and when the water depth increases which suggests that the sensors were always located inside the surf zone good predictions are obtained for the wave heights fig 5 although hs is only constrained by the water depth and the γ parameter which was adjusted based on field measurements see section 3 3 4 3 undertow consistent comparisons between measured and simulated currents were only feasible at the surf zone adcp location and for the first measurement cell along the vertical starting from the bottom since the bursts for the other cells were not temporally long enough to low pass filter the effect of ig waves which cause the cross shore velocity to be alternatively onshore and offshore directed fig 6 shows the comparison between the measured cross shore velocity which was computed by time averaging the cross shore velocity signal for each 20 min burst and the simulated quasi eulerian velocity at z 0 47 m from the bed i e the center of the measurement cell the measured bottom velocity is almost always negative indicating the presence of an undertow the positive values correspond mainly to times where the measurement cell is not limited to the lower part of the water column due to relatively low water levels and one can note that it only reaches about 0 3 m s 1 even under very energetic conditions very probably because the location of the instrument remains close to the shoreline in comparison to the large surf zone width this hypothesis is supported by model results which suggest that undertows up to 0 7 m s 1 developed 500 to 1000 m from the shoreline an overall good agreement is obtained between measured and simulated bottom cross shore velocity though an unexplained bias is observed during the third tidal cycle 4 4 setup comparisons between the total surge computed from measurements and from the model at the different intertidal stations are shown in fig 7 where it can be seen that a good overall agreement is obtained between both it is important to note that the atmospheric surge only reached a maximum of about 10 cm during almost the full measurement period meaning that the essential part of the total surge is due to the setup except during the last 1 5 h which has been removed for the present comparison because of partly inaccurate atmospheric forcing for this particular time in more details the joint analysis of fig 4 and 7 reveals that the accuracy of setup predictions does not deteriorate in shallow water with a nil to very small negative bias at pt7 and pt8 where the water depth is lower than 1 0 m 5 discussion 5 1 model predictive skills and limitations in this study an existing 3d phase averaged modelling system was improved to adequately represent the main effects of short waves on the hydrodynamic circulation in the nearshore namely the wave breaking and roller accelerations the enhanced bottom stress and vertical mixing this modelling system was applied to hindcast a field experiment carried out at a dissipative beach under moderate energy to extreme wave conditions with offshore h m0 exceeding 9 0 m and h m0 at breaking reaching 6 0 m model data comparison for wave parameters water levels and undertows showed predictive skills within the state of the art moghimi et al 2013 kumar et al 2012 which should be highlighted because high resolution hindcasts of surf zones under this range of wave heights is very scarce in the literature the comparison between observed and modelled total surge showed that the improved modelling system was able to reproduce the surge with a nrmsd of the order of 20 and with a negative mean bias of about 5 cm which remains in the error margin of the measurements while model data comparisons of wave setup under storm conditions are very limited in the literature probably owing to the inherent difficulty to collect measurements under such conditions the results obtained in this study are of similar accuracy compared to wave setup predictions obtained for low to moderate wave conditions and with a 1d analytical model e g apotsos et al 2007 or under high energetic conditions but with a 3d phase resolving wave model e g nicolae lerma et al 2017 in order to analyse the impact of the different wave induced effects on the results except for the wave breaking parameterisation which will be discussed in the next section some sensitivity tests were carried out it first appears that βs which relates the amount of the energy dissipated by wave breaking that is transformed into turbulent kinetic energy did not impact the results substantially when varying it from 15 i e the best fit value corresponding to the study of feddersen 2012 to 100 probably due to the relative weakness of the wave induced circulation that is present even without wave induced turbulence similarly the consideration in the turbulence closure model of an increased bottom mixing length due to the presence of waves did not reveal much impact on the water levels results while the inclusion of the roller effect slightly increased the wave setup predictions which corroborates the findings of apotsos et al 2007 this effect remained weak probably due to the unbarred morphology of the saint trojan beach however we employed a simplified approach to represent roller effects which might be questionable for barred beaches where the roller would have a larger contribution further research is needed for instance regarding the parameterisation of the roller area as a function of the breaking regime another process that might influence the observed setup is the presence of very large ig waves during the measurement period with h m0 ig exceeding 1 8 m in the nearshore during the last tidal cycle while the analysis of these ig waves is outside the scope of this paper and deserves a specific study one can wonder what would be the impact of not representing this phenomenon in our modelling system firstly across the surf zone a substantial amount of energy is transferred from the gravity to the ig band through non linear interactions in the present modelling system short wave energy loss across the surf zone is represented mainly through depth limited breaking which is then injected in the momentum equations of the circulation model it is therefore possible that the amount of energy that is injected in the momentum equations is overestimated secondly the measured current velocities associated with the most energetic ig waves were seen to be asymmetric and to reach about 2 m s 1 in the very nearshore which can potentially cause a non zero resulting bottom stress over an ig wave period and thus impact the wave setup 5 2 importance of wave breaking parameterisation the studied beach has already been the subject of several modelling studies which aimed at computing the annual longshore transport bertin et al 2008b and validating a modelling system bertin et al 2009 in these studies the beach displayed a very flat morphology with a constant slope on the order of 0 015 and significant wave heights were well reproduced nrmsd of the order of 15 using a constant γ parameter in the wave breaking model and set to 0 39 equivalent to 0 55 based on hs in bertin et al 2009 when applied to the present dataset this parameterisation only allowed obtaining fair wave height predictions in the beach lower part fig 8 a in the beach upper part where the bottom slope increases by a factor of 2 to 3 wave heights were underestimated by a factor of two this problem led us to implement an adaptive breaking parameterisation which improved our wave height predictions from the gently sloping lower beach to the steep upper beach fig 8 b as shown by the decrease of the rmsd from 0 13 m to 0 09 m as the wave setup is controlled mainly by wave dissipation the surge predictions are also substantially improved with the adaptive breaking parameterisation fig 9 the nrmsd for the whole dataset decreases from 31 to 22 while the bias is reduced by a factor of 2 when switching from constant to variable breaking parameterisation while the main improvements are found where the beach slope exceeds 0 03 as shown by for instance barthelemy 2017 these results suggest that an adaptive wave breaking parameterisation is particularly relevant in coastal environments where the bottom slope varies strongly such as barred beaches or tidal inlets 5 3 impact of the beach slope on the wave setup as proposed in the study of apotsos et al 2007 the wave setup can be increased by representing a bottom stress term associated with the undertow into the classical 1d cross shore balance equation between the wave momentum flux gradient i e the radiation stress gradient when following longuet higgins and stewart 1964 and the barotropic pressure gradient associated with the setup a first test to verify this hypothesis in saint trojan is to simply compare 3d and 2dh runs since the depth varying wave induced circulation is not represented when using a 2dh configuration the comparison between the surge simulated with these two configurations can be seen on the scatter plot of fig 10 which reveals only very marginal improvements with the 3d approach compared to the 2dh approach this behaviour could appear to be in disagreement with the conclusions of apotsos et al 2007 or suggest that other parameters differ between both studies interestingly the surf zone integrated beach slope of the two field sites studied by apotsos et al 2007 i e beaches near duck in north carolina and near egmond in the netherlands is substantially higher than the one of our field site which ranges from 0 003 at low tide during the storm peak to 0 015 during the first high tide we thus applied the model to the case of an idealized beach with different constant slopes in order to analyse the extent to which the vertical circulation can affect the difference between 2dh and 3d simulated wave setup for this idealized case we used a computational grid 1 85 km long and 1 5 km wide a grid resolution ranging from 15 m along the open boundary to 2 m along the coast a time step of 5 s and 41 sigma levels constant normally incident waves were considered with t p 12 s and h m0 at breaking hereafter hb of 1 0 3 0 and 5 0 m without tidal nor atmospheric forcing the roller acceleration was turned off for these idealized test cases in order to focus only on the contribution of the wave induced circulation on the setup since no specific wave breaking parameterisation is adequate for all considered beach slope the approach of apotsos et al 2008 is used here by holding b constant to 1 and considering their highest mean best fit value for γ which equals 0 51 for the thornton and guza 1983 model the corresponding momentum equation along the cross shore axis satisfies 24 d u d t 1 ρ p h x z ν u z f w a v e x which once the steady state is reached and depth integrated is equivalent to 25 g η x 1 h d η u u x v u y w u z z ν u z f w a v e x d z aiming to analyse the contribution of each term of the right hand side rhs of eq 25 to its left hand side which gives the wave setup we use the model outputs i e quasi eulerian velocity vertical viscosity and wave force outputs to compute the partial change in mean elevation or setup contribution associated with each rhs term the total wave setup can thus be written 26 η η u η v η w η ν η w a f o where η u η v η w η ν and ηwafo are the setup contributions associated with the cross shore advection the longshore advection the vertical advection the vertical viscosity and the wave force terms respectively each term is computed in a similar manner as for instance 27 η u x 1 g h 0 x d η u u x d z d x for the setup contribution due to the cross shore advection the results of these 9 simulations are synthesized on fig 11 which reveals firstly that for a given wave height at breaking hereafter hb maximum wave setup along the coast increases with the beach slope the contribution of wave forces varies very little with the beach slope or hb and induces a maximum setup on the order of 10 12 of hb however one should note that this behaviour might be related to the constant breaking parameterisation used in these idealized tests in contrast to the wave force the contribution of the vertical circulation to the maximum setup increases with the beach slope from about 10 for β 0 01 to about 17 for β 0 05 in more details among the terms associated with the wave induced circulation the vertical viscosity term appears more relevant for a gently sloping beach while the cross shore horizontal advection term becomes dominant for more sloping beaches interestingly for a given beach slope the respective contribution of each term varies very little with hb in order to illustrate how these different mechanisms vary spatially we computed each term along a cross shore profile located at mid grid width for the steepest considered beach slope β 0 05 with h b 5 m fig 12 in this figure the sum of the contribution of the different terms is called ηrhs and is also plotted in order to verify that it approximately equals the simulated wave setup η the remaining disparity between the two being due to the post processing of model results which doesn t match exactly the model algorithm moreover one can note that the longshore advection term η v is zero as it can be expected for shore normal waves while the wave setup simulated using a 2dh configuration is only due to the wave force term i e η η w a f o it can be clearly seen on fig 12 that this is not the case when using a 3d configuration the contribution of the advection terms η u and η w and the vertical viscosity term ην become positive 50 80 m from the shoreline which causes an increase of the wave setup compared to the case where only the wave force term is taken into account i e in a 2dh configuration these results could explain the underestimated setup along the shoreline found in raubenheimer et al 2001 and apotsos et al 2007 it is also interesting to note that the advection terms contribute slightly to increase the set down compared to the simulation where only the wave force term is considered 6 conclusions a yet unpublished dataset of water levels wave parameters and bottom currents was obtained at the dissipative beach of saint trojan france during early february 2017 under storm conditions with offshore h m0 exceeding 9 0 m and h m0 at breaking reaching 6 0 m an existing 3d phase averaged modelling system was improved to adequately represent the main effects of short waves on the hydrodynamic circulation and revealed good predictive skills and stability even for a range of wave heights for which high resolution model applications are very scarce the comparison between a constant and an adaptive wave breaking parameterisation revealed that wave height and setup predictions in the surf zone are substantially improved with the second approach which suggests that adaptive parameterisations should be relevant for coastal zones with varying bottom slopes such as barred beaches and tidal inlets the comparison between a 2dh and a 3d run revealed only very marginal improvements with the second approach which suggests that the impact of the vertical circulation on wave setup is very weak at the studied dissipative beach however the application of the model at idealized beaches with varying slopes and wave heights revealed that the relative contribution of the horizontal and vertical advection terms and the vertical viscosity term to the total setup increase with the beach slope reaching about 17 i e a 20 increase for β 0 05 moreover this analysis suggests that the respective contribution of each term varies little with the wave height at breaking previously published studies relying on 1d models raubenheimer et al 1996 apotsos et al 2007 reported substantial underestimations of wave setup in shallow water the mechanisms presented in

lienss finally kevin martins provided valuable comments about the parameterisation of wave dissipation and roller contribution appendix a adiabatic case the adiabatic test case presented in bennis et al 2011 was considered as a first test to validate the implementation of the vortex force formalism in our modelling system this test case consists of steady monochromatic waves shoaling and deshoaling over a bump without wave breaking and for an inviscid fluid using an incident wave height h 1 02 m and a wave period t 5 24 s the analytical solution for the decrease in mean elevation over the bump is given by longuet higgins 1967 28 η a n a k 0 e 0 sinh 2 k 0 h 0 k e sinh 2 k h where k is the wavenumber h is the water depth e is the variance of the surface elevation and the subscript 0 indicates that the value is taken at x 0 the configuration of our model for this test case consists of a grid length and width of 800 m and 250 m respectively a spatial resolution of 5 m 11 vertical sigma levels and a time step of 10 s fig 13 shows that the change in surface elevation over the bump is correctly reproduced by the model once the steady state is reached this change being simply due to the change in wave induced mean pressure j in the framework of the vortex force formalism 
24128,the current generation of climate models exhibit a large spread in the steady state and projected southern ocean upper and lower overturning circulation with mechanisms for deep ocean variability remaining less well understood here common southern ocean metrics in twelve models from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiment phase ii core ii are assessed over a 60 year period specifically stratification surface buoyancy fluxes and eddies are linked to the magnitude of the strengthening trend in the upper overturning circulation and a decreasing trend in the lower overturning circulation across the core ii models the models evolve similarly in the upper 1 km and the deep ocean with an almost equivalent poleward intensification trend in the southern hemisphere westerly winds however the models differ substantially in their eddy parameterisation and surface buoyancy fluxes in general models with a larger heat driven water mass transformation where deep waters upwell at the surface 55 s transport warmer waters into intermediate depths thus weakening the stratification in the upper 2 km models with a weak eddy induced overturning and a warm bias in the intermediate waters are more likely to exhibit larger increases in the upper overturning circulation and more significant weakening of the lower overturning circulation we find the opposite holds for a cool model bias in intermediate depths combined with a more complex 3d eddy parameterisation that acts to reduce isopycnal slope in summary the southern ocean overturning circulation decadal trends in the coarse resolution core ii models are governed by biases in surface buoyancy fluxes and the ocean density field and the configuration of the eddy parameterisation keywords core ii models meridional overturning circulation southern ocean eddy parameterisation ocean stratification water mass transformation 1 introduction southern ocean water masses are connected via the upper and lower meridional overturning circulation moc cells and the antarctic circumpolar current acc in a southern ocean zonal mean view the upper cell of the moc is driven by the upwelling of northern sourced deep waters and northward surface ekman transport speer et al 2000 the lower moc flows in the opposite direction comprised of upwelled waters made denser by sea ice and mixing process along the antarctic margin and of northward southern ocean abyssal flows the strength of the acc is linked to both the upper ocean meridional density gradient across it and the wind stress imparted upon the ocean surface russell et al 2006 boning et al 2008 meijers et al 2012 rintoul and naveira garabato 2013 farneti et al 2015 the acc transport and the residual or total transport of the upper moc cell are generally thought to be enhanced by the poleward shift and intensification of the southern hemisphere westerlies morrison and hogg 2013 farneti et al 2010 gent and danabasoglu 2011 sijp and england 2009 saenko et al 2012 hogg et al 2017 eddies also play a large role in counteracting the influence of winds more so for the acc than the moc morrison and hogg 2013 however spatially and temporally biased observations and modelling capabilities and parameterisations inhibit our understanding of the long term variability of these circulation systems multi model analyses have been used for over a decade to elucidate major long term trends in the earth s climate system whilst the mean across multi model studies is often in good agreement with observations in variables such as winds surface temperature and radiative fluxes and precipitation gleckler et al 2008 the inter model spread is vast sparse spatiotemporal observational data can contribute to model spread in circulation magnitudes for example farneti et al 2015 showed that the transport of the upper moc across models is in far better agreement with observationally based estimates than the lower moc likely due to a denser distribution of observational data available within the upper 2 km of the ocean used to support model constraints the southern ocean overturning circulation upper and lower branches are connected by the incoming deep waters that upwell within the acc region and transport temperature anomalies and the oceanic response of climate forcing on decadal to centennial timescales armour et al 2016 however multi model efforts such as the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments phase ii core ii danabasoglu et al 2014 have revealed major differences and biases in the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics contributing to the meridional overturning circulation that limit our understanding of the temporally evolving climate system for example whilst the mean acc transport in core ii models 150 3 42 7 sv where 1 sv equates to 106 m3 s 1 farneti et al 2015 agrees well with the long standing observational estimates approximately 135 sv cunningham et al 2003 chidichimo et al 2014 the model spread is around 50 sv further the most recent observational estimate for acc transport is 175 sv donohue et al 2016 providing a new target for models to attain biases in sea ice that contribute to the freshwater fluxes for antarctic bottom water formation remain poorly understood with models failing to capture the sign and magnitude of antarctic trends mahlstein et al 2013 downes et al 2015 shu et al 2015 this study offers a new insight into the spread in overturning circulation across core ii climate models for the mean and varied states the core ii effort is comprised of coupled ocean sea ice models forced by a common atmospheric state for the 1948 2007 period large and yeager 2009 the coherent atmospheric state converted to surface fluxes using bulk formulae is particularly advantageous in that influences of large scale circulation such as wind stress are very similar across the core ii models for example the southern hemisphere westerly wind stress differs by no more than 10 in strength and less than 1 in latitude in position farneti et al 2015 yet the ocean circulation differs across the core ii models due principally to model dynamics the coupling of the core ii surface fields of wind speed humidity surface air temperature and radiative fluxes to the ocean and sea ice models leads to a large spread in the magnitude of the variability in large scale circulation downes et al 2015 assessed the twelve core ii models presented here and found that the latitudinal position whereby the mid latitude heat gain switched to high latitude heat loss varied by more than 10 and farneti et al 2015 showed a similar result for the decadal trend in surface heat fluxes the mean state surface heat flux distribution contributes to the mid latitude deep winter mixed layers which varied by more than 150 m across the core ii models and directly influences the rate of subduction of upper ocean water masses downes et al 2015 in addition there were significant differences in the ocean temperature and salinity biases the pattern of weddell sea deep convection and the sea ice extent that all contribute to the lower overturning circulation and the formation of antarctic bottom water farneti et al 2015 found that the eddy induced overturning circulation ranged by more than 6 sv more than half the magnitude of the model mean across 17 core ii models due to the differing parameterisation of the eddy mixing scheme with a 4 8 to 18 2 sv range in the associated total upper branch of the moc downes et al 2015 and farneti et al 2015 conducted extensive analyses on southern ocean water mass sea ice and large scale circulation processes in the core ii models focusing particularly on the 1988 2007 period here we expand upon these analyses by evaluating the inter model differences and biases that lead to the large spread in overturning circulation trends over the 1948 2007 period wind stress and buoyancy are known drivers of the ocean s large scale circulation the very similar trend in wind stress strength and position across the core ii models farneti et al 2015 provides an opportunity to focus on the surface buoyancy and interior density model fields as mechanisms for changes in overturning circulation however we must also consider the eddy contribution to changes given that each model employs its own version of an eddy advection scheme which can drastically affect the model response to surface forcings gent and danabasoglu 2011 farneti et al 2015 this is the first study to our knowledge that associates decadal upper and lower overturning circulation trends with model biases in density and stratification and eddy parameterisation configuration in section 2 we briefly outline model features of the twelve core ii models assessed and the common metrics we use in this study we describe the mean and temporal evolution of the upper and lower moc and its association with model buoyancy and density biases in section 3 including an analysis of the relationship between the moc density and the westerly wind stress we summarise and discuss our findings in section 4 2 models and methods 2 1 the core ii models we use 12 models from the core ii effort that are described in danabasoglu et al 2014 downes et al 2015 and farneti et al 2015 namely access awi bergen cmcc gold ictp kiel05 mom mom025 mri ncar and nocs the 12 models features are detailed in table 1 and we provide a brief overview here almost all of the models have a coarse resolution grid with approximately 1 horizontal spacing exceptions are the mom025 and kiel05 models that have a 1 4 and 1 2 horizontal grid respectively and ictp has a 2 horizontal resolution the models have between 30 and 75 vertical levels mesoscale circulation is parameterised using a 1 2 or 3 dimensional eddy diffusivity coefficient table 1 based on the gent and mcwilliams 1990 scheme that impacts the strength of the eddy induced overturning circulation and the extent to which the eddy overturning compensates variability in the eulerian mean circulation note that the eddy permitting mom025 model does not use an eddy parameterisation all the models are coupled to a sea ice model the inter annually varying atmospheric state used in the twelve core ii models large and yeager 2009 provides common atmospheric surface temperature wind speed humidity and radiative fluxes for 1948 2007 the core ii models are simulated for 300 years five 60 year core forced cycles and we assess the final cycle here trends in large scale transports have been shown to remain consistent across each the 60 year cycles e g see fig 22 in farneti et al 2015 we note that our conclusions for at least the upper overturning circulation hold regardless of whether we use the full 60 year core ii output or whether we disregard the first decade after which the model has equilibrated to the new cycle using periods less than 50 years are not ideal for distinguishing models with a smaller or larger magnitude in the moc decadal trends for ocean interior variables we compare the core ii models to two versions of the world ocean atlas woa climatologies woa09 locarnini et al 2010 antonov et al 2010 and woa13 version 2 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 the former has been produced on a 1 grid with 33 vertical levels whilst the woa13 climatology includes an additional decade of climatology data compared to woa09 and is available on a 1 4 grid with 102 vertical levels 2 2 definitions and calculations in this study the moc is defined as the zonal integration and vertical cumulative sum in depth or density space of the meridional velocity the upper and lower overturning circulation here is the combination of the eddy induced and eulerian mean circulations known as the residual or total circulation trends and changes in the moc cell strengths used throughout the study are based on calculations using absolute values that is a positive trend will indicate increases and negative values for decreases our moc results are presented in density coordinates referenced to 2 km with units in sv the moc in the classic depth coordinate does not equate to the same as the more natural density

negatively signed is defined as the absolute maximum strength in the density range 1036 5 σ 2 1037 5 kg m 3 between 60 s and 30 s we restrict the southern boundary of our moclc definition at 60 s because we do not want to confuse its trend with that of the subpolar cell in the same density range the eddy induced overturning circulation in density space mocgm has more than one maxima in the southern ocean in several models farneti et al 2015 see their fig 18 thus we average the eddy contribution to the moc across a range of densities farneti et al 2015 showed that the time mean averaged mocgm was associated with the eddy induced advection coefficient used in the eddy parametrisation scheme see their fig 21 we follow the definition used in farneti et al 2015 where the mocgm is averaged over the density range 1034 5 σ 2 1037 5 kg m 3 and latitude range of 70 s 35 s note that the mocgm flows in the same direction as the moclc and flows across both the lower and upper moc density ranges saenko et al 2012 the mom025 model excludes an eddy parameterisation and the gold model did not archive the eddy contribution these models are highlighted by an asterisk in figures where we illustrate mocgm diagnostics given that the core ii models are coupled to a common atmospheric state we pay particular focus to the surface and interior density related properties that may alter the large scale circulation we use the surface water mass transformation wmt diagnostics estimated in downes et al 2015 see their figs 14 and 15 and first introduced in walin 1982 to show how atmosphere ocean surface buoyancy fluxes of heat and freshwater combine to alter the surface density the surface transformation is an integration over the entire water mass outcrop region bounded by ρk and ρ k 1 where ρ k 1 ρ k and is estimated as following downes et al 2011 2015 1 f ρ k 1 ρ k 1 ρ k a α q n e t c p d a 1 ρ k 1 ρ k a ρ 0 β s f w n e t d a there are two main terms in the surface

surface salinity s and reference ocean density taken here to be ρ 0 1035 kg m 3 positive transformation rates indicate where lighter water masses are converted to denser layers associated with surface buoyancy loss and negative rates with conversion to lower densities due to surface buoyancy gain 3 results 3 1 the mean state of the moc we begin by describing the mean state of the density wind stress and overturning circulation to help orient the reader and then link these mean states to decadal variability in the moc all density and overturning circulation diagnostics are calculated online and archived as monthly means the zonal mean ocean density is very similar for the upper kilometre of the ocean in the core ii models downes et al 2015 given that the models are forced by the same atmospheric state by the end of the 60 year core ii analysis period the isopycnals have deepened in the southern ocean interior north of 60 s consistent with warming and freshening trends and shoal south of 60 s fig 1 a the strong westerly winds that steepen isopycnals and act to strengthen the eulerian upper overturning circulation increase by approximately 30 in its maximum strength and shift poleward by 3 to around 54 latitude by 2007 fig 1b see also fig 2 in farneti et al 2015 3 1 1 the upper and eddy induced overturning cells the southern ocean moc in density space is comprised of an upper cell in the 60 30 s latitude range and at higher densities the lower cell flowing in the opposite direction fig 2 c f farneti et al 2015 the residual moc is comprised of the eulerian and eddy induced circulation the latter being distributed in density space across both the upper and lower overturning cells the maximum strength of the net upper and lower moc and the average eddy induced moc over the southern ocean are illustrated in fig 3 the core ii model mean that is the average of all twelve models is in good agreement with observationally based mocuc estimates of approximately 12 sv lumpkin and speer 2007 with considerable spread across the individual models fig 3a models with a larger mocuc are those with the upper cell extending across larger density ranges and latitudes specifically the access awi cmcc kiel mom mom025 and mri models see where the upper cell extends south of 60 s in these models in fig 2 farneti et al 2015 showed that models with a more complex three dimensional eddy parameterisation awi bergen and ncar produced a larger eddy contribution to the moc red circles in fig 3b however among the models with a two dimensional depth independent eddy parameterisation several have a large range for the eddy advection coefficient that extends up to 5000 m2 s 1 cmcc ictp kiel05 and nocs this extended coefficient range also increases the magnitude of the eddy induced overturning circulation conversely a one dimensional eddy parameterisation or two dimensional eddy parametrisation with a smaller advection coefficient range i e up to 1000 m2 s 1 produces a small eddy induced overturning blue circles in fig 3b 3 1 2 the lower overturning cell in climate models the deep ocean is one of the most poorly represented ocean regions primarily due to sparse observations coarse model vertical grid resolution and mesoscale parameterisations that are fixed or depth time independent the lower overturning circulation in density space moclc varies considerably across climate models downes and hogg 2013 farneti et al 2015 linked to ocean temperature and salinity biases throughout the water column heuzé et al 2013 wang et al 2011 here moclc in the final 20 years of each experiment varies from 5 sv in the eddy permitting mom025 model to 22 sv in gold fig 3c most of the moclc estimates are lower than observationally based estimates 16 29 sv lumpkin and speer 2007 talley 2013 models with weak moclc can have a strong mocuc e g kiel05 mom025 and mri and vice versa e g bergen and gold and nocs to the south of the lower moc lies a subpolar cell that is driven by convection and sea ice variability fig 2 we find that this subpolar cell is significantly correlated to the strength of the lower cell moclc in eight of the twelve core ii models over the 60 year period figure not shown however we were unable to find a distinct link between variability in polar seas and that in the lower moc cell due to the large spread in convection rates and patterns for example the moclc consistently decreases but there is no consistent trend in the weddell sea mixed layer depth an indicator of deep water formation thus the subpolar cell does not likely contribute to the decreasing trend in the moclc and we focus on understanding the coherent model trends in the lower and upper moc between 30 s and 60 s 3 2 temporal variability of the moc 3 2 1 the upper overturning cell here we examine decadal variability in the overturning circulation as a function of the model and varying surface buoyancy fluxes stratification and eddy parametrisation we begin with the upper ocean density variability in the latitude range 60 30 s where the mocuc is defined in the core ii models the mocuc increases by 0 1 to 1 6 sv decade fig 4a with the lowest trends found in the awi cmcc gold mom025 and ncar models in the mean state these five models and kiel05 have a stronger vertical density gradient north of the wind stress maximum that is evident across the 60 year core ii period fig 4b and c that is the density difference between the 0 1 km and 1 2 km depth ranges is greater in these models and thus the stratification is stronger this stronger upper ocean stratification maintained by surface warming and freshening see figs 10 12 in farneti et al 2015 is associated with weak winter mixed layer trends in the same region see fig 22 in downes et al 2015 we note that the density in the 0 1 km range is very similar across the models thus it is the density in 1 2 km that dominates the density differences in fig 4b and c the core ii models have a vertical density gradient that spans observational estimates from both the woa09 and woa13 climatologies it is interesting to note that the woa13 observational climatology lies within the upper density gradient range of the models with a weak mocuc decadal trend red however the earlier woa09 version lies within the range of models that exhibit a larger mocuc trend blue we also note some exceptions to the model results the mocuc decadal trend in the kiel05 model is large despite this model having a higher vertical density gradient further the bergen model has a mocuc decadal trend that is mid range 1 sv decade fig 4 a smaller vertical density gradient but a higher eddy induced overturning circulation fig 3b the choice of eddy parameterisation influences upper ocean density by reducing the isopycnal slope and thus increasing the density difference between the 0 1 km and 1 2 km depth ranges we find that the models with a 3d eddy parameterisation awi bergen and ncar are among the models with a smaller decadal trend in the mocuc of under 1 2 sv decade mostly red circles in fig 4a in contrast models with a 1d or 2d eddy parameterisation blue circles e g access ictp mom mri and nocs tend to have a smaller eddy induced overturning circulation fig 3b but a larger trend fig 4a our upper moc cell results are in agreement with previous studies that show the eddy induced circulation reduces the influence of the poleward intensifying wind stress fig 1b on the residual mocuc see also for example saenko et al 2012 farneti et al 2015 gent 2016 chapman and sallée 2017 marshall et al 2017 in fig 4d we evaluate the relationship between the vertical density change in the upper 2 km in the acc region and the average strength of the eddy induced overturning circulation within the 65 53 s latitude range south of the wind stress maximum displayed in the fig 4d we find a significant correlation between eddy induced overturning and the upper ocean vertical density gradient r 0 58 models with a weak mocuc decadal trend including some of which have a more complex 3d eddy parameterisation awi bergen and ncar have a larger density gradient and vice versa for the larger mocuc trends however we do not find a strong correlation between the eddy induced overturning circulation averaged over the core ii period and the vertical density gradient in the region north of the wind stress maximum r 0 28 53 40 s figure not shown thus the eddy overturning circulation is most influential in the upwelling region of the acc 3 2 2 the lower overturning cell whilst the mocuc increases coherently across the twelve models the moclc coherently decreases consistent with recent deep ocean temperature salinity and volume trends purkey and johnson 2012 the moclc decreases by 0 5 1 7 sv per decade across the twelve models fig 5a with the largest trend in the bergen mom025 mri and nocs models followed by the access awi and ictp models close to 1 sv decade we note that four of the six models with a weaker moclc trend namely cmcc gold kiel05 and ncar also have a weaker mocuc trend a stronger upper ocean density gradient fig 4 and a more complex three dimensional or no eddy parameterisation fig 3 whilst the sign of the moclc trend is coherent the variations in magnitude can be understood by again looking at the ocean interior density properties the moclc is prominent at densities greater than 1036 9 kg m 3 fig 2 which is in the depth range greater than 2 km for the regions approximately bound by 40 s and 40 n fig 1a spence et al 2014 showed that changes in the moclc due to wind stress variability can be attributed to the density components of the potential vorticity budget here we estimate the potential vorticity fig 5b and c defined as f ρ 0 δρ δz where f represents the coriolis force ρ 0 is the mean ocean density and δρ δz is the vertical change in the local density for depths greater than 2 km we find that the mean state potential vorticity is larger in models with a larger moclc decreasing trend black dots and smaller for models with weaker moclc decreasing trends in short a weaker deep ocean stratification sustained over the 60 year core ii period reduces the weakening of the lower overturning circulation further the observational estimates for the present day climate blue and cyan dashed lines in fig 5b lie in the weakly stratified low pv values despite a fairly coherent result regarding the moc trends and density and stratification illustrated in figs 4 and 5 we do note some exceptions the moclc decadal trend in the ictp model is large 1 1 sv decade even though this model shows a low potential vorticity conversely the nocs model which falls clearly in the large moclc category also exhibits a cool 1 2 km temperature bias in the mean state these discrepancies as well as those in the bergen and kiel05 models for the mocuc results may be due to a number of reasons such as sea ice variability chosen vertical coordinates grid resolution and possible biases arising from averaging in our estimates the question remains as to how this stronger or weaker deep ocean stratification is developed and maintained we find that temperature biases within the intermediate water mass layers approximately 1 to 2 km are reflected in the deep ocean potential vorticity a warm bias in the mean state across mid to high latitudes black curves compared with observations is found in models where the deep ocean stratification is stronger and the decreasing trend in the moclc is larger in magnitude fig 5d variations in temperature in the 1 to 2 km depth range also influences deep ocean stratification and the overturning circulation there is a cool bias with temperature cooling negative fig 5d and e across low and mid latitudes for the models with a weaker moclc trend magenta curves and warm bias and warming for models with a larger moclc decadal trend black curves similarly salinity has an increasing trend for models with a smaller moclc decadal trend for the 1 to 2 km depth range with little distinction across models for depths lower and higher than this range figure not shown thus the cooling and increasing salinity trends in the 1 to 2 km range are associated with the stratification below 2 km over the 60 year core ii period 3 2 3 water mass transformation whilst eddies play a role in the upper ocean stratification in the 1 to 2 km depth range fig 4d we must also consider the formation processes at the ocean surface contributing to intermediate waters that are exported in this depth range the surface heat and freshwater fluxes in the core ii models are influenced by the individual model surface temperature and salt and sea ice downes et al 2015 showed that the zonal mean surface heat fluxes varied substantially in sign across southern ocean latitudes see their fig 3 in fig 6 we illustrate the conversion of southern ocean water mass classes south of 30 s that results from monthly changes in the surface heat and freshwater flux input into the first model ocean layer a negative water mass transformation wmt rate implies the water mass in a particular density class has a buoyancy gain in its outcrop density range and is transformed to a lighter density class deep waters that upwell to the surface in the southern ocean around 1035 5 1036 5 kg m 3 are transformed into lighter intermediate waters via buoyancy gain in particular the models with a larger moclc decadal trend black dots fig 5a have a greater transformation rate from deep waters to lighter densities due to surface heat fluxes fig 6a and c in short the upwelled deep waters in these models are becoming warmer as they transform to intermediate waters thus models with a larger decreasing moclc trend also have warmer water subducted into their 1 2 km depth range also shown in fig 5 lower panels that strengthens deep ocean stratification further the surface water mass transformation due to oceanic heat gain doubles by the end of the 60 year core ii period compare panels a and c in fig 6 we did not find any distinct differences between the black and magenta models for the freshwater based surface water mass transformation fig 6b and d we also look at how these surface wmt terms change over the core ii period fig 6e and f we find that both heat and freshwater fluxes change similarly across the core ii models and this temporal change is not associated with the magnitude of the moclc decadal trends in fig 5a thus it is the difference in the surface heat wmt contribution in the models in the mean state and not its temporal evolution that is associated with trends in the lower overturning circulation further the largest heat and freshwater fluxes changes occur in the deep water density range 1036 σ 2 1037 1 kg m 3 fig 6e and f which corresponds with the density range where we find the largest equatorward shift in outcropping isopycnals fig 7 this density range also coincides with the latitudinal region where wind stress increases are largest as the westerly the winds intensify and shift polewards over the core ii period fig 1b in summary surface heat fluxes influence the intermediate ocean temperature and water column stratification with differences in surface heat and freshwater fluxes across the models being largest over intermediate and deep water mass ranges where the surface wind stress changes are largest 4 summary and discussion representation of southern ocean large scale circulation features range widely in multi model studies making it difficult to extract key circulation trends and associated mechanisms such as wind stress and buoyancy fluxes here we evaluate key southern ocean metrics across a major multi model effort namely core ii using the 1948 2007 timeseries the advantage of using the core ii models in this analysis is that their coherent poleward intensification of the westerly winds allows us to somewhat isolate the role of surface buoyancy fluxes and stratification on overturning circulation trends the poleward intensification of the westerly winds steepens isopycnals in the acc region particularly over the region where deep waters upwell however surface warming and a large eddy induced overturning circulation combat this steeper isopycnal gradient our main results are summarised as two scenarios in fig 8 in brief the configuration of the eddy parameterisation and the ocean density field are strongly linked with the magnitude of the moc trends on decadal timescales the fig 8 upper panel represents models with weak upper stratification and strong deep stratification in the southern ocean models that behave in this way generally have a 1d or 2d eddy parameterisation and thus a smaller mocgm associated with larger trends in the mocuc however eddies alone do not account for the stratification patterns over the entire water column the surface heat fluxes at the junction where deep waters are upwelled in the southern ocean and transformed into lighter intermediate waters are associated with the temperature field at intermediate depths in the ocean interior and this can also alter the ocean stratification models with a larger heat driven surface water mass transformation at the deep water intermediate water junction have a warmer intermediate ocean layer 1 to 2 km the weak upper ocean stratification enables the poleward intensification of the westerly winds to maximise its influence on increasing the upper overturning circulation further this warmer intermediate layer creates a stronger stratification in the deep ocean below 2 km models with a stronger deep ocean stratification exhibit a greater sensitivity of the moclc to surface forcing presumably because the stratification more effectively impedes vertical transport four of the models access bergen mri and nocs show both a larger decadal increasing trend in the mocuc and a larger decadal decreasing trend in the moclc conversely in the alternative scenario fig 8 lower panel models with weak heat driven surface transformation and a cooler intermediate ocean layer in the mean state exhibit a smaller decadal decreasing trend in the moclc in the upper ocean a stronger stratification and a more complex 3d eddy parameterisation i e a larger mocgm are associated with smaller increases in the mocuc on decadal timescales four of the six models cmcc gold kiel05 and ncar with a weaker decreasing moclc trend also show a weaker mocuc trend we note that improving the configuration of eddy parameterisation alone does not produce a more realistic ocean stratification however the lower panel of fig 8 does contain both a larger eddy contribution to the upper moc and a weaker deep ocean stratification that is more aligned with observations see fig 5 compared to the upper panel scenario this study offers new insights into how large scale moc metrics are linked to eddies and stratification in a multi model analyses but there are of course caveats firstly we are assessing metrics from a zonal mean perspective however oceanic and atmospheric features are zonally asymmetric and this regional variation is not taken into account here though we note that those conducting large scale multi model analyses usually have neither the time or model output storage capabilities to produce analyses that compares extensive regional detail across multiple models further we have focused here on metrics influencing the overturning circulation that are readily discussed and published making our results easily testable in future model simulations the 300 year core ii period is too short for the deep ocean to reach a thermodynamic equilibrium and thus we expect minor deep ocean drift in the final cycle analysed however farneti et al 2015 has shown that large scale southern ocean circulation trends are persistent within each 60 year cycle here we analyse twelve models coupled to a common atmospheric state whereas other recent multi model efforts such as cmip5 have fully coupled climate model contributions in these types of models there is a two way flux of ocean and atmosphere variables that is the ocean can influence the atmospheric state further fully coupled model comparisons have revealed a large spread in wind stress position and strength making it near impossible to isolate the influence of wind stress versus buoyancy fluxes in an evolving climate whether our results hold in a fully coupled multi model comparison is yet to be tested particularly due to the shortage of cmip5 models that archive the overturning circulation in density space nonetheless using a multi model effort with a common but varying atmospheric state such as core ii allows for some control over how many variables and model components change over time the main conclusion of this study is that model biases in the mean and varying states of temperature salinity surface buoyancy fluxes and configuration of the eddy parameterisation in coarse resolution models influence the sensitivity of the upper and lower overturning circulation cells our results are not impacted by the spread of moc transports in the mean state nor the model vertical grid resolution for future multi model efforts we suggest that the temporal evolution of the eddy circulation surface buoyancy fluxes and interior ocean density biases be a key focus as a mechanism for overturning circulation changes acknowledgments the authors wish to thank r farneti for

24128,the current generation of climate models exhibit a large spread in the steady state and projected southern ocean upper and lower overturning circulation with mechanisms for deep ocean variability remaining less well understood here common southern ocean metrics in twelve models from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiment phase ii core ii are assessed over a 60 year period specifically stratification surface buoyancy fluxes and eddies are linked to the magnitude of the strengthening trend in the upper overturning circulation and a decreasing trend in the lower overturning circulation across the core ii models the models evolve similarly in the upper 1 km and the deep ocean with an almost equivalent poleward intensification trend in the southern hemisphere westerly winds however the models differ substantially in their eddy parameterisation and surface buoyancy fluxes in general models with a larger heat driven water mass transformation where deep waters upwell at the surface 55 s transport warmer waters into intermediate depths thus weakening the stratification in the upper 2 km models with a weak eddy induced overturning and a warm bias in the intermediate waters are more likely to exhibit larger increases in the upper overturning circulation and more significant weakening of the lower overturning circulation we find the opposite holds for a cool model bias in intermediate depths combined with a more complex 3d eddy parameterisation that acts to reduce isopycnal slope in summary the southern ocean overturning circulation decadal trends in the coarse resolution core ii models are governed by biases in surface buoyancy fluxes and the ocean density field and the configuration of the eddy parameterisation keywords core ii models meridional overturning circulation southern ocean eddy parameterisation ocean stratification water mass transformation 1 introduction southern ocean water masses are connected via the upper and lower meridional overturning circulation moc cells and the antarctic circumpolar current acc in a southern ocean zonal mean view the upper cell of the moc is driven by the upwelling of northern sourced deep waters and northward surface ekman transport speer et al 2000 the lower moc flows in the opposite direction comprised of upwelled waters made denser by sea ice and mixing process along the antarctic margin and of northward southern ocean abyssal flows the strength of the acc is linked to both the upper ocean meridional density gradient across it and the wind stress imparted upon the ocean surface russell et al 2006 boning et al 2008 meijers et al 2012 rintoul and naveira garabato 2013 farneti et al 2015 the acc transport and the residual or total transport of the upper moc cell are generally thought to be enhanced by the poleward shift and intensification of the southern hemisphere westerlies morrison and hogg 2013 farneti et al 2010 gent and danabasoglu 2011 sijp and england 2009 saenko et al 2012 hogg et al 2017 eddies also play a large role in counteracting the influence of winds more so for the acc than the moc morrison and hogg 2013 however spatially and temporally biased observations and modelling capabilities and parameterisations inhibit our understanding of the long term variability of these circulation systems multi model analyses have been used for over a decade to elucidate major long term trends in the earth s climate system whilst the mean across multi model studies is often in good agreement with observations in variables such as winds surface temperature and radiative fluxes and precipitation gleckler et al 2008 the inter model spread is vast sparse spatiotemporal observational data can contribute to model spread in circulation magnitudes for example farneti et al 2015 showed that the transport of the upper moc across models is in far better agreement with observationally based estimates than the lower moc likely due to a denser distribution of observational data available within the upper 2 km of the ocean used to support model constraints the southern ocean overturning circulation upper and lower branches are connected by the incoming deep waters that upwell within the acc region and transport temperature anomalies and the oceanic response of climate forcing on decadal to centennial timescales armour et al 2016 however multi model efforts such as the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments phase ii core ii danabasoglu et al 2014 have revealed major differences and biases in the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics contributing to the meridional overturning circulation that limit our understanding of the temporally evolving climate system for example whilst the mean acc transport in core ii models 150 3 42 7 sv where 1 sv equates to 106 m3 s 1 farneti et al 2015 agrees well with the long standing observational estimates approximately 135 sv cunningham et al 2003 chidichimo et al 2014 the model spread is around 50 sv further the most recent observational estimate for acc transport is 175 sv donohue et al 2016 providing a new target for models to attain biases in sea ice that contribute to the freshwater fluxes for antarctic bottom water formation remain poorly understood with models failing to capture the sign and magnitude of antarctic trends mahlstein et al 2013 downes et al 2015 shu et al 2015 this study offers a new insight into the spread in overturning circulation across core ii climate models for the mean and varied states the core ii effort is comprised of coupled ocean sea ice models forced by a common atmospheric state for the 1948 2007 period large and yeager 2009 the coherent atmospheric state converted to surface fluxes using bulk formulae is particularly advantageous in that influences of large scale circulation such as wind stress are very similar across the core ii models for example the southern hemisphere westerly wind stress differs by no more than 10 in strength and less than 1 in latitude in position farneti et al 2015 yet the ocean circulation differs across the core ii models due principally to model dynamics the coupling of the core ii surface fields of wind speed humidity surface air temperature and radiative fluxes to the ocean and sea ice models leads to a large spread in the magnitude of the variability in large scale circulation downes et al 2015 assessed the twelve core ii models presented here and found that the latitudinal position whereby the mid latitude heat gain switched to high latitude heat loss varied by more than 10 and farneti et al 2015 showed a similar result for the decadal trend in surface heat fluxes the mean state surface heat flux distribution contributes to the mid latitude deep winter mixed layers which varied by more than 150 m across the core ii models and directly influences the rate of subduction of upper ocean water masses downes et al 2015 in addition there were significant differences in the ocean temperature and salinity biases the pattern of weddell sea deep convection and the sea ice extent that all contribute to the lower overturning circulation and the formation of antarctic bottom water farneti et al 2015 found that the eddy induced overturning circulation ranged by more than 6 sv more than half the magnitude of the model mean across 17 core ii models due to the differing parameterisation of the eddy mixing scheme with a 4 8 to 18 2 sv range in the associated total upper branch of the moc downes et al 2015 and farneti et al 2015 conducted extensive analyses on southern ocean water mass sea ice and large scale circulation processes in the core ii models focusing particularly on the 1988 2007 period here we expand upon these analyses by evaluating the inter model differences and biases that lead to the large spread in overturning circulation trends over the 1948 2007 period wind stress and buoyancy are known drivers of the ocean s large scale circulation the very similar trend in wind stress strength and position across the core ii models farneti et al 2015 provides an opportunity to focus on the surface buoyancy and interior density model fields as mechanisms for changes in overturning circulation however we must also consider the eddy contribution to changes given that each model employs its own version of an eddy advection scheme which can drastically affect the model response to surface forcings gent and danabasoglu 2011 farneti et al 2015 this is the first study to our knowledge that associates decadal upper and lower overturning circulation trends with model biases in density and stratification and eddy parameterisation configuration in section 2 we briefly outline model features of the twelve core ii models assessed and the common metrics we use in this study we describe the mean and temporal evolution of the upper and lower moc and its association with model buoyancy and density biases in section 3 including an analysis of the relationship between the moc density and the westerly wind stress we summarise and discuss our findings in section 4 2 models and methods 2 1 the core ii models we use 12 models from the core ii effort that are described in danabasoglu et al 2014 downes et al 2015 and farneti et al 2015 namely access awi bergen cmcc gold ictp kiel05 mom mom025 mri ncar and nocs the 12 models features are detailed in table 1 and we provide a brief overview here almost all of the models have a coarse resolution grid with approximately 1 horizontal spacing exceptions are the mom025 and kiel05 models that have a 1 4 and 1 2 horizontal grid respectively and ictp has a 2 horizontal resolution the models have between 30 and 75 vertical levels mesoscale circulation is parameterised using a 1 2 or 3 dimensional eddy diffusivity coefficient table 1 based on the gent and mcwilliams 1990 scheme that impacts the strength of the eddy induced overturning circulation and the extent to which the eddy overturning compensates variability in the eulerian mean circulation note that the eddy permitting mom025 model does not use an eddy parameterisation all the models are coupled to a sea ice model the inter annually varying atmospheric state used in the twelve core ii models large and yeager 2009 provides common atmospheric surface temperature wind speed humidity and radiative fluxes for 1948 2007 the core ii models are simulated for 300 years five 60 year core forced cycles and we assess the final cycle here trends in large scale transports have been shown to remain consistent across each the 60 year cycles e g see fig 22 in farneti et al 2015 we note that our conclusions for at least the upper overturning circulation hold regardless of whether we use the full 60 year core ii output or whether we disregard the first decade after which the model has equilibrated to the new cycle using periods less than 50 years are not ideal for distinguishing models with a smaller or larger magnitude in the moc decadal trends for ocean interior variables we compare the core ii models to two versions of the world ocean atlas woa climatologies woa09 locarnini et al 2010 antonov et al 2010 and woa13 version 2 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 the former has been produced on a 1 grid with 33 vertical levels whilst the woa13 climatology includes an additional decade of climatology data compared to woa09 and is available on a 1 4 grid with 102 vertical levels 2 2 definitions and calculations in this study the moc is defined as the zonal integration and vertical cumulative sum in depth or density space of the meridional velocity the upper and lower overturning circulation here is the combination of the eddy induced and eulerian mean circulations known as the residual or total circulation trends and changes in the moc cell strengths used throughout the study are based on calculations using absolute values that is a positive trend will indicate increases and negative values for decreases our moc results are presented in density coordinates referenced to 2 km with units in sv the moc in the classic depth coordinate does not equate to the same as the more natural density coordinates e g döös and webb 1994 and future changes in the moc in depth and density space differ in sign and magnitude downes and hogg 2013 the upper cell in density coordinates mocuc clockwise directed positively signed is defined as the maximum strength in the density range 1035 σ 2 1036 5 kg m 3 between 60 s and 30 s the lower cell in density coordinates moclc counter clockwise directed negatively signed is defined as the absolute maximum strength in the density range 1036 5 σ 2 1037 5 kg m 3 between 60 s and 30 s we restrict the southern boundary of our moclc definition at 60 s because we do not want to confuse its trend with that of the subpolar cell in the same density range the eddy induced overturning circulation in density space mocgm has more than one maxima in the southern ocean in several models farneti et al 2015 see their fig 18 thus we average the eddy contribution to the moc across a range of densities farneti et al 2015 showed that the time mean averaged mocgm was associated with the eddy induced advection coefficient used in the eddy parametrisation scheme see their fig 21 we follow the definition used in farneti et al 2015 where the mocgm is averaged over the density range 1034 5 σ 2 1037 5 kg m 3 and latitude range of 70 s 35 s note that the mocgm flows in the same direction as the moclc and flows across both the lower and upper moc density ranges saenko et al 2012 the mom025 model excludes an eddy parameterisation and the gold model did not archive the eddy contribution these models are highlighted by an asterisk in figures where we illustrate mocgm diagnostics given that the core ii models are coupled to a common atmospheric state we pay particular focus to the surface and interior density related properties that may alter the large scale circulation we use the surface water mass transformation wmt diagnostics estimated in downes et al 2015 see their figs 14 and 15 and first introduced in walin 1982 to show how atmosphere ocean surface buoyancy fluxes of heat and freshwater combine to alter the surface density the surface transformation is an integration over the entire water mass outcrop region bounded by ρk and ρ k 1 where ρ k 1 ρ k and is estimated as following downes et al 2011 2015 1 f ρ k 1 ρ k 1 ρ k a α q n e t c p d a 1 ρ k 1 ρ k a ρ 0 β s f w n e t d a there are two main terms in the surface water mass transformation estimate the first represents the transformation due to the net heat flux into the ocean qnet and its associated thermal expansion and heat capacity coefficients α and cp respectively the second term represents the net freshwater flux into the ocean fwnet including precipitation evaporation run off and sea ice melt and associated haline contraction coefficient β surface salinity s and reference ocean density taken here to be ρ 0 1035 kg m 3 positive transformation rates indicate where lighter water masses are converted to denser layers associated with surface buoyancy loss and negative rates with conversion to lower densities due to surface buoyancy gain 3 results 3 1 the mean state of the moc we begin by describing the mean state of the density wind stress and overturning circulation to help orient the reader and then link these mean states to decadal variability in the moc all density and overturning circulation diagnostics are calculated online and archived as monthly means the zonal mean ocean density is very similar for the upper kilometre of the ocean in the core ii models downes et al 2015 given that the models are forced by the same atmospheric state by the end of the 60 year core ii analysis period the isopycnals have deepened in the southern ocean interior north of 60 s consistent with warming and freshening trends and shoal south of 60 s fig 1 a the strong westerly winds that steepen isopycnals and act to strengthen the eulerian upper overturning circulation increase by approximately 30 in its maximum strength and shift poleward by 3 to around 54 latitude by 2007 fig 1b see also fig 2 in farneti et al 2015 3 1 1 the upper and eddy induced overturning cells the southern ocean moc in density space is comprised of an upper cell in the 60 30 s latitude range and at higher densities the lower cell flowing in the opposite direction fig 2 c f farneti et al 2015 the residual moc is comprised of the eulerian and eddy induced circulation the latter being distributed in density space across both the upper and lower overturning cells the maximum strength of the net upper and lower moc and the average eddy induced moc over the southern ocean are illustrated in fig 3 the core ii model mean that is the average of all twelve models is in good agreement with observationally based mocuc estimates of approximately 12 sv lumpkin and speer 2007 with considerable spread across the individual models fig 3a models with a larger mocuc are those with the upper cell extending across larger density ranges and latitudes specifically the access awi cmcc kiel mom mom025 and mri models see where the upper cell extends south of 60 s in these models in fig 2 farneti et al 2015 showed that models with a more complex three dimensional eddy parameterisation awi bergen and ncar produced a larger eddy contribution to the moc red circles in fig 3b however among the models with a two dimensional depth independent eddy parameterisation several have a large range for the eddy advection coefficient that extends up to 5000 m2 s 1 cmcc ictp kiel05 and nocs this extended coefficient range also increases the magnitude of the eddy induced overturning circulation conversely a one dimensional eddy parameterisation or two dimensional eddy parametrisation with a smaller advection coefficient range i e up to 1000 m2 s 1 produces a small eddy induced overturning blue circles in fig 3b 3 1 2 the lower overturning cell in climate models the deep ocean is one of the most poorly represented ocean regions primarily due to sparse observations coarse model vertical grid resolution and mesoscale parameterisations that are fixed or depth time independent the lower overturning circulation in density space moclc varies considerably across climate models downes and hogg 2013 farneti et al 2015 linked to ocean temperature and salinity biases throughout the water column heuzé et al 2013 wang et al 2011 here moclc in the final 20 years of each experiment varies from 5 sv in the eddy permitting mom025 model to 22 sv in gold fig 3c most of the moclc estimates are lower than observationally based estimates 16 29 sv lumpkin and speer 2007 talley 2013 models with weak moclc can have a strong mocuc e g kiel05 mom025 and mri and vice versa e g bergen and gold and nocs to the south of the lower moc lies a subpolar cell that is driven by convection and sea ice variability fig 2 we find that this subpolar cell is significantly correlated to the strength of the lower cell moclc in eight of the twelve core ii models over the 60 year period figure not shown however we were unable to find a distinct link between variability in polar seas and that in the lower moc cell due to the large spread in convection rates and patterns for example the moclc consistently decreases but there is no consistent trend in the weddell sea mixed layer depth an indicator of deep water formation thus the subpolar cell does not likely contribute to the decreasing trend in the moclc and we focus on understanding the coherent model trends in the lower and upper moc between 30 s and 60 s 3 2 temporal variability of the moc 3 2 1 the upper overturning cell here we examine decadal variability in the overturning circulation as a function of the model and varying surface buoyancy fluxes stratification and eddy parametrisation we begin with the upper ocean density variability in the latitude range 60 30 s where the mocuc is defined in the core ii models the mocuc increases by 0 1 to 1 6 sv decade fig 4a with the lowest trends found in the awi cmcc gold mom025 and ncar models in the mean state these five models and kiel05 have a stronger vertical density gradient north of the wind stress maximum that is evident across the 60 year core ii period fig 4b and c that is the density difference between the 0 1 km and 1 2 km depth ranges is greater in these models and thus the stratification is stronger this stronger upper ocean stratification maintained by surface warming and freshening see figs 10 12 in farneti et al 2015 is associated with weak winter mixed layer trends in the same region see fig 22 in downes et al 2015 we note that the density in the 0 1 km range is very similar across the models thus it is the density in 1 2 km that dominates the density differences in fig 4b and c the core ii models have a vertical density gradient that spans observational estimates from both the woa09 and woa13 climatologies it is interesting to note that the woa13 observational climatology lies within the upper density gradient range of the models with a weak mocuc decadal trend red however the earlier woa09 version lies within the range of models that exhibit a larger mocuc trend blue we also note some exceptions to the model results the mocuc decadal trend in the kiel05 model is large despite this model having a higher vertical density gradient further the bergen model has a mocuc decadal trend that is mid range 1 sv decade fig 4 a smaller vertical density gradient but a higher eddy induced overturning circulation fig 3b the choice of eddy parameterisation influences upper ocean density by reducing the isopycnal slope and thus increasing the density difference between the 0 1 km and 1 2 km depth ranges we find that the models with a 3d eddy parameterisation awi bergen and ncar are among the models with a smaller decadal trend in the mocuc of under 1 2 sv decade mostly red circles in fig 4a in contrast models with a 1d or 2d eddy parameterisation blue circles e g access ictp mom mri and nocs tend to have a smaller eddy induced overturning circulation fig 3b but a larger trend fig 4a our upper moc cell results are in agreement with previous studies that show the eddy induced circulation reduces the influence of the poleward intensifying wind stress fig 1b on the residual mocuc see also for example saenko et al 2012 farneti et al 2015 gent 2016 chapman and sallée 2017 marshall et al 2017 in fig 4d we evaluate the relationship between the vertical density change in the upper 2 km in the acc region and the average strength of the eddy induced overturning circulation within the 65 53 s latitude range south of the wind stress maximum displayed in the fig 4d we find a significant correlation between eddy induced overturning and the upper ocean vertical density gradient r 0 58 models with a weak mocuc decadal trend including some of which have a more complex 3d eddy parameterisation awi bergen and ncar have a larger density gradient and vice versa for the larger mocuc trends however we do not find a strong correlation between the eddy induced overturning circulation averaged over the core ii period and the vertical density gradient in the region north of the wind stress maximum r 0 28 53 40 s figure not shown thus the eddy overturning circulation is most influential in the upwelling region of the acc 3 2 2 the lower overturning cell whilst the mocuc increases coherently across the twelve models the moclc coherently decreases consistent with recent deep ocean temperature salinity and volume trends purkey and johnson 2012 the moclc decreases by 0 5 1 7 sv per decade across the twelve models fig 5a with the largest trend in the bergen mom025 mri and nocs models followed by the access awi and ictp models close to 1 sv decade we note that four of the six models with a weaker moclc trend namely cmcc gold kiel05 and ncar also have a weaker mocuc trend a stronger upper ocean density gradient fig 4 and a more complex three dimensional or no eddy parameterisation fig 3 whilst the sign of the moclc trend is coherent the variations in magnitude can be understood by again looking at the ocean interior density properties the moclc is prominent at densities greater than 1036 9 kg m 3 fig 2 which is in the depth range greater than 2 km for the regions approximately bound by 40 s and 40 n fig 1a spence et al 2014 showed that changes in the moclc due to wind stress variability can be attributed to the density components of the potential vorticity budget here we estimate the potential vorticity fig 5b and c defined as f ρ 0 δρ δz where f represents the coriolis force ρ 0 is the mean ocean density and δρ δz is the vertical change in the local density for depths greater than 2 km we find that the mean state potential vorticity is larger in models with a larger moclc decreasing trend black dots and smaller for models with weaker moclc decreasing trends in short a weaker deep ocean stratification sustained over the 60 year core ii period reduces the weakening of the lower overturning circulation further the observational estimates for the present day climate blue and cyan dashed lines in fig 5b lie in the weakly stratified low pv values despite a fairly coherent result regarding the moc trends and density and stratification illustrated in figs 4 and 5 we do note some exceptions the moclc decadal trend in the ictp model is large 1 1 sv decade even though this model shows a low potential vorticity conversely the nocs model which falls clearly in the large moclc category also exhibits a cool 1 2 km temperature bias in the mean state these discrepancies as well as those in the bergen and kiel05 models for the mocuc results may be due to a number of reasons such as sea ice variability chosen vertical coordinates grid resolution and possible biases arising from averaging in our estimates the question remains as to how this stronger or weaker deep ocean stratification is developed and maintained we find that temperature biases within the intermediate water mass layers approximately 1 to 2 km are reflected in the deep ocean potential vorticity a warm bias in the mean state across mid to high latitudes black curves compared with observations is found in models where the deep ocean stratification is stronger and the decreasing trend in the moclc is larger in magnitude fig 5d variations in temperature in the 1 to 2 km depth range also influences deep ocean stratification and the overturning circulation there is a cool bias with temperature cooling negative fig 5d and e across low and mid latitudes for the models with a weaker moclc trend magenta curves and warm bias and warming for models with a larger moclc decadal trend black curves similarly salinity has an increasing trend for models with a smaller moclc decadal trend for the 1 to 2 km depth range with little distinction across models for depths lower and higher than this range figure not shown thus the cooling and increasing salinity trends in the 1 to 2 km range are associated with the stratification below 2 km over the 60 year core ii period 3 2 3 water mass transformation whilst eddies play a role in the upper ocean stratification in the 1 to 2 km depth range fig 4d we must also consider the formation processes at the ocean surface contributing to intermediate waters that are exported in this depth range the surface heat and freshwater fluxes in the core ii models are influenced by the individual model surface temperature and salt and sea ice downes et al 2015 showed that the zonal mean surface heat fluxes varied substantially in sign across southern ocean latitudes see their fig 3 in fig 6 we illustrate the conversion of southern ocean water mass classes south of 30 s that results from monthly changes in the surface heat and freshwater flux input into the first model ocean layer a negative water mass transformation wmt rate implies the water mass in a particular density class has a buoyancy gain in its outcrop density range and is transformed to a lighter density class deep waters that upwell to the surface in the southern ocean around 1035 5 1036 5 kg m 3 are transformed into lighter intermediate waters via buoyancy gain in particular the models with a larger moclc decadal trend black dots fig 5a have a greater transformation rate from deep waters to lighter densities due to surface heat fluxes fig 6a and c in short the upwelled deep waters in these models are becoming warmer as they transform to intermediate waters thus models with a larger decreasing moclc trend also have warmer water subducted into their 1 2 km depth range also shown in fig 5 lower panels that strengthens deep ocean stratification further the surface water mass transformation due to oceanic heat gain doubles by the end of the 60 year core ii period compare panels a and c in fig 6 we did not find any distinct differences between the black and magenta models for the freshwater based surface water mass transformation fig 6b and d we also look at how these surface wmt terms change over the core ii period fig 6e and f we find that both heat and freshwater fluxes change similarly across the core ii models and this temporal change is not associated with the magnitude of the moclc decadal trends in fig 5a thus it is the difference in the surface heat wmt contribution in the models in the mean state and not its temporal evolution that is associated with trends in the lower overturning circulation further the largest heat and freshwater fluxes changes occur in the deep water density range 1036 σ 2 1037 1 kg m 3 fig 6e and f which corresponds with the density range where we find the largest equatorward shift in outcropping isopycnals fig 7 this density range also coincides with the latitudinal region where wind stress increases are largest as the westerly the winds intensify and shift polewards over the core ii period fig 1b in summary surface heat fluxes influence the intermediate ocean temperature and water column stratification with differences in surface heat and freshwater fluxes across the models being largest over intermediate and deep water mass ranges where the surface wind stress changes are largest 4 summary and discussion representation of southern ocean large scale circulation features range widely in multi model studies making it difficult to extract key circulation trends and associated mechanisms such as wind stress and buoyancy fluxes here we evaluate key southern ocean metrics across a major multi model effort namely core ii using the 1948 2007 timeseries the advantage of using the core ii models in this analysis is that their coherent poleward intensification of the westerly winds allows us to somewhat isolate the role of surface buoyancy fluxes and stratification on overturning circulation trends the poleward intensification of the westerly winds steepens isopycnals in the acc region particularly over the region where deep waters upwell however surface warming and a large eddy induced overturning circulation combat this steeper isopycnal gradient our main results are summarised as two scenarios in fig 8 in brief the configuration of the eddy parameterisation and the ocean density field are strongly linked with the magnitude of the moc trends on decadal timescales the fig 8 upper panel represents models with weak upper stratification and strong deep stratification in the southern ocean models that behave in this way generally have a 1d or 2d eddy parameterisation and thus a smaller mocgm associated with larger trends in the mocuc however eddies alone do not account for the stratification patterns over the entire water column the surface heat fluxes at the junction where deep waters are upwelled in the southern ocean and transformed into lighter intermediate waters are associated with the temperature field at intermediate depths in the ocean interior and this can also alter the ocean stratification models with a larger heat driven surface water mass transformation at the deep water intermediate water junction have a warmer intermediate ocean layer 1 to 2 km the weak upper ocean stratification enables the poleward intensification of the westerly winds to maximise its influence on increasing the upper overturning circulation further this warmer intermediate layer creates a stronger stratification in the deep ocean below 2 km models with a stronger deep ocean stratification exhibit a greater sensitivity of the moclc to surface forcing presumably because the stratification more effectively impedes vertical transport four of the models access bergen mri and nocs show both a larger decadal increasing trend in the mocuc and a larger decadal decreasing trend in the moclc conversely in the alternative scenario fig 8 lower panel models with weak heat driven surface transformation and a cooler intermediate ocean layer in the mean state exhibit a smaller decadal decreasing trend in the moclc in the upper ocean a stronger stratification and a more complex 3d eddy parameterisation i e a larger mocgm are associated with smaller increases in the mocuc on decadal timescales four of the six models cmcc gold kiel05 and ncar with a weaker decreasing moclc trend also show a weaker mocuc trend we note that improving the configuration of eddy parameterisation alone does not produce a more realistic ocean stratification however the lower panel of fig 8 does contain both a larger eddy contribution to the upper moc and a weaker deep ocean stratification that is more aligned with observations see fig 5 compared to the upper panel scenario this study offers new insights into how large scale moc metrics are linked to eddies and stratification in a multi model analyses but there are of course caveats firstly we are assessing metrics from a zonal mean perspective however oceanic and atmospheric features are zonally asymmetric and this regional variation is not taken into account here though we note that those conducting large scale multi model analyses usually have neither the time or model output storage capabilities to produce analyses that compares extensive regional detail across multiple models further we have focused here on metrics influencing the overturning circulation that are readily discussed and published making our results easily testable in future model simulations the 300 year core ii period is too short for the deep ocean to reach a thermodynamic equilibrium and thus we expect minor deep ocean drift in the final cycle analysed however farneti et al 2015 has shown that large scale southern ocean circulation trends are persistent within each 60 year cycle here we analyse twelve models coupled to a common atmospheric state whereas other recent multi model efforts such as cmip5 have fully coupled climate model contributions in these types of models there is a two way flux of ocean and atmosphere variables that is the ocean can influence the atmospheric state further fully coupled model comparisons have revealed a large spread in wind stress position and strength making it near impossible to isolate the influence of wind stress versus buoyancy fluxes in an evolving climate whether our results hold in a fully coupled multi model comparison is yet to be tested particularly due to the shortage of cmip5 models that archive the overturning circulation in density space nonetheless using a multi model effort with a common but varying atmospheric state such as core ii allows for some control over how many variables and model components change over time the main conclusion of this study is that model biases in the mean and varying states of temperature salinity surface buoyancy fluxes and configuration of the eddy parameterisation in coarse resolution models influence the sensitivity of the upper and lower overturning circulation cells our results are not impacted by the spread of moc transports in the mean state nor the model vertical grid resolution for future multi model efforts we suggest that the temporal evolution of the eddy circulation surface buoyancy fluxes and interior ocean density biases be a key focus as a mechanism for overturning circulation changes acknowledgments the authors wish to thank r farneti for

24129,in the tidal ebb cycle at the mouth of the columbia river strong density and velocity fronts sometimes form perpendicular to the coast at the edges of the freshwater plume they are distinct from previously analyzed fronts at the offshore western edge of the plume that evolve as a gravity wave bore we present simulation results to demonstrate their occurrence and investigate the mechanisms behind their frontogenesis and evolution tidal velocities on average ranged between 1 5 m s 1 in flood and 2 5 m s 1 in ebb during the brief hindcast period the tidal fronts exhibit strong horizontal velocity and buoyancy gradients on a scale 100 m in width with normalized relative vorticity ζz f values reaching up to 50 we specifically focus on the front on the northern edge of the plume and examine the evolution in plume characteristics such as its water mass gradients horizontal and vertical velocity structure vertical velocity turbulent vertical mixing horizontal propagation cross front momentum balance and lagrangian frontogenetic tendencies in both buoyancy and velocity gradients advective frontogenesis leads to a very sharp front where lateral mixing near the grid resolution limit arrests its further contraction the negative vorticity within the front is initiated by the positive bottom drag curl on the north side of the columbia estuary and against the north jetty because of the large negative vorticity and horizontal vorticity gradient centrifugal and lateral shear instability begins to develop along the front but frontal fragmentation and decay set in only after the turn of the tide because of the briefness of the ebb interval keywords columbia river advective plume front roms ocean modeling 1 introduction the columbia river is a large tidally pulsed river located in the pacific northwest between washington and oregon its mean monthly discharge varies between 3500 m3 s 1 and 10 000 m3 s 1 during the last 10 years based on the usgs beaver army terminal quincy or discharge statistics generating a large freshwater plume many previous studies concerning the mouth of the columbia river have focused on the plume characteristics as it spreads into the ocean for example kilcher and nash 2010 give a detailed analysis of the structure and dynamics of the columbia river plume s western front in terms of frontal speed internal wave speed turbulent mixing and froude number and nash and moum 2005 show that the western front emits large amplitude internal waves as it advances into the ocean in this study we focus instead on the recurrent sharp advective fronts on the northern and southern edges of the plume horner devine et al 2015 is a review of coastal river plumes it divides the river outflow into four regimes progressing offshore the estuarine source the near field jet where the outflow is super critical i e depth averaged current exceeds the internal gravity wave speed the mid field where geostrophic or wind stress influences emerge and the far field where the plume has been transformed into a geostrophic alongshore coastal current the usual dynamical conception for the advancing edge of the plume is as an internal gravity wave accelerated by the freshwater density anomaly and accompanied by strong vertical mixing across the underlying interface garvine 1974 the gravity wave spreading pattern is modeled as radially symmetric about a center moving offshore with the outflow velocity garvine 1984 luketina and imberger 1987 jay et al 2010b near the shore line this would imply a front moving alongshore away from the river source the mid and far field structure can be influenced by a prevailing usually wind driven coastal current e g hickey et al 2005 shows the coastal current from the columbia plume to be bi directional depending on the wind regime orton and jay 2005 and thomson et al 2014 examine the enhanced turbulence and mixing at the western plume front fronts are defined by sharp horizontal

outcome of horizontal deformation straining or horizontal convergence acting on an initial horizontal buoyancy gradient pettersen 1936 hoskins and bretherton 1972 recently it has become evident that the surface ocean is full of fronts with a horizontal size that has come to be called submesoscale with lateral widths 0 1 10 km mcwilliams 2016 their frontogenesis can also occur through convergence

river plume over multiple tidal cycles where the plume exhibits recurrent sharp ebb plume edge fronts that are aligned approximately perpendicular to the coast and propagate only slowly the front s genesis structure and behavior are more similar to advective frontogenesis than to the usual conception of a gravity wave bore at the edge of a river plume although the phenomenon may be a dynamical hybrid of both influences our results are to be taken as experimental with as yet no full theoretical explanation nor field confirmation in the next section we summarize previous modeling studies of the plume and describe the methods used in the present study in section 3 we present a brief general validation of the model solution analyses are then made of the general structure of the plume section 4 the contrasting local structures and propagation speeds of the northern and western plume fronts section 5 and the vertical vorticity generation and frontogenesis processes as well as the onset of a late ebb frontal instability in the northern front section 6 section 7 provides a summary and discussion 2 modeling approach regional modeling of the u s west coast circulation is done with open boundary conditions and stable long term quasi equilibrium behavior e g marchesiello et al 2003 this approach can include the columbia river inflow and tides but at a whole coast scale the desired spatial detail is absent more local attention with finer model grids has been given to the local coastal circulation near the columbia river in a number of studies many of which demonstrate skill through validation with observations maccready et al 2009 mccabe et al 2009 liu et al 2009a b banas et al 2009 burla et al 2010 elias et al 2012 kärnä et al 2016 akan et al 2017 however none has focused on the plume fronts mainly because of insufficient grid resolution out in the plume this is remedied here by using multiple levels of grid nesting we use a hydrostatic model which is the common practice in oceanic circulation modeling this imposes limits on the dynamical validity for some phenomena particularly with respect to short internal gravity waves generated in the plume which are not the main focus of this study most advective phenomena in the ocean on the scale of 100 m or more are approximately hydrostatic and a hydrostatic solution can be assessed a posteriori for its dynamical consistency we return to this issue in section 7 we make simulation hindcasts with the coawst warner et al 2010 modeling system in a 4 level nested grid configuration the horizontal grid resolutions of level 1 level 2 level 3 and level 4 configurations are d x 3 km 1 km 200 m and 40 m respectively the nesting procedure is done offline i e with information transfer only toward finer grids boundary and initial data for these regional configurations is provided by dr alex kurapov using the data assimilation method described in kurapov et al 2011 with this multi level configuration we are able to generate high frequency and high resolution initial and boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing for finer resolution nested grids thus the influences of the larger scale coastal upwelling and downwelling dynamics are incorporated in our level 3 and level 4 simulations the level 3 model d x 200 m simulation is carried out for a 45 day period may 9th through june 15th 2013 this period is chosen to cover a riverine and estuarine transport and data assimilation and remote sensing for littoral applications experimental period rivet ii and darla supported by the u s office of naval research a separate paper specific to another experimental period akan et al 2017 discusses the model configuration and level 3 model results in detail however for the purposes of this study we make a further nest focused on the nearshore plume dynamics in this paper we present results from the d x 40 m resolution model level 4 from june 3 to june 10 2013 this is a period with relatively weaker surface gravity wave hs 2 m and river discharge conditions 8000 m3 s 1 compared to the rest of the rivet ii experimental period but still it is during the seasonal of larger river run off and discharge the oceanic tides in this region are mixed semi diurnal and diurnal with a variation between spring and neap tides the focus period for level 4 integration is not during either of these tidal extremes while the results presented here are specific only to this short interval we expect that similar plume edge frontogenesis will occur frequently in this region in competition with other wind wave and current influences the model grid has 40 vertical terrain following levels shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 fig 1 shows the model domain and topography that is comprised of a blend of the bathymetry used in kassem 2012 and the usgs swath bathymetry gelfenbaum et al 2015 the initial and boundary conditions are obtained from the level 3 resolution solution level 3 model is forced with tidal constituents and realistic river discharge this information is then transferred to level 4 through the boundary conditions clamped boundary condition is used to match the river discharge at the eastern boundary surface air temperature sea level pressure precipitation relative humidity shortwave and longwave radiation and 10 m winds from the d x 1 km resolution model kurapov et al 2011 are

n e 10 m θ s 5 0 and θ b 0 4 the method used for bathymetry smoothing on both levels is explained in akan et al 2017 wetting and drying is not included in level 3 but is included in level 4 all the other setup parameters are the same in both levels a third order upstream advection algorithm which is designed to provide minimal diffusion sufficient to keep the solution smooth near the grid scale is used in roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 to discretize the momentum equation we used the default laplacian formulation of roms for the horizontal mixing of momentum and tracers for vertical mixing the mellor yamada 2 5 mellor and yamada 1982 parameterization scheme is used the level 3 and level 4 models are fully coupled with surface gravity wave effects on currents and the current effect on the waves is based on the asymptotic theory developed by mcwilliams et al 2004 and the model implementation by uchiyama et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 implemented a similar formulation in coawst the coawst model has been widely used in the oceanographic community and it has produced good model observation comparisons in different studies in coastal regions e g kumar et al 2012 olabarrieta et al 2011 further details of the model including more of the specific parameters for this configuration and additional validation tests beyond those in section 3 are reported in akan et al 2017 which is a study of the wave current plume interactions at the mouth of the columbia river 3 model validation before focusing on the plume fronts we present several observational comparisons that establish that the tidal signal near the mouth of the columbia river is reasonably well represented in the simulations for the whole hindcast period on the level 3 grid surface elevation significant wave height currents salinity and temperature were recorded at the different locations marked in fig 1 figs 2 and 3 show the time series comparison between the model results and the observations the latter figure has an expanded time scale to give an orientation to the phase of the tides in particular we will focus below on the ebb period between the high tide at 04 00 at the river mouth and low tide at 10 00 utc on june 3 2013 the peak ebb velocity occurs at 07 30 utc note that observed surface elevation time series are obtained from noaa see http tidesandcurrents noaa

information about availability of the remaining datasets used in this study the signals are dominated by the tides overall good agreement with the observations is seen sea surface elevation η and salinity time series match almost perfectly however the model seems to overestimate the eastward surface velocities for every flood and there are also minor differences in the observed eastward bottom velocity profile at this particular location not shown the latter could be due to the imperfect representation of the bathymetry or due to the choice of bottom friction parameterization quadratic bottom drag was used in the present study and sensitivity tests performed with different drag coefficient values showed insignificant differences in the model observation comparisons however we did not test a bottom drag parameterization that could account for both the current and wave velocities and this could be part of the reason for the differences observed in the bottom velocities the biggest discrepancy is in the temperature record between may 25th and june 3rd 2013 when the observed t shows a very weak tidal signal and it is not as cold following low tide as in the model during other intervals the tidal range and minimum in t are well matched assuming the observations are valid during this period we presume that some unknown event happened that is not captured in the model to evaluate the model performance more quantitatively the statistics used to compare modeled with observed data are the root mean square rms error the bias and a non dimensional skill assessment parameter ms used in elias et al 2012 table 1 shows the model statistics for the time series shown in figs 2 and 3 in general the model skill ms is over 0 85 except for the temperature these statistical skills are similar to other columbia river studies e g liu et al 2009a elias et al 2012 kärnä et al 2016 the modeled significant wave height hs time series at locations 1 and 2 in fig 1 are also included in table 1 and they also compare well with the observations even though we find that the dynamical influences of surface gravity waves on the plume edge front are small in our present simulations section 7 the model skill in hs is an indirect indication of the accuracy of the modeled wind forcing as well as of the wave model itself in akan et al 2017 wave influences are shown to be important for other phenomena we compare the spatial structure of the flow along the plume axis using the velocity profiles obtained from a surface wave instrument float with tracking swift thomson 2012 the swift was released at the beginning of the second ebb cycle on june 3 2013 inside the river mouth and traveled offshore along the path shown with a dashed black line in the top panel of fig 4 the bottom panels show the comparison between the model and the swift observations along that path this comparison is done by extracting the model data closest to the observation path in space and time from fig 4 we can conclude that the instrument seemingly has difficulty in detecting the near bottom velocity and the model slightly overestimates the near surface velocity although in the bulk of the water column the model captures the spatial structure of the velocity field fairly well a different comparison of spatial structure is made in fig 5 between observed ctd profiles within the outer estuary collected by dr rocky geyer whoi and modeled salinity transects along a northward path indicated by the dashed black line in the right panel these data are during early flood conditions on june 7 2013 the model reproduces the overall cross plume distribution of the salinity rather well including the upper fresh layer the bottom saline layer and their interface around z 10 m there are indications of insufficient parameterized vertical mixing in the upper 7 m and perhaps excessive mixing in the bottom 5 m thus we conclude that the model was able reproduce the overall structure of the tidally pulsed plume at least near the mouth and along the plume center as it moves offshore during ebb 4 plume structure over the 11 day hindcast in the level 4 grid section 2 the pattern of the plume is broadly similar over each of the ebb cycles but of course with some variety because of the variable atmospheric and oceanic conditions it should be also noted that river discharge and tidal regime are the key factors determining the plume lift off region the wind during this period is generally moderate and toward the southeast thus favoring coastal upwelling and a southward surface flow that favors a southward turning of the offshore plume the sea level drop and ebb currents are somewhat stronger during one of the two cycles per day fig 3 and in each instance over this period there are well defined edge fronts on both the north and south sides of the plume the northern edge front in particular extends seaward more than 15 km offshore from the northern jet and exhibits only weak northward propagation at a speed that varies among cycles in this paper we will focus on the stronger cycle early on june 3 2013 as a typical instance during this simulation period in fig 6 the surface patterns in salinity s and normalized vertical vorticity ζ z f x v y u f where u v are eastward and northward velocity respectively are shown at early peak and late periods of the cycle as expected the layer of freshwater spreads seaward and is diluted with salty water by mixing from below as it goes along strong density gradients in the frontal zone occur between the light fresh water in the plume and the salty dense seawater outside the simulated difference in salinity across the plume edge can be as large as 10 psu even several km outside the river mouth the general structure of the plume corresponds to the regimes identified in horner devine et al 2015 section 1 the seaward limit of the source region in the estuary is defined by where the freshwater layer lifts off the bottom during ebb this occurs very near the line between the western ends of the jetties in the center of the river channel around x 11 km i e near location 1 in fig 1 the outflow plume jet is super critical during ebb with the depth averaged flow faster than an internal gravity wave speed i e about 1 m s 1 section 5 out to about x 6 7 km further offshore are the mid and far field regimes of the plume where the edge fronts analyzed in sections 4 6 are located in fig 6 the seaward western edge front is well defined in s but more marginally and variably so in ζz it moves rapidly to the west and out of the level 4 subdomain by the middle of the ebb cycle in contrast the northern and southern edge fronts are well defined in both s and ζz and they extend outward from the river mouth jetties with much slower rates of meridional expansion away from the source along the coastlines the northern edge front is especially well defined in ζz at all stages of the ebb the sign of ζz is negative anticyclonic in the northern edge front and positive in the southern one these signs are consistent with a river outflow velocity profile that peaks in the plume center and decreases toward the edges and there are suggestions of vorticity enhancement i e generation see section 6 at the river channel sides and terminal jetties the strong vorticity at these edge fronts is mainly associated with strong offshore flow u 0 inside the plume and a much weaker flow outside in the early ebb stage the north front is thicker but as the plume expands it gets thinner and thinner down to a width on the order of 100 m the peak vorticity at both edge fronts reaches ζz 40f its width and the vorticity magnitude are likely limited by the model resolution and lateral diffusion probably they are narrower in nature the northern front is temporally stable over several hours 4 h are shown here although incipient wiggles and fragmentation are evident by the late ebb stage the frontal sharpening i e frontogenesis and frontal instability processes are discussed further in section 6 the overall direction of the plume is toward south southeast without turning to follow the coastline toward the north which is typical for many plumes and for the columbia plume at some times due to the coriolis force this direction is likely due to advection by the generally southward surface coastal current during this period forced by the wind stress the flood stage is not shown in fig 6 but it can be seen in the animation provided in supporting information other indicators of the plume edge fronts are shown in fig 7 the density gradient is large and well delineated across the anticyclonic northern and western fronts but very weak across the cyclonic southern front the horizontal divergence d i v h x u y v marks all three fronts and it reaches magnitudes almost as large as the vertical vorticity with maximum values near 30f the divergence is negative i e convergent at the northern and western fronts which will be shown to have a frontogenetic effect section 6 whereas it is more weakly positive at the southern front hence only moderately frontolytic surface convergence implies a downwelling velocity below at the western front the patterns in these two fields are consistent with the conventional interpretation of it as a gravity wave bore section 1 the strong well formed vorticity line at the northern front does not fit as well with this interpretation but it does have in common with submesoscale advective fronts section 1 the coincidence of large ρ large ζz and negative divh however it differs from open ocean surface submesoscale fronts in that its ζz is negative rather than positive suggesting a different vorticity generation process than the planetary vortex stretching term f z w where w is the vertical velocity and f the coriolis frequency planetary vortex stretching favors enhancement of cyclonic vorticity near a vertical boundary and this is the usual situation for most submesoscale fronts because of its weak density gradient and positive divergence the southern edge feature does not seem well formed as a recognizable frontal structure as the other two do in spite of its strong cyclonic vorticity signature both at peak ebb at 08 00 utc and later approaching low tide at 10 00 utc fig 6f 5 frontal structure and propagation now we examine more closely the northern and western frontal zones in the north a cross section of normal velocity v s ρ and vertical velocity w in fig 8 shows a sharp front between the riverine fresh and oceanic salty water with a width of about 100 m i e limited near the model s grid scale and a thickness of about 6 m over a shallow water depth of 11 m the same upper ocean structure also occurs farther offshore along the front where the water is deeper there is a southward flow at all depths in the exterior to the north of the plume at a rate of about 0 2 m s 1 and a vigorous overturning cell occurs with downwelling at the plume edge the downwelling speed is in excess of 0 1 m s 1 a weaker upwelling occurs just past the edge as if the plume itself is partly blocking the ambient flow this secondary circulation in v w is quite asymmetric compared to advective fronts due to a uniform deformation flow or to turbulent thermal wind furthermore it is unlike such frontogenetic mechanisms in that it does not imply a conversion of available potential energy because the downwelling is on the light side hence wb 0 for the most part the large values of y v and y ρ near the surface are congruent with the northern front signals in fig 7 as indicated in fig 6 the northern front moves slowly northward which is the direction expected from a gravitational acceleration due to lighter water and higher sea level inside the plume the propagation is measured in fig 9 a a hovmöller diagram of surface front location marked by strong convergence in y t space it shows reasonably steady propagation of the front over most of the ebb cycle at a rather slow rate of 0 14 m s 1 in the neighboring ebb cycles this speed varies somewhat and its average value is about 0 1 m s 1 a finite depth gravity wave dispersion relation for a two layer fluid is 1 c g δ ρ h 1 h 2 ρ 0 h 1 h 2 where h 1 and h 2 are upper and lower layer thicknesses and δρ is the density difference across the layer interface evaluating this with fig 8d yields a value of 0 46 m s 1 even allowing for doppler shifting by the ambient depth averaged v i e to the north of the front 0 2 m s 1 the propagation rate of the northern front is at best on the margin of consistency with gravity wave dynamics in contrast the western front s propagation rate is much faster 1 06 m s 1 toward the west fig 9b with similar values of about 1 0 m s 1 during the neighboring ebb cycles kilcher and nash 2010 reports measured front speeds reaching up to 1 1 m s 1 for the western head of the columbia plume with an average value of 0 9 m s 1 relative to the ambient current thus our solution is consistent with the observed propagation speed of the western front an analogous cross section across this western front in fig 10 has a somewhat more diffuse vertical stratification structure than the northern front fig 8 presumably due to the effect of larger vertical mixing across the lower s interface it provides an estimate of c 0 9 m s 1 from 1 after taking the deep water limit with h 2 h 1 its normal velocity u is strongly westward behind the front and weakly so ahead consistent with downwelling w underneath this surface convergence line the frontal w values here are similarly large as in the northern front behind the front to the east is a sequence of oscillating extrema in w these are consistent with the emission of strong internal gravity waves from the propagating front as reported in nash and moum 2005 we repeat the caution that these short gravity waves may not be accurately calculated in a hydrostatic model but there is no good reason to doubt the validity of their occurrence we therefore conclude that the western front is generally consistent with the usual conception of a river plume front as a nonlinear gravity wave bore jay et al 2010a show synthetic aperture radar images of multiple realizations of the columbia river ebb plume they generally confirm the rapid spreading of the western edge front consistent with their conceptual model of a gravity wave bore with vertical mixing however their examples for the spreading of the northern edge front are mixed some spread rapidly northward along the coast and some remain pegged close to the mouth thus there is variability in the propagation behavior of the northern edge front for reasons not yet well understood and the slow propagation seen in fig 9a is not inconsistent with some of the observed examples 6 northern edge frontal dynamics to gain further insight into the mechanism generating and sustaining the northern edge front we diagnose the lagrangian frame frontogenetic tendency function f hoskins and bretherton 1972 capet et al 2008 mcwilliams et al 2015 an increase in the magnitude of the horizontal gradient of density or velocity with time is referred as frontogenesis where f is positive while a decrease in the magnitude of this gradient with time is referred as frontolysis where f 0 the lagrangian horizontal buoyancy gradient frontogenetic tendency equation is 2 d d t 1 2 i b i b f b j b j u k k b j b j w y v y b 2 in the first line the indices span x i x y with u i u v the horizontal velocity components repeated indices imply summation only the advective contributions to frontogenesis are written on the right side here and the dots denote additional mixing terms that will not be analyzed here the approximation in the second line is appropriate to the northern edge front where x y and w v the lagrangian horizontal velocity gradient frontogenetic tendency equation is 3 d 1 2 i u j i u j f u 1 ρ 0 i u j i j p i u j i u k k u j i u j i w z u j y v 1 ρ 0 y 2 p y u 2 y v 2 the conventions here are the same as in 2 except that now the pressure gradient terms are included on the right side as well as the advective ones because they are closely related in incompressible flows with strong advection the coriolis force contributes nothing to the total velocity gradient frontogenesis it only gives an exchange between the u and v components the approximation in the second line is appropriate to the northern edge front where x y and u v w surface maps of both frontogenetic tendencies are shown in fig 11 and both fu and fb show advective frontogenesis all along the northern edge front with essentially weak values everywhere else including at the western edge front these patterns are persistent throughout the ebb period indicating that the sharpness of the northern front is being actively maintained the essential reason why the f functions are positive at the surface as indicated in the second line approximations in 2 and 3 is because y v 0 i e the transverse flow is convergent at the surface notice that on the scales plotted here there are no significant frontogenetic tendencies at the western and southern edge fronts in 2 3 the quasi exponential growth rate is y v from fig 8a this rate can be estimated as having a peak value on the order of 0 5 10 2 s 1 at the northern edge front which is quite rapid also notice that fu 0 along the northern jetty i e the advective frontogenesis along the northern plume edge and the vorticity generation analyzed in fig 14 below are initiated even within the columbia estuary fig 12 shows additional fields in a transect across the northern edge front complementing those in fig 8 the along front velocity u is uniformly westward very strong near the surface 2 m s 1 within the plume and with a sharp gradient across the front both u and v have a strong vertical shear within the plume the t field shows the same structure as the s and ρ fields even though it does not control the density because it reflects the water mass difference between the plume and the exterior ocean the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient kv from the mellor yamada 2 5 parameterization scheme mellor and yamada 1982 is elevated at the front somewhat spottily because of the sharp gradients in ρ and u v in the bottom boundary layer and also within the plume interior the vertical vorticity ζz has the surface anticyclonic frontal signature that extends down through the water until the bottom boundary layer stress diminishes it finally the frontogenetic tendency functions f are positive frontogenetic near the surface and either small for fu or negative frontolytic for fb below which is typical of open ocean submesoscale advective frontogenesis mcwilliams 2017 the frontolysis at depth in fb is due to the sign change in y v to a positive value hence horizontal divergence without the pressure term in the second line of 3 fu would also be negative at depth but its inclusion leads to small values there as with fig 8 transects across the northern edge front at other x locations or times during the ebb cycle show essentially similar structures the meridional momentum balance is 4 t v 1 ρ 0 y p u x v v y v w z v z k v z v f h y f u a c c p g h a v a v m h m c f the left side is the local acceleration acc on the right side are the pressure gradient force pg horizontal advection ha vertical advection va parameterized vertical mixing vm and implicit horizontal diffusion associated with the horizontal advection operator hm and coriolis force cf the dominant terms in the second line in 4 are evaluated in fig 13 the momentum balance is highly advective with ha and va large the pressure gradient force pg is central to gravity wave dynamics even in bores with some expression of acc pg however here pg is nearly zero near the surface including its surface expression g y η where η is the sea level with a drop of only about 1 cm across the front though it becomes strong below in addition the horizontal mixing hm force is large and its pattern is opposite to that of the acc its role is to resist the frontogenetic tendency in y v evident in figs 11a and 12e and thus arrest the northern edge front near the grid resolution scale of the model among the plotted terms the acc is weakest so that there is degree of approximate momentum balance excluding acc p g h a v a h m 0 though of course nowhere near the degree of balance found in e g geostrophic flows with small rossby number the coriolis force is weak at the front consistent with the large ζz f values in figs 6b d f and 12d this is in contrast with the plume scale momentum balance analysis in mccabe et al 2009 where the coriolis force is a significant contributor its horizontal resolution is a factor of ten coarser than the level 4 simulation here and the edge fronts are not well resolved similarly the vertical mixing force is relatively unimportant in the local balance by an order of magnitude even though the local eddy viscosity reaches values larger than 10 2 m2 s 1 fig 12c the along front momentum balance not shown has a similar degree of advective dominance as does the cross front balance shown here but with an even smaller role for pg because of the small along front gradient in addition to the frontogenetic maintenance of the sharpness of the northern edge front a frontal vertical vorticity source arises as the flow emerges through the river mouth the depth integrated vertical vorticity equation has a bottom drag source 5 t h η ζ z d z 1 ρ 0 curl z τ b where τ b is the horizontal bottom stress that is parameterized as a quadratic function of the near bottom velocity with a non dimensional drag coefficient of c d 2 5 10 3 as before the dots denote additional terms in the equation not explicitly written here the right side bottom stress curl in 5 is plotted in fig 14 at two different times early and middle ebb if the drag increases toward the sides of the estuary because of the shoaling depth fig 1 then one expects a positive pattern on the north side of the channel and negative on the south the actual patterns are more complicated than this because the bathymetry and flow are complicated nevertheless there is a prevailing positive pattern on the northern side near the mouth at the jetty and even extending beyond the jetty in association with the seaward protrusion of a bathymetric slope fig 1 this positive stress curl pattern implies negative vertical vorticity generation in 5 thus the northern edge front with its strong negative vorticity line fig 6b d f that extends nearly to the bottom fig 12d is pre conditioned by the drag induced vorticity generation near the river mouth this edge front therefore has the attributes of a vortical wake front associated with the river dragging against its northern boundary slope the northern edge front has very sharp horizontal velocity gradients and thus is susceptible to an inflection point barotropic instability additionally it has large negative ζz f and strongly stable stratification figs 8 and 12d hence negative ertel potential vorticity thus it is also susceptible to centrifugal symmetric instability hoskins 1974 it also is at least near the margin of stratified vertical shear instability with r i z z u 2 values below 1 although in this model configuration the response to small ri is parameterized in the vertical mixing scheme fig 12c thus from a simplified dynamical perspective viewing the northern edge front as a steady momentum balanced conservative parallel flow it can be expected to be unstable to inflection point and or centrifugal instability however this perspective is too simple nevertheless as illustrated in fig 15 the edge front does begin to meander laterally at late time in the ebb cycle and it does so progressively with offshore downstream distance there are also indications of incipient frontal fragmentation later in time after ebb is over the front meanders much more and becomes even more fragmented as its vertical vorticity changes sign to positive cyclonic as typical of spontaneously arising deep water submesoscale fronts mcwilliams 2016 see the animation in supporting information our interpretation is that because of the active vorticity generation and frontogenetic tendencies during the peak ebb cycle as well perhaps as the model s vertical and lateral mixing the frontal instability processes are suppressed or at least delayed for several hours but eventually emerge as the ebb forcing abates we have not attempted a detailed analysis of the instability behavior in this solution in part because of the complexity of multiple dynamical influences and in part because its lateral scale is so small that the model s computational accuracy is marginal for any sub frontal scales 7 summary and discussion this paper presents results from a high resolution model hindcast of the mouth of the columbia river region during the high outflow season spring we demonstrate and explain the sharpness and relative stability of the northern edge fronts that develop during ebb tide during the hindcast period typical columbia river patterns are observed a large oscillatory tidal flow and an alongshore southward flow under upwelling favorable winds on each ebb the expansion of the tidal plume forms strong density fronts fronts at the western edge of the plume have been investigated in many previous studies and generally behave consistently with gravity wave bores section 1 as is also shown here this paper primarily focuses on the northern edge of the plume where the front is very strong through the combined effects of bottom drag vorticity generation and advective frontogenesis for both density and velocity gradients at the front with frontolytic horizontal mixing arresting the frontal width near the grid scale the northern edge front propagates only slowly northward parallel to the coast and it persists for several hours in spite of approximately satisfying the conditions for inviscid lateral shear and centrifugal instabilities thus the front stays sharp and approximately stable over many hours and extends more than 10 km offshore because it is actively frontogenetic and the frontogenesis acts to sharpen and maintain the front while any potential instability might arise to destroy it during the period of our hindcast simulations similar edge fronts are observed on every ebb depending on the upwelling and downwelling winds the columbia river plume movement could be bi directional hickey et al 2005 liu et al 2009b this bi directional behavior does not occur during this particular hindcast period but based on our simulations of a different year fronts visually similar to the northern edge front are generated on every ebb regardless of upwelling and downwelling winds and the spreading pattern of the plume we have not analyzed in detail these other examples on some occasions in our simulations vortical fronts are also generated at the southern plume edge but these cases are also not analyzed here surface gravity wave effects are included in the simulation however by comparing with a companion solution without the surface wave effects we conclude that the frontogenetic phenomenon in this paper does not essentially depend upon the surface wave effects so no detailed analysis is made here of this aspect of the simulation finally because the model used in this study is hydrostatic we check t w and find that it is safely small compared to the local buoyancy anomaly b in the northern edge front e g fig 8c d for w and b plus the approximation that t c y where c is the frontal propagation speed in fig 9a thus the hydrostatic approximation is approximately valid for the edge fronts studied here even down to the fine scale resolution of the model however in other places in the simulated fields internal gravity waves are more evident and t w is not relatively small thus the hydrostatic approximation is more doubtful in such places in due course it would be prudent to redo simulations such as ours with a fully non hydrostatic model the characteristics of the plume northern edge front analyzed here are not entirely familiar from previous frontal theories simulations and observations they seem to amalgamate several aspects of advective frontogenesis gravity wave dynamics and topographic wake vorticity generation and flow separation we take this as inspiration to explore this phenomenon

24129,in the tidal ebb cycle at the mouth of the columbia river strong density and velocity fronts sometimes form perpendicular to the coast at the edges of the freshwater plume they are distinct from previously analyzed fronts at the offshore western edge of the plume that evolve as a gravity wave bore we present simulation results to demonstrate their occurrence and investigate the mechanisms behind their frontogenesis and evolution tidal velocities on average ranged between 1 5 m s 1 in flood and 2 5 m s 1 in ebb during the brief hindcast period the tidal fronts exhibit strong horizontal velocity and buoyancy gradients on a scale 100 m in width with normalized relative vorticity ζz f values reaching up to 50 we specifically focus on the front on the northern edge of the plume and examine the evolution in plume characteristics such as its water mass gradients horizontal and vertical velocity structure vertical velocity turbulent vertical mixing horizontal propagation cross front momentum balance and lagrangian frontogenetic tendencies in both buoyancy and velocity gradients advective frontogenesis leads to a very sharp front where lateral mixing near the grid resolution limit arrests its further contraction the negative vorticity within the front is initiated by the positive bottom drag curl on the north side of the columbia estuary and against the north jetty because of the large negative vorticity and horizontal vorticity gradient centrifugal and lateral shear instability begins to develop along the front but frontal fragmentation and decay set in only after the turn of the tide because of the briefness of the ebb interval keywords columbia river advective plume front roms ocean modeling 1 introduction the columbia river is a large tidally pulsed river located in the pacific northwest between washington and oregon its mean monthly discharge varies between 3500 m3 s 1 and 10 000 m3 s 1 during the last 10 years based on the usgs beaver army terminal quincy or discharge statistics generating a large freshwater plume many previous studies concerning the mouth of the columbia river have focused on the plume characteristics as it spreads into the ocean for example kilcher and nash 2010 give a detailed analysis of the structure and dynamics of the columbia river plume s western front in terms of frontal speed internal wave speed turbulent mixing and froude number and nash and moum 2005 show that the western front emits large amplitude internal waves as it advances into the ocean in this study we focus instead on the recurrent sharp advective fronts on the northern and southern edges of the plume horner devine et al 2015 is a review of coastal river plumes it divides the river outflow into four regimes progressing offshore the estuarine source the near field jet where the outflow is super critical i e depth averaged current exceeds the internal gravity wave speed the mid field where geostrophic or wind stress influences emerge and the far field where the plume has been transformed into a geostrophic alongshore coastal current the usual dynamical conception for the advancing edge of the plume is as an internal gravity wave accelerated by the freshwater density anomaly and accompanied by strong vertical mixing across the underlying interface garvine 1974 the gravity wave spreading pattern is modeled as radially symmetric about a center moving offshore with the outflow velocity garvine 1984 luketina and imberger 1987 jay et al 2010b near the shore line this would imply a front moving alongshore away from the river source the mid and far field structure can be influenced by a prevailing usually wind driven coastal current e g hickey et al 2005 shows the coastal current from the columbia plume to be bi directional depending on the wind regime orton and jay 2005 and thomson et al 2014 examine the enhanced turbulence and mixing at the western plume front fronts are defined by sharp horizontal gradients frequently at the sea surface and usually in the density ρ or buoyancy b g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 where g is gravitational acceleration and ρ 0 is a constant reference density but also the horizontal

outcome of horizontal deformation straining or horizontal convergence acting on an initial horizontal buoyancy gradient pettersen 1936 hoskins and bretherton 1972 recently it has become evident that the surface ocean is full of fronts with a horizontal size that has come to be called submesoscale with lateral widths 0 1 10 km mcwilliams 2016 their frontogenesis can also occur through convergence in the secondary circulation due to vertical mixing a k a the turbulent thermal wind mcwilliams et al 2015 this paper reports the results of a high resolution computational simulation of the columbia river plume over multiple tidal cycles where the plume exhibits recurrent sharp ebb plume edge fronts that are aligned approximately perpendicular to the coast and propagate only slowly the front s genesis structure and behavior are more similar to advective frontogenesis than to the usual conception of a gravity wave bore at the edge of a river plume although the phenomenon may be a dynamical hybrid of both influences our results are to be taken as experimental with as yet no full theoretical explanation nor field confirmation in the next section we summarize previous modeling studies of the plume and describe the methods used in the present study in section 3 we present a brief general validation of the model solution analyses are then made of the general structure of the plume section 4 the contrasting local structures and propagation speeds of the northern and western plume fronts section 5 and the vertical vorticity generation and frontogenesis processes as well as the onset of a late ebb frontal instability in the northern front section 6 section 7 provides a summary and discussion 2 modeling approach regional modeling of the u s west coast circulation is done with open boundary conditions and stable long term quasi equilibrium behavior e g marchesiello et al 2003 this approach can include the columbia river inflow and tides but at a whole coast scale the desired spatial detail is absent more local attention with finer model grids has been given to the local coastal circulation near the columbia river in a number of studies many of which demonstrate skill through validation with observations maccready et al 2009 mccabe et al 2009 liu et al 2009a b banas et al 2009 burla et al 2010 elias et al 2012 kärnä et al 2016 akan et al 2017 however none has focused on the plume fronts mainly because of insufficient grid resolution out in the plume this is remedied here by using multiple levels of grid nesting we use a hydrostatic model which is the common practice in oceanic circulation modeling this imposes limits on the dynamical validity for some phenomena particularly with respect to short internal gravity waves generated in the plume which are not the main focus of this study most advective phenomena in the ocean on the scale of 100 m or more are approximately hydrostatic and a hydrostatic solution can be assessed a posteriori for its dynamical consistency we return to this issue in section 7 we make simulation hindcasts with the coawst warner et al 2010 modeling system in a 4 level nested grid configuration the horizontal grid resolutions of level 1 level 2 level 3 and level 4 configurations are d x 3 km 1 km 200 m and 40 m respectively the nesting procedure is done offline i e with information transfer only toward finer grids boundary and initial data for these regional configurations is provided by dr alex kurapov using the data assimilation method described in kurapov et al 2011 with this multi level configuration we are able to generate high frequency and high resolution initial and boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing for finer resolution nested grids thus the influences of the larger scale coastal upwelling and downwelling dynamics are incorporated in our level 3 and level 4 simulations the level 3 model d x 200 m simulation is carried out for a 45 day period may 9th through june 15th 2013 this period is chosen to cover a riverine and estuarine transport and data assimilation and remote sensing for littoral applications experimental period rivet ii and darla supported by the u s office of naval research a separate paper specific to another experimental period akan et al 2017 discusses the model configuration and level 3 model results in detail however for the purposes of this study we make a further nest focused on the nearshore plume dynamics in this paper we present results from the d x 40 m resolution model level 4 from june 3 to june 10 2013 this is a period with relatively weaker surface gravity wave hs 2 m and river discharge conditions 8000 m3 s 1 compared to the rest of the rivet ii experimental period but still it is during the seasonal of larger river run off and discharge the oceanic tides in this region are mixed semi diurnal and diurnal with a variation between spring and neap tides the focus period for level 4 integration is not during either of these tidal extremes while the results presented here are specific only to this short interval we expect that similar plume edge frontogenesis will occur frequently in this region in competition with other wind wave and current influences the model grid has 40 vertical terrain following levels shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 fig 1 shows the model domain and topography that is comprised of a blend of the bathymetry used in kassem 2012 and the usgs swath bathymetry gelfenbaum et al 2015 the initial and boundary conditions are obtained from the level 3 resolution solution level 3 model is forced with tidal constituents and realistic river discharge this information is then transferred to level 4 through the boundary conditions clamped boundary condition is used to match the river discharge at the eastern boundary surface air temperature sea level pressure precipitation relative humidity shortwave and longwave radiation and 10 m winds from the d x 1 km resolution model kurapov et al 2011 are used to calculate the air sea fluxes of heat and momentum fairall et al 1996 similar to level 3 level 4 has 40 vertically stretched σ terrain following levels σ coordinate parameters used are t c l i n e 10 m θ s 5 0 and θ b 0 4 the method used for bathymetry smoothing on both levels is explained in akan et al 2017 wetting and drying is not included in level 3 but is included in level 4 all the other setup parameters are the same in both levels a third order upstream advection algorithm which is designed to provide minimal diffusion sufficient to keep the solution smooth near the grid scale is used in roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 to discretize the momentum equation we used the default laplacian formulation of roms for the horizontal mixing of momentum and tracers for vertical mixing the mellor yamada 2 5 mellor and yamada 1982 parameterization scheme is used the level 3 and level 4 models are fully coupled with surface gravity wave effects on currents and the current effect on the waves is based on the asymptotic theory developed by mcwilliams et al 2004 and the model implementation by uchiyama et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 implemented a similar formulation in coawst the coawst model has been widely used in the oceanographic community and it has produced good model observation comparisons in different studies in coastal regions e g kumar et al 2012 olabarrieta et al 2011 further details of the model including more of the specific parameters for this configuration and additional validation tests beyond those in section 3 are reported in akan et al 2017 which is a study of the wave current plume interactions at the mouth of the columbia river 3 model validation before focusing on the plume fronts we present several observational comparisons that establish that the tidal signal near the mouth of the columbia river is reasonably well represented in the simulations for the whole hindcast period on the level 3 grid surface elevation significant wave height currents salinity and temperature were recorded at the different locations marked in fig 1 figs 2 and 3 show the time series comparison between the model results and the observations the latter figure has an expanded time scale to give an orientation to the phase of the tides in particular we will focus below on the ebb period between the high tide at 04 00 at the river mouth and low tide at 10 00 utc on june 3 2013 the peak ebb velocity occurs at 07 30 utc note that observed surface elevation time series are obtained from noaa see http tidesandcurrents noaa gov observational temperature and salinity time series are obtained from the center for coastal margin and prediction interdisciplinary saturn network baptista et al 2015 and see acknowledgements for information about availability of the remaining datasets used in this study the signals are dominated by the tides overall good agreement with the observations is seen sea surface elevation η and salinity time series match almost perfectly however the model seems to overestimate the eastward surface velocities for every flood and there are also minor differences in the observed eastward bottom velocity profile at this particular location not shown the latter could be due to the imperfect representation of the bathymetry or due to the choice of bottom friction parameterization quadratic bottom drag was used in the present study and sensitivity tests performed with different drag coefficient values showed insignificant differences in the model observation comparisons however we did not test a bottom drag parameterization that could account for both the current and wave velocities and this could be part of the reason for the differences observed in the bottom velocities the biggest discrepancy is in the temperature record between may 25th and june 3rd 2013 when the observed t shows a very weak tidal signal and it is not as cold following low tide as in the model during other intervals the tidal range and minimum in t are well matched assuming the observations are valid during this period we presume that some unknown event happened that is not captured in the model to evaluate the model performance more quantitatively the statistics used to compare modeled with observed data are the root mean square rms error the bias and a non dimensional skill assessment parameter ms used in elias et al 2012 table 1 shows the model statistics for the time series shown in figs 2 and 3 in general the model skill ms is over 0 85 except for the temperature these statistical skills are similar to other columbia river studies e g liu et al 2009a elias et al 2012 kärnä et al 2016 the modeled significant wave height hs time series at locations 1 and 2 in fig 1 are also included in table 1 and they also compare well with the observations even though we find that the dynamical influences of surface gravity waves on the plume edge front are small in our present simulations section 7 the model skill in hs is an indirect indication of the accuracy of the modeled wind forcing as well as of the wave model itself in akan et al 2017 wave influences are shown to be important for other phenomena we compare the spatial structure of the flow along the plume axis using the velocity profiles obtained from a surface wave instrument float with tracking swift thomson 2012 the swift was released at the beginning of the second ebb cycle on june 3 2013 inside the river mouth and traveled offshore along the path shown with a dashed black line in the top panel of fig 4 the bottom panels show the comparison between the model and the swift observations along that path this comparison is done by extracting the model data closest to the observation path in space and time from fig 4 we can conclude that the instrument seemingly has difficulty in detecting the near bottom velocity and the model slightly overestimates the near surface velocity although in the bulk of the water column the model captures the spatial structure of the velocity field fairly well a different comparison of spatial structure is made in fig 5 between observed ctd profiles within the outer estuary collected by dr rocky geyer whoi and modeled salinity transects along a northward path indicated by the dashed black line in the right panel these data are during early flood conditions on june 7 2013 the model reproduces the overall cross plume distribution of the salinity rather well including the upper fresh layer the bottom saline layer and their interface around z 10 m there are indications of insufficient parameterized vertical mixing in the upper 7 m and perhaps excessive mixing in the bottom 5 m thus we conclude that the model was able reproduce the overall structure of the tidally pulsed plume at least near the mouth and along the plume center as it moves offshore during ebb 4 plume structure over the 11 day hindcast in the level 4 grid section 2 the pattern of the plume is broadly similar over each of the ebb cycles but of course with some variety because of the variable atmospheric and oceanic conditions it should be also noted that river discharge and tidal regime are the key factors determining the plume lift off region the wind during this period is generally moderate and toward the southeast thus favoring coastal upwelling and a southward surface flow that favors a southward turning of the offshore plume the sea level drop and ebb currents are somewhat stronger during one of the two cycles per day fig 3 and in each instance over this period there are well defined edge fronts on both the north and south sides of the plume the northern edge front in particular extends seaward more than 15 km offshore from the northern jet and exhibits only weak northward propagation at a speed that varies among cycles in this paper we will focus on the stronger cycle early on june 3 2013 as a typical instance during this simulation period in fig 6 the surface patterns in salinity s and normalized vertical vorticity ζ z f x v y u f where u v are eastward and northward velocity respectively are shown at early peak and late periods of the cycle as expected the layer of freshwater spreads seaward and is diluted with salty water by mixing from below as it goes along strong density gradients in the frontal zone occur between the light fresh water in the plume and the salty dense seawater outside the simulated difference in salinity across the plume edge can be as large as 10 psu even several km outside the river mouth the general structure of the plume corresponds to the regimes identified in horner devine et al 2015 section 1 the seaward limit of the source region in the estuary is defined by where the freshwater layer lifts off the bottom during ebb this occurs very near the line between the western ends of the jetties in the center of the river channel around x 11 km i e near location 1 in fig 1 the outflow plume jet is super critical during ebb with the depth averaged flow faster than an internal gravity wave speed i e about 1 m s 1 section 5 out to about x 6 7 km further offshore are the mid and far field regimes of the plume where the edge fronts analyzed in sections 4 6 are located in fig 6 the seaward western edge front is well defined in s but more marginally and variably so in ζz it moves rapidly to the west and out of the level 4 subdomain by the middle of the ebb cycle in contrast the northern and southern edge fronts are well defined in both s and ζz and they extend outward from the river mouth jetties with much slower rates of meridional expansion away from the source along the coastlines the northern edge front is especially well defined in ζz at all stages of the ebb the sign of ζz is negative anticyclonic in the northern edge front and positive in the southern one these signs are consistent with a river outflow velocity profile that peaks in the plume center and decreases toward the edges and there are suggestions of vorticity enhancement i e generation see section 6 at the river channel sides and terminal jetties the strong vorticity at these edge fronts is mainly associated with strong offshore flow u 0 inside the plume and a much weaker flow outside in the early ebb stage the north front is thicker but as the plume expands it gets thinner and thinner down to a width on the order of 100 m the peak vorticity at both edge fronts reaches ζz 40f its width and the vorticity magnitude are likely limited by the model resolution and lateral diffusion probably they are narrower in nature the northern front is temporally stable over several hours 4 h are shown here although incipient wiggles and fragmentation are evident by the late ebb stage the frontal sharpening i e frontogenesis and frontal instability processes are discussed further in section 6 the overall direction of the plume is toward south southeast without turning to follow the coastline toward the north which is typical for many plumes and for the columbia plume at some times due to the coriolis force this direction is likely due to advection by the generally southward surface coastal current during this period forced by the wind stress the flood stage is not shown in fig 6 but it can be seen in the animation provided in supporting information other indicators of the plume edge fronts are shown in fig 7 the density gradient is large and well delineated across the anticyclonic northern and western fronts but very weak across the cyclonic southern front the horizontal divergence d i v h x u y v marks all three fronts and it reaches magnitudes almost as large as the vertical vorticity with maximum values near 30f the divergence is negative i e convergent at the northern and western fronts which will be shown to have a frontogenetic effect section 6 whereas it is more weakly positive at the southern front hence only moderately frontolytic surface convergence implies a downwelling velocity below at the western front the patterns in these two fields are consistent with the conventional interpretation of it as a gravity wave bore section 1 the strong well formed vorticity line at the northern front does not fit as well with this interpretation but it does have in common with submesoscale advective fronts section 1 the coincidence of large ρ large ζz and negative divh however it differs from open ocean surface submesoscale fronts in that its ζz is negative rather than positive suggesting a different vorticity generation process than the planetary vortex stretching term f z w where w is the vertical velocity and f the coriolis frequency planetary vortex stretching favors enhancement of cyclonic vorticity near a vertical boundary and this is the usual situation for most submesoscale fronts because of its weak density gradient and positive divergence the southern edge feature does not seem well formed as a recognizable frontal structure as the other two do in spite of its strong cyclonic vorticity signature both at peak ebb at 08 00 utc and later approaching low tide at 10 00 utc fig 6f 5 frontal structure and propagation now we examine more closely the northern and western frontal zones in the north a cross section of normal velocity v s ρ and vertical velocity w in fig 8 shows a sharp front between the riverine fresh and oceanic salty water with a width of about 100 m i e limited near the model s grid scale and a thickness of about 6 m over a shallow water depth of 11 m the same upper ocean structure also occurs farther offshore along the front where the water is deeper there is a southward flow at all depths in the exterior to the north of the plume at a rate of about 0 2 m s 1 and a vigorous overturning cell occurs with downwelling at the plume edge the downwelling speed is in excess of 0 1 m s 1 a weaker upwelling occurs just past the edge as if the plume itself is partly blocking the ambient flow this secondary circulation in v w is quite asymmetric compared to advective fronts due to a uniform deformation flow or to turbulent thermal wind furthermore it is unlike such frontogenetic mechanisms in that it does not imply a conversion of available potential energy because the downwelling is on the light side hence wb 0 for the most part the large values of y v and y ρ near the surface are congruent with the northern front signals in fig 7 as indicated in fig 6 the northern front moves slowly northward which is the direction expected from a gravitational acceleration due to lighter water and higher sea level inside the plume the propagation is measured in fig 9 a a hovmöller diagram of surface front location marked by strong convergence in y t space it shows reasonably steady propagation of the front over most of the ebb cycle at a rather slow rate of 0 14 m s 1 in the neighboring ebb cycles this speed varies somewhat and its average value is about 0 1 m s 1 a finite depth gravity wave dispersion relation for a two layer fluid is 1 c g δ ρ h 1 h 2 ρ 0 h 1 h 2 where h 1 and h 2 are upper and lower layer thicknesses and δρ is the density difference across the layer interface evaluating this with fig 8d yields a value of 0 46 m s 1 even allowing for doppler shifting by the ambient depth averaged v i e to the north of the front 0 2 m s 1 the propagation rate of the northern front is at best on the margin of consistency with gravity wave dynamics in contrast the western front s propagation rate is much faster 1 06 m s 1 toward the west fig 9b with similar values of about 1 0 m s 1 during the neighboring ebb cycles kilcher and nash 2010 reports measured front speeds reaching up to 1 1 m s 1 for the western head of the columbia plume with an average value of 0 9 m s 1 relative to the ambient current thus our solution is consistent with the observed propagation speed of the western front an analogous cross section across this western front in fig 10 has a somewhat more diffuse vertical stratification structure than the northern front fig 8 presumably due to the effect of larger vertical mixing across the lower s interface it provides an estimate of c 0 9 m s 1 from 1 after taking the deep water limit with h 2 h 1 its normal velocity u is strongly westward behind the front and weakly so ahead consistent with downwelling w underneath this surface convergence line the frontal w values here are similarly large as in the northern front behind the front to the east is a sequence of oscillating extrema in w these are consistent with the emission of strong internal gravity waves from the propagating front as reported in nash and moum 2005 we repeat the caution that these short gravity waves may not be accurately calculated in a hydrostatic model but there is no good reason to doubt the validity of their occurrence we therefore conclude that the western front is generally consistent with the usual conception of a river plume front as a nonlinear gravity wave bore jay et al 2010a show synthetic aperture radar images of multiple realizations of the columbia river ebb plume they generally confirm the rapid spreading of the western edge front consistent with their conceptual model of a gravity wave bore with vertical mixing however their examples for the spreading of the northern edge front are mixed some spread rapidly northward along the coast and some remain pegged close to the mouth thus there is variability in the propagation behavior of the northern edge front for reasons not yet well understood and the slow propagation seen in fig 9a is not inconsistent with some of the observed examples 6 northern edge frontal dynamics to gain further insight into the mechanism generating and sustaining the northern edge front we diagnose the lagrangian frame frontogenetic tendency function f hoskins and bretherton 1972 capet et al 2008 mcwilliams et al 2015 an increase in the magnitude of the horizontal gradient of density or velocity with time is referred as frontogenesis where f is positive while a decrease in the magnitude of this gradient with time is referred as frontolysis where f 0 the lagrangian horizontal buoyancy gradient frontogenetic tendency equation is 2 d d t 1 2 i b i b f b j b j u k k b j b j w y v y b 2 in the first line the indices span x i x y with u i u v the horizontal velocity components repeated indices imply summation only the advective contributions to frontogenesis are written on the right side here and the dots denote additional mixing terms that will not be analyzed here the approximation in the second line is appropriate to the northern edge front where x y and w v the lagrangian horizontal velocity gradient frontogenetic tendency equation is 3 d 1 2 i u j i u j f u 1 ρ 0 i u j i j p i u j i u k k u j i u j i w z u j y v 1 ρ 0 y 2 p y u 2 y v 2 the conventions here are the same as in 2 except that now the pressure gradient terms are included on the right side as well as the advective ones because they are closely related in incompressible flows with strong advection the coriolis force contributes nothing to the total velocity gradient frontogenesis it only gives an exchange between the u and v components the approximation in the second line is appropriate to the northern edge front where x y and u v w surface maps of both frontogenetic tendencies are shown in fig 11 and both fu and fb show advective frontogenesis all along the northern edge front with essentially weak values everywhere else including at the western edge front these patterns are persistent throughout the ebb period indicating that the sharpness of the northern front is being actively maintained the essential reason why the f functions are positive at the surface as indicated in the second line approximations in 2 and 3 is because y v 0 i e the transverse flow is convergent at the surface notice that on the scales plotted here there are no significant frontogenetic tendencies at the western and southern edge fronts in 2 3 the quasi exponential growth rate is y v from fig 8a this rate can be estimated as having a peak value on the order of 0 5 10 2 s 1 at the northern edge front which is quite rapid also notice that fu 0 along the northern jetty i e the advective frontogenesis along the northern plume edge and the vorticity generation analyzed in fig 14 below are initiated even within the columbia estuary fig 12 shows additional fields in a transect across the northern edge front complementing those in fig 8 the along front velocity u is uniformly westward very strong near the surface 2 m s 1 within the plume and with a sharp gradient across the front both u and v have a strong vertical shear within the plume the t field shows the same structure as the s and ρ fields even though it does not control the density because it reflects the water mass difference between the plume and the exterior ocean the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient kv from the mellor yamada 2 5 parameterization scheme mellor and yamada 1982 is elevated at the front somewhat spottily because of the sharp gradients in ρ and u v in the bottom boundary layer and also within the plume interior the vertical vorticity ζz has the surface anticyclonic frontal signature that extends down through the water until the bottom boundary layer stress diminishes it finally the frontogenetic tendency functions f are positive frontogenetic near the surface and either small for fu or negative frontolytic for fb below which is typical of open ocean submesoscale advective frontogenesis mcwilliams 2017 the frontolysis at depth in fb is due to the sign change in y v to a positive value hence horizontal divergence without the pressure term in the second line of 3 fu would also be negative at depth but its inclusion leads to small values there as with fig 8 transects across the northern edge front at other x locations or times during the ebb cycle show essentially similar structures the meridional momentum balance is 4 t v 1 ρ 0 y p u x v v y v w z v z k v z v f h y f u a c c p g h a v a v m h m c f the left side is the local acceleration acc on the right side are the pressure gradient force pg horizontal advection ha vertical advection va parameterized vertical mixing vm and implicit horizontal diffusion associated with the horizontal advection operator hm and coriolis force cf the dominant terms in the second line in 4 are evaluated in fig 13 the momentum balance is highly advective with ha and va large the pressure gradient force pg is central to gravity wave dynamics even in bores with some expression of acc pg however here pg is nearly zero near the surface including its surface expression g y η where η is the sea level with a drop of only about 1 cm across the front though it becomes strong below in addition the horizontal mixing hm force is large and its pattern is opposite to that of the acc its role is to resist the frontogenetic tendency in y v evident in figs 11a and 12e and thus arrest the northern edge front near the grid resolution scale of the model among the plotted terms the acc is weakest so that there is degree of approximate momentum balance excluding acc p g h a v a h m 0 though of course nowhere near the degree of balance found in e g geostrophic flows with small rossby number the coriolis force is weak at the front consistent with the large ζz f values in figs 6b d f and 12d this is in contrast with the plume scale momentum balance analysis in mccabe et al 2009 where the coriolis force is a significant contributor its horizontal resolution is a factor of ten coarser than the level 4 simulation here and the edge fronts are not well resolved similarly the vertical mixing force is relatively unimportant in the local balance by an order of magnitude even though the local eddy viscosity reaches values larger than 10 2 m2 s 1 fig 12c the along front momentum balance not shown has a similar degree of advective dominance as does the cross front balance shown here but with an even smaller role for pg because of the small along front gradient in addition to the frontogenetic maintenance of the sharpness of the northern edge front a frontal vertical vorticity source arises as the flow emerges through the river mouth the depth integrated vertical vorticity equation has a bottom drag source 5 t h η ζ z d z 1 ρ 0 curl z τ b where τ b is the horizontal bottom stress that is parameterized as a quadratic function of the near bottom velocity with a non dimensional drag coefficient of c d 2 5 10 3 as before the dots denote additional terms in the equation not explicitly written here the right side bottom stress curl in 5 is plotted in fig 14 at two different times early and middle ebb if the drag increases toward the sides of the estuary because of the shoaling depth fig 1 then one expects a positive pattern on the north side of the channel and negative on the south the actual patterns are more complicated than this because the bathymetry and flow are complicated nevertheless there is a prevailing positive pattern on the northern side near the mouth at the jetty and even extending beyond the jetty in association with the seaward protrusion of a bathymetric slope fig 1 this positive stress curl pattern implies negative vertical vorticity generation in 5 thus the northern edge front with its strong negative vorticity line fig 6b d f that extends nearly to the bottom fig 12d is pre conditioned by the drag induced vorticity generation near the river mouth this edge front therefore has the attributes of a vortical wake front associated with the river dragging against its northern boundary slope the northern edge front has very sharp horizontal velocity gradients and thus is susceptible to an inflection point barotropic instability additionally it has large negative ζz f and strongly stable stratification figs 8 and 12d hence negative ertel potential vorticity thus it is also susceptible to centrifugal symmetric instability hoskins 1974 it also is at least near the margin of stratified vertical shear instability with r i z z u 2 values below 1 although in this model configuration the response to small ri is parameterized in the vertical mixing scheme fig 12c thus from a simplified dynamical perspective viewing the northern edge front as a steady momentum balanced conservative parallel flow it can be expected to be unstable to inflection point and or centrifugal instability however this perspective is too simple nevertheless as illustrated in fig 15 the edge front does begin to meander laterally at late time in the ebb cycle and it does so progressively with offshore downstream distance there are also indications of incipient frontal fragmentation later in time after ebb is over the front meanders much more and becomes even more fragmented as its vertical vorticity changes sign to positive cyclonic as typical of spontaneously arising deep water submesoscale fronts mcwilliams 2016 see the animation in supporting information our interpretation is that because of the active vorticity generation and frontogenetic tendencies during the peak ebb cycle as well perhaps as the model s vertical and lateral mixing the frontal instability processes are suppressed or at least delayed for several hours but eventually emerge as the ebb forcing abates we have not attempted a detailed analysis of the instability behavior in this solution in part because of the complexity of multiple dynamical influences and in part because its lateral scale is so small that the model s computational accuracy is marginal for any sub frontal scales 7 summary and discussion this paper presents results from a high resolution model hindcast of the mouth of the columbia river region during the high outflow season spring we demonstrate and explain the sharpness and relative stability of the northern edge fronts that develop during ebb tide during the hindcast period typical columbia river patterns are observed a large oscillatory tidal flow and an alongshore southward flow under upwelling favorable winds on each ebb the expansion of the tidal plume forms strong density fronts fronts at the western edge of the plume have been investigated in many previous studies and generally behave consistently with gravity wave bores section 1 as is also shown here this paper primarily focuses on the northern edge of the plume where the front is very strong through the combined effects of bottom drag vorticity generation and advective frontogenesis for both density and velocity gradients at the front with frontolytic horizontal mixing arresting the frontal width near the grid scale the northern edge front propagates only slowly northward parallel to the coast and it persists for several hours in spite of approximately satisfying the conditions for inviscid lateral shear and centrifugal instabilities thus the front stays sharp and approximately stable over many hours and extends more than 10 km offshore because it is actively frontogenetic and the frontogenesis acts to sharpen and maintain the front while any potential instability might arise to destroy it during the period of our hindcast simulations similar edge fronts are observed on every ebb depending on the upwelling and downwelling winds the columbia river plume movement could be bi directional hickey et al 2005 liu et al 2009b this bi directional behavior does not occur during this particular hindcast period but based on our simulations of a different year fronts visually similar to the northern edge front are generated on every ebb regardless of upwelling and downwelling winds and the spreading pattern of the plume we have not analyzed in detail these other examples on some occasions in our simulations vortical fronts are also generated at the southern plume edge but these cases are also not analyzed here surface gravity wave effects are included in the simulation however by comparing with a companion solution without the surface wave effects we conclude that the frontogenetic phenomenon in this paper does not essentially depend upon the surface wave effects so no detailed analysis is made here of this aspect of the simulation finally because the model used in this study is hydrostatic we check t w and find that it is safely small compared to the local buoyancy anomaly b in the northern edge front e g fig 8c d for w and b plus the approximation that t c y where c is the frontal propagation speed in fig 9a thus the hydrostatic approximation is approximately valid for the edge fronts studied here even down to the fine scale resolution of the model however in other places in the simulated fields internal gravity waves are more evident and t w is not relatively small thus the hydrostatic approximation is more doubtful in such places in due course it would be prudent to redo simulations such as ours with a fully non hydrostatic model the characteristics of the plume northern edge front analyzed here are not entirely familiar from previous frontal theories simulations and observations they seem to amalgamate several aspects of advective frontogenesis gravity wave dynamics and topographic wake vorticity generation and flow separation we take this as inspiration to explore this phenomenon
