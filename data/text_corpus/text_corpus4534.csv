force free surface elevation 1 introduction recently some new types of gravity caisson breakwaters have been constructed to protect harbours and provide safe harbourage one of them is comb type caisson ctc breakwater comprising uniform ctcs the concept of the ctc was initially proposed in the late 1990s li et al 2002 it is named the ctc breakwater because from the top view it looks like a comb the ctc breakwater has been successfully applied in the port area of da yao bay dalian china fig 1 the ctc consisting of a rectangular caisson and two thin side plates fig 2 evolves from the conventional rectangular caisson with part of the rectangular caisson replaced by side plates the ctc breakwater has two structure types i e a non open type ctc with the side plates directly connected to the seabed and an open ctc with the side plates immersed to a certain depth relative to the traditional rectangular caisson the ctc can save engineering investment and reduce the requirement of foundation bearing capacity niu et al 2003 because the rectangular caisson is partially replaced by side plates and has a smaller base area most importantly the gap beneath the side plates allow the pass of current which can significantly reduce the flow velocity near the breakwater entrance guaranteeing the navigation safety in addition the reflection coefficient and wave forces acting on the ctc breakwater are smaller than that of the traditional caisson breakwater li et al 2002 and thus the stability against sliding of the structure can be enhanced the reductions of wave reflection and wave forces acting on ctc are mainly due to two reasons first there exist a distance between front wall of rectangular caisson and side plates which gives rise to a wave phase difference between the front wall of caisson and on the side plates hence the horizontal wave forces on the front wall and side plate cannot reach their peaks simultaneously second the opening area beneath the side plate allows a small portion of seawater entering into the harbour meanwhile a small portion of wave energy transmits into the harbour rather than wave directly acting on the caisson and the transmitted waves induce wave force acting on the back wall of the caisson and side plates leading to the reduction of total horizontal wave force various experimental and numerical studies have been conducted niu et al 2003 reviewed the development and construction of comb type caisson breakwater and presented a comparison between comb type caisson and traditional rectangular caisson through physical model tests their results showed that under similar incident wave conditions the width of comb type caisson was almost the same as width of the traditional caisson li et al 2002 and dong et al 2003 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate the wave reflection and wave forces acting on ctc breakwaters based on experimental results empirical formulae were proposed to calculate the reflection coefficient and wave forces on the ctc breakwaters fang et al 2011 used physical model tests and numerical simulations to study the wave transmission and the distribution of the wave pressure on the surface of ctc breakwaters under irregular wave conditions these authors also provided an empirical formula to calculate the transmission coefficient recently zang et al 2018 numerically and experimentally investigated the critical conditions for the appearance of impulsive wave forces acting on the ctc breakwaters then these researchers presented useful suggestions on improving the hydrodynamic performance of the ctc breakwater the above studies mainly focused on the experimental and numerical investigations under normally incident waves the analytical solution of wave acting on the periodic array of ctc under different incident wave angles has not been developed however the analytical studies of wave interacting with a periodic array of equally spaced identical caissons have been presented which are helpful for developing the analytical solution evans and linton 1993 proved the existence of edge waves travelling along a periodic array of equally spaced identical thin barriers connecting by a vertical wall in the rear evans and fernyhough 1995 further examined the edge wave interacting with a coastal structure the coastal structure was very similar to a non open comb type structure these authors paid considerable attention to the edge waves propagating along the coastline and decaying exponentially away from the coastline however the wave reflection wave transmission or wave forces acting on the structure were not investigated fernyhough and evans 1995 studied the wave reflection and transmission of a periodic array of equally spaced rectangular caissons porter and evans 1996 examined incident wave interacting a periodic array of segment offshore breakwaters based on linear potential theory and found that the number of reflected and transmitted waves were dependent on the angle of incidence and the ratio of the wavelength to the period of the structure a review on the computation progress and understanding of wave interacting with an array of offshore structures was presented by mciver 2002 previous studies on waves interacting with a periodic array of equally spaced identical caissons are actually two dimensional 2d solutions of boundary value problem in this study we will develop a 3d analytical solution for wave interacting with open ctc breakwaters under different incident wave angles the present 3d solution is capable of considering the periodicity along the longitudinal direction of the breakwater and the existence of partially immersed side plates to simplify the mathematical derivation a periodic boundary condition evans and linton 1993 evans and fernyhough 1995 is employed this article is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equation and boundary conditions for wave interacting with ctc breakwaters under different incident wave angles are presented the matched eigenfunction expansion method is used to solve the present problem the formulae of hydrodynamic quantities are presented in section 3 the convergence of the new analytical solution is examined and the analytical solution is validated against previous results in section 4 the effects of wave and structural parameters on the hydrodynamic quantities are investigated finally the main conclusions of this study are drawn 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 boundary value problem the oblique incident wave interacting ctc breakwater consisting of an array of uniform ctcs is shown in fig 2 the front wave chamber with width b 1 is formed by the front half parts of adjacent rectangular caissons and side plates the rear wave chamber with width b 2 is formed by the latter half parts of adjacent rectangular caissons and the side plates the water depth is of constant d while the bottom of the side plate is located at a distance b away from the seabed thus the immersed depth of the side plate is h a d b the components for one unit of the ctc are presented in the upper left corner of fig 2 the length of the rectangular caisson is c and the length of the side plate is a the total length of the ctc is l 2a c the thickness of the side plate is assumed to be zero since it is much smaller than the incident wavelength a cartesian coordinate system is chosen with its original point is located at the intersection of the side plate the lateral face of the rectangular caisson and the still water level the x y plane is at the still water level with the z axis pointing vertically upwards the y axis points towards the length direction of the breakwater wave trains with wave height h and wavelength l are obliquely incident at an angle θ 0 0 θ 0 π 2 based on potential theory the velocity potential φ x y z t can be used to describe the wave motion problem by considering linear harmonic waves with an angular frequency ω the time factor e i ω t can be separated from the velocity potential φ x y z t wave pressure p x y z t and wave elevation ξ x y t thus we obtain 1 φ x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t 2 p x y z t re p x y z e i ω t 3 ξ x y t re η x y e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the variable and i 1 ϕ x y z p x y z and η x y are the complex spatial velocity potential wave pressure and wave elevation respectively which are independent of the time t in the fluid domain the spatial complex velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation 4 2 ϕ x y z x 2 2 ϕ x y z y 2 2 ϕ x y z z 2 0 the spatial complex velocity potential also satisfies free surface boundary condition and non penetration condition of the seabed 5 ϕ z ω 2 g ϕ z 0 6 ϕ z 0 z d where g is the gravitational acceleration furthermore the spatial complex velocity potential ϕ x y z must satisfy the non penetration boundary conditions on the solid walls 7 ϕ x 0 x b 1 x b 2 2 a m l y m 1 l d

wave can be written as 10 φ i i g h 2 ω e i k x x b 1 e i k y y cosh k 0 z d cosh k 0 d where the wave number k 0 satisfies the wave dispersion relation equation 11 ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 d in which the components of the wave number k 0 in the x direction and y direction correspond to k x k 0 cos θ 0 and k y k 0 sin θ 0 respectively owing to the periodic geometry features of the ctc breakwater with a periodicity l the following periodic boundary condition are adopted for the velocity potential dalrymple and martin 1990 porter and evans 2005 liu et al 2007 cal et al 2014 12 ϕ x y m l z e i m k y l ϕ x y z m 0 1 2 by adopting this periodic boundary condition the velocity potential ϕ x y z can be initially determined in a strip of x 0 y l and then extended to the remaining fluid domains the strip of the fluid domain is divided into four sub regions region i x b 1 0 y l the semi infinite fluid domain in front of the breakwater region ii b 1 x 0 0 y 2 a the fluid domain formed by the front half parts of the two adjacent rectangular caissons and the side plates forming a front wave chamber region iii 0 x b 2 0 y 2 a the fluid domain formed by the latter half parts of the two adjacent rectangular caissons and the side plates forming a rear wave chamber and region iv x b 2 0 y l the fluid domain inside the harbour basin 2 2 formulation of velocity potentials in four sub regions the series solutions of the velocity potentials satisfying the laplace equation and relevant boundary conditions 5 6 and 12 can be written as 13 φ i i g h 2 ω e i k x x b 1 e i k y y z 0 z m 0 z m z i s m

evanescent modes and the propagation modes of the reflected waves on the right hand side of eq 16 the term includes the evanescent modes and the propagation modes of the transmitted waves the waves corresponding to the real β mi are evanescent waves exponentially decaying with increase of distance from the breakwater when β 00 ik 0x the propagation waves are the zeroth reflected and transmitted waves the zeroth reflected wave propagates along the mirror reflection direction of the incident wave and the zeroth transmitted wave propagates along the extended line direction of the incident wave the propagation waves corresponding to the pure imaginary β 0i are multiple reflected and transmitted waves propagating along different directions teng et al 2004 have found the behaviour of multiple reflected waves propagating along different directions when they studied the wave interacting with a periodic array of perforated caissons it was indicated that the existence of partition walls inside caissons might lead to multiple reflected waves propagating along different directions referring to the studies by fernyhough and evans 1995 and liu et al 2016 the total number of reflected waves and the total number of transmitted waves are both equal to m 1 m 2 1 where m 1 int k 0 l 1 sin θ 0 2 π and m 2 int k 0 l 1 sin θ 0 2 π the symbol int denotes the integer part of the variables furthermore the included angles θ n m 1 n m 2 between the propagating directions of the n th reflected wave transmitted wave and the x axis satisfy sin θ n sin θ 0 2 n π k 0 l the relation between the incident wave and the n th reflected wave is classified into four different cases which are sketched in fig a1 in appendix a the relation between the incident wave and the n th transmitted wave is also classified into four different cases which are sketched in fig a2 in appendix a from eq 18 the total number of reflected and transmitted waves is a function of the wave number k 0 the incident wave angle θ 0 and the ctc length l with the variations of k 0 θ 0 and l there may exist multiple reflected and transmitted waves leading to abrupt changes of the wave reflection and transmission coefficients and wave force details will be discussed in section 4 in eqs 13 16 e i y and c j y are the y direction eigenfunctions and z m z m 0 1 2 are the depth dependent eigenfunctions they are

solution then we consider several special cases of the present solution and compare with previous analytical solutions in the literature linton and evans 1993 fernyhough and evans 1995 porter and evans 1995 linton and evans 1993 and porter and evans 1996 3 1 convergence examination to understand the convergence of the present analytical solution the two truncated numbers m and n are carefully examined the method is to fix one of truncated numbers m n while the other n m truncated number varies typical results for c r and c t are listed in tables 2 4 at a fixed truncated number n 5 with different m the calculations for a fixed truncated number m with different n are also conducted but are not presented here in tables 2 4 the calculation parameters used in the two cases are as follows a d 0 2 b 1 d 0 6 b 2 d 0 6 c d 1 0 θ 0 π 6 and h a d 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 the above results show that the convergence is good at different drafts of the side plates it is confirmed that the truncated numbers m 60 and n 5 are able to produce three figure accuracy hence they are adopted in the following calculations unless otherwise stated 3 2 comparisons with previous solutions when the immersed depth of the side plate h a is equal to zero the present problem becomes water wave scattering by a periodic array of rectangular blocks which has been investigated by fernyhough and evans 1995 using the galerkin approximation method the calculated results of r n t n and c t 2 by the present solution are compared with fernyhough and evans 1995 in fig 5 we can see that the results of the two solutions are in good agreement when the immersed depth of the side plate h a and the values of b 1 and b 2 all approach zero the ctc breakwater becomes an infinite periodic array of equally spaced segment offshore breakwaters this has been studied by porter and evans 1996 for the special case of segment offshore breakwaters the comparisons of r n and t n between the present analytical solution and that of porter and evans 1996 are presented in fig 6 in our present solution very small chamber widths of b 1 b 2 0 0001 are adopted it is seen from the figure that the results of the two analytical solutions are in good agreement fig 6 a shows that at θ 0 0 higher modes of reflected and transmitted waves appear at wave numbers k 0 d 2nπ n 1 2 and r n t n for n 1 when the immersed depth of the side plate h a and the length of the rectangular caisson c both approach zero the present solution becomes the special case of wave scattering by an infinite periodic array of identical parallel thin plates the scattering of acoustic waves by such periodic parallel thin plates has been reported by linton and evans 1993 the mathematical solutions for the scattering problems of linear water waves and acoustic waves are essentially the same thus the present solution and the solution of linton and evans 1993 for identical parallel thin plates are compared in fig 7 again the two solutions agree well each other porter and evans 1995 have studied the wave action on a partially immersed thin barrier by using the multi term galerkin approximation method when the waves are normally incident and the values of b 1 b 2 and c all approach zero the present solution becomes the special case of normal wave action on a partially immersed barrier we compare the c r and c t calculated by the present solution with that of porter and evans 1995 as shown in fig 8 here very small chamber widths of b 1 b 2 0 0001 are adopted again it can be seen from fig 8 that the agreements of the two different solutions are good 4 results and discussion in this section we present results to investigate the influences on hydrodynamic quantities i e c r c t c fx and c fy of the relative front wave chamber width b 1 l the side plate location b 1 b 1 b 2 the immersed depth of the side plate h a d the length of the side plate a d the incident wave angle θ 0 and the wave number k 0 the dimensionless free surface elevations near the ctc breakwater are also analysed a dimensionless length of the rectangular caisson c d 1 is adopted in the following calculations unless otherwise indicated 4 1 reflection and transmission coefficients the effects of b 1 l on the c r and c t are presented in fig 9 a wave number k 0 d 1 5 and an incident wave angle θ 0 π 4 are considered the parameters of the breakwater are b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 and h a d 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 here the wide range of b 1 l is used to illustrate the periodicity and the large values of b 1 l are not of interest in practical engineering in fig 9 the c r and c t curves vary periodically with b 1 l the periodic variation has local peaks or valleys due to the wave phase difference between the front wall of the rectangular caisson and the side plates the periodic variations are also observed for other incident wave angles it is noteworthy that the c t is close to 1 at b 1 l 0 5 0 25n n 0 1 2 in fig 9 b the main reason is that there exists a distance b 1 between the front wall and side plate giving rise to a phase difference between waves acting on the front wall and the side plate when the wave phase difference between the waves reflected by the front wall and side plate is close to π 2 the wave superpose there and counteract at some distance away from the breakwater leading to a very low reflection wave transmission being nearly 1 accordingly furthermore when the immersed depth of side plate h a d is less than 0 4 the opening area beneath the side plate is large and most of wave energy transmits into the habour the trend of c r versus b 1 l in fig 9 a are completely opposite to that of c r versus b 1 l in fig 9 b the curves of c r versus b 1 l have similar trends at different h a d the difference is that when h a d increases the c r and c t curves move upwards and downwards in the figure respectively in fig 10 the variations of c r and c t versus b 1 b 1 b 2 are plotted at h a d 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 according to engineering practice niu et al 2003 the relative width of the rectangular caisson is fixed at b 1 b 2 d 2 a wave number k 0 d 1 5 is adopted the reflection coefficient c r first decreases to a minimum value then increases and finally levels off with the increasing b 1 b 1 b 2 the c r and c t curves vary in opposing ways due to energy conservation notably the c r and c t curves at different h a d are symmetrical about the axis of b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 additional calculations are conducted and confirmed the symmetrical phenomena about the axis of b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 under different incident wave angles similar symmetrical phenomena of c r and c t curves have been explained by mei 2005 who investigated the reciprocity relations of c r and c t between two diffraction problems more details on the reciprocity relations can be found in linton and mciver 2001 in fig 10 we examine the effect of b 1 b 1 b 2 on c r and c t at a fixed incident wave number of k 0 d 1 5 to further consider different wave numbers the variations of c r and c t versus k 0 d at various b 1 b 1 b 2 are presented in fig 11 the value of h a d is fixed at 0 5 due to the symmetry phenomenon of the c r and c t curves only b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 0 6 0 8 and 1 are plotted for long period waves small values of k 0 d c r increases rapidly to a peak value when k 0 d continues to increase c r decreases and local minima of c r is observed notably it is found that c r changes abruptly at k 0 d 2 31 which will be discussed later at large k 0 d the c r approaches unity for different b 1 b 1 b 2 for long and short period waves in fig 11 the c r and c t are almost the same with b 1 b 1 b 2 afterwards when k 0 d is between 1 25 and 2 0 the variation trends of c r and c t with increasing b 1 b 1 b 2 are similar to those at k 0 d 1 5 in fig 10 comparisons between figs 10 b and fig 11 b suggest that to obtain a good sheltering function of a ctc breakwater in engineering applications small wave transmission coefficient c t is required an optimum range for b 1 b 1 b 2 which is far away from 0 5 fig 10 b is recommended when k 0 d ranges from 1 25 to 2 0 fig 11 b in fig 11 abrupt changes become evident in the different b 1 b 1 b 2 around k 0 d 2 31 in order to understand the abrupt changes the zeroth and negative first reflection and transmission coefficients versus k 0 d are plotted at h a d 0 5 and 0 6 in fig 12 in general the wave energies of the zeroth reflected wave and zeroth transmitted wave are dominant at different h a d near k 0 d 2 31 the negative first reflected wave r 1 and the negative first transmitted wave t 1 appear a portion of the wave energy transfers from the zeroth wave mode to the negative first wave mode when k 0 d 3 the curves of r n and t n for different of h a d overlap comparison between figs 11 and 12 shows that all the abrupt changes in c r and c t occur at k 0 d 2 31 and the negative first reflected and transmitted waves appear thus the interactions of multiple propagation waves lead to abrupt changes in c r and c t as indicated in eq 18 the wave frequencies where c r and c t change abruptly correspond to β 0 i 0 i 0 1 2 and the corresponding wave frequencies can be calculated by k 0 d 2 i π d 1 sin θ l i 0 1 2 fig 13 shows the variations of c r and c t versus k 0 d at different h a d the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 and θ 0 π 4 as presented in fig 13 when h a d increases from 0 4 to 0 8 the general variations of c r and c t curves share a similar trend for small values of k 0 d long period waves the values of c r and c t approximately coincide as h a d increases when k 0 d is larger than 0 25 c r increases and c t decreases with the increase of h a d at large values of k 0 d the reflection coefficient c r is almost the same except for when h a d 0 2 for the special h a d 0 2 the shape of c r curve is quite different from other cases and two obvious local peaks are observed the c r and c t versus k 0 d at different side plate lengths a d are presented in fig 14 the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 h a d 0 5 a d 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 and θ 0 π 4 when k 0 d 1 5 c r decreases monotonically while c t increases with the increase of a d however when k 0 d 1 5 the variation trends of c r and c t versus a d are opposite to the above cases with k 0 d 1 5 notably the wave frequency decreases with the increase of a d when c t changes abruptly for the red dotted line with a d 0 5 we clearly observe two abrupt change this behaviour is attributed to the negative first reflected and transmitted waves r 1 and t 1 occurring at k 0 d 1 85 and the negative second reflected and transmitted waves r 2 and t 2 occurring at k 0 d 3 69 the effects of the incident wave angle θ 0 on c r and c t are shown in fig 15 the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 h a d 0 5 and different θ 0 at small values of k 0 d c r decreases with increasing θ 0 while the variation of c t shows an opposite tendency however when k 0 d is larger than 1 25 c r increases and c t decreases with the increase of θ 0 at large values of k 0 d the c r and c t curves tend to coincide except for abrupt changes notably the wave frequencies decrease with the increase of θ 0 when c t changes abruptly 4 2 total wave forces fig 16 shows the effects of b 1 l on c fx and c fy for different h a d the calculation conditions are b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 h a d 0 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 k 0 d 1 5 and θ 0 π 4 from fig 16 the horizontal wave force c fx initially decreases to local minima with the increase of b 1 l afterwards with the increase of b 1 l c fx slightly increases to a local peak and then reach a small minimum value the c fx and c fy versus b 1 l vary periodically when h a d equals zero see red solid line the present structure forms a periodic array of equally spaced rectangular caissons the curves of c fx and c fy for h a d 1 represent the wave forces acting on a non open ctc see red dashed line in the engineering interest range of b 1 l 0 5 the horizontal wave force c fx on the ctc breakwater is smaller than that on the rectangular caisson h a d 0 for most cases in addition comparisons between figs 16 and 9 show that the variations of c fx and c fy versus b 1 l are somewhat similar to those of c r and c t versus b 1 l the wave forces c fx and c fy versus k 0 d are examined in fig 17 side plate locations b 1 b 1 b 2 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 and 1 are considered the other calculation parameters are fixed at b 1 b 2 d 2 a d 0 3 h a d 0 5 and θ 0 π 4 the wave forces c fx and c fy first increase to their maximum values and then decrease rapidly with the increase of wave number k 0 d finally the wave forces c fx tend to be constant when b 1 b 1 b 2 increases for long period waves small wave numbers k 0 d c fx and c fy change slightly at moderate values of k 0 d c fx decreases while the peak value of c fy increases with increasing b 1 b 1 b 2 in fig 17 a the red solid line shows wave forces acting on the vertical wall breakwater it is seen that c fx on the ctc is smaller than those on the vertical wall breakwater for most cases however at approximately k 0 d 2 31 the c fx becomes even larger than those on the vertical wall breakwater due to the abrupt changes of wave force caused by interactions of multiple propagation waves c fx and c fy versus k 0 d for different h a d are presented in fig 18 the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 and θ 0 π 4 for small wave numbers c fx increases monotonically with the increase of h a d such an increasing behaviour is because that for a small immersed depth of the side plate h a d more wave energy can pass through the gap rather than waves directly acting on the front wall of the ctc meanwhile the transmitted waves induce wave forces on the back wall of the ctc in an opposite direction of incident wave leading to a reduction in c fx when k 0 d continues to increase the wave forces c fx change slightly with increasing h a d as k 0 d 2 31 the wave forces c fx are approximately constant and the change in h a d does not lead to notable variation of the wave forces c fy the effects of a d on c fx and c fy are plotted in fig 19 when a d increases the wave force c fx generally decreases and the peak value of c fy decreases for the red dashed line of a d 0 5 we observe two abrupt changes due to the interactions of multiple propagation waves the effects of θ 0 on c fx and c fy are presented in fig 20 which shows that c fx decreases with increasing θ 0 at small wave numbers k 0 d at moderate wave numbers the variation of c fx with θ 0 is complex the c fy corresponding to θ 0 π 4 is larger than those subjected to other incident wave angles when θ 0 0 c fy is equal to zero which is not presented in fig 20 b 4 3 wave forces on the side plates the two side plates are the weak components in a comb type caisson under wave actions investigations on the structure stress acting on the side plates and internal stress distribution of the side plates have already presented by wang et al 2001 and zhang et al 2002 using experimental and numerical methods for investigations on wave forces on side plates the variations of c fx14 and c fx36 versus k 0 d at different h a d are presented in fig 21 where c fx14 f x1 f x4 ρghld acting on the right side plate and c fx36 f x3 f x6 ρghld acting on the left side plate when k 0 d 2 31 c fx14 and c fx36 increase with the increase of h a d for large k 0 d the wave forces on the two sides change little for different h a d the wave forces c fx14 and c fx36 versus k 0 d at different side plate lengths a d are plotted in fig 22 if the wave frequencies wave number are not close to the wave frequencies where the c fx14 and c fx36 values change abruptly the side plate length a d has little influence on c fx14 and c fx36 in figs 21 and 22 c fx14 and c fx36 on the two side plates are very close and they are much less than the total wave forces c fx on the ctc 4 4 free surface elevations the contours of the dimensionless free surface elevation η a a h 2 near the ctc breakwater are presented in fig 23 28 for different wave numbers the contours of the dimensionless free surface elevation η a vary periodically along the y direction therefore only six ctcs are plotted in fig 23 θ 0 0 and fig 24 θ 0 π 4 only the zeroth reflected wave and zeroth transmitted wave exist in the fluid domain thus the contours of the free surface elevation in front of the breakwater are essentially the superposition of the wave heights of the incident wave and the zeroth reflected wave a wave concentration occurs inside the wave chamber comparing fig 23 with fig 24 the values of the free surface elevation in the vicinity of the breakwater decrease when the wave train is obliquely incident similar phenomenon is also observed by peter and melyn 2007 as they numerically studied waves interacting with a periodic array of caissons with irregular shape in fig 25 the incident wave number k 0 d 3 5 is considered as discussed before the zeroth reflected wave the zeroth transmitted wave the negative first reflected wave and the negative first transmitted wave coexist at this wave frequency thus due to the superposition of multiple reflected waves in front of the breakwater the contours of the free surface elevation in fig 25 become more complex the free surface elevation η a inside the region of the front wave chamber is smaller compared with those in fig 24 k 0 d 1 5 for short period waves at large values of k 0 d the wave energy can hardly reach the rear wave chamber therefore the free surface elevation η a inside the harbour basin are very small in fig 26 the values of free surface elevation clearly increase with the increase of b 1 d compared with those in fig 24 in fig 26 the maximum values of the free surface elevation are approximately 3 times the wave amplitude inside the front wave chamber as determined analytically it is noted that the measured free surface elevations in the vicinity of breakwater should be much lower than those predicted by the analytical solutions when the incident waves propagated through a periodic array of identical caissons takahashi et al 1989 kagemoto et al 1999 pullin and joubert 2006 in fig 27 the contours of η a at h a d 0 2 are plotted the free surface elevations at a distance away from the breakwater in figs 24 and 27 are almost the same which lead to the same c r and c t as presented in fig 10 b 1 d b 2 d 1 0 however the free surface elevations inside the front wave chamber of the breakwater in fig 27 are obviously smaller than those in fig 24 h a d 0 5 while free surface elevations inside the rear wave chamber of breakwater are similar with those in fig 24 note that in figs 23 24 26 and 27 at k 0 d 1 5 there is a wave energy focus just after corner of the rectangular caisson near the exit of rear wave chamber the wave energy focus is attributed to the wave diffraction from each corner of the rectangular caisson a similar phenomenon was observed by dalrymple et al 2000 in an investigation of oblique incident wave propagating through channels for a clearer view a 3d sketch of free surface elevations η a in fig 28 is presented the calculation parameters are the same as those in fig 27 the 3d plot displays the free surface elevations by a colour bar and altitude along the z directions at the inlet of the front wave chamber the free surface elevations are smaller than those in front of the side plate the reason is that the wave propagates and interacts with the ctc breakwater forming uprising water due to the constraint in the front wave chamber it can be seen that the free surface elevation near the outlet of the rear wave chamber are larger than those near the back of the rectangular caisson this is because that the wave propagates from the confined chamber to an opening area and the wave energy spreads overall the comb type breakwater with an optimal configuration can effectively reduce the free surface elevations 5 conclusions in this study a 3d analytical solution has been established for oblique wave interaction with comb type caisson breakwaters using matched eigenfunction expansions based on linear potential theory formulae for calculating the hydrodynamic quantities of the breakwater have been developed the convergence of the new analytical solution is confirmed for various immersed depths of the side plate the accuracy of the present analytical solution has been validated against previous results in literature typical calculation examples have been presented to examining the influences of the wave parameters and structural parameters on hydrodynamic quantities the main conclusions are listed as follows among the main influencing factors the hydrodynamic quantities the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t and wave forces c fx and c fy are highly dependent on the relative wave chamber width b 1 l the length of the side plate a d and the incident wave angle θ 0 have certain influence on the hydrodynamic quantities it has been found that the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients with side plate location b 1 b 1 b 2 are symmetrical about the axis of b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 the variation trend of wave force c fx versus b 1 b 1 b 2 is opposite to that of wave force c fy the c fx increases and c fy remains almost the same as the increase of immersed depth h a d the horizontal wave forces in x direction on two side plates are almost the same the existence of periodic array of rectangular caissons may lead to multiple reflected and transmitted waves propagating along different directions the total number of reflected and transmitted waves depends on the wave number the incident wave angle and the length of comb type caisson at wave frequencies corresponding to k 0 d 2 i π d 1 sin θ l i 0 1 2 the hydrodynamic quantities change abruptly the abrupt changes in the hydrodynamic quantities are identified to be attributed to interactions of multiple propagation waves compared with the case of normally incident waves oblique waves give rise to the decrease of the free surface elevations decrease for short period waves the contours of the free surface elevations become more complex due to the superposition of multiple propagation waves the wave concentration becomes significant as the wave chamber width and the immersed depth of the side plates this study provides a better understanding of the hydrodynamic performance of comb type caisson breakwaters under oblique incident waves the fast predictions by the present analytical solution with rather low computational efforts can be a useful tool for preliminary design the proposed analytical solution can also be applied for other periodic array of equally spaced identical caissons due to the limitations of linear potential theory breaking waves cannot be considered for the complex free surface wave action on breakwater three dimensional numerical simulations based on navier stokes equations become necessary which are being carried out

22670,this paper presents a three dimensional 3d analytical solution for oblique wave interaction with a periodic array of specific caissons connected with partially immersed thin walls comb type

caisson breakwaters in preliminary design due to its high computing efficiency keywords comb type caisson periodic boundary condition analytical solution reflection and transmission coefficients wave force free surface elevation 1 introduction recently some new types of gravity caisson breakwaters have been constructed to protect harbours and provide safe harbourage one of them is comb type caisson ctc breakwater comprising uniform ctcs the concept of the ctc was initially proposed in the late 1990s li et al 2002 it is named the ctc breakwater because from the top view it looks like a comb the ctc breakwater has been successfully applied in the port area of da yao bay dalian china fig 1 the ctc consisting of a rectangular caisson and two thin side plates fig 2 evolves from the conventional rectangular caisson with part of the rectangular caisson replaced by side plates the ctc breakwater has two structure types i e a non open type ctc with the side plates directly connected to the seabed and an open ctc with the side plates immersed to a certain depth relative to the traditional rectangular caisson the ctc can save engineering investment and reduce the requirement of foundation bearing capacity niu et al 2003 because the rectangular caisson is partially replaced by side plates and has a smaller base area most importantly the gap beneath the side plates allow the pass of current which can significantly reduce the flow velocity near the breakwater entrance guaranteeing the navigation safety in addition the reflection coefficient and wave forces acting on the ctc breakwater are smaller than that of the traditional caisson breakwater li et al 2002 and thus the stability against sliding of the structure can be enhanced the reductions of wave reflection and wave forces acting on ctc are mainly due to two reasons first there exist a distance between front wall of rectangular caisson and side plates which gives rise to a wave phase difference between the front wall of caisson and on the side plates hence the horizontal wave forces on the front wall and side plate cannot reach their peaks simultaneously second the opening area beneath the side plate allows a small portion of seawater entering into the harbour meanwhile a small portion of wave energy transmits into the harbour rather than wave directly acting on the caisson and the transmitted waves induce wave force acting on the back wall of the caisson and side plates leading to the reduction of total horizontal wave force various experimental and numerical studies have been conducted niu et al 2003 reviewed the development and construction of comb type caisson breakwater and presented a comparison between comb type caisson and traditional rectangular caisson through physical model tests their results showed that under similar incident wave conditions the width of comb type caisson was almost the same as width of the traditional caisson li et al 2002 and dong et al 2003 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate the wave reflection and wave forces acting on ctc breakwaters based on experimental results empirical formulae were proposed to calculate the reflection coefficient and wave forces on the ctc breakwaters fang et al 2011 used physical model tests and numerical simulations to study the wave transmission and the distribution of the wave pressure on the surface of ctc breakwaters under irregular wave conditions these authors also provided an empirical formula to calculate the transmission coefficient recently zang et al 2018 numerically and experimentally investigated the critical conditions for the appearance of impulsive wave forces acting on the ctc breakwaters then these researchers presented useful suggestions on improving the hydrodynamic performance of the ctc breakwater the above studies mainly focused on the experimental and numerical investigations under normally incident waves the analytical solution of wave acting on the periodic array of ctc under different incident wave angles has not been developed however the analytical studies of wave interacting with a periodic array of equally spaced identical caissons have been presented which are helpful for developing the analytical solution evans and linton 1993 proved the existence of edge waves travelling along a periodic array of equally spaced identical thin barriers connecting by a vertical wall in the rear evans and fernyhough 1995 further examined the edge wave interacting with a coastal structure the coastal structure was very similar to a non open comb type structure these authors paid considerable attention to the edge waves propagating along the coastline and decaying exponentially away from the coastline however the wave reflection wave transmission or wave forces acting on the structure were not investigated fernyhough and evans 1995 studied the wave reflection and transmission of a periodic array of equally spaced rectangular caissons porter and evans 1996 examined incident wave interacting a periodic array of segment offshore breakwaters based on linear potential theory and found that the number of reflected and transmitted waves were dependent on the angle of incidence and the ratio of the wavelength to the period of the structure a review on the computation progress and understanding of wave interacting with an array of offshore structures was presented by mciver 2002 previous studies on waves interacting with a periodic array of equally spaced identical caissons are actually two dimensional 2d solutions of boundary value problem in this study we will develop a 3d analytical solution for wave interacting with open ctc breakwaters under different incident wave angles the present 3d solution is capable of considering the periodicity along the longitudinal direction of the breakwater and the existence of partially immersed side plates to simplify the mathematical derivation a periodic boundary condition evans and linton 1993 evans and fernyhough 1995 is employed this article is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equation and boundary conditions for wave interacting with ctc breakwaters under different incident wave angles are presented the matched eigenfunction expansion method is used to solve the present problem the formulae of hydrodynamic quantities are presented in section 3 the convergence of the new analytical solution is examined and the analytical solution is validated against previous results in section 4 the effects of wave and structural parameters on the hydrodynamic quantities are investigated finally the main conclusions of this study are drawn 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 boundary value problem the oblique incident wave interacting ctc breakwater consisting of an array of uniform ctcs is shown in fig 2 the front wave chamber with width b 1 is formed by the front half parts of adjacent rectangular caissons and side plates the rear wave chamber with width b 2 is formed by the latter half parts of adjacent rectangular caissons and the side plates the water depth is of constant d while the bottom of the side plate is located at a distance b away from the seabed thus the immersed depth of the side plate is h a d b the components for one unit of the ctc are presented in the upper left corner of fig 2 the length of the rectangular caisson is c and the length of the side plate is a the total length of the ctc is l 2a c the thickness of the side plate is assumed to be zero since it is much smaller than the incident wavelength a cartesian coordinate system is chosen with its original point is located at the intersection of the side plate the lateral face of the rectangular caisson and the still water level the x y plane is at the still water level with the z axis pointing vertically upwards the y axis points towards the length direction of the breakwater wave trains with wave height h and wavelength l are obliquely incident at an angle θ 0 0 θ 0 π 2 based on potential theory the velocity potential φ x y z t can be used to describe the wave motion problem by considering linear harmonic waves with an angular frequency ω the time factor e i ω t can be separated from the velocity potential φ x y z t wave pressure p x y z t and wave elevation ξ x y t thus we obtain 1 φ x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t 2 p x y z t re p x y z e i ω t 3 ξ x y t re η x y e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the variable and i 1 ϕ x y z p x y z and η x y are the complex spatial velocity potential wave pressure and wave elevation respectively which are independent of the time t in the fluid domain the spatial complex velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation 4 2 ϕ x y z x 2 2

components of the wave number k 0 in the x direction and y direction correspond to k x k 0 cos θ 0 and k y k 0 sin θ 0 respectively owing to the periodic geometry features of the ctc breakwater with a

corresponding to the real β mi are evanescent waves exponentially decaying with increase of distance from the breakwater when β 00 ik 0x the propagation waves are the zeroth reflected and transmitted waves the zeroth reflected wave propagates along the mirror reflection direction of the incident wave and the zeroth transmitted wave propagates along the extended line direction of the incident wave the propagation waves corresponding to the pure imaginary β 0i are multiple reflected and transmitted waves propagating along different directions teng et al 2004 have found the behaviour of multiple reflected waves propagating along different directions when they studied the wave interacting with a periodic array of perforated caissons it was indicated that the existence of partition walls inside caissons might lead to multiple reflected waves propagating along different directions referring to the studies by fernyhough and evans 1995 and liu et al 2016 the total number of reflected waves and the total number of transmitted waves are both equal to m 1 m 2 1 where m 1 int k 0 l 1 sin θ 0 2 π and m 2 int k 0 l 1 sin θ 0 2 π the symbol int denotes the integer part of the variables furthermore the included angles θ n m 1 n m 2 between the propagating directions of the n th reflected wave transmitted wave and the x axis satisfy sin θ n sin θ 0 2 n π k 0 l the relation between the incident

classified into four different cases which are sketched in fig a2 in appendix a from eq 18 the total number of reflected and transmitted waves is a function of the wave number k 0 the incident wave angle θ 0 and the ctc length l with the variations of k 0 θ 0 and l there may exist multiple reflected and transmitted waves leading to abrupt changes of the wave reflection and transmission

solution then we consider several special cases of the present solution and compare with previous analytical solutions in the literature linton and evans 1993 fernyhough and evans 1995 porter and evans 1995 linton and evans 1993 and porter and evans 1996 3 1 convergence examination to understand the convergence of the present analytical solution the two truncated numbers m and n are carefully examined the method is to fix one of truncated numbers m n while the other n m truncated number varies typical results for c r and c t are listed in tables 2 4 at a fixed truncated number n 5 with different m the calculations for a fixed truncated number m with different n are also conducted but are not presented here in tables 2 4 the calculation parameters used in the two cases are as follows a d 0 2 b 1 d 0 6 b 2 d 0 6 c d 1 0 θ 0 π 6 and h a d 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 the above results show that the convergence is good at different drafts of the side plates it is confirmed that the truncated numbers m 60 and n 5 are able to produce three figure accuracy hence they are adopted in the following calculations unless otherwise stated 3 2 comparisons with previous solutions when the immersed depth of the side plate h a is equal to zero the present problem becomes water wave scattering by a periodic array of rectangular blocks which has been investigated by fernyhough and evans 1995 using the galerkin approximation method the calculated results of r n t n and c t 2 by the present solution are compared with fernyhough and evans 1995 in fig 5 we can see that the results of the two solutions are in good agreement when the immersed depth of the side plate h a and the values of b 1 and b 2 all approach zero the ctc breakwater becomes an infinite periodic array of equally spaced segment offshore breakwaters this has been studied by porter and evans 1996 for the special case of segment offshore breakwaters the comparisons of r n and t n between the present analytical solution and that of porter and evans 1996 are presented in fig 6 in our present solution very small chamber widths of b 1 b 2 0 0001 are adopted it is seen from the figure that the results of the two analytical solutions are in good agreement fig 6 a shows that at θ 0 0 higher modes of reflected and transmitted waves appear at wave numbers k 0 d 2nπ n 1 2 and r n t n for n 1 when the immersed depth of the side plate h a and the length of the rectangular caisson c both approach zero the present solution becomes the special case of wave scattering by an infinite periodic array of identical parallel thin plates the scattering of acoustic waves by such periodic parallel thin plates has been reported by linton and evans 1993 the mathematical solutions for the scattering problems of linear water waves and acoustic waves are essentially the same thus the present solution and the solution of linton and evans 1993 for identical parallel thin plates are compared in fig 7 again the two solutions agree well each other porter and evans 1995 have studied the wave action on a partially immersed thin barrier by using the multi term galerkin approximation method when the waves are normally incident and the values of b 1 b 2 and c all approach zero the present solution becomes the special case of normal wave action on a partially immersed barrier we compare the c r and c t calculated by the present solution with that of porter and evans 1995 as shown in fig 8 here very small chamber widths of b 1 b 2 0 0001 are adopted again it can be seen from fig 8 that the agreements of the two different solutions are good 4 results and discussion in this section we present results to investigate the influences on hydrodynamic quantities i e c r c t c fx and c fy of the relative front wave chamber width b 1 l the side plate location b 1 b 1 b 2 the immersed depth of the side plate h a d the length of the side plate a d the incident wave angle θ 0 and the wave number k 0 the dimensionless free surface elevations near the ctc breakwater are also analysed a dimensionless length of the rectangular caisson c d 1 is adopted in the following calculations unless otherwise indicated 4 1 reflection and transmission coefficients the effects of b 1 l on the c r and c t are presented in fig 9 a wave number k 0 d 1 5 and an incident wave angle θ 0 π 4 are considered the parameters of the breakwater are b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 and h a d 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 here the wide range of b 1 l is used to illustrate the periodicity and the large values of b 1 l are not of interest in practical engineering in fig 9 the c r and c t curves vary periodically with b 1 l the periodic variation has local peaks or valleys due to the wave phase difference between the front wall of the rectangular caisson and the side plates the periodic variations are also observed for other incident wave angles it is noteworthy that the c t is close to 1 at b 1 l 0 5 0 25n n 0 1 2 in fig 9 b the main reason is that there exists a distance b 1 between the front wall and side plate giving rise to a phase difference between waves acting on the front wall and the side plate when the wave phase difference between the waves reflected by the front wall and side plate is close to π 2 the wave superpose there and counteract at some distance away from the breakwater leading to a very low reflection wave transmission being nearly 1 accordingly furthermore when the immersed depth of side plate h a d is less than 0 4 the opening area beneath the side plate is large and most of wave energy transmits into the habour the trend of c r versus b 1 l in fig 9 a are completely opposite to that of c r versus b 1 l in fig 9 b the curves of c r versus b 1 l have similar trends at different h a d the difference is that when h a d increases the c r and c t curves move upwards and downwards in the figure respectively in fig 10 the variations of c r and c t versus b 1 b 1 b 2 are plotted at h a d 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 according to engineering practice niu et al 2003 the relative width of the rectangular caisson is fixed at b 1 b 2 d 2 a wave number k 0 d 1 5 is adopted the reflection coefficient c r first decreases to a minimum value then increases and finally levels off with the increasing b 1 b 1 b 2 the c r and c t curves vary in opposing ways due to energy conservation notably the c r and c t curves at different h a d are symmetrical about the axis of b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 additional calculations are conducted and confirmed the symmetrical phenomena about the axis of b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 under different incident wave angles similar symmetrical phenomena of c r and c t curves have been explained by mei 2005 who investigated the reciprocity relations of c r and c t between two diffraction problems more details on the reciprocity relations can be found in linton and mciver 2001 in fig 10 we examine the effect of b 1 b 1 b 2 on c r and c t at a fixed incident wave number of k 0 d 1 5 to further consider different wave numbers the variations of c r and c t versus k 0 d at various b 1 b 1 b 2 are presented in fig 11 the value of h a d is fixed at 0 5 due to the symmetry phenomenon of the c r and c t curves only b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 0 6 0 8 and 1 are plotted for long period waves small values of k 0 d c r increases rapidly to a peak value when k 0 d continues to increase c r decreases and local minima of c r is observed notably it is found that c r changes abruptly at k 0 d 2 31 which will be discussed later at large k 0 d the c r approaches unity for different b 1 b 1 b 2 for long and short period waves in fig 11 the c r and c t are almost the same with b 1 b 1 b 2 afterwards when k 0 d is between 1 25 and 2 0 the variation trends of c r and c t with increasing b 1 b 1 b 2 are similar to those at k 0 d 1 5 in fig 10 comparisons between figs 10 b and fig 11 b suggest that to obtain a good sheltering function of a ctc breakwater in engineering applications small wave transmission coefficient c t is required an optimum range for b 1 b 1 b 2 which is far away from 0 5 fig 10 b is recommended when k 0 d ranges from 1 25 to 2 0 fig 11 b in fig 11 abrupt changes become evident in the different b 1 b 1 b 2 around k 0 d 2 31 in order to understand the abrupt changes the zeroth and negative first reflection and transmission coefficients versus k 0 d are plotted at h a d 0 5 and 0 6 in fig 12 in general the wave energies of the zeroth reflected wave and zeroth transmitted wave are dominant at different h a d near k 0 d 2 31 the negative first reflected wave r 1 and the negative first transmitted wave t 1 appear a portion of the wave energy transfers from the zeroth wave mode to the negative first wave mode when k 0 d 3 the curves of r n and t n for different of h a d overlap comparison between figs 11 and 12 shows that all the abrupt changes in c r and c t occur at k 0 d 2 31 and the negative first reflected and transmitted waves appear thus the interactions of multiple propagation waves lead to abrupt changes in c r and c t as indicated in eq 18 the wave frequencies where c r and c t change abruptly correspond to β 0 i 0 i 0 1 2 and the corresponding wave frequencies can be calculated by k 0 d 2 i π d 1 sin θ l i 0 1 2 fig 13 shows the variations of c r and c t versus k 0 d at different h a d the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 and θ 0 π 4 as presented in fig 13 when h a d increases from 0 4 to 0 8 the general variations of c r and c t curves share a similar trend for small values of k 0 d long period waves the values of c r and c t approximately coincide as h a d increases when k 0 d is larger than 0 25 c r increases and c t decreases with the increase of h a d at large values of k 0 d the reflection coefficient c r is almost the same except for when h a d 0 2 for the special h a d 0 2 the shape of c r curve is quite different from other cases and two obvious local peaks are observed the c r and c t versus k 0 d at different side plate lengths a d are presented in fig 14 the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 h a d 0 5 a d 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 and θ 0 π 4 when k 0 d 1 5 c r decreases monotonically while c t increases with the increase of a d however when k 0 d 1 5 the variation trends of c r and c t versus a d are opposite to the above cases with k 0 d 1 5 notably the wave frequency decreases with the increase of a d when c t changes abruptly for the red dotted line with a d 0 5 we clearly observe two abrupt change this behaviour is attributed to the negative first reflected and transmitted waves r 1 and t 1 occurring at k 0 d 1 85 and the negative second reflected and transmitted waves r 2 and t 2 occurring at k 0 d 3 69 the effects of the incident wave angle θ 0 on c r and c t are shown in fig 15 the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 h a d 0 5 and different θ 0 at small values of k 0 d c r decreases with increasing θ 0 while the variation of c t shows an opposite tendency however when k 0 d is larger than 1 25 c r increases and c t decreases with the increase of θ 0 at large values of k 0 d the c r and c t curves tend to coincide except for abrupt changes notably the wave frequencies decrease with the increase of θ 0 when c t changes abruptly 4 2 total wave forces fig 16 shows the effects of b 1 l on c fx and c fy for different h a d the calculation conditions are b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 h a d 0 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 k 0 d 1 5 and θ 0 π 4 from fig 16 the horizontal wave force c fx initially decreases to local minima with the increase of b 1 l afterwards with the increase of b 1 l c fx slightly increases to a local peak and then reach a small minimum value the c fx and c fy versus b 1 l vary periodically when h a d equals zero see red solid line the present structure forms a periodic array of equally spaced rectangular caissons the curves of c fx and c fy for h a d 1 represent the wave forces acting on a non open ctc see red dashed line in the engineering interest range of b 1 l 0 5 the horizontal wave force c fx on the ctc breakwater is smaller than that on the rectangular caisson h a d 0 for most cases in addition comparisons between figs 16 and 9 show that the variations of c fx and c fy versus b 1 l are somewhat similar to those of c r and c t versus b 1 l the wave forces c fx and c fy versus k 0 d are examined in fig 17 side plate locations b 1 b 1 b 2 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 and 1 are considered the other calculation parameters are fixed at b 1 b 2 d 2 a d 0 3 h a d 0 5 and θ 0 π 4 the wave forces c fx and c fy first increase to their maximum values and then decrease rapidly with the increase of wave number k 0 d finally the wave forces c fx tend to be constant when b 1 b 1 b 2 increases for long period waves small wave numbers k 0 d c fx and c fy change slightly at moderate values of k 0 d c fx decreases while the peak value of c fy increases with increasing b 1 b 1 b 2 in fig 17 a the red solid line shows wave forces acting on the vertical wall breakwater it is seen that c fx on the ctc is smaller than those on the vertical wall breakwater for most cases however at approximately k 0 d 2 31 the c fx becomes even larger than those on the vertical wall breakwater due to the abrupt changes of wave force caused by interactions of multiple propagation waves c fx and c fy versus k 0 d for different h a d are presented in fig 18 the calculation parameters are b 1 d b 2 d 1 a d 0 3 and θ 0 π 4 for small wave numbers c fx increases monotonically with the increase of h a d such an increasing behaviour is because that for a small immersed depth of the side plate h a d more wave energy can pass through the gap rather than waves directly acting on the front wall of the ctc meanwhile the transmitted waves induce wave forces on the back wall of the ctc in an opposite direction of incident wave leading to a reduction in c fx when k 0 d continues to increase the wave forces c fx change slightly with increasing h a d as k 0 d 2 31 the wave forces c fx are approximately constant and the change in h a d does not lead to notable variation of the wave forces c fy the effects of a d on c fx and c fy are plotted in fig 19 when a d increases the wave force c fx generally decreases and the peak value of c fy decreases for the red dashed line of a d 0 5 we observe two abrupt changes due to the interactions of multiple propagation waves the effects of θ 0 on c fx and c fy are presented in fig 20 which shows that c fx decreases with increasing θ 0 at small wave numbers k 0 d at moderate wave numbers the variation of c fx with θ 0 is complex the c fy corresponding to θ 0 π 4 is larger than those subjected to other incident wave angles when θ 0 0 c fy is equal to zero which is not presented in fig 20 b 4 3 wave forces on the side plates the two side plates are the weak components in a comb type caisson under wave actions investigations on the structure stress acting on the side plates and internal stress distribution of the side plates have already presented by wang et al 2001 and zhang et al 2002 using experimental and numerical methods for investigations on wave forces on side plates the variations of c fx14 and c fx36 versus k 0 d at different h a d are presented in fig 21 where c fx14 f x1 f x4 ρghld acting on the right side plate and c fx36 f x3 f x6 ρghld acting on the left side plate when k 0 d 2 31 c fx14 and c fx36 increase with the increase of h a d for large k 0 d the wave forces on the two sides change little for different h a d the wave forces c fx14 and c fx36 versus k 0 d at different side plate lengths a d are plotted in fig 22 if the wave frequencies wave number are not close to the wave frequencies where the c fx14 and c fx36 values change abruptly the side plate length a d has little influence on c fx14 and c fx36 in figs 21 and 22 c fx14 and c fx36 on the two side plates are very close and they are much less than the total wave forces c fx on the ctc 4 4 free surface elevations the contours of the dimensionless free surface elevation η a a h 2 near the ctc breakwater are presented in fig 23 28 for different wave numbers the contours of the dimensionless free surface elevation η a vary periodically along the y direction therefore only six ctcs are plotted in fig 23 θ 0 0 and fig 24 θ 0 π 4 only the zeroth reflected wave and zeroth transmitted wave exist in the fluid domain thus the contours of the free surface elevation in front of the breakwater are essentially the superposition of the wave heights of the incident wave and the zeroth reflected wave a wave concentration occurs inside the wave chamber comparing fig 23 with fig 24 the values of the free surface elevation in the vicinity of the breakwater decrease when the wave train is obliquely incident similar phenomenon is also observed by peter and melyn 2007 as they numerically studied waves interacting with a periodic array of caissons with irregular shape in fig 25 the incident wave number k 0 d 3 5 is considered as discussed before the zeroth reflected wave the zeroth transmitted wave the negative first reflected wave and the negative first transmitted wave coexist at this wave frequency thus due to the superposition of multiple reflected waves in front of the breakwater the contours of the free surface elevation in fig 25 become more complex the free surface elevation η a inside the region of the front wave chamber is smaller compared with those in fig 24 k 0 d 1 5 for short period waves at large values of k 0 d the wave energy can hardly reach the rear wave chamber therefore the free surface elevation η a inside the harbour basin are very small in fig 26 the values of free surface elevation clearly increase with the increase of b 1 d compared with those in fig 24 in fig 26 the maximum values of the free surface elevation are approximately 3 times the wave amplitude inside the front wave chamber as determined analytically it is noted that the measured free surface elevations in the vicinity of breakwater should be much lower than those predicted by the analytical solutions when the incident waves propagated through a periodic array of identical caissons takahashi et al 1989 kagemoto et al 1999 pullin and joubert 2006 in fig 27 the contours of η a at h a d 0 2 are plotted the free surface elevations at a distance away from the breakwater in figs 24 and 27 are almost the same which lead to the same c r and c t as presented in fig 10 b 1 d b 2 d 1 0 however the free surface elevations inside the front wave chamber of the breakwater in fig 27 are obviously smaller than those in fig 24 h a d 0 5 while free surface elevations inside the rear wave chamber of breakwater are similar with those in fig 24 note that in figs 23 24 26 and 27 at k 0 d 1 5 there is a wave energy focus just after corner of the rectangular caisson near the exit of rear wave chamber the wave energy focus is attributed to the wave diffraction from each corner of the rectangular caisson a similar phenomenon was observed by dalrymple et al 2000 in an investigation of oblique incident wave propagating through channels for a clearer view a 3d sketch of free surface elevations η a in fig 28 is presented the calculation parameters are the same as those in fig 27 the 3d plot displays the free surface elevations by a colour bar and altitude along the z directions at the inlet of the front wave chamber the free surface elevations are smaller than those in front of the side plate the reason is that the wave propagates and interacts with the ctc breakwater forming uprising water due to the constraint in the front wave chamber it can be seen that the free surface elevation near the outlet of the rear wave chamber are larger than those near the back of the rectangular caisson this is because that the wave propagates from the confined chamber to an opening area and the wave energy spreads overall the comb type breakwater with an optimal configuration can effectively reduce the free surface elevations 5 conclusions in this study a 3d analytical solution has been established for oblique wave interaction with comb type caisson breakwaters using matched eigenfunction expansions based on linear potential theory formulae for calculating the hydrodynamic quantities of the breakwater have been developed the convergence of the new analytical solution is confirmed for various immersed depths of the side plate the accuracy of the present analytical solution has been validated against previous results in literature typical calculation examples have been presented to examining the influences of the wave parameters and structural parameters on hydrodynamic quantities the main conclusions are listed as follows among the main influencing factors the hydrodynamic quantities the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t and wave forces c fx and c fy are highly dependent on the relative wave chamber width b 1 l the length of the side plate a d and the incident wave angle θ 0 have certain influence on the hydrodynamic quantities it has been found that the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients with side plate location b 1 b 1 b 2 are symmetrical about the axis of b 1 b 1 b 2 0 5 the variation trend of wave force c fx versus b 1 b 1 b 2 is opposite to that of wave force c fy the c fx increases and c fy remains almost the same as the increase of immersed depth h a d the horizontal wave forces in x direction on two side plates are almost the same the existence of periodic array of rectangular caissons may lead to multiple reflected and transmitted waves propagating along different directions the total number of reflected and transmitted waves depends on the wave number the incident wave angle and the length of comb type caisson at wave frequencies corresponding to k 0 d 2 i π d 1 sin θ l i 0 1 2 the hydrodynamic quantities change abruptly the abrupt changes in the hydrodynamic quantities are identified to be attributed to interactions of multiple propagation waves compared with the case of normally incident waves oblique waves give rise to the decrease of the free surface elevations decrease for short period waves the contours of the free surface elevations become more complex due to the superposition of multiple propagation waves the wave concentration becomes significant as the wave chamber width and the immersed depth of the side plates this study provides a better understanding of the hydrodynamic performance of comb type caisson breakwaters under oblique incident waves the fast predictions by the present analytical solution with rather low computational efforts can be a useful tool for preliminary design the proposed analytical solution can also be applied for other periodic array of equally spaced identical caissons due to the limitations of linear potential theory breaking waves cannot be considered for the complex free surface wave action on breakwater three dimensional numerical simulations based on navier stokes equations become necessary which are being carried out

22671,the mechanical behavior of coiled tubing in riser systems is critical to success of coiled tubing operations in the development of offshore oil and gas the purpose of this work is to guide the coiled tubing s marine applications by analyzing influencing factors of the coupled system this paper describes a mechanical model of micro elements of the coiled tubing in riser system under force excitation of ocean loads nonlinear equations simplified by finite difference method are solved through the newton raphson iteration method then the analytical analysis is compared with a three dimensional finite element model of the coiled tubing in riser systems to ensure safe operation lateral displacement and internal bending moment of the riser are calculated besides four influencing factors annular clearance ocean depth platform offset and friction coefficient are investigated the results show that strength design of the riser needs to consider the critical position and larger outer diameter of coiled tubing smaller water depth operation smaller platform offset and smaller friction coefficient are preferred to improve the injection efficiency of coiled tubing this research can provide important theoretical support for ocean applications of coiled tubing keywords coiled tubing riser finite difference method influencing factor force excitation 1 introduction coiled tubing ct is gaining more and more attention in the development of offshore oil and gas for its incomparable advantages such as high efficiency low pollution fast moving properties and its technological relevance 2018 guan et al 2018 it can be used in various applications in combination with ct downhole tools such as well flushing drilling milling fishing etc through the injection head the ct and its bottom tool string are commonly injected into a riser for above offshore applications 2012 wang et al 2012 defined as ct in riser systems typical ct in riser systems shown in fig 1 a include a riser and a ct the riser outer pipe is a key equipment to connect floating vessel and blowout preventer bop around subsea wellhead through two flex joints the ct inner pipe is inserted into the riser through an injection head installed on the offshore platform 2018 wang and liu 2018 however the ct would be subject to frictional resistance against riser wall because of internal fouling fish sand plugs or ice blocking due to its low stiffness the ct easily leads to sinusoidal and helical buckling issues during operation 2015 chen et al 2015 moreover with the growth of the interaction force between the inner and outer pipes the ct also affects the stress in the riser of the coupled system resulting in changes of lateral displacement and bending moment of the riser increases of water depth disturbances of wind wave and currents are likely to cause coupled vibration of this columns system which may result in operation s failure and even accidents therefore the mechanical behavior of marine ct in riser systems is important to the success of offshore production operations a number of studies have been conducted on the mechanical behavior of ct in ct in riser systems kuroiwa et al 2002 kuroiwa et al 2002 investigated effect of contact between riser and ct by a finite element method falser et al 2010 falser et al 2010 studied interaction characteristics between compliant guide and ct our research group has also conducted work in this aspect chen et al 2015 2016 2017 2018 chen et al 2015 2016 2017 2018 analyzed how to reduce friction between ct and riser and how to affect ct s axial load under different boundaries and different diameters by experimental study wang et al 2016 2014 2014 wang et al 2014a 2016 xiong et al 2014 investigated the transfer characteristics of axial force of coiled tubing in ct in riser systems wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 built a mathematical model of ct in steel catenary riser systems considering impacts of ct s buckling to discuss the characteristic of axial force with inclined angle s changes the analysis mainly focus on the axial force and contact force on the inner pipe likewise some works have focused on the riser mao et al 2010 mao et al 2016 established a mechanical model of deepwater drilling riser considering actual string configurations wang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 presented a coupled dynamic analysis of deepwater drilling riser under combined force excitation and parametric excitation these studies mainly focus on displacement bending moment and deflection of the riser in marine environment and are less concerned with coupled effect other than this morooka et al 1997 morooka and bueno 1997 presented the calculation method of contact forces using finite elements for modeling the drill column yan and wang et al 2014 2014 yan et al 2014 wang et al 2014b established a mechanical model of coupled system between riser and drill string nevertheless it does not include impacts of ocean loads for ct in riser systems in this paper a coupled mechanical model of ct in riser systems considering ocean loads was built and solved by an analytical method to compare with the calculation results a finite element model was built as shown in fig 1 b to clarify the operating parameter of ct influencing factors about the riser and the ct in the coupled system were investigated this study would provide theoretical support for the ct s operation 2 mechanical models 2 1 marine ct in riser systems there are two types of coiled tubing used in offshore oil and gas field industry i riserless operation using ct executed from a vessel in open water 2015 lasseigne et al 2015 has been mastered by very few companies on the other hand ii ct in a riser where the ct into a marine riser or production riser is the most common method shown in fig 1 a this paper investigates the second type that is a pipe in pipe model commonly the systems suffer force excitation and parametric excitation 2015 wang et al 2015 it is assumed that the offshore platform had a virtuous heave control system and therefore is ignored axial tension resulted from heave motion of the vessel hence the force excitation induced by horizontal ocean wave and current forces mainly is considered in this paper a simplified coupled mechanical model is proposed as shown in fig 2 a using coordinate system is follows origin o is at the top of the riser x axis is horizontal direction and z axis is vertical down injection force f d t starts at the top end of the ct by a ct injector on the platform there is a gap r b between the inner pipe and outer pipes the following assumptions are applied during equation deductions in this paper i friction coefficient is constant ii ct is a homogeneous elastic rod which means that gravity normal stress and friction are distributed evenly iii cross section of the riser and the ct are round which means collapse on cross section is not taken into consideration iv riser and ct are always under linear elastic deformation 2 2 analysis of micro elements the coupled system is subject to ocean current and wave as shown in fig 2 a and the force situation is very complex therefore the systems are simplified and separated according to the recommendation given in 2018 wang et al 2018 and shown in fig 2 b the riser is divided into n equal segments with 0 at the top and n at the bottom random micro elements of the riser and the ct having length ds are described 2014 wang et al 2014b as shown in fig 3 that indicates the forces and bending moments of micro elements under coupled forces in fig 3 a the forces of the micro element on the riser are defined as f rt is tension f rs is shear force and m is bending moment of ds of the riser f μ is friction in the tangent direction between the ct and the riser external load f ws is the influence of current and wave the riser bears gravity f w buoyancy f zs f rd indicates the normal stress between the ct and the riser and θ is the angle of the tangent direction of ds and the z axis three equilibrium equations are obtained through forces analysis including the forces of the x axis the forces of the z axis and the torques in the x z plane in fig 3 b the forces of the micro element of the ct are also defined as f dt indicates the axial force f μ indicates the friction and f z s indicates the buoyancy of the ct θ is the angle of the tangent direction of ds to the z axis as the role of bending moment in ct is not considered two equilibrium equations are obtained the same to the riser 1 analysis of the micro element of the riser firstly a micro segment of the riser is selected for force analysis fig 3 a shows the static balance of forces and bending moments acting on a section of the micro element in the x and z direction respectively besides the moment balance is taken at the center point of the standpipe m three equilibrium equations of the micro element under static balance conditions are shown in equation 1 for an analytic derivation refer to the appendix 1 d d z f rs d x d z d f rt d z f w 1 f μ f rd d x d z 0 d f rs d z d d z f rt d x d z f ws f rd f μ d x d z 0 d d z e i d 2 x d z

friction coefficient between the ct and riser f rd indicates the contact force of the riser per unit length e is modulus of elasticity i is moment of inertia of the section 2 analysis of micro element of the ct analysis of micro segment of the ct is similar to that of the riser two equilibrium equations of the micro element of the ct are shown in equation 2 2 d f dt d z f w 2 a f w 2 d 2 x d z 2 f

outer diameter of the ct 2 3 ocean loads loads due to dynamic process of ocean waves and currents are complex in this study the combined force of waves and currents f w s z in the water depth z are calculated using the morison equation 2015 wang et al 2015 as shown in equation 3 3 f w s z 1 2 c d ρ w d v u v u c m ρ w π d 2 4 a x where d is outer diameter of the riser v is current velocity u is wave velocity a x is wave acceleration along the direction of x axis ρ w is seawater density according to the code for the classification and construction of fixed offshore platforms in china for a circular structure the drag coefficient cd is 0 6 1 2 inertia coefficient cm is 1 3 2 0 in this study c d 1 2 and c m 2 0 are assumed 2014 yan et al 2014 the current velocity v changes with the water depth z as follows 4 v v m h z h v r h z h 1 7 where v m is wind speed v r is tide speed at surface of sea and h is total water depth the wave force is solved by the theory of two dimensional waves 2015 wang et al 2015 the velocity and acceleration components in the direction of x axis can be obtained by the potential function the wave velocity u and wave acceleration a x are shown in equations 5 and 6 respectively 5 u π h t cosh k z h sinh k h cos k x ϖ t 6 a x 2 π 2 h t 2 cosh k z h sinh k h sin k x ϖ t where k is wave number t is wave period ϖ is wave frequency and h is wave height substituting equation 4 6 into equation 3 the forces of wave and current f w s z at any depth could be calculated by equation 7 7 f w s z 1 2 c d ρ w d π h t c h k h z s h k h v m h z h v r h z h 1 7

inner and outer pipe are divided into n segments thus n 1 points are created each point has 4 unknown state variables f r s f r t f d t m so there are 4n 4 unknown state variables in total each segment has 2 unknown variables f r d f u thus there are 2n unknown state variables overall there are m 6n 4 unknown variables in contrast the number of equation is 6n therefore this mechanical model is solved after 4 boundary conditions are applied based on a typical operating condition boundary conditions of the riser are as follows the displacement of the riser top is constant in x direction and there is no displacement of the riser bottom because the riser is hinged at both ends there is no bending moment at each side of the riser 9 x 0 d i s m 0 e i d 2 x d z 2 z 0 0 x h 0 m h e i d 2 x d z 2 z h 0 where h is the depth into ocean dis is the primary displacement of platform in x direction the injection force can be measured by the injection head injecting the ct at the top end of the ct the displacement of the ct at the top end in x direction is similar with that of the riser because the bop is fixed there is no displacement at the bottom of the ct in x direction consequently boundary conditions of the ct are shown in equation 10 10 x 0 d i s f dt 0 c o n v x h 0 where conv is injection force equation 8 is third order nonlinear ordinary differential equation and can be solved by the finite differences method difference quotients are used to replace the differential quotients included the first order the second order and the third order in the mechanical model

iteration method using matlab software 2010 kulworawanichpong 2010 the mechanical properties of the marine ct in riser coupled systems are then obtained 2018 wang et al 2018 3 numerical modeling 3 1 numerical models three dimensional 3d finite element model of the marine ct in riser systems were developed by using abaqus finite element code shown in fig 1 b taking an actual deep water well in the south china sea as an example water depth is 1000 m outside diameter of the riser commonly used in ocean operation 2015 wang et al 2015 is 533 mm and three typical diameters of the ct 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm are selected density of the ct and the riser are both 7850 kg m3 table 1 gives the geometric properties of the inner pipe and outer pipe the riser is modeled using shell elements with six degrees of freedom at each node and the ct is modeled using beam elements with three degrees of freedom at each node in axial direction of the pipeline according to the recommendation method given by literature bi and hao 2016 an element size of 0 48 m is used in the axial direction as a result the ct is divided into 200 elements and the riser is divided into 16448 elements as shown in fig 1 b the material properties of the inner and outer pipes are shown in table 2 the bottom of the riser is fixed x axis and y axis direction and there is no limit to the rotation around the z axis direction the top of the riser only fixed x axis direction referring to literature chen et al 2015 the friction coefficient between the two pipes is defined as 0 3 and the contact type in finite element model is surface to surface according to the api rpsc7 1996 recommended practice for coiled tubing operations in oil and gas well services and the maximum injection force of the injector type is zrt80 the injection force is selected f d t 182 kn in our work 2011 zhao 2011 3 2 wave and current loadings typical ocean conditions are selected from analysis of last 10 years shown in table 3 wind speed is taken as 1 m s and current velocity is taken as 0 5 m s wave height is h 6 5 m wave cycle is t 8 s wave number is k 0 1 substituting the parameter of ocean loads in table 3 into equation 7 distribution of the loads along ocean depth is obtained as shown in equation 12 12 f z 91 57 2 55 e 0 1 z 2 55 0 1 z 200 1 0 001 z 0 5 1 0 001 z 1 7 2 15 38 e 0 1 z 15 38 e 0 1 z 200 because the ocean loads are complicated the equivalent lateral forces of ocean loads are simplified necessarily according to the torque equivalent the riser is divided into 100 sections that each section is 10 m and then the ocean loads are equivalent to 99 different positions thus value of each point s lateral force can be equivalently calculated by equation 13 13 i 10 i 1 10 f z d z f i 10 so that the ocean load of 90 m 100 m pipe section is calculated by equation 13 at the 100 m position 90 100 f z d z f 1 10 and then f 1 15170 4n is obtained for simplicity of the results obtained at 99 positions the typical calculation results are shown in table 4 4 results after the coupled system was solved by the iteration method through matlab software 2018 wang et al 2018 and simulated by the finite element model lateral displacement and bending moment of the riser were considered for riser s operation safety and four influencing factors annular clearance ocean depth platform offset and friction coefficient were analyzed for the ct s injection efficiency 4 1 riser 1 lateral displacement as a large deformation will lead to riser s damage the lateral displacement of the riser is discussed for an injection force of coiled tubing of 95000n an outside diameter of the riser and the ct of 533 mm and 88 9 mm respectively and the initial lateral displacement of the platform assumed to be 5 m the simulation results and calculation results of the lateral displacements of the riser are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the riser occurs deformation under the ocean loads within calculation results of coupled system the maximum lateral displacement occurred at 133 5 m under water of 9 80 m this is because that the ocean loads on the riser in table 4 gradually reduced with the water depth and the ocean wave mainly affects the coupled system less than 133 5 m water depth in addition the bottom of the riser is fixed x axis and y axis direction so the lateral displacement becomes smaller and smaller the simulation results obtained through finite element analysis have a similar trend with calculation results and the maximum lateral displacement is 9 70 m at 120 8 m water depth verifying the validity of the theory according to the above results the deformation range of the ct in riser systems under typical ocean conditions can be controlled within 1 0 of riser s length when the riser strength is designed this critical point should be considered 2 bending moment the bending moment of the riser shown in fig 5 is another sensitive parameter the calculation results in fig 5 show two peaks of the bending moment in the riser 1 98 105 n m at water depth of 53 m and 6 2 104 n m at the water depth of 980 m near the wellhead the bending moment is close to 0 n m at all other depth the simulation results have a similar trend with calculation results and the maximum bending moment of 1 75 105 n m occurs at the water depth of 54 m therefore the critical position from 30 to 100 m below the water surface should be considered in the design process of the riser 4 2 the ct the mechanical behavior of the ct is critical to the successful operation four influencing factors including annular clearance ocean depth platform offset and friction coefficient are discussed below 1 annular clearance effect and validity by simulation results when the diameter of a riser is constant different outer diameters of the ct 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm lead to different annular clearances 196 65 mm 183 95 mm and 170 45 mm due to the location of the injection head on the platform the axial load of ct s top end is defined as force in and the axial load of ct s bottom end as force out 2015 chen et al 2015 the influencing effect on force out of three annular clearances found by calculation from the analytical method described in section 2 is shown in fig 6 for a range of injection forces fig 6 a shows that the force out is an increasing trend with the force in for each annular clearance with the growth of the force in the inner pipe will be subject to sinusoidal buckling or helical buckling the value of the sinusoidal buckling force f c r s and the helical buckling force f c r h can be found from the literature chen et al 2016 so that for instance using the inner pipe of 88 9 mm f c r s is 21400n and f c r h is 30300 n dividing the curve in fig 6 a into two areas a and b the limit value is 24000n in area a as the ct is gradually subject to the initial friction mainly caused by gravity the rate of increase is basically the same for each condition in area b the ct needs to overcome the friction value caused by f r d and then the friction f μ between the inner pipe and the outer pipe can be calculated by equation 14 14 f μ μ 0 l f r d d x the trends of ct s diameters 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm are similar to that of the 88 9 mm when the input force finally reaches 100000n the output force of the three outer diameters of ct at 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm is 34908 3n 54418 5n and 76350 3n respectively to analyze the growing trend of the force out with the force in the transfer efficiency defined as ε f o r c e o u t f o r c e i n is shown in fig 6 b this indicates that the transfer efficiency of 88 9 mm ct is significantly lower than others when the force in exceeds 24000n which is near the critical value of sinusoidal buckling for 88 9 mm ct 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force transfer efficiency of 141 3 mm ct drops slowly after reaching this peak when the input force finally reaches 100000n the transfer efficiencies are respectively 34 9 54 4 and 76 4 for 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm cts fig 6 shows that a smaller annular clearance is more favorable to axial force transmission in other words the axial force transmission of ct in riser systems gradually improves as the outer diameter of the ct increases in order to verify the calculation results comparison of calculation results obtained by the analytical method described in section 2 and simulation results investigated by abaqus in three annular clearances is shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it can be seen that the numerical results basically agree with the abaqus results the maximum error is inner pipe 88 9 mm in the 40000n which is less than 18 the errors between calculation and simulation results may be attributed to systems simplification contact conditions that are uniform contact in mathematical assumptions and surface to surface contact in finite element model and computational errors 2 ocean depth effect in order to study the ocean depth effect three cases of 800 m 1000 m and 1200 m are selected with the ct outer diameter of 88 9 mm fig 8 shows the influencing effect of three ocean depths according to fig 8 a the force out is an increasing trend with force in in area a after the injection force is greater than 22000n 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force of the ct in 800 m water depth is obviously greater than the other two this is mainly caused by the growth of friction f r d with increase of water depth and the value of friction can be calculated by equation 14 when the force in finally reaches 100000n the output force of ct with 800 m 1000 m and 1200 m ocean depths is 43100n 32280n and 34908 3n correspondingly in fig 8 b the transfer efficiency of 800 m water depth decreases slowly after reaching the peak the transfer efficiency of 800 m 1000 m and 1200 m ocean depths is respectively 43 1 32 3 and 34 9 in the maximal force in the above results show that the transfer efficiency of ct s axial force in the ct in riser systems gradually deteriorates with the increase of the depth the ct is more easily deformed and the friction resistance operation increases as the ocean depth increases leading to an increase of operation difficulty 3 platform offset effect to discuss influence of platform offset 1 3 and 5 values of the ocean depth are selected with a depth of 1000 m and a ct s outer diameter of 88 9 mm fig 9 shows the influencing effect of three platform offsets in fig 9 a after the force in is greater than 30000n 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force of the ct in the platform offset of 10 m is obviously greater than that of other two cases the reason is that frictional resistance between ct and riser will rise with the increase of platform offset in a vertical riser and then the transmission of the axial force will be more unfavorable the results are different with results of steel catenary riser scr pipe in pipe system 2018 wang et al 2018 since there is no bending section in vertical riser when the input force reaches 100000n output forces of the ct with 10 m 30 m and 50 m offset are 34407n 32507n and 27726n respectively in fig 9 b the axial force transfer efficiency of 10 m offset is slower after reaching the peak with the transfer efficiency of 10 m 30 m and 50 m offset being respectively 34 4 32 5 and 27 7 at the maximal force in therefore the greater the platform offset deviated from wellhead the worse the transfer efficiency of vertical riser systems 4 friction coefficient effect in order to study the effect of friction coefficient three friction coefficients selected 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 with the depth of 1000 m are selected in this study fig 10 shows the effect of the friction coefficient from fig 10 a after the input force is greater than 30000n 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force with friction coefficient of 0 1 is significantly greater than others this is because that the friction forces do more work as the friction coefficient increase which affects transmission of the axial force it can also be seen in fig 10 b that the axial force transfer efficiency of the ct with friction coefficient of 0 1 reduces relatively slowly after reaching the peak from the results when the input force reaches 100000n the force outs of ct are 38379 63n 34908 3n and 31920 7n and the transfer efficiency are 38 4 34 9 and 31 9 respectively for three friction coefficients of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 therefore the greater the value of the friction coefficient the worse the axial force transmission of the ct in riser systems will be 5 conclusions in present work the influencing factors of the system that ct injects into a marine riser considering coupled effect of ocean wave and current were investigated a coupled mechanical model of ct in riser systems under force excitation was established and was solved by finite difference method and newton raphson iteration methods which is very different with the fixed boundary 2015 chen et al 2015 a 3d finite element model by abaqus finite element code was described to clarify above model lateral displacement and internal bending moment of the riser were explored and strength design and check of the critical position of the riser were provided for reference by analyzing four common influencing factors to improve tubing injection characteristic a larger outer diameter of coiled tubing a smaller water depth operation a smaller platform offset and a smaller friction coefficient are preferred the above results show that focus points of the riser and favored parameters of the ct can be considered by the theory in offshore oil and gas industry two dynamic excitation sources which are force excitation and parametric excitation can affect this coupled system 2015 wang et al 2015 in this study we assumed that the ct tensioner has better control of the axial direction and the parameter excitation is ignored consequently the force excitation by the ocean wave and ocean current only is analyzed in the future we will discuss the effect of the system under two kinds of simultaneous dynamic excitations acknowledgment this work was supported by national natural science foundation of

length of riser section d s r ρ d θ can be concluded from fig 3 a consequently a simplified model shown in equation 1 can be obtained 
22671,the mechanical behavior of coiled tubing in riser systems is critical to success of coiled tubing operations in the development of offshore oil and gas the purpose of this work is to guide the coiled tubing s marine applications by analyzing influencing factors of the coupled system this paper describes a mechanical model of micro elements of the coiled tubing in riser system under force excitation of ocean loads nonlinear equations simplified by finite difference method are solved through the newton raphson iteration method then the analytical analysis is compared with a three dimensional finite element model of the coiled tubing in riser systems to ensure safe operation lateral displacement and internal bending moment of the riser are calculated besides four influencing factors annular clearance ocean depth platform offset and friction coefficient are investigated the results show that strength design of the riser needs to consider the critical position and larger outer diameter of coiled tubing smaller water depth operation smaller platform offset and smaller friction coefficient are preferred to improve the injection efficiency of coiled tubing this research can provide important theoretical support for ocean applications of coiled tubing keywords coiled tubing riser finite difference method influencing factor force excitation 1 introduction coiled tubing ct is gaining more and more attention in the development of offshore oil and gas for its incomparable advantages such as high efficiency low pollution fast moving properties and its technological relevance 2018 guan et al 2018 it can be used in various applications in combination with ct downhole tools such as well flushing drilling milling fishing etc through the injection head the ct and its bottom tool string are commonly injected into a riser for above offshore applications 2012 wang et al 2012 defined as ct in riser systems typical ct in riser systems shown in fig 1 a include a riser and a ct the riser outer pipe is a key equipment to connect floating vessel and blowout preventer bop around subsea wellhead through two flex joints the ct inner pipe is inserted into the riser through an injection head installed on the offshore platform 2018 wang and liu 2018 however the ct would be subject to frictional resistance against riser wall because of internal fouling fish sand plugs or ice blocking due to its low stiffness the ct easily leads to sinusoidal and helical buckling issues during operation 2015 chen et al 2015 moreover with the growth of the interaction force between the inner and outer pipes the ct also affects the stress in the riser of the coupled system resulting in changes of lateral displacement and bending moment of the riser increases of water depth disturbances of wind wave and currents are likely to cause coupled vibration of this columns system which may result in operation s failure and even accidents therefore the mechanical behavior of marine ct in riser systems is important to the success of offshore production operations a number of studies have been conducted on the mechanical behavior of ct in ct in riser systems kuroiwa et al 2002 kuroiwa et al 2002 investigated effect of contact between riser and ct by a finite element method falser et al 2010 falser et al 2010 studied interaction characteristics between compliant guide and ct our research group has also conducted work in this aspect chen et al 2015 2016 2017 2018 chen et al 2015 2016 2017 2018 analyzed how to reduce friction between ct and riser and how to affect ct s axial load under different boundaries and different diameters by experimental study wang et al 2016 2014 2014 wang et al 2014a 2016 xiong et al 2014 investigated the transfer characteristics of axial force of coiled tubing in ct in riser systems wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 built a mathematical model of ct in steel catenary riser systems considering impacts of ct s buckling to discuss the characteristic of axial force with inclined angle s changes the analysis mainly focus on the axial force and contact force on the inner pipe likewise some works have focused on the riser mao et al 2010 mao et al 2016 established a mechanical model of deepwater drilling riser considering actual string configurations wang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 presented a coupled dynamic analysis of deepwater drilling riser under combined force excitation and parametric excitation these studies mainly focus on displacement bending moment and deflection of the riser in marine environment and are less concerned with coupled effect other than this morooka et al 1997 morooka and bueno 1997 presented the calculation method of contact forces using finite elements for modeling the drill column yan and wang et al 2014 2014 yan et al 2014 wang et al 2014b established a mechanical model of coupled system between riser and drill string nevertheless it does not include impacts of ocean loads for ct in riser systems in this paper a coupled mechanical model of ct in riser systems considering ocean loads was built and solved by an analytical method to compare with the calculation results a finite element model was built as shown in fig 1 b to clarify the operating parameter of ct influencing factors about the riser and the ct in the coupled system were investigated this study would provide theoretical support for the ct s operation 2 mechanical models 2 1 marine ct in riser systems there are two types of coiled tubing used in offshore oil and gas field industry i riserless operation using ct executed from a vessel in open water 2015 lasseigne et al 2015 has been mastered by very few companies on the other hand ii ct in a riser where the ct into a marine riser or production riser is the most common method shown in fig 1 a this paper investigates the second type that is a pipe in pipe model commonly the systems suffer force excitation and parametric excitation 2015 wang et al 2015 it is assumed that the offshore platform had a virtuous heave control system and therefore is ignored axial tension resulted from heave motion of the vessel hence the force excitation induced by horizontal ocean wave and current forces mainly is considered in this paper a simplified coupled mechanical model is proposed as shown in fig 2 a using coordinate system is follows origin o is at the top of the riser x axis is horizontal direction and z axis is vertical down injection force f d t starts at the top end of the ct by a ct injector on the platform there is a gap r b between the inner pipe and outer pipes the following assumptions are applied during equation deductions in this paper i friction coefficient is constant ii ct is a homogeneous elastic rod which means that gravity normal stress and friction are distributed evenly iii cross section of the riser and the ct are round which means collapse on cross section is not taken into consideration iv riser and ct are always under linear elastic deformation 2 2 analysis of micro elements the coupled system is subject to ocean current and wave as shown in fig 2 a and the force situation is very complex therefore the systems are simplified and separated according to the recommendation given in 2018 wang et al 2018 and shown in fig 2 b the riser is divided into n equal segments with 0 at the top and n at the bottom random micro elements of the riser and the ct having length ds are described 2014 wang et al 2014b as shown in fig 3 that indicates the forces and bending moments of micro elements under coupled forces in fig 3 a the forces of the micro element on the riser are defined as f rt is tension f rs is shear force and m is bending moment of ds of the riser f μ is friction in the tangent direction between the ct and the riser external load f ws is the influence of current and wave the riser bears gravity f w buoyancy f zs f rd indicates the normal stress between the ct and the riser and θ is the angle of the tangent direction of ds and the z axis three equilibrium equations are obtained through forces analysis including the forces of the x axis the forces of the z axis and the torques in the x z plane in fig 3 b the forces of the micro element of the ct are also defined as f dt indicates the axial force f μ indicates the friction and f z s indicates the buoyancy of the ct θ is the angle of the tangent direction of ds to the z axis as the role of bending moment in ct is not considered two equilibrium equations are obtained the same to the riser 1 analysis of the micro element of the riser firstly a micro segment of the riser is selected for force analysis fig 3 a shows the static balance of forces and bending moments acting on a section of the micro element in the x and z direction respectively besides the moment balance is taken at the center point of the standpipe m three equilibrium equations of the micro element under static balance conditions are

outer diameter of the ct 2 3 ocean loads loads due to dynamic process of ocean waves and currents are complex in this study the combined force of waves and currents f w s z in the water depth z are calculated using the morison equation 2015 wang et al 2015 as shown in equation 3 3 f w s z 1 2 c d ρ w d v u v u c m ρ w π d 2 4 a x where d is outer diameter of the riser v is current velocity u is wave velocity a x is wave acceleration along the direction of x axis ρ w is seawater density according to the code for the classification and construction of fixed offshore platforms in china for a circular structure the drag coefficient cd is 0 6 1 2 inertia coefficient cm is 1 3 2 0 in this study c d 1 2 and c m 2 0 are assumed 2014 yan et al 2014 the current velocity v changes with the water depth z as follows 4 v v m h z h v r h z h 1 7 where v m is wind speed v r is tide speed at surface of sea and h is total water depth the wave force is solved by the theory of two dimensional waves 2015 wang et al 2015 the velocity and acceleration components in the direction of x axis can be obtained by the potential function the wave velocity u and wave acceleration a x are shown in equations

inner and outer pipe are divided into n segments thus n 1 points are created each point has 4 unknown state variables f r s f r t f d t m so there are 4n 4 unknown state variables in total each segment has 2 unknown variables f r d f u thus there are 2n unknown state variables overall there are m 6n 4 unknown variables in contrast the number of equation is 6n therefore this mechanical model is solved after 4 boundary conditions are applied based on a typical operating condition boundary conditions of the riser are as follows the displacement of the riser top is constant in x direction and there is no displacement of the riser bottom because the riser is hinged at both ends there is no bending moment at each side of the riser 9 x 0 d i s m 0 e i d 2 x d z 2 z 0 0 x h 0 m h e i d 2 x d z 2 z h 0 where h is the depth into ocean dis is the primary displacement of platform in x direction the injection force can be measured by the injection head injecting the ct at the top end of the ct the displacement of the ct at the top end in x direction is similar with that of the riser because the bop is fixed there is no displacement at the bottom of the ct in x direction consequently boundary conditions of the ct are shown in equation 10 10 x 0 d i s f dt 0 c o n v x h 0 where conv is injection force equation 8 is third order nonlinear ordinary differential equation and can be solved by the finite differences method difference quotients are used to replace the differential quotients included the first order the second order and the third order in the mechanical model

numerical models three dimensional 3d finite element model of the marine ct in riser systems were developed by using abaqus finite element code shown in fig 1 b taking an actual deep water well in the south china sea as an example water depth is 1000 m outside diameter of the riser commonly used in ocean operation 2015 wang et al 2015 is 533 mm and three typical diameters of the ct 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm are selected density of the ct and the riser are both 7850 kg m3 table 1 gives the geometric properties of the inner pipe and outer pipe the riser is modeled using shell elements with six degrees of freedom at each node and the ct is modeled using beam elements with three degrees of freedom at each node in axial direction of the pipeline according to the recommendation method given by literature bi and hao 2016 an element size of 0 48 m is used in the axial direction as a result the ct is divided into 200 elements and the riser is divided into 16448 elements as shown in fig 1 b the material properties of the inner and outer pipes are shown in table 2 the bottom of the riser is fixed x axis and y axis direction and there is no limit to the rotation around the z axis direction the top of the riser only fixed x axis direction referring to literature chen et al 2015 the friction coefficient between the two pipes is defined as 0 3 and the contact type in finite element model is surface to surface according to the api rpsc7 1996 recommended practice for coiled tubing operations in oil and gas well services and the maximum injection force of the injector type is zrt80 the injection force is selected f d t 182 kn in our work 2011 zhao 2011 3 2 wave and current loadings typical ocean conditions are selected from analysis of last 10 years shown in table 3 wind speed is taken as 1 m s and current velocity is taken as 0 5 m s wave height is h 6 5 m wave cycle is t 8 s wave number is k 0 1 substituting the parameter of ocean loads in table 3 into equation 7 distribution of the loads along ocean depth is obtained as shown in equation 12 12 f z 91 57 2 55 e 0 1 z 2 55 0 1 z 200 1 0 001 z 0 5 1 0 001 z 1 7 2 15 38 e 0 1 z 15 38 e 0 1 z 200 because the ocean loads are complicated the equivalent lateral forces of ocean loads are simplified necessarily according to the torque equivalent the riser is divided into 100 sections that each section is 10 m and then the ocean loads are equivalent to 99 different positions thus value of each point s lateral force can be equivalently calculated by equation 13 13 i 10 i 1 10 f z d z f i 10 so that the ocean load of 90 m 100 m pipe section is calculated by equation 13 at the 100 m position 90 100 f z d z f 1 10 and then f 1 15170 4n is obtained for simplicity of the results obtained at 99 positions the typical calculation results are shown in table 4 4 results after the coupled system was solved by the iteration method through matlab software 2018 wang et al 2018 and simulated by the finite element model lateral displacement and bending moment of the riser were considered for riser s operation safety and four influencing factors annular clearance ocean depth platform offset and friction coefficient were analyzed for the ct s injection efficiency 4 1 riser 1 lateral displacement as a large deformation will lead to riser s damage the lateral displacement of the riser is discussed for an injection force of coiled tubing of 95000n an outside diameter of the riser and the ct of 533 mm and 88 9 mm respectively and the initial lateral displacement of the platform assumed to be 5 m the simulation results and calculation results of the lateral displacements of the riser are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the riser occurs deformation under the ocean loads within calculation results of coupled system the maximum lateral displacement occurred at 133 5 m under water of 9 80 m this is because that the ocean loads on the riser in table 4 gradually reduced with the water depth and the ocean wave mainly affects the coupled system less than 133 5 m water depth in addition the bottom of the riser is fixed x axis and y axis direction so the lateral displacement becomes smaller and smaller the simulation results obtained through finite element analysis have a similar trend with calculation results and the maximum lateral displacement is 9 70 m at 120 8 m water depth verifying the validity of the theory according to the above results the deformation range of the ct in riser systems under typical ocean conditions can be controlled within 1 0 of riser s length when the riser strength is designed this critical point should be considered 2 bending moment the bending moment of the riser shown in fig 5 is another sensitive parameter the calculation results in fig 5 show two peaks of the bending moment in the riser 1 98 105 n m at water depth of 53 m and 6 2 104 n m at the water depth of 980 m near the wellhead the bending moment is close to 0 n m at all other depth the simulation results have a similar trend with calculation results and the maximum bending moment of 1 75 105 n m occurs at the water depth of 54 m therefore the critical position from 30 to 100 m below the water surface should be considered in the design process of the riser 4 2 the ct the mechanical behavior of the ct is critical to the successful operation four influencing factors including annular clearance ocean depth platform offset and friction coefficient are discussed below 1 annular clearance effect and validity by simulation results when the diameter of a riser is constant different outer diameters of the ct 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm lead to different annular clearances 196 65 mm 183 95 mm and 170 45 mm due to the location of the injection head on the platform the axial load of ct s top end is defined as force in and the axial load of ct s bottom end as force out 2015 chen et al 2015 the influencing effect on force out of three annular clearances found by calculation from the analytical method described in section 2 is shown in fig 6 for a range of injection forces fig 6 a shows that the force out is an increasing trend with the force in for each annular clearance with the growth of the force in the inner pipe will be subject to sinusoidal buckling or helical buckling the value of the sinusoidal buckling force f c r s and the helical buckling force f c r h can be found from the literature chen et al 2016 so that for instance using the inner pipe of 88 9 mm f c r s is 21400n and f c r h is 30300 n dividing the curve in fig 6 a into two areas a and b the limit value is 24000n in area a as the ct is gradually subject to the initial friction mainly caused by gravity the rate of increase is basically the same for each condition in area b the ct needs to overcome the friction value caused by f r d and then the friction f μ between the inner pipe and the outer pipe can be calculated by equation 14 14 f μ μ 0 l f r d d x the trends of ct s diameters 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm are similar to that of the 88 9 mm when the input force finally reaches 100000n the output force of the three outer diameters of ct at 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm is 34908 3n 54418 5n and 76350 3n respectively to analyze the growing trend of the force out with the force in the transfer efficiency defined as ε f o r c e o u t f o r c e i n is shown in fig 6 b this indicates that the transfer efficiency of 88 9 mm ct is significantly lower than others when the force in exceeds 24000n which is near the critical value of sinusoidal buckling for 88 9 mm ct 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force transfer efficiency of 141 3 mm ct drops slowly after reaching this peak when the input force finally reaches 100000n the transfer efficiencies are respectively 34 9 54 4 and 76 4 for 88 9 mm 114 3 mm and 141 3 mm cts fig 6 shows that a smaller annular clearance is more favorable to axial force transmission in other words the axial force transmission of ct in riser systems gradually improves as the outer diameter of the ct increases in order to verify the calculation results comparison of calculation results obtained by the analytical method described in section 2 and simulation results investigated by abaqus in three annular clearances is shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it can be seen that the numerical results basically agree with the abaqus results the maximum error is inner pipe 88 9 mm in the 40000n which is less than 18 the errors between calculation and simulation results may be attributed to systems simplification contact conditions that are uniform contact in mathematical assumptions and surface to surface contact in finite element model and computational errors 2 ocean depth effect in order to study the ocean depth effect three cases of 800 m 1000 m and 1200 m are selected with the ct outer diameter of 88 9 mm fig 8 shows the influencing effect of three ocean depths according to fig 8 a the force out is an increasing trend with force in in area a after the injection force is greater than 22000n 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force of the ct in 800 m water depth is obviously greater than the other two this is mainly caused by the growth of friction f r d with increase of water depth and the value of friction can be calculated by equation 14 when the force in finally reaches 100000n the output force of ct with 800 m 1000 m and 1200 m ocean depths is 43100n 32280n and 34908 3n correspondingly in fig 8 b the transfer efficiency of 800 m water depth decreases slowly after reaching the peak the transfer efficiency of 800 m 1000 m and 1200 m ocean depths is respectively 43 1 32 3 and 34 9 in the maximal force in the above results show that the transfer efficiency of ct s axial force in the ct in riser systems gradually deteriorates with the increase of the depth the ct is more easily deformed and the friction resistance operation increases as the ocean depth increases leading to an increase of operation difficulty 3 platform offset effect to discuss influence of platform offset 1 3 and 5 values of the ocean depth are selected with a depth of 1000 m and a ct s outer diameter of 88 9 mm fig 9 shows the influencing effect of three platform offsets in fig 9 a after the force in is greater than 30000n 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force of the ct in the platform offset of 10 m is obviously greater than that of other two cases the reason is that frictional resistance between ct and riser will rise with the increase of platform offset in a vertical riser and then the transmission of the axial force will be more unfavorable the results are different with results of steel catenary riser scr pipe in pipe system 2018 wang et al 2018 since there is no bending section in vertical riser when the input force reaches 100000n output forces of the ct with 10 m 30 m and 50 m offset are 34407n 32507n and 27726n respectively in fig 9 b the axial force transfer efficiency of 10 m offset is slower after reaching the peak with the transfer efficiency of 10 m 30 m and 50 m offset being respectively 34 4 32 5 and 27 7 at the maximal force in therefore the greater the platform offset deviated from wellhead the worse the transfer efficiency of vertical riser systems 4 friction coefficient effect in order to study the effect of friction coefficient three friction coefficients selected 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 with the depth of 1000 m are selected in this study fig 10 shows the effect of the friction coefficient from fig 10 a after the input force is greater than 30000n 2015 chen et al 2015 the axial force with friction coefficient of 0 1 is significantly greater than others this is because that the friction forces do more work as the friction coefficient increase which affects transmission of the axial force it can also be seen in fig 10 b that the axial force transfer efficiency of the ct with friction coefficient of 0 1 reduces relatively slowly after reaching the peak from the results when the input force reaches 100000n the force outs of ct are 38379 63n 34908 3n and 31920 7n and the transfer efficiency are 38 4 34 9 and 31 9 respectively for three friction coefficients of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 therefore the greater the value of the friction coefficient the worse the axial force transmission of the ct in riser systems will be 5 conclusions in present work the influencing factors of the system that ct injects into a marine riser considering coupled effect of ocean wave and current were investigated a coupled mechanical model of ct in riser systems under force excitation was established and was solved by finite difference method and newton raphson iteration methods which is very different with the fixed boundary 2015 chen et al 2015 a 3d finite element model by abaqus finite element code was described to clarify above model lateral displacement and internal bending moment of the riser were explored and strength design and check of the critical position of the riser were provided for reference by analyzing four common influencing factors to improve tubing injection characteristic a larger outer diameter of coiled tubing a smaller water depth operation a smaller platform offset and a smaller friction coefficient are preferred the above results show that focus points of the riser and favored parameters of the ct can be considered by the theory in offshore oil and gas industry two dynamic excitation sources which are force excitation and parametric excitation can affect this coupled system 2015 wang et al 2015 in this study we assumed that the ct tensioner has better control of the axial direction and the parameter excitation is ignored consequently the force excitation by the ocean wave and ocean current only is analyzed in the future we will discuss the effect of the system under two kinds of simultaneous dynamic excitations acknowledgment this work was supported by national natural science foundation of

22672,the international maritime organization imo is developing direct stability assessment dsa criteria for parametric roll pr and other four failure modes under the framework of second generation intact stability criteria which will be very helpful for further enhancement of the safety level of ship design according to previous studies roll damping plays an important role in the simulation of pr and a hybrid prediction method for ship parametric roll has been developed which uses direct cfd approach to estimate roll damping coefficients as well as weakly nonlinear model to predict 3 d o f motion responses the well known container ship c11 was adopted for validation in the previous study and comparison study has been conducted among hybrid method a 1 d o f non linear dynamics method and direct cfd prediction method for pr the results show that the proposed hybrid method has reached sufficient accuracy and can be used at early design stage of a ship from the engineering point of view more validations are necessary to further explore the robustness of the hybrid method especially the specific applicable condition in this research further validation study of the hybrid method is done with three more ships including two container ships and one ro ro ship based on the comparison of results from numerical simulations and experiments the prediction accuracy of the hybrid method is investigated and limitations are discussed from this study one can obtain experience of time domain numerical simulation and make contributions to the development of imo dsa criteria guideline keywords hybrid prediction parametric roll cfd 1 introduction with an aim to reduce the risk of parametric roll accidents imo has launched the development of second generation intact stability criteria for many years by the beginning of 2017 the level 1 and level 2 draft criteria imo 2015 2016 has been preliminarily established and now imo is focusing on further developing draft guidelines imo 2017 of the dsa procedures which will provide qualitative and quantitative technical requirements for the numerical simulation tool time domain simulation of parametric roll has been studied for many years and abundant works have been published bulian 2005 surendran et al 2007 bulian and francescutto 2008 chang 2008 spyrou et al 2008 perunovic 2011 fossen and nijmeijer 2012 the effect of roll damping estimation method on parametric roll simulation has also been investigated and its importance proved hashimoto and umeda 2010 the roll damping is usually estimated with model test data or simplified empirical formula kawahara and maekawa et al 2012 in recent years a great progress has been made in the direct calculation of the roll damping based on the cfd approach the 3d simulations for ships with without forward speed and with without bilge keels have been successfully conducted yang and zhou et al 2013 wilson and carrica et al 2006 larsson and visonneau 2010 in order to estimate roll damping and further conduct pr simulation a hybrid method zhou and ma et al 2016 is developed based on 3d cfd approach and 3d potential method and the well known container ship c11 apl china was adopted for validation the results show that the proposed hybrid method has reached sufficient accuracy and can be used at early design stage of a ship however only one ship was used for validation in the previous study and from the engineering point of view more validations are necessary moreover limitations of this method should also be investigated based on this background model tests of three ships are adopted for further validation in this study including two container ships and one ro ro ship the numerical simulation accuracy is investigated and the potential limitations are analyzed some of which have been preliminarily validated by comparison study with fully nonlinear cfd method also suggestions on draft guidelines of dsa procedure have been provided 2 the hybrid prediction method of parametric roll the hybrid prediction method zhou and ma et al 2016 consists of two components i e roll damping coefficients estimated by 3d cfd approach and 3 d o f motion responses simulated by 3d weakly nonlinear potential method the hybrid prediction method follows an operational procedure shown in fig 1 the hybrid prediction method can estimate roll damping coefficients by simulating free decay or forced roll with cfd solver at model scale simulations of free decay have been validated by several model test results which show good agreement achieved zhou and ma et al 2015 simulation of forced roll cannot be directly validated currently due to the lack of test data however it can be tested by comparison of simulated roll amplitude response of pr and its model tests zhou and ma et al 2016 which shows that the simulation of forced roll can also satisfy the requirement of pr prediction and performs even better than that of free decay both simulations adopt 3d cfd solver isis cfd deng and queutey et al 2009 2010 which uses reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse and finite volume method the flow solver concerns the incompressible unsteady ranse and is based on the finite volume method to build the spatial discretization of the transport equations the face based method is generalized to three dimensional unstructured meshes for which non overlapping control volumes are bounded by an arbitrary number of constitutive faces the flow solver deals with multi phase flows and moving grids in the multi phase continuum with consideration of the incompressible flow of viscous fluid under isothermal conditions the mass momentum and volume fraction conservation equations can be written as follows using the generalized form of gauss theorem ecole centrale de nantes 2012 1 t v ρ d v v ρ u u d n d s 0 2 t v ρ u i d v s ρ u i u u d n d s s τ i j i j p i i n d s v ρ g i d v 3 t v c i d v s c i u u d n d s 0 where v is the control volume s is the surface of v ρ i c i ρ i and μ i c i μ i are the density and the viscosity of the effective flow u is the velocity p is the pressure u d is the moving velocity of s τ i j is the components of the viscous stress tensor g i is the gravity vector the pressure field is obtained from the mass conservation constraint which is transformed into a pressure equation and the velocity field is obtained from the momentum conservation equations in the case of turbulent flows additional transport equations for modeled variables are solved in a form similar to that of the momentum equations and they can be discretized and solved using the same principles the k omega sst menter turbulence model is used in the rans solver and the adaptive grid refinement method refinement de refinement parallel unsteady and with load balancing is adopted for capturing the free surface the 6 d o f motion equations are directly based on newton s second law the forces due to the interaction between the ship and the fluids water and air are calculated by integrating the three dimensional pressures of the fluids for the hull surface of the ship and updated every time step then the motions could be solved deng and queutey et al 2009 2010 it is recommended to adopt both sliding grid and adaptive grid refinement method for the numerical simulation of free decay and forced roll if sliding grid is not adopted the grid near the free surface need to be refined and more grids are needed to capture the wave induced by ship and cope with the rotation of calculation domain table 1 shows the principal dimension of ship models used to validate the cfd simulation of free decay zhou and ma et al 2015 2016 due to the lack of model test simulation of forced roll cannot be validated directly the forced roll simulation method is validated indirectly by simulating parametric roll of c11 zhou and ma et al 2016 in previous study zhou and ma et al 2015 the time step and mesh have been analyzed and validated firstly to investigate appropriate settings of simulations based on these experiences natural roll period and roll damping coefficients obtained by cfd simulations are in a good agreement with model tests near the initial heel angles zhou and ma et al 2015 2016 fig 2 and fig 3 show the comparison results of non dimensional equivalent roll damping b ˆ 44 of c11 f n 0 05 0 1 zhou and ma et al 2015 once roll damping coefficients have been estimated the hybrid method then adopts 3 d o f weakly nonlinear model roll heave and pitch for the simulation of ship motion zhou and ma et al 2016 considering the time delay effect cummins impulse response theory cummins 1962 is utilized radiation and diffraction force coefficients are calculated by 3d frequency domain method nonlinearity of froude krylov forces is taken into account in simulating the variation of restore moment in waves motion equations are as follows 4 m μ 33 η 3 0 t k 33 t τ η 3 d τ μ 35 η 5 b 35 η 5 0 t k 35 t τ η 5 d τ f 3 i s f 3 d m g i x x μ 44 η 4 0 t k 44 t τ η 4 d τ f 4 i s f 4 d f 4 v i y y μ 55 η 5 0 t k 55 t τ η 5 d τ c 55 η 5 μ 53 η 3 b 53 η 3 0 t k 53 t τ η 3 d τ f 5 i s f 5 d where f i s is the composition force of the froude krylov force and the restore force which are calculated based on the 3d pressure integration method for the instantaneous wetted hull the diffraction forces f d are predicted by the 3d frequency domain potential method the radiation forces are calculated based on the impulse response theory in the motion equation with consideration of the memory effect as 5 k j k τ 2 π 0 b j k w e b j k cos w e τ d w e where b j k w e is the wave making damping calculated by the frequency domain potential method μ j k are the added mass or moment of inertia calculated for the mean wetted surface by solving the boundary problem b j k are the damping coefficients and b 35 b 53 u μ 33 where u is the forward speed of the ship c j k are the restoring coefficients and c 55 u 2 μ 33 f 4 v is the moment due to the viscous roll damping and is simplified as 6 f 4 v a η 4 c η 4 3 where a and c are the roll damping coefficients calculated by the cfd approach according to the previous validation study with the famous container ship c11 as well as comparison study with a 1 d o f non linear dynamics method and direct cfd prediction method the accuracy and applicability of hybrid method have been validated zhou and ma et al 2016 the effect of roll damping estimation methods on prediction of pr is analyzed and recommendations on parameter settings and mesh generation are given fig 4 shows the predictions of the parametric rolling for c11 by the hybrid method and fig 5 shows the time history according to the prediction results of c11 with the hybrid method the forced roll the parametric roll could be successfully predicted for different speeds and wave steepness in cases when those amplitudes are equal to or less than 27 a satisfactory accuracy is achieved zhou and ma et al 2016 the influences of damping coefficient with different initial roll angles and roll period have been analyzed in zhou and ma et al 2016 the results revealed that the initial heel angle of free decay or forced roll amplitude and roll period play an important role in obtaining the roll damping characteristics thus the forced roll simulation is recommended to ensure the roll period is as close as the parametric roll however the roll amplitude of parametric roll is unknown for blind simulation which makes the initial heel angle or forced roll amplitude difficult to determine at this stage since 25 degrees of roll amplitude is selected as standard value for level 2 criteria imo 2015 and the standard value of dsa is still under discussion the hybrid method is supposed to ensure the accuracy of parametric roll prediction about 25 at this stage in the model test the heel angle of free decay tests is limited by the water tightness of model deck and the freeboard of model ship obtained test data and conducted validations are all for cases less than 20 considering these limitations hybrid method takes 20 for roll damping simulation at this stage so in theory the hybrid method is not applicable to simulate large roll amplitude based on this setting the margin of application is investigated in this study 3 discussion of further validations and limitations in order to further validate the prediction accuracy and discuss limitations of the hybrid prediction method more sample ships are utilized for simulations which are compared with model test results in this research 3 1 sample ships with an aim to further validate the hybrid method three ships are adopted in this research i e two container ships and one ro ro ship the principal dimensions of sample ships are demonstrated in table 2 the ship models with scale factors of 0 012 0 016 and 0 019 are shown respectively in fig 6 the experiments are conducted at ocean engineering basin of shanghai jiaotong university and sea keeping basin of china ship scientific research center both of which are ittc members and have extensive experience in ship hydrodynamic research the models used in model test and cfd simulation have taken into account the hull appendages a rudder is installed to all three ships and s25 is installed with bilge keels the scaled model and numerical model are consistent and the propellers are not taken into account in the cfd simulations roll damping coefficients used for parametric roll simulations are estimated by simulating forced roll at 20 in model scale the forced roll frequency is taken as frequency of parametric roll for blind simulations the frequency can be taken as ω 0 5 ω e where ω e is encounter frequency in this study the frequency of parametric roll is directly obtained from model tests the simulation of the forced roll is based on the 3 d o f motions including roll pitch and heave the parameter settings and mesh generation are determined based on recommendations by zhou and ma et al 2016 respectively the adopted mesh generations and parameter settings are further validated with free decay model test data of 10000teu container ship s25 table 3 shows comparison results of natural roll periods and roll damping coefficients at zero speed which are obtained with free decay cfd simulations fig 7 shows the comparison results of the free decay histories and non dimensional equivalent roll damping b ˆ 44 at f n 0 fig 8 shows the convergence verification of the mesh generations and parameter settings which are used for forced roll simulations as shown in fig 7 a and b 6 d o f simulations are compared with 3 d o f and 4 d o f simulations to verify the sway roll coupling effect on free decay according to computations of a french frigate conducted by hua hua and régnier et al 2011 freeing the d o f of sway could improve the correlation with the experiments the comparison reveals that the sway roll coupling effect is significant for free decay in previous study zhou and ma et al 2015 2016 the d o f settings are strictly consistent with the model test which means the 6 d o f or 3 d o f simulations are adopted depending on whether the experimental measurement method is unconstrained or partially constrained as for s25 the model test was conducted at ocean engineering basin with unconstrained measurement method thus the 6 d o f simulation results are closest to the model test results and the sway roll effect is further validated with regard to forced roll the 3 d o f simulations are also compared with 4 d o f and 6 d o f simulations as shown in fig 8 roll moment and non dimensional equivalent roll damping obtained with 3 simulation method are very close it seems the d o f of sway yaw and surge have little influence on the forced roll simulation thus in the lack of forced roll model test data the 3 d o f forced roll simulation can be adopted at this stage to obtain the roll damping for further parametric roll prediction for the free decay and forced roll simulations the time step is taken as 0 006 and simulations are made on 2 22m grids the comparisons see figs 7 c 8 a and 8 b and c reveal that the time step and mesh generation can achieve convergence results for both free decay and forced roll the effective wave theory developed by grim 1961 is utilized for converting irregular waves to effective regular wave then a proper range of steepness corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 significant weave height h s 6 5 m is selected for effective regular waves which means the model tests and numerical simulations are conducted in adverse sea condition that may endanger the ships certainly the ultimate goal of developing the hybrid method is to predict parametric roll in irregular waves at this stage the accuracy and limitations should be validated first in regular wave besides head wave is selected for wave direction 3 2 discussion of precision validation and limitation 3 2 1 10000teu container ship s25 comparison of predicted roll amplitude responses and their test results are shown in fig 9 these cases utilize three effective wave lengths i e λ l pp 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 the hull speed is at fn 0 as shown in fig 9 a similar trend is observed in predicted roll amplitudes and their test results for all cases within the range corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 predicted roll amplitudes are smaller than 25 which means this ship may be invulnerable to pr from point view of level 2 criteria imo 2015 imo has developed provisional acceptance criteria for numerical prediction method of pr in draft guidelines of direct stability assessment procedures imo 2017 proposing accuracy requirements for roll amplitude it should be noted that the acceptance criteria are still under development whose rationality have not been validated according to the results from comparison the hybrid method is in good agreement with model test 15 out of 19 validation cases meet the roll amplitude requirement see fig 10 this result is in consistent with the conclusion from validation study of c11 i e as a whole hybrid method could achieve good accuracy for cases with roll amplitudes equal to or less than 27 however 1 case is found to be a false alarm case 3 λ l 0 8 and 3 cases case 1 2 and 3 λ l 1 0 exceeds relative error control range the absolute errors are all smaller than 3 5 the roll amplitude error of these 3 cases are 3 5 18 2 2 6 13 3 and 2 5 11 7 at incident wave λ l 0 8 as shown in fig 9 a it is observed that roll amplitude of pr increases dramatically when wave steepness increases slightly during the experiment this phenomenon indicates that due to the nonlinearity of pr the appearance of critical wave steepness is very sensitive to loading condition zhou and ma et al 2013 as well as hydrodynamic forces since hybrid method is a simplified numerical method the predicted hydrodynamic forces deviate from their reality which further leads to differences between critical wave steepness considering this point the prediction for pr amplitude by hybrid method could not fully satisfy the current requirements of the draft guidelines 3 2 2 4250teu container ship c1 comparison of predicted roll amplitude responses with their test results as shown in fig 11 these cases utilize two effective wave lengths i e λ l pp 0 8 and 1 0 the hull speeds are at fn 0 0517 5kn and 0 1 according to the validation study of c11 zhou and ma et al 2016 the hybrid method is not applicable to predict the roll amplitude of pr above 27 for two reasons first the roll damping coefficients are estimated at 20 roll amplitude which limits the application of this method in large pr response prediction second the hybrid method is developed based on weakly nonlinear model which could not simulate complex nonlinear ship water action precisely therefore all cases with predicted roll amplitudes larger than 40 are considered pointless in this research as shown in fig 11 the effective wave steepness range corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 is smaller than 0 024 for all cases within this range the predicted roll amplitudes are smaller than 25 which indicates c1 may be not sensitive to parametric roll for cases with steady roll amplitude equal to or less than 26 7 hybrid method could obtain simulation results that are in consistent with model tests however with the increase of wave steepness the simulation agreement of hybrid method decreases dramatically and the steady pr responses are significantly overestimated in some model tests at h λ 0 03 to 0 04 it can be observed that the steady roll amplitudes begin to decrease with the increase of wave steepness which finally vanish see fig 11 b in this simulations even capsizing events can be captured which are completely inconsistent with experimental observation in previous studies some numerical models are also found tending to over predict the parametric resonance umeda and hashimoto et al 2004 besides the effect of roll damping another possible explanation for this phenomenon is the limitation of transverse stability calculation approach adopted in the hybrid method as indicated by neves et al in their research neves and rodríguez 2006 this phenomenon is improved by modifying non linear mathematical model experimental studies also reveal that the variation of gz curves in wave may be overestimated by froude krylov assumption gu and wang et al 2015 2017 which may lead to more energy input and greater roll response prediction results thus it could be preliminarily conjectured that the limitations of hybrid method lead to a bad match and further research is necessary in this issue furthermore as shown in figs 12 and 13 in cases of large wave steepness h λ 0 03 and 0 04 obvious water shipping slamming and rudder emergence can also be easily observed during parametric roll these strong nonlinear events bring greater difficulty to the numerical simulation for c1 since hybrid method adopts weakly nonlinear model to simulate the motion response of pr hydrodynamic forces such as radiation diffraction forces and roll damping estimation are simplified which means strong nonlinear events cannot be fully taken into account in this numerical model thus this could also be another possible explanation why hybrid method is not applicable theoretically speaking a fully nonlinear numerical model may be more appropriate but it still needs further investigation especially comparison study with 3d cfd method 3 2 3 ro ro ship s10 comparison of predicted roll amplitude responses with their test results as shown in fig 14 these cases utilize effective wave length λ l pp 1 0 the hull speeds are at fn 0 0 and 0 2 as compared with test results see fig 14 in cases with steady roll amplitude equal to or less than 33 2 hybrid method can largely obtain consistent simulation results the maximum wave steepness amongst these cases is 0 0225 which is slightly larger than the range corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 a false positive event is obtained at fn 0 2 which makes the predicted critical wave steepness to be more conservative also roll amplitudes are overestimated in cases of large wave steepness h λ 0 03 and 0 04 fig 15 shows the motion time histories pitch roll and heave calculated by the hybrid method with the increase of wave steepness the simulated roll response could not achieve steady condition for some cases it seems the nonlinearity of roll also enhances in the simulation however in the experiment the observed roll amplitude always achieves steady condition even for case at h λ 0 04 the cause of this issue is still unclear at this stage and further investigation is needed furthermore slamming and rudder emergence can also be observed in some model tests due to high freeboard bow slamming would not lead to further green water event according to the validation study of these three ships the performances of simulations using hybrid method are similar on the whole the hybrid method could achieve good accuracy for cases with moderate wave steepness and roll amplitudes the upper limit of wave steepness of this method seems to be 0 0225 which mainly covers adverse sea condition corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 the upper limit of roll amplitude seems to be 26 7 which is basically sufficient for the prediction of dangerous parametric roll event if critical value is assumed to be 25 the hybrid method is neither applicable for simulating cases with strong nonlinearity like slamming shipping water and rudder emergence nor for accurate prediction of critical wave steepness corresponding to sudden appearance of pr event limited by the model tests data used for validation the hybrid method estimates roll damping at 20 further validations conducted in this study reveal that this setting may have limited the margin of application thus study on the simulation and validation of roll damping at larger roll angle is one of the focuses of future research 4 comparison of hybrid and direct cfd prediction methods in order to further validate the hybrid method and investigate its limitation in critical wave steepness prediction the fully nonlinear direct cfd prediction method zhou and ma et al 2016 is utilized for comparison study the adopted parameter settings and mesh generation are based on the recommendations illustrated by zhou and ma et al 2016 a cylindrical domain is created in the computational domain in which sliding grids are used to simulate large roll response comparison study is conducted for s25 and all simulations are made on 2 22m grids the 3 d o f motions roll pitch and heave are the free motions for the simulation of pr the grids in the sliding domain cylindrical domain are set to be in rigid motion which means the mesh will follow exactly the ship without being deformed the grids in the outer domain are set to be in weighted deformation which means a sliding domain fitted mesh will be generated using an analytical weighted deformation technique for the motion related to the sliding domain exactly same as the ship so the mesh is imposed with limited amplitudes of motion for the three degrees of freedom and the 3 d o f motions of ship could be simulated at the same time fig 16 shows the comparisons of the roll amplitudes predicted by the two methods it can be shown from the results that similar and even better accuracy could be achieved with the direct cfd prediction method as a fully nonlinear approach based on viscous flow theory and finite volume method direct cfd prediction method improves the accuracy of predicting hydrodynamic forces and critical wave steepness however the difference between predicted roll amplitudes and test results remains a false alarm event that pr occurs at less wave steepness is also obtained by the cfd method see fig 16 a the over prediction of critical wave steepness is similar to that of hybrid method which confirms the speculation about the sensitivity of parametric roll occurrence as shown in fig 16 b and c the direct cfd prediction method could achieve better agreement than the hybrid method but for some cases see fig 16 a the predicted roll amplitudes are even more conservative than that of the hybrid method leading to slightly less accuracy it could be observed that the agreement of the direct cfd prediction method improved with the increase of incident wave length besides the predicted steady roll amplitude of one case h λ 0 02272 λ l pp 0 8 as observed anomaly deviated from the model tests trend furthermore owing to overestimated roll amplitude see figs 16 a and fig 17 shipping water could be observed in simulations which do not appear in the model tests as shown in fig 6 and fig 18 this may also be attributed to the limitation of adopted sliding grids as shown in fig 19 at this stage the reason is still unclear and also needs further investigation especially for the comparison of different mesh generations on the other hand the direct cfd prediction method shows its potential as an appropriate fully nonlinear tool to further validate the hybrid method and investigate the limitations as shown in figs 16 and 17 as sliding grids are utilized to simulate the cylindrical near field close to the ship see fig 17 the comparisons in this research are only conducted for small wave steepness cases with an aim to satisfy the requirement of large roll response prediction the heel angle of cylindrical domain follows the ship roll response as shown in fig 11 since the responses of pitch and heave are relatively small simulations using sliding grids could perform well however it should be noted that for simulation of large pitch and heave response this mesh generation may not be applicable anymore while overset grids could be a better option thus it is necessary to study the direct cfd prediction method so as to conduct further investigation of hybrid method considering that the direct cfd prediction method consumes huge computation time the hybrid method still has comparative advantage and is more applicable at the current stage pr accuracy requirements of dsa draft guideline mainly focus on the accuracy of roll amplitude according to the comparison study neither the hybrid method nor the direct cfd prediction method could fully meet these requirements which may indicate the requirements of dsa are over conservative to be satisfied from the practical point of view further clarification may be necessary for accuracy requirements of dsa draft guideline especially the consideration of adding tolerance about critical wave steepness prediction error or failure cases proportion 5 conclusions the hybrid method for the prediction of ship parametric roll is further validated in this research compared with model test results of three ships and a fully nonlinear direct cfd prediction method the prediction accuracy and limitations of the hybrid method are investigated the following conclusions are drawn with the hybrid method the parametric roll can be predicted with a good accuracy within a moderate range of incident wave steepness and roll amplitude response which confirm the conclusion of previous study the upper limit wave of steepness and upper limit of roll amplitude seems to be 0 0225 and 26 7 which are basically sufficient for the prediction of dangerous parametric roll event due to the limitations of the hybrid method especially constrained by the roll damping estimation method and the transverse stability calculation approach the method seems not applicable for simulating cases exceeding the upper limits besides it is neither applicable for simulating cases with strong nonlinearity like slamming shipping water and rudder emergence nor for accurate prediction of critical wave steepness corresponding to sudden appearance of pr event with regard to the pr accuracy requirements it may be necessary to consider adding tolerance about critical wave steepness prediction error or failure cases proportional

22672,the international maritime organization imo is developing direct stability assessment dsa criteria for parametric roll pr and other four failure modes under the framework of second generation intact stability criteria which will be very helpful for further enhancement of the safety level of ship design according to previous studies roll damping plays an important role in the simulation of pr and a hybrid prediction method for ship parametric roll has been developed which uses direct cfd approach to estimate roll damping coefficients as well as weakly nonlinear model to predict 3 d o f motion responses the well known container ship c11 was adopted for validation in the previous study and comparison study has been conducted among hybrid method a 1 d o f non linear dynamics method and direct cfd prediction method for pr the results show that the proposed hybrid method has reached sufficient accuracy and can be used at early design stage of a ship from the engineering point of view more validations are necessary to further explore the robustness of the hybrid method especially the specific applicable condition in this research further validation study of the hybrid method is done with three more ships including two container ships and one ro ro ship based on the comparison of results from numerical simulations and experiments the prediction accuracy of the hybrid method is investigated and limitations are discussed from this study one can obtain experience of time domain numerical simulation and make contributions to the development of imo dsa criteria guideline keywords hybrid prediction parametric roll cfd 1 introduction with an aim to reduce the risk of parametric roll accidents imo has launched the development of second generation intact stability criteria for many years by the beginning of 2017 the level 1 and level 2 draft criteria imo 2015 2016 has been preliminarily established and now imo is focusing on further developing draft guidelines imo 2017 of the dsa procedures which will provide qualitative and quantitative technical requirements for the numerical simulation tool time domain simulation of parametric roll has been studied for many years and abundant works have been published bulian 2005 surendran et al 2007 bulian and francescutto 2008 chang 2008 spyrou et al 2008 perunovic 2011 fossen and nijmeijer 2012 the effect of roll damping estimation method on parametric roll simulation has also been investigated and its importance proved hashimoto and umeda 2010 the roll damping is usually estimated with model test data or simplified empirical formula kawahara and maekawa et al 2012 in recent years a great progress has been made in the direct calculation of the roll damping based on the cfd approach the 3d simulations for ships with without forward speed and with without bilge keels have been successfully conducted yang and zhou et al 2013 wilson and carrica et al 2006 larsson and visonneau 2010 in order to estimate roll damping and further conduct pr simulation a hybrid method zhou and ma et al 2016 is developed based on 3d cfd approach and 3d potential method and the well known container ship c11 apl china was adopted for validation the results show that the proposed hybrid method has reached sufficient accuracy and can be used at early design stage of a ship however only one ship was used for validation in the previous study and from the engineering point of view more validations are necessary moreover limitations of this method should also be investigated based on this background model tests of three ships are adopted for further validation in this study including two container ships and one ro ro ship the numerical simulation accuracy is investigated and the potential limitations are analyzed some of which have been preliminarily validated by comparison study with fully nonlinear cfd method also suggestions on draft guidelines of dsa procedure have been provided 2 the hybrid prediction method of parametric roll the hybrid prediction method zhou and ma et al 2016 consists of two components i e roll damping coefficients estimated by 3d cfd approach and 3 d o f motion responses simulated by 3d weakly nonlinear potential method the hybrid prediction method follows an operational procedure shown in fig 1 the hybrid prediction method can estimate roll damping coefficients by simulating free decay or forced roll with cfd solver at model scale simulations of free decay have been validated by several model test results which show good agreement achieved zhou and ma et al 2015 simulation of forced roll cannot be directly validated currently due to the lack of test data however it can be tested by comparison of simulated roll amplitude response of pr and its model tests zhou and ma et al 2016 which shows that the simulation of forced roll can also satisfy the requirement of pr prediction and performs even better than that of free decay both simulations adopt 3d cfd solver isis cfd deng and queutey et al 2009 2010 which uses reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse and finite volume method the flow solver concerns the incompressible unsteady ranse and is based on the finite volume method to build the spatial discretization of the transport equations the face based method is generalized to three dimensional unstructured meshes for which non overlapping control volumes are bounded by an arbitrary number of constitutive faces the flow solver deals with multi phase flows and moving grids in the multi phase continuum with consideration of the incompressible flow of viscous fluid under isothermal conditions the mass momentum and volume fraction conservation equations can be written as follows using the generalized form of gauss theorem ecole centrale de nantes 2012 1 t v ρ d v v ρ u u d n d s 0 2 t v ρ u i d v s ρ u i u u d n d s s τ i j i j p i i n d s v ρ g i d v 3 t v c i d v s c i u u d n d s 0

of s τ i j is the components of the viscous stress tensor g i is the gravity vector the pressure field is obtained from the mass conservation constraint which is transformed into a pressure equation and the velocity field is obtained from the momentum conservation equations in the case of turbulent flows additional transport equations for modeled variables are solved in a form similar to that of the momentum equations and they can be discretized and solved using the same principles the k omega sst menter turbulence model is used in the rans solver and the adaptive grid refinement method refinement de refinement parallel unsteady and with load balancing is adopted for capturing the free surface the 6 d o f motion equations are directly based on newton s second law the forces due to the interaction between the ship and the fluids water and air are calculated by integrating the three dimensional pressures of the fluids for the hull surface of the ship and updated every time step then the motions could be solved deng and queutey et al 2009 2010 it is recommended to adopt both sliding grid and adaptive grid refinement method for the numerical simulation of free decay and forced roll if sliding grid is not adopted the grid near the free surface need to be refined and more grids are needed to capture the wave induced by ship and cope with the rotation of calculation domain table 1 shows the principal dimension of ship models used to validate the cfd simulation of free decay zhou and ma et al 2015 2016 due to the lack of model test simulation of forced roll cannot be validated directly the forced roll simulation method is validated indirectly by simulating parametric roll of c11 zhou and ma et al 2016 in previous study zhou and ma et al 2015 the time step and mesh have been analyzed and validated firstly to investigate appropriate settings of simulations based on these experiences natural roll period and roll damping coefficients obtained by cfd simulations are in a good agreement with model tests near the initial heel angles zhou and ma et al 2015 2016 fig 2 and fig 3 show the comparison results of non dimensional equivalent roll damping b ˆ 44 of c11 f n 0 05 0 1 zhou and ma et al 2015 once roll damping coefficients have been estimated the hybrid method then adopts 3 d o f weakly nonlinear model roll heave and pitch for the simulation of ship motion zhou and ma et al 2016 considering the time delay effect cummins impulse response theory cummins 1962 is utilized radiation and diffraction force coefficients are calculated by 3d frequency domain method nonlinearity of froude krylov forces is taken into account in simulating the variation of restore moment in waves motion equations are as follows 4 m μ 33 η 3 0 t k 33 t τ η 3 d τ μ 35 η 5 b 35

where f i s is the composition force of the froude krylov force and the restore force which are calculated based on the 3d pressure integration method for the instantaneous wetted hull the diffraction

approach according to the previous validation study with the famous container ship c11 as well as comparison study with a 1 d o f non linear dynamics method and direct cfd prediction method the accuracy and applicability of hybrid method have been validated zhou and ma et al 2016 the effect of roll damping estimation methods on prediction of pr is analyzed and recommendations on parameter settings and mesh generation are given fig 4 shows the predictions of the parametric rolling for c11 by the hybrid method and fig 5 shows the time history according to the prediction results of c11 with the hybrid method the forced roll the parametric roll could be successfully predicted for different speeds and wave steepness in cases when those amplitudes are equal to or less than 27 a satisfactory accuracy is achieved zhou and ma et al 2016 the influences of damping coefficient with different initial roll angles and roll period have been analyzed in zhou and ma et al 2016 the results revealed that the initial heel angle of free decay or forced roll amplitude and roll period play an important role in obtaining the roll damping characteristics thus the forced roll simulation is recommended to ensure the roll period is as close as the parametric roll however the roll amplitude of parametric roll is unknown for blind simulation which makes the initial heel angle or forced roll amplitude difficult to determine at this stage since 25 degrees of roll amplitude is selected as standard value for level 2 criteria imo 2015 and the standard value of dsa is still under discussion the hybrid method is supposed to ensure the accuracy of parametric roll prediction about 25 at this stage in the model test the heel angle of free decay tests is limited by the water tightness of model deck and the freeboard of model ship obtained test data and conducted validations are all for cases less than 20 considering these limitations hybrid method takes 20 for roll damping simulation at this stage so in theory the hybrid method is not applicable to simulate large roll amplitude based on this setting the margin of application is investigated in this study 3 discussion of further validations and limitations in order to further validate the prediction accuracy and discuss limitations of the hybrid prediction method more sample ships are utilized for simulations which are compared with model test results in this research 3 1 sample ships with an aim to further validate the hybrid method three ships are adopted in this research i e two container ships and one ro ro ship the principal dimensions of sample ships are demonstrated in table 2 the ship models with scale factors of 0 012 0 016 and 0 019 are shown respectively in fig 6 the experiments are conducted at ocean engineering basin of shanghai jiaotong university and sea keeping basin of china ship scientific research center both of which are ittc members and have extensive experience in ship hydrodynamic research the models used in model test and cfd simulation have taken into account the hull appendages a rudder is installed to all three ships and s25 is installed with bilge keels the scaled model and numerical model are consistent and the propellers are not taken into account in the cfd simulations roll damping coefficients used for parametric roll simulations are estimated by simulating forced roll at 20 in model scale the forced roll frequency is taken as frequency of parametric roll for blind simulations the frequency can be taken as ω 0 5 ω e where ω e is encounter frequency in this study the frequency of parametric roll is directly obtained from model tests the simulation of the forced roll is based on the 3 d o f motions including roll pitch and heave the parameter settings and mesh generation are determined based on recommendations by zhou and ma et al 2016 respectively the adopted mesh generations and parameter settings are further validated with free decay model test data of 10000teu container ship s25 table 3 shows comparison results of natural roll periods and roll damping coefficients at zero speed which are obtained with free decay cfd simulations fig 7 shows the comparison results of the free decay histories and non dimensional equivalent roll damping b ˆ 44 at f n 0 fig 8 shows the convergence verification of the mesh generations and parameter settings which are used for forced roll simulations as shown in fig 7 a and b 6 d o f simulations are compared with 3 d o f and 4 d o f simulations to verify the sway roll coupling effect on free decay according to computations of a french frigate conducted by hua hua and régnier et al 2011 freeing the d o f of sway could improve the correlation with the experiments the comparison reveals that the sway roll coupling effect is significant for free decay in previous study zhou and ma et al 2015 2016 the d o f settings are strictly consistent with the model test which means the 6 d o f or 3 d o f simulations are adopted depending on whether the experimental measurement method is unconstrained or partially constrained as for s25 the model test was conducted at ocean engineering basin with unconstrained measurement method thus the 6 d o f simulation results are closest to the model test results and the sway roll effect is further validated with regard to forced roll the 3 d o f simulations are also compared with 4 d o f and 6 d o f simulations as shown in fig 8 roll moment and non dimensional equivalent roll damping obtained with 3 simulation method are very close it seems the d o f of sway yaw and surge have little influence on the forced roll simulation thus in the lack of forced roll model test data the 3 d o f forced roll simulation can be adopted at this stage to obtain the roll damping for further parametric roll prediction for the free decay and forced roll simulations the time step is taken as 0 006 and simulations are made on 2 22m grids the comparisons see figs 7 c 8 a and 8 b and c reveal that the time step and mesh generation can achieve convergence results for both free decay and forced roll the effective wave theory developed by grim 1961 is utilized for converting irregular waves to effective regular wave then a proper range of steepness corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 significant weave height h s 6 5 m is selected for effective regular waves which means the model tests and numerical simulations are conducted in adverse sea condition that may endanger the ships certainly the ultimate goal of developing the hybrid method is to predict parametric roll in irregular waves at this stage the accuracy and limitations should be validated first in regular wave besides head wave is selected for wave direction 3 2 discussion of precision validation and limitation 3 2 1 10000teu container ship s25 comparison of predicted roll amplitude responses and their test results are shown in fig 9 these cases utilize three effective wave lengths i e λ l pp 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 the hull speed is at fn 0 as shown in fig 9 a similar trend is observed in predicted roll amplitudes and their test results for all cases within the range corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 predicted roll amplitudes are smaller than 25 which means this ship may be invulnerable to pr from point view of level 2 criteria imo 2015 imo has developed provisional acceptance criteria for numerical prediction method of pr in draft guidelines of direct stability assessment procedures imo 2017 proposing accuracy requirements for roll amplitude it should be noted that the acceptance criteria are still under development whose rationality have not been validated according to the results from comparison the hybrid method is in good agreement with model test 15 out of 19 validation cases meet the roll amplitude requirement see fig 10 this result is in consistent with the conclusion from validation study of c11 i e as a whole hybrid method could achieve good accuracy for cases with roll amplitudes equal to or less than 27 however 1 case is found to be a false alarm case 3 λ l 0 8 and 3 cases case 1 2 and 3 λ l 1 0 exceeds relative error control range the absolute errors are all smaller than 3 5 the roll amplitude error of these 3 cases are 3 5 18 2 2 6 13 3 and 2 5 11 7 at incident wave λ l 0 8 as shown in fig 9 a it is observed that roll amplitude of pr increases dramatically when wave steepness increases slightly during the experiment this phenomenon indicates that due to the nonlinearity of pr the appearance of critical wave steepness is very sensitive to loading condition zhou and ma et al 2013 as well as hydrodynamic forces since hybrid method is a simplified numerical method the predicted hydrodynamic forces deviate from their reality which further leads to differences between critical wave steepness considering this point the prediction for pr amplitude by hybrid method could not fully satisfy the current requirements of the draft guidelines 3 2 2 4250teu container ship c1 comparison of predicted roll amplitude responses with their test results as shown in fig 11 these cases utilize two effective wave lengths i e λ l pp 0 8 and 1 0 the hull speeds are at fn 0 0517 5kn and 0 1 according to the validation study of c11 zhou and ma et al 2016 the hybrid method is not applicable to predict the roll amplitude of pr above 27 for two reasons first the roll damping coefficients are estimated at 20 roll amplitude which limits the application of this method in large pr response prediction second the hybrid method is developed based on weakly nonlinear model which could not simulate complex nonlinear ship water action precisely therefore all cases with predicted roll amplitudes larger than 40 are considered pointless in this research as shown in fig 11 the effective wave steepness range corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 is smaller than 0 024 for all cases within this range the predicted roll amplitudes are smaller than 25 which indicates c1 may be not sensitive to parametric roll for cases with steady roll amplitude equal to or less than 26 7 hybrid method could obtain simulation results that are in consistent with model tests however with the increase of wave steepness the simulation agreement of hybrid method decreases dramatically and the steady pr responses are significantly overestimated in some model tests at h λ 0 03 to 0 04 it can be observed that the steady roll amplitudes begin to decrease with the increase of wave steepness which finally vanish see fig 11 b in this simulations even capsizing events can be captured which are completely inconsistent with experimental observation in previous studies some numerical models are also found tending to over predict the parametric resonance umeda and hashimoto et al 2004 besides the effect of roll damping another possible explanation for this phenomenon is the limitation of transverse stability calculation approach adopted in the hybrid method as indicated by neves et al in their research neves and rodríguez 2006 this phenomenon is improved by modifying non linear mathematical model experimental studies also reveal that the variation of gz curves in wave may be overestimated by froude krylov assumption gu and wang et al 2015 2017 which may lead to more energy input and greater roll response prediction results thus it could be preliminarily conjectured that the limitations of hybrid method lead to a bad match and further research is necessary in this issue furthermore as shown in figs 12 and 13 in cases of large wave steepness h λ 0 03 and 0 04 obvious water shipping slamming and rudder emergence can also be easily observed during parametric roll these strong nonlinear events bring greater difficulty to the numerical simulation for c1 since hybrid method adopts weakly nonlinear model to simulate the motion response of pr hydrodynamic forces such as radiation diffraction forces and roll damping estimation are simplified which means strong nonlinear events cannot be fully taken into account in this numerical model thus this could also be another possible explanation why hybrid method is not applicable theoretically speaking a fully nonlinear numerical model may be more appropriate but it still needs further investigation especially comparison study with 3d cfd method 3 2 3 ro ro ship s10 comparison of predicted roll amplitude responses with their test results as shown in fig 14 these cases utilize effective wave length λ l pp 1 0 the hull speeds are at fn 0 0 and 0 2 as compared with test results see fig 14 in cases with steady roll amplitude equal to or less than 33 2 hybrid method can largely obtain consistent simulation results the maximum wave steepness amongst these cases is 0 0225 which is slightly larger than the range corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 a false positive event is obtained at fn 0 2 which makes the predicted critical wave steepness to be more conservative also roll amplitudes are overestimated in cases of large wave steepness h λ 0 03 and 0 04 fig 15 shows the motion time histories pitch roll and heave calculated by the hybrid method with the increase of wave steepness the simulated roll response could not achieve steady condition for some cases it seems the nonlinearity of roll also enhances in the simulation however in the experiment the observed roll amplitude always achieves steady condition even for case at h λ 0 04 the cause of this issue is still unclear at this stage and further investigation is needed furthermore slamming and rudder emergence can also be observed in some model tests due to high freeboard bow slamming would not lead to further green water event according to the validation study of these three ships the performances of simulations using hybrid method are similar on the whole the hybrid method could achieve good accuracy for cases with moderate wave steepness and roll amplitudes the upper limit of wave steepness of this method seems to be 0 0225 which mainly covers adverse sea condition corresponding to sea condition 6 and 7 the upper limit of roll amplitude seems to be 26 7 which is basically sufficient for the prediction of dangerous parametric roll event if critical value is assumed to be 25 the hybrid method is neither applicable for simulating cases with strong nonlinearity like slamming shipping water and rudder emergence nor for accurate prediction of critical wave steepness corresponding to sudden appearance of pr event limited by the model tests data used for validation the hybrid method estimates roll damping at 20 further validations conducted in this study reveal that this setting may have limited the margin of application thus study on the simulation and validation of roll damping at larger roll angle is one of the focuses of future research 4 comparison of hybrid and direct cfd prediction methods in order to further validate the hybrid method and investigate its limitation in critical wave steepness prediction the fully nonlinear direct cfd prediction method zhou and ma et al 2016 is utilized for comparison study the adopted parameter settings and mesh generation are based on the recommendations illustrated by zhou and ma et al 2016 a cylindrical domain is created in the computational domain in which sliding grids are used to simulate large roll response comparison study is conducted for s25 and all simulations are made on 2 22m grids the 3 d o f motions roll pitch and heave are the free motions for the simulation of pr the grids in the sliding domain cylindrical domain are set to be in rigid motion which means the mesh will follow exactly the ship without being deformed the grids in the outer domain are set to be in weighted deformation which means a sliding domain fitted mesh will be generated using an analytical weighted deformation technique for the motion related to the sliding domain exactly same as the ship so the mesh is imposed with limited amplitudes of motion for the three degrees of freedom and the 3 d o f motions of ship could be simulated at the same time fig 16 shows the comparisons of the roll amplitudes predicted by the two methods it can be shown from the results that similar and even better accuracy could be achieved with the direct cfd prediction method as a fully nonlinear approach based on viscous flow theory and finite volume method direct cfd prediction method improves the accuracy of predicting hydrodynamic forces and critical wave steepness however the difference between predicted roll amplitudes and test results remains a false alarm event that pr occurs at less wave steepness is also obtained by the cfd method see fig 16 a the over prediction of critical wave steepness is similar to that of hybrid method which confirms the speculation about the sensitivity of parametric roll occurrence as shown in fig 16 b and c the direct cfd prediction method could achieve better agreement than the hybrid method but for some cases see fig 16 a the predicted roll amplitudes are even more conservative than that of the hybrid method leading to slightly less accuracy it could be observed that the agreement of the direct cfd prediction method improved with the increase of incident wave length besides the predicted steady roll amplitude of one case h λ 0 02272 λ l pp 0 8 as observed anomaly deviated from the model tests trend furthermore owing to overestimated roll amplitude see figs 16 a and fig 17 shipping water could be observed in simulations which do not appear in the model tests as shown in fig 6 and fig 18 this may also be attributed to the limitation of adopted sliding grids as shown in fig 19 at this stage the reason is still unclear and also needs further investigation especially for the comparison of different mesh generations on the other hand the direct cfd prediction method shows its potential as an appropriate fully nonlinear tool to further validate the hybrid method and investigate the limitations as shown in figs 16 and 17 as sliding grids are utilized to simulate the cylindrical near field close to the ship see fig 17 the comparisons in this research are only conducted for small wave steepness cases with an aim to satisfy the requirement of large roll response prediction the heel angle of cylindrical domain follows the ship roll response as shown in fig 11 since the responses of pitch and heave are relatively small simulations using sliding grids could perform well however it should be noted that for simulation of large pitch and heave response this mesh generation may not be applicable anymore while overset grids could be a better option thus it is necessary to study the direct cfd prediction method so as to conduct further investigation of hybrid method considering that the direct cfd prediction method consumes huge computation time the hybrid method still has comparative advantage and is more applicable at the current stage pr accuracy requirements of dsa draft guideline mainly focus on the accuracy of roll amplitude according to the comparison study neither the hybrid method nor the direct cfd prediction method could fully meet these requirements which may indicate the requirements of dsa are over conservative to be satisfied from the practical point of view further clarification may be necessary for accuracy requirements of dsa draft guideline especially the consideration of adding tolerance about critical wave steepness prediction error or failure cases proportion 5 conclusions the hybrid method for the prediction of ship parametric roll is further validated in this research compared with model test results of three ships and a fully nonlinear direct cfd prediction method the prediction accuracy and limitations of the hybrid method are investigated the following conclusions are drawn with the hybrid method the parametric roll can be predicted with a good accuracy within a moderate range of incident wave steepness and roll amplitude response which confirm the conclusion of previous study the upper limit wave of steepness and upper limit of roll amplitude seems to be 0 0225 and 26 7 which are basically sufficient for the prediction of dangerous parametric roll event due to the limitations of the hybrid method especially constrained by the roll damping estimation method and the transverse stability calculation approach the method seems not applicable for simulating cases exceeding the upper limits besides it is neither applicable for simulating cases with strong nonlinearity like slamming shipping water and rudder emergence nor for accurate prediction of critical wave steepness corresponding to sudden appearance of pr event with regard to the pr accuracy requirements it may be necessary to consider adding tolerance about critical wave steepness prediction error or failure cases proportional

22673,as one of the key met ocean environmental loads affecting underwater structural design current is closely related to the failure process of underwater structures such as moorings and risers in marine structural analysis a current model depends mainly on its speed profile corresponding to the design criterion the conventional model of the current speed extreme cse profile ignores the interlayer correlation and renders the current profile model conservative this study is focused on the analysis of a current profile model aimed at the strength and dynamic design of underwater structures with special consideration of the interlayer correlation based on the long term prototype measured data in the liuhua oil field in the south china sea for the current model related to strength design an empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition is first utilized for dimensional reduction then the multi dimensional extreme value problem is converted into an inverse reliability problem the inverse second order reliability method isorm is applied to update the reliability index for an optimal solution the global energy for different multi year return periods is treated as objective functions to determine the extreme value profiles corresponding to strength design of underwater structures for the current model related to dynamic design a statistical classification method based on the clustering large application algorithm clara is performed to obtain a multi profile current model by using a large long term prototype monitoring current dataset an average silhouette width is found and used to determine the final classification number finally a multi profile current model is established for the underwater structural dynamic design the presented current models can be directly applied as the current loads for underwater structural design in the south china sea moreover besides the possibility to extend the proposed method to other ocean areas it can also be used for developing models of wind acoustic and other field variables keywords current profile model failure criteria prototype monitoring inverse second order reliability method isorm clustering analysis 1 introduction in general currents are usually comprised of multiple components such as tidal currents wind driven currents ocean circulations boundary currents internal waves and solitons etc ertekin and rodenbusch 2016 in marine engineering current is usually treated as one of the key loading factors for the design of underwater structures firstly the profile flow of water results in a strong drag force on underwater structures secondly the vortex shedding process of current would cause a vortex induced vibration viv of risers moorings and other flexible structures and may result in fatigue damage with the development of floating structures into deep water the effects of currents on underwater structures will become more prominent in the design of underwater structures the current load mainly depends on the current speed distribution along the water depth in general long return period extreme values of the met ocean environmental factors are usually utilized as the loading criteria for the current loading model due to the difficulties in multivariate extreme values analysis univariate extreme value estimates of the current speed on each flow layer has been used in the conventional design method the envelope of extreme values of current speed on different layers within the same return period was used as the design index this may lead to over conservative estimations especially for deep waters in recent years many researchers have devoted their efforts to further considering the vertical correlation in the derivation of current speed extreme cse profiles one of those approaches is to assume that the cse profile satisfies a specific spatial shape the cse value of the surface layer is then applied to extrapolate the entire extreme profile by using a spatial shape function because the assumed extreme profile shape is difficult to determine in advance the above mentioned method is subjective and not suitable winterstein et al performed a study of extreme current profiles by introducing the turkstra model winterstein et al 2009 2011 firstly a cse value analysis was conducted for each water depth layer then a regression analysis for all depths was performed to obtain multiple conditional current analysis cca profiles this method has been used to calculate the cse model near norway in the north sea similarly based on the conditional extreme value theory jonathan et al 2012 developed multivariate statistical models of current and predicted the extreme values for a multi year return period in the northwestern sea of australia however such multivariate extreme value models were based on the asymptotic extreme value theory and the inevitable ad hoc assumptions that would be needed to make the method work would bring large uncertainties in the calculation in addition the identification of the model parameters increases the computational complexity especially with increasing water depth aiming at the above mentioned problems the combination of the empirical orthogonal function eof and the inverse first order reliability method iform may provide a better alternative and more effective solution in 1997 forristall and cooper 1997 used the eof method to reduce the dimension of current speed profiles and calculated the cse profiles by the iform and the response functions subsequently the iform has been gradually applied in the derivation of extreme current profiles lima et al 2009 used the eof decomposition in the complex domain to determine current velocity extreme profiles for the southeastern seas off brazil jeans et al 2012 obtained three local extreme profiles of current speed at the ormen lange field in norway by using the combinations of the first two orders of the eof modes kyo et al 2013 converted the traditional direction included extreme value problem into a 2d inverse reliability problem with two orthogonal directions and solved it by the iform in general the iform has been applied in many ocean engineering research efforts due to its advantages as a simple theory and low computational complexity however because of iform s linear assumptions the reliability index is treated as a constant making it only applicable to the case where the limit state function is a linear function in many cases the limit state function in extreme profile prediction is often a nonlinear function especially in current speed extreme prediction where the objective function i e response function in some papers of a drag force is exactly a nonlinear function therefore it is often preferred to solve for the extreme profiles using the inverse second order reliability method isorm on the other hand many researchers have begun to study the current speed profile models for the underwater structures subject to dynamic loads two improved calculation methods i e the eof method and the current profile characterization cpc method for the dynamic current speed profile at the faeroe shetland channel were evaluated by jeans et al 2002 the classic cpc method divides the current speed values of each layer into a number of intervals then the intervals in each layer are arranged by permutation and combination as a type of cpc to avoid the lower spatial resolution caused by a large number of groups the classical cpc method is only applicable to a rather limited water depth the eof method however is not severely limited by water depth by employing a dimensional reduction of the raw data the eof method only requires a statistical classification of the first several modes with the development of the marine structures into deep water the eof method will be used more widely due to its spatial advantage both the cpc and eof method were used to reduce large current profile databases into a smaller representative set of profiles for riser design by prevosto et al 2012 who further explored the use of new methods named k means algorithm kma and maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda by jeans et al 2015 however the problem with the inaccuracy caused by the mode selection and grid division requires special attention during the analysis the eof decomposition used in the classification will lead to a loss of the high order profile modes and even cause an insufficient estimation of damage of structures therefore it has been recognized that the above methods such as iform and eof still require further improvement in this study two kinds of current velocity profile models for underwater structure strength and dynamic design are evaluated using prototype measured current data in the south china sea which incorporate the interlayer correlation for the strength design model the eof is used for dimension reduction and the isorm theory is applied to update the reliability index for solving the inverse reliability problem two extreme profile models are determined using the global and local energy as the objective functions for the dynamic design model the clustering large application clara method based on large data is used for solving the cpcs of the original large sample set the average silhouette width is used as the criterion to measure the clustering quality and export the optimal classification results finally the proportions of the cpcs are also determined 2 current model on underwater structure strength design based on eof decomposition and isorm 2 1 eof decomposition the eof decomposition was initially applied in meteorology lorenz 1956 and has been widely used for the analysis of spatiotemporal data as a multivariate analysis method the essence of the eof decomposition is a coordinate transformation two orthogonal matrices are obtained by the eof process the original variable x a spatio temporal data matrix is represented as the product of the two orthogonal matrices subsequently a new mathematical representation of the original variable x in the new coordinate system is obtained as follows xu and wang 2011 1 x p t or x i j k 1 m p i k t k j i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 n where i and j denote spatial location and sampling time respectively each column of p is called a spatial eigenvector or spatial mode t is the principal component pc and represents the temporal amplitude the decomposition process described by equation 1 is called an eof decomposition or spatio temporal decomposition the eof decomposition does not only achieve the spatio temporal decoupling of the variables but also reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional data by using the linear combination of the first several orders modes the spatial modes are usually arranged in the descending order of the variance contribution rates thus the dimensional reduction of the original data can be achieved by the reconstruction of the first several modes and their temporal amplitudes at present the major method of obtaining the spatial eigenvectors is the singular value decomposition svd of the matrix golub and van loan 2013 the eof modals obtained by the decomposition are arranged in descending order according to the variance contribution rate after the eof decomposition of the measurement current data the current velocity profile v c z t can be approximated and developed by the first m orders eof and pc as 2 v c z t i 1 m e o f i z p c i t where z is the spatial location t is sampling time e o f i represents the i th order spatial mode and p c i represents the temporal amplitudes of the i th order spatial mode after the decomposition only pcs depend on time so all the time statistical features of v c are transformed to pcs so that the original problem is converted into a statistical analysis problem of pcs 2 2 isorm extreme prediction in general the extreme current profile for a multi year return period is used as the input of load criteria in the strength design of underwater structures hence the problem of solving the extreme profile in equation 2 could be regarded as the problem of determining the extreme parameters α 1 α 2 α i α m 1 α m for pc s due to the difficulty in solving a multivariate extreme value problem the failure probability for a multi year return period will be converted into a corresponding reliability index then the extreme value problem transforms into the inverse reliability problem of the given target reliability for the reliability problem equivalent normalization is required to map the non normal extreme parameters into the standard normal space u space for a two dimensional problem it is assumed that α 1 and α 2 are two undetermined stochastic parameters the two parameters α 1 and α 2 are determined by distribution fitting as f 1 α 1 and f 2 1 α 2 α 1 respectively f 1 α 1 is the probability distribution of α 1 and f 2 1 is the conditional probability distribution of α 2 then equation 3 rosenblatt 1952 is used to achieve the equivalent normalization to obtain the standard normal variables u 1 and u 2 3 u 1 φ 1 f 1 α 1 u 2 φ 1 f 2 1 α 2 α 1 where φ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable the f 1 could be easily estimated by fitting to the first row of the matrix t obtained in equation 1 while the conditional distribution function f 2 1 can t be estimated directly it was suggested to adopt the indirect fitting method drago et al 2015 eckert gallup et al 2014 during fitting α 1 was divided into several small intervals in each interval the distribution of α 2 was fitted by the same distribution function thus getting the conditional distribution of α 2 α 1 at each interval next constant parameters in these distributions were used as variable parameters function of α 1 to fit the functional relationship between variable parameters of these conditional distribution and the independent variable α 1 when a reliability index β is known for example assuming that the considered design variable such as the current drag force is g u the limit state equation is expressed as g u g u k t 0 g u is the limit state function or performance function and k t is the design value of the design variable for a t year return period the inverse reliability problem is to solve the nonlinear constrained optimization problem as 4 m a x g u o r g u s u b j e c t t o β 2 u i 2 based on design criteria the considered variable is chosen as g u and used as an objective function subsequently the original problem becomes an inverse reliability problem expressed by equation 4 to determine a final design point u in u space as mentioned above β is determined prior to the inverse reliability analysis the iform is often used to solve the inverse reliability problem due to its simple and explicit characteristics for calculating β in the first order reliability method form the reliability index corresponding to the failure probability p f for a multi year return period is given as follows 5 β f o r m φ 1 1 p f where β f o r m is the first order reliability index in addition the reliability index is a constant for a given failure probability in form in fact β is not only related to the failure probability but also changes with the design point or solution therefore form is only applicable to the approximate solution of the linear performance function or a weakly nonlinear performance function the second order reliability method sorm is a more effective and accurate method for solving the reliability problem with stronger nonlinearity in the sorm analysis a quadratic taylor expansion is conducted on the governing function at a design point the second order approximation at the design point accounts for the variations of the main curvatures and leads to a higher precision the reliability index is expressed as a function of the failure probability and main curvatures which is usually expressed as follows breitung 1984 6 β s o r m φ 1 1 p f i 1 n 1 β s o r m κ i 1 2 in which β s o r m is the second order reliability index n is the design variable number and the denominator is called the sorm factor denoted by s f i e 7 s f i 1 n 1 β s o r m κ i 1 2 where κ i is the main curvature of the limit state surface g u 0 at the design point u in the standard normal space for coordinate direction i in the calculation process the sorm factor can be calculated by using a coordinate rotation method breitung 1992 2015 in this study the symmetric rank one sr1 algorithm is used to approximate the hessian matrix the sr1 is applicable to the case when h is non positive and can be asymptotically converged to the real hessian matrix under certain conditions wright and nocedal 2006 based on the sr1 method the hessian matrix can be updated to avoid breakpoints and guarantee the numerical stability after that the reliability index is modified by the iterative proceduregiske et al 2017 in equation 6 the main flow for solving the isorm problem is shown in fig 1 first the initial reliability index β 0 is determined by equation 5 to obtain the initial design point u 0 β 0 cos 45 sin 45 subsequently the arc optimization search algorithm du et al 2004 is applied to solve the optimization problem presented in equation 4 then the values of β o l d and u o l d are transferred as input parameters to equation 6 for updating the reliability index β equation 8 is used to update the design point u o l d 8 u u p d β u p d u o l d u o l d if the convergence condition is not satisfied β u p d and u u p d will be transferred into the arc algorithm again and the isorm will be used for updating until convergence occurs the convergence criterion is as follows 9 u u p d u o l d u u p d 10 3 when the final design point u is obtained u is mapped back to the original physical space through equation 3 for obtaining the extreme parameters α 1 α 2 then the extreme parameters are substituted back into equation 2 for obtaining the final design profile through the above iterative method the isorm method can achieve higher precision than the iform method 3 current profile model for underwater structure dynamic design based on a clustering algorithm the viv or vortex induced motions vim are the main reasons of dynamic damages to risers moorings and other underwater flexible structures according to riser design specifications the current profile is one of the important parameters governing viv dnv 2017 while under non uniform flow conditions the mode shape of the mode excited by the current is difficult to determine and the viv behavior can be complex therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of different current profile configurations and their time statistical distributions at present the dynamic analysis of risers etc is generally focused on several specific current profiles such as uniform flow or shear flow the dynamic simulation by using a single or relatively simple model of current profiles cannot accurately express the responses of the structures in actual ocean conditions therefore an appropriate current velocity profile classification analysis based on field measured data can be used as the input load to reduce the amount of raw data while ensuring high calculation accuracy at present many researchers classify the current profile by eof decomposition the eof method was used to reduce large current profile databases into a smaller representative set of profiles for riser design by prevosto et al 2012 the cpc and its percentages are eventually obtained by the mesh discretization process in the eof decomposition however the artificial grid division method is mainly based on certain empirical properties so the final number of classes is prone to be arbitrary and subjective an excessive number of categories reduce the computational efficiency for fatigue analysis conversely too few categories may oversimplify the profile type furthermore eof decomposition will result in the loss of high order raw data although the loss ratio is small errors may occur in the fatigue design if the major excitation mode of the viv is sensitive to the high order modes in this paper an unsupervised clustering algorithm is used to perform a classification analysis of the current profile the clusters are determined based on the inherent characteristics of the data while no assumptions are made regarding the number and structural features of the clusters it is known that the pam partitioning around medoids method is based on the search for representative medoids and is more robust than the k mean method which is sensitive to outliers however the pam method has higher requirements for time and memory and it is not practical for clustering large data sets the clustering large applications clara method kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 is used for the clustering algorithm clara is also based on the k medoids approach and it is suitable to deal with large data sets instead of considering the entire data set clara uses a random sample of the data set and applies the pam method to calculate the optimal cluster center points from the samples so the clara was used for the clustering algorithm in this paper to deal with our large sample data in order to avoid the data loss due to the use of the eof method the clustering analysis is conducted on the original data without any assumptions the initial range of the clusters is given at first expressed by the number k then a certain parameter such as the average silhouette width is used as an index to measure the quality of the classification results within the chosen initial range of k different clusterings are attempted to output the index values for different k values by observing the variations in the index over k the k corresponding to the maximum index value which indicates an optimal classification result is determined as the final cluster number the corresponding optimal clustering results are the output with the statistics of the percentages of the profile types fig 2 shows the main algorithm flow used in the clustering of the current profile the original profile data constitute an input matrix and each profile is used as a sample i e a column vector of the matrix in case of a given initial range of k the clara algorithm is applied at each specific value of k as follows 1 for a large data sample set multiple samples are extracted by the clara algorithm to determine an optimal subsample 2 the pam algorithm is used for clustering based on an optimal subsample 3 the average silhouette width ss to determine the final optimal classification number k is output the average silhouette width s s above is defined as follows 10 s s 1 k i 1 k s i s i min b a max a min b i 1 2 3 n in which k is the present classification number s i is the silhouette width of the i th point each sample is seen as a point in the multidimensional sample space for the present classification results a is the mean distance between the i th point and other points in the same cluster b a vector is the mean distance between the i th point and other points in the other clusters and n is the total number of samples the silhouette width considers the cohesion and separation degree which reflect the quality of the clustering results the optimal cluster number k and the clustering results selected by the average silhouette width minimize the sample distances in the same cluster and maximize the distances between the different categories once the clustering process is completed the ss for different k values are output the k value corresponding to the maximum ss is used as the optimal number of clusters in addition the results of the clustering are the output representing the optimal classification results the profiles corresponding to the center points of each cluster are selected to serve as the optimal cpc profiles 4 current models for prototype monitoring data from the south china sea 4 1 prototype current data and its correlational analysis the lh11 1 oil field is located in the pearl river mouth basin in the south china sea at the coordinates of 115 42 e and 20 49 n and about 220 km southeast of hong kong fig 3 the nanhaitiaozhan nhtz fps as shown in fig 4 is a semi submersible drilling platform serving the lh11 1 oil field the prototype current data used in this paper originate mainly from the prototype monitoring system established on the nhtz platform du et al 2014 wu et al 2013 which conducts measurements of current velocity and direction using two sets of acoustic doppler current profiling adcp equipment the current meter used for deep water current measurements is installed at a depth of 20 25 m the full measured range water depth about 150 m is divided into 14 layers with an interlayer spacing of 7 m and a sampling rate of 10 min the analysis of the current velocity profiles is performed by using the monitoring data recorded in recent years to verify the correlation between the measured current flow layers the measured current velocity data are assigned into 14 one dimensional time series according to different layers denoted by c u 1 c u 14 the correlation analysis is conducted using a cross correlation function and correlation coefficients fig 5 shows the results of the cross correlation function for relating layer 1 to layers 2 7 and 14 it can be observed that the correlations are mainly concentrated in a short delay time and that the strongest correlation exists between spatially adjacent layers when the delay time is zero the normalized correlation function value is equal to the correlation coefficients as shown in fig 5 fig 6 shows the correlation coefficient distribution for all 14 flow layers the yellow area near the diagonals indicates the strong correlation of the current speed in the adjacent spaces it indicates that the traditional current speed model based on stratification theory would lead to conservative results and the obtained current profiles will be inconsistent with the actual profiles within the inherent correlation in the following section the profile vector is used as the research objective for the current model analysis at first eof decomposition is conducted to analyze the characteristics of current profile modes then the strength design model and dynamic design model are derived based on the isorm and clustering method respectively 4 2 eof decomposition and modal analysis the results of the eof decomposition of the measured current speed profiles with the svd technique are shown in fig 7 as the first several spatial modes occupy the dominant components in all modes fig 7 shows only the first six modes and their temporal amplitudes the corresponding modal variance contribution rates and the cumulative contribution rates of the top ten modes are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the sum of the variance contribution rates of the first and second modes is higher than 95 the sum of the contribution rates of the residual high order modes is less than 5 from the perspective of the variance contribution rate the first two modes the accuracy is 95 are selected for the reconstitution of the current speed profiles in addition the first mode is close to a uniform flow which is similar to the general tidal current pattern and reflect the barotropic properties of the current the second mode is close to the shear flow which is similar to the wind driven current pattern with baroclinic characteristics the spatial shapes of the higher order modes indicate an increase in the complexity as the order increases the third fourth fifth and sixth modes exhibit 1 2 3 and 4 peaks respectively which exhibit the baroclinic characteristics of the current speed however due to the small variance contribution rates of the higher order modes the current speed profile is generally dominated by barotropic characteristics 4 3 current profile model oriented to strength failure in underwater structures for an underwater vertical structure such as a riser the strength design mainly considers the drag force influence of the current on the entire structure so the drag force is set as the objective function to determine the corresponding design domain for a multi year return period the inverse second order reliability method isorm is used to solve the optimal design point of current profile for the chosen return period as the drag force is proportional to the square of the current speed the following simplified objective function is applied for a solution using equation 3 11 g 1 i 1 14 v c 2 z i i 1 14 e o f 1 z i α 1 e o f 2 z i α 2 2 in the above equation z i denotes the depth corresponding to the velocity of each layer the maximization of the drag force or maximization of the global energy is set as the optimal design principle the design point obtained is shown in fig 9 an example of a one year return period in addition to the probability contour and design point for the one year return period fig 9 also gives the limit state curve crossing the design point it is clear from the optimal solution process that the design point is the tangent point of the above two curves and u satisfies g u g 1 u k 1 0 at the design point at this point the drag force g 1 u reaches the maximum value for the one year return period it can be seen that the design point has two meanings first it represents the design profile that generates the maximum drag force among all one year return profiles second it shows the minimum return period or maximum return probability among the profiles producing a one year return drag force a limit state fig 10 gives three design profiles of the current speed for three difference return periods i e 1 year 5 year and 10 year return periods it can be seen that the design profiles for all return periods are similar with regard to the spatial shapes and reflect strong shear flow characteristics 4 4 current profile model for the dynamic failure of underwater structures in the viv design of underwater structures such as risers current analytical methods are mainly based on a semi empirical algorithm or software packages such as shear7 the cpc profiles can be used as the input loads for commercial software after calculating the fatigue damage rates of the riser under various cpc effects the final cumulative damage rate can be obtained by the weighted summation 12 d d i p i in which d is the cumulative fatigue damage rate d i is the damage rate produced by each cpc profile and p i is the corresponding weight coefficient that is the cpc occurrence probability the cpc profiles of the measured data is calculated by the clustering algorithm it is required to determine the initial range of the cluster number k prior to the clustering analysis for a 14d multivariate variable the measured current profile contains 14 depth layers as a 14d random vector at least 14 coordinate bases or spatial modes are required in the multidimensional space to represent all shapes so the number of clusters should not be less than 14 on the other hand the calculation efficiency will be reduced by an excessively large cluster number which is inconsistent with the aim of reducing the number of profiles therefore the maximum class number is set to 200 the changes in the average silhouette width ss over k are shown in fig 11 based on the clustering analysis it can be seen that as k increases ss increases and then decreases in addition the decreasing trend is clear when k is large indicating that an excessive number of profiles leads to the redundancy of the data consequently the index ss reaches the maximum when k 28 hence 28 is the optimal cluster number and the optimal classification results occur for this number fig 12 shows the classification results of 28 types of profiles each subgraph is marked by the occurrence probability during the monitoring period the red color indicates the cpc of each cluster which is selected from the actual profiles by the pam method mentioned above the cpcs selected in this manner guarantee the completeness of the numerical analysis results in the real ocean environment the grey area is the fluctuation range of each cluster of the profiles the two boundaries are determined by the quantiles of 0 05 and 0 95 this model can be used as the current model for the structural dynamic design and each cpc can be used as a loading condition for the numerical modeling analysis then through equation 12 simulated results are combined with each probability as weight for the reliability assessment of the dynamic design in addition if the fatigue life of a riser is estimated it is required to consider the influence of the extreme profile for a multi year return period for the fatigue damage calculation during the measured period the appropriate use of these methods satisfies a given accuracy requirement but for the prediction of the fatigue life the method does not include the damage generated by the return extreme profiles over the measured period a solution meling et al 2002 is to predict the extreme profile firstly before solving the cpcs and add the predicted extreme profile for the multi year return period to the measured data set in this manner the fatigue damage and the remaining structural life can be calculated according to the above mentioned method 5 conclusions the ocean current is the main marine environmental load affecting many offshore engineering structures due to its random and non stationary characteristics the actual current model at a specific area needs to be analyzed and determined in combination with measured data the current model depends on the velocity profiles and the conventional current profile determination method is based on a stratified analysis of the current profile and ignores the spatial correlation using field measured data this study evaluates two kinds of velocity profiles corresponding to structural strength and dynamic design with the combination of eof and isorm method and the clara method respectively the two kinds of velocity profile models for the south china sea are established on the basis of analyses of measured data and provide an important reference for underwater structural design in the south china sea for the current profile model of strength design an eof decomposition is used and the first several order modes are chosen according to the variance contribution rate for dimension reduction as a first step subsequently the sorm theory is applied to update the reliability index for solving the inverse reliability problem instead of the traditional form method to improve the calculation accuracy by iterative solution and more suitable for the case of nonlinear objective function global energy and local energy are used as the objective functions to determine the two extreme current models the designers can select the corresponding extreme profiles based on different design requirements such as water depth and structural dimension for the current profile model focused on the dynamic problem viv or vim of underwater structures the clara clustering algorithm is used to classify the original large data set then the average silhouette width is used as an index for measuring the clustering quality to output the best classification results 28 cpc profiles and their occurrence percentages are provided the optimal classification results provide more accurate load conditions for the dynamic design of underwater structures each cpc profile can be treated as a load condition for the simulation analysis the simulation results can be weighted for the reliability evaluation of the vibration and fatigue design the results of this study provide references for the determination of regional current loads in the underwater structure design of marine engineering the proposed analysis method can be extended to other ocean areas and can also be used for the analysis of wind fields acoustic fields and other similar field variables as well as multiple variables however some aspects of the proposed method require improvement first the current direction and three dimensional extreme models and their solution methods will be the focus of future studies besides it is desirable to develop a more general current model analysis method applicable to other ocean areas acknowledgements the authors are

22673,as one of the key met ocean environmental loads affecting underwater structural design current is closely related to the failure process of underwater structures such as moorings and risers in marine structural analysis a current model depends mainly on its speed profile corresponding to the design criterion the conventional model of the current speed extreme cse profile ignores the interlayer correlation and renders the current profile model conservative this study is focused on the analysis of a current profile model aimed at the strength and dynamic design of underwater structures with special consideration of the interlayer correlation based on the long term prototype measured data in the liuhua oil field in the south china sea for the current model related to strength design an empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition is first utilized for dimensional reduction then the multi dimensional extreme value problem is converted into an inverse reliability

models can be directly applied as the current loads for underwater structural design in the south china sea moreover besides the possibility to extend the proposed method to other ocean areas it can also be used for developing models of wind acoustic and other field variables keywords current profile model failure criteria prototype monitoring inverse second order reliability method isorm clustering analysis 1 introduction in general currents are usually comprised of multiple components such as tidal currents wind driven currents ocean circulations boundary currents internal waves and solitons etc ertekin and rodenbusch 2016 in marine engineering current is usually treated as one of the key loading factors for the design of underwater structures firstly the profile flow of water results in a strong drag force on underwater structures secondly the vortex shedding process of current would cause a vortex induced vibration viv of risers moorings and other flexible structures and may result in fatigue damage with the development of floating structures into deep water the effects of currents on underwater structures will become more prominent in the design of underwater structures the current load mainly depends on the current speed distribution along the water depth in general long return period extreme values of the met ocean environmental factors are usually utilized as the loading criteria for the current loading model due to the difficulties in multivariate extreme values analysis univariate extreme value estimates of the current speed on each flow layer has been used in the conventional design method the envelope of extreme values of current speed on different layers within the same return period was used as the design index this may lead to over conservative estimations especially for deep waters in recent years many researchers have devoted their efforts to further considering the vertical correlation in the derivation of current speed extreme cse profiles one of those approaches is to assume that the cse profile satisfies a specific spatial shape the cse value of the surface layer is then applied to extrapolate the entire extreme profile by using a spatial shape function because the assumed extreme profile shape is difficult to determine in advance the above mentioned method is subjective and not suitable winterstein et al performed a study of extreme current profiles by introducing the turkstra model winterstein et al 2009 2011 firstly a cse value analysis was conducted for each water depth layer then a regression analysis for all depths was performed to obtain multiple conditional current analysis cca profiles this method has been used to calculate the cse model near norway in the north sea similarly based on the conditional extreme value theory jonathan et al 2012 developed multivariate statistical models of current and predicted the extreme values for a multi year return period in the northwestern sea of australia however such multivariate extreme value models were based on the asymptotic extreme value theory and the inevitable ad hoc assumptions that would be needed to make the method work would bring large uncertainties in the calculation in addition the identification of the model parameters increases the computational complexity especially with increasing water depth aiming at the above mentioned problems the combination of the empirical orthogonal function eof and the inverse first order reliability method iform may provide a better alternative and more effective solution in 1997 forristall and cooper 1997 used the eof method to reduce the dimension of current speed profiles and calculated the cse profiles by the iform and the response functions subsequently the iform has been gradually applied in the derivation of extreme current profiles lima et al 2009 used the eof decomposition in the complex domain to determine current velocity extreme profiles for the southeastern seas off brazil jeans et al 2012 obtained three local extreme profiles of current speed at the ormen lange field in norway by using the combinations of the first two orders of the eof modes kyo et al 2013 converted the traditional direction included extreme value problem into a 2d inverse reliability problem with two orthogonal directions and solved it by the iform in general the iform has been applied in many ocean engineering research efforts due to its advantages as a simple theory and low computational complexity however because of iform s linear assumptions the reliability index is treated as a constant making it only applicable to the case where the limit state function is a linear function in many cases the limit state function in extreme profile prediction is often a nonlinear function especially in current speed extreme prediction where the objective function i e response function in some papers of a drag force is exactly a nonlinear function therefore it is often preferred to solve for the extreme profiles using the inverse second order reliability method isorm on the other hand many researchers have begun to study the current speed profile models for the underwater structures subject to dynamic loads two improved calculation methods i e the eof method and the current profile characterization cpc method for the dynamic current speed profile at the faeroe shetland channel were evaluated by jeans et al 2002 the classic cpc method divides the current speed values of each layer into a number of intervals then the intervals in each layer are arranged by permutation and combination as a type of cpc to avoid the lower spatial resolution caused by a large number of groups the classical cpc method is only applicable to a rather limited water depth the eof method however is not severely limited by water depth by employing a dimensional reduction of the raw data the eof method only requires a statistical classification of the first several modes with the development of the marine structures into deep water the eof method will be used more widely due to its spatial advantage both the cpc and eof method were used to reduce large current profile databases into a smaller representative set of profiles for riser design by prevosto et al 2012 who further explored the use of new methods named k means algorithm kma and maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda by jeans et al 2015 however the problem with the inaccuracy caused by the mode selection and grid division requires special attention during the analysis the eof decomposition used in the classification will lead to a loss of the high order profile modes and even cause an insufficient estimation of damage of structures therefore it has been recognized that the above methods such as iform and eof still require further improvement in this study two kinds of current velocity profile models for underwater structure strength and dynamic design are evaluated using prototype measured current data in the south china sea which incorporate the interlayer correlation for the strength design model the eof is used for dimension reduction and the isorm theory is applied to update the reliability index for solving the inverse reliability problem two extreme profile models are determined using the global and local energy as the objective functions for the dynamic design model the clustering large application clara method based on large data is used for solving the cpcs of the original large sample set the average silhouette width is used as the criterion to measure the clustering quality and export the optimal classification results finally the proportions of the cpcs are also determined 2 current model on underwater structure strength design based on eof decomposition and isorm 2 1 eof decomposition the eof decomposition was initially applied in meteorology lorenz 1956 and has been widely used for the analysis of spatiotemporal data as a multivariate analysis method the essence of the eof decomposition is a coordinate transformation two orthogonal matrices are obtained by the eof process the original variable x a spatio temporal data matrix is represented as the product of the two orthogonal matrices subsequently a new mathematical representation of the original variable x in the new coordinate system is obtained as follows xu and wang 2011 1 x p t or x i j k 1 m p i k t k j i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 n where i and j denote spatial location and sampling time respectively each column of p is called a spatial eigenvector or spatial mode t is the principal component pc and represents the temporal amplitude the decomposition process described by equation 1 is called an eof decomposition or spatio temporal decomposition the eof decomposition does not only achieve the spatio temporal decoupling of the variables but also reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional data by using the linear combination of the first several orders modes the spatial modes are usually arranged in the descending order of the variance contribution rates thus the dimensional reduction of the original data can be achieved by the reconstruction of the first several modes and their temporal amplitudes at present the major method of obtaining the spatial eigenvectors is the singular value decomposition svd of the matrix golub and van loan 2013 the eof modals obtained by the decomposition are arranged in descending order according to the variance contribution rate after the eof decomposition of the measurement current data the current velocity profile v c z t can be approximated and developed by the first m orders eof and pc as 2 v c z t i 1 m e o f i z p c i t where z is the spatial location t is sampling time e o f i represents the i th order spatial mode and p c i represents the temporal amplitudes of the i th order spatial mode after the decomposition only pcs depend on time so all the time statistical features of v c are transformed to pcs so that the original problem is converted into a statistical analysis problem of pcs 2 2 isorm extreme prediction in general the extreme current profile for a multi year return period is used as the input of load criteria in the strength design of underwater structures hence the problem of solving the extreme profile in equation 2 could be regarded as the problem of determining the extreme parameters α 1 α 2 α i α m 1 α m for pc s due to the difficulty in solving a multivariate extreme value problem the failure probability for a multi year return period will be converted into a corresponding reliability index then the extreme value problem transforms into the inverse reliability problem of the given target reliability for the reliability problem equivalent normalization is required to map the non normal extreme parameters into the standard normal space u space for a two dimensional problem it is assumed that α 1 and α 2 are two undetermined stochastic parameters the two parameters α 1 and α 2 are determined by distribution fitting as f 1 α 1 and f 2 1 α 2 α 1 respectively f 1 α 1 is the probability distribution of α 1 and f 2 1 is the conditional probability distribution of α 2 then equation 3 rosenblatt 1952 is used to achieve the equivalent normalization to obtain the standard normal variables u 1 and u 2 3 u 1 φ 1 f 1 α 1 u 2 φ 1 f 2 1 α 2 α 1 where φ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable the f 1 could be easily estimated by fitting to the first row of the matrix t obtained in equation 1 while the conditional distribution function f 2 1 can t be estimated directly it was suggested to adopt the indirect fitting method drago et al 2015 eckert gallup et al 2014 during fitting α 1 was divided into several small intervals in each interval the distribution of α 2 was fitted by the same distribution function thus getting the conditional distribution of α 2 α 1 at each interval next constant parameters in these distributions were used as variable parameters function of α 1 to fit the functional relationship between variable parameters of these conditional distribution and the independent variable α 1 when a reliability index β is known for example assuming that the considered design variable such as the current drag force is g u the limit state equation is expressed as g u g u k t 0 g u is the limit state function or performance function and k t is the design value of the design variable for a t year return period the inverse reliability problem is to solve the nonlinear constrained optimization problem as 4 m a x g u o r g u s u b j e c t t o β 2 u i 2 based on design criteria the considered variable is chosen as g u and used as an objective function subsequently the original problem becomes an inverse reliability problem expressed by equation 4 to determine a final design point u in u space as mentioned above β is determined prior to the inverse reliability analysis the iform is often used to solve the inverse reliability problem due to its simple and explicit characteristics for calculating β in the first order reliability method form the reliability index corresponding to the failure probability p f for a multi year return period is given as follows 5 β f o r m φ 1 1 p f where β f o r m is the first order reliability index in addition the reliability index is a constant for a given failure probability in form in fact β is not only related to the failure probability but also changes with the design point or solution therefore form is only applicable to the approximate solution of the linear performance function or a weakly nonlinear performance function the second order reliability method sorm is a more effective and accurate method for solving the reliability problem with stronger nonlinearity in the sorm analysis a quadratic taylor expansion is conducted on the governing function at a design point the second order approximation at the design point accounts for the variations of the main curvatures and leads to a higher precision the reliability index is expressed as a function of the failure probability and main curvatures which is usually expressed as follows breitung 1984 6 β s o r m φ 1 1 p f i 1 n 1 β s o r m κ i 1 2 in which β s o r m is the second order reliability index n is the design variable number and the denominator is called the sorm factor denoted by s f i e 7 s f i 1 n 1 β s o r m κ i 1 2 where κ i is the main curvature of the limit state surface g u 0 at the design point u in the standard normal space for coordinate direction i in the calculation process the sorm factor can be calculated by using a coordinate rotation method breitung 1992 2015 in this study the symmetric rank one sr1 algorithm is used to approximate the hessian matrix the sr1 is applicable to the case when h is non positive and can be asymptotically converged to the real hessian matrix under certain conditions wright and nocedal 2006 based on the sr1 method the hessian matrix can be updated to avoid breakpoints and guarantee the numerical stability after that the reliability index is modified by the iterative proceduregiske et al 2017 in equation 6 the main flow for solving the isorm problem is shown in fig 1 first the initial reliability index β 0 is determined by equation 5 to obtain the initial design point u 0 β 0 cos 45 sin 45 subsequently the arc optimization search algorithm du et al 2004 is applied to solve the optimization problem presented in equation 4 then the values of β o l d and u o l d are transferred as input parameters to equation 6 for updating the reliability index β equation 8 is used to update the design point u o l d 8 u u p d β u p d u o l d u o l d if the convergence condition is not satisfied β u p d and u u p d will be transferred into the arc algorithm again and the isorm will be used for updating until convergence occurs the convergence criterion is as follows 9 u u p d u o l d u u p d 10 3 when the final design point u is obtained u is mapped back to the original physical space through equation 3 for obtaining the extreme parameters α 1 α 2 then the extreme parameters are substituted back into equation 2 for obtaining the final design profile through the above iterative method the isorm method can achieve higher precision than the iform method 3 current profile model for underwater structure dynamic design based on a clustering algorithm the viv or vortex induced motions vim are the main reasons of dynamic damages to risers moorings and other underwater flexible structures according to riser design specifications the current profile is one of the important parameters governing viv dnv 2017 while under non uniform flow conditions the mode shape of the mode excited by the current is difficult to determine and the viv behavior can be complex therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of different current profile configurations and their time statistical distributions at present the dynamic analysis of risers etc is generally focused on several specific current profiles such as uniform flow or shear flow the dynamic simulation by using a single or relatively simple model of current profiles cannot accurately express the responses of the structures in actual ocean conditions therefore an appropriate current velocity profile classification analysis based on field measured data can be used as the input load to reduce the amount of raw data while ensuring high calculation accuracy at present many researchers classify the current profile by eof decomposition the eof method was used to reduce large current profile databases into a smaller representative set of profiles for riser design by prevosto et al 2012 the cpc and its percentages are eventually obtained by the mesh discretization process in the eof decomposition however the artificial grid division method is mainly based on certain empirical properties so the final number of classes is prone to be arbitrary and subjective an excessive number of categories reduce the computational efficiency for fatigue analysis conversely too few categories may oversimplify the profile type furthermore eof decomposition will result in the loss of high order raw data although the loss ratio is small errors may occur in the fatigue design if the major excitation mode of the viv is sensitive to the high order modes in this paper an unsupervised clustering algorithm is used to perform a classification analysis of the current profile the clusters are determined based on the inherent characteristics of the data while no assumptions are made regarding the number and structural features of the clusters it is known that the pam partitioning around medoids method is based on the search for representative medoids and is more robust than the k mean method which is sensitive to outliers however the pam method has higher requirements for time and memory and it is not practical for clustering large data sets the clustering large applications clara method kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 is used for the clustering algorithm clara is also based on the k medoids approach and it is suitable to deal with large data sets instead of considering the entire data set clara uses a random sample of the data set and applies the pam method to calculate the optimal cluster center points from the samples so the clara was used for the clustering algorithm in this paper to deal with our large sample data in order to avoid the data loss due to the use of the eof method the clustering analysis is conducted on the original data without any assumptions the initial range of the clusters is given at first expressed by the number k then a certain parameter such as the average silhouette width is used as an index to measure the quality of the classification results within the chosen initial range of k different clusterings are attempted to output the index values for different k values by observing the variations in the index over k the k corresponding to the maximum index value which indicates an optimal classification result is determined as the final cluster number the corresponding optimal clustering results are the output with the statistics of the percentages of the profile types fig 2 shows the main algorithm flow used in the clustering of the current profile the original profile data constitute an input matrix and each profile is used as a sample i e a column vector of the matrix in case of a given initial range of k the clara algorithm is applied at each specific value of k as follows 1 for a large data sample set multiple samples are extracted by the clara algorithm to determine an optimal subsample 2 the pam algorithm is used for clustering based on an optimal subsample 3 the average silhouette width ss to determine the final optimal classification number k is output the average silhouette width s s above is defined as follows 10 s s 1 k i 1 k s i s i min b a max a min b i 1 2 3 n in which k is the present classification number s i is the silhouette width of the i th point each sample is seen as a point in the multidimensional sample space for the present classification results a is the mean distance between the i th point and other points in the same cluster b a vector is the mean distance between the i th point and other points in the other clusters and n is the total number of samples the silhouette width considers the cohesion and separation degree which reflect the quality of the clustering results the optimal cluster number k and the clustering results selected by the average silhouette width minimize the sample distances in the same cluster and maximize the distances between the different categories once the clustering process is completed the ss for different k values are output the k value corresponding to the maximum ss is used as the optimal number of clusters in addition the results of the clustering are the output representing the optimal classification results the profiles corresponding to the center points of each cluster are selected to serve as the optimal cpc profiles 4 current models for prototype monitoring data from the south china sea 4 1 prototype current data and its correlational analysis the lh11 1 oil field is located in the pearl river mouth basin in the south china sea at the coordinates of 115 42 e and 20 49 n and about 220 km southeast of hong kong fig 3 the nanhaitiaozhan nhtz fps as shown in fig 4 is a semi submersible drilling platform serving the lh11 1 oil field the prototype current data used in this paper originate mainly from the prototype monitoring system established on the nhtz platform du et al 2014 wu et al 2013 which conducts measurements of current velocity and direction using two sets of acoustic doppler current profiling adcp equipment the current meter used for deep water current measurements is installed at a depth of 20 25 m the full measured range water depth about 150 m is divided into 14 layers with an interlayer spacing of 7 m and a sampling rate of 10 min the analysis of the current velocity profiles is performed by using the monitoring data recorded in recent years to verify the correlation between the measured current flow layers the measured current velocity data are assigned into 14 one dimensional time series according to different layers denoted by c u 1 c u 14 the correlation analysis is conducted using a cross correlation function and correlation coefficients fig 5 shows the results of the cross correlation function for relating layer 1 to layers 2 7 and 14 it can be observed that the correlations are mainly concentrated in a short delay time and that the strongest correlation exists between spatially adjacent layers when the delay time is zero the normalized correlation function value is equal to the correlation coefficients as shown in fig 5 fig 6 shows the correlation coefficient distribution for all 14 flow layers the yellow area near the diagonals indicates the strong correlation of the current speed in the adjacent spaces it indicates that the traditional current speed model based on stratification theory would lead to conservative results and the obtained current profiles will be inconsistent with the actual profiles within the inherent correlation in the following section the profile vector is used as the research objective for the current model analysis at first eof decomposition is conducted to analyze the characteristics of current profile modes then the strength design model and dynamic design model are derived based on the isorm and clustering method respectively 4 2 eof decomposition and modal analysis the results of the eof decomposition of the measured current speed profiles with the svd technique are shown in fig 7 as the first several spatial modes occupy the dominant components in all modes fig 7 shows only the first six modes and their temporal amplitudes the corresponding modal variance contribution rates and the cumulative contribution rates of the top ten modes are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the sum of the variance contribution rates of the first and second modes is higher than 95 the sum of the contribution rates of the residual high order modes is less than 5 from the perspective of the variance contribution rate the first two modes the accuracy is 95 are selected for the reconstitution of the current speed profiles in addition the first mode is close to a uniform flow which is similar to the general tidal current pattern and reflect the barotropic properties of the current the second mode is close to the shear flow which is similar to the wind driven current pattern with baroclinic characteristics the spatial shapes of the higher order modes indicate an increase in the complexity as the order increases the third fourth fifth and sixth modes exhibit 1 2 3 and 4 peaks respectively which exhibit the baroclinic characteristics of the current speed however due to the small variance contribution rates of the higher order modes the current speed profile is generally dominated by barotropic characteristics 4 3 current profile model oriented to strength failure in underwater structures for an underwater vertical structure such as a riser the strength design mainly considers the drag force influence of the current on the entire structure so the drag force is set as the objective function to determine the corresponding design domain for a multi year return period the inverse second order reliability method isorm is used to solve the optimal design point of current profile for the chosen return period as the drag force is proportional to the square of the current speed the following simplified objective function is applied for a solution using equation 3 11 g 1 i 1 14 v c 2 z i i 1 14 e o f 1 z i α 1 e o f 2 z i α 2 2 in the above equation z i denotes the depth corresponding to the velocity of each layer the maximization of the drag force or maximization of the global energy is set as the optimal design principle the design point obtained is shown in fig 9 an example of a one year return period in addition to the probability contour and design point for the one year return period fig 9 also gives the limit state curve crossing the design point it is clear from the optimal solution process that the design point is the tangent point of the above two curves and u satisfies g u g 1 u k 1 0 at the design point at this point the drag force g 1 u reaches the maximum value for the one year return period it can be seen that the design point has two meanings first it represents the design profile that generates the maximum drag force among all one year return profiles second it shows the minimum return period or maximum return probability among the profiles producing a one year return drag force a limit state fig 10 gives three design profiles of the current speed for three difference return periods i e 1 year 5 year and 10 year return periods it can be seen that the design profiles for all return periods are similar with regard to the spatial shapes and reflect strong shear flow characteristics 4 4 current profile model for the dynamic failure of underwater structures in the viv design of underwater structures such as risers current analytical methods are mainly based on a semi empirical algorithm or software packages such as shear7 the cpc profiles can be used as the input loads for commercial software after calculating the fatigue damage rates of the riser under various cpc effects the final cumulative damage rate can be obtained by the weighted summation 12 d d i p i in which d is the cumulative fatigue damage rate d i is the damage rate produced by each cpc profile and p i is the corresponding weight coefficient that is the cpc occurrence probability the cpc profiles of the measured data is calculated by the clustering algorithm it is required to determine the initial range of the cluster number k prior to the clustering analysis for a 14d multivariate variable the measured current profile contains 14 depth layers as a 14d random vector at least 14 coordinate bases or spatial modes are required in the multidimensional space to represent all shapes so the number of clusters should not be less than 14 on the other hand the calculation efficiency will be reduced by an excessively large cluster number which is inconsistent with the aim of reducing the number of profiles therefore the maximum class number is set to 200 the changes in the average silhouette width ss over k are shown in fig 11 based on the clustering analysis it can be seen that as k increases ss increases and then decreases in addition the decreasing trend is clear when k is large indicating that an excessive number of profiles leads to the redundancy of the data consequently the index ss reaches the maximum when k 28 hence 28 is the optimal cluster number and the optimal classification results occur for this number fig 12 shows the classification results of 28 types of profiles each subgraph is marked by the occurrence probability during the monitoring period the red color indicates the cpc of each cluster which is selected from the actual profiles by the pam method mentioned above the cpcs selected in this manner guarantee the completeness of the numerical analysis results in the real ocean environment the grey area is the fluctuation range of each cluster of the profiles the two boundaries are determined by the quantiles of 0 05 and 0 95 this model can be used as the current model for the structural dynamic design and each cpc can be used as a loading condition for the numerical modeling analysis then through equation 12 simulated results are combined with each probability as weight for the reliability assessment of the dynamic design in addition if the fatigue life of a riser is estimated it is required to consider the influence of the extreme profile for a multi year return period for the fatigue damage calculation during the measured period the appropriate use of these methods satisfies a given accuracy requirement but for the prediction of the fatigue life the method does not include the damage generated by the return extreme profiles over the measured period a solution meling et al 2002 is to predict the extreme profile firstly before solving the cpcs and add the predicted extreme profile for the multi year return period to the measured data set in this manner the fatigue damage and the remaining structural life can be calculated according to the above mentioned method 5 conclusions the ocean current is the main marine environmental load affecting many offshore engineering structures due to its random and non stationary characteristics the actual current model at a specific area needs to be analyzed and determined in combination with measured data the current model depends on the velocity profiles and the conventional current profile determination method is based on a stratified analysis of the current profile and ignores the spatial correlation using field measured data this study evaluates two kinds of velocity profiles corresponding to structural strength and dynamic design with the combination of eof and isorm method and the clara method respectively the two kinds of velocity profile models for the south china sea are established on the basis of analyses of measured data and provide an important reference for underwater structural design in the south china sea for the current profile model of strength design an eof decomposition is used and the first several order modes are chosen according to the variance contribution rate for dimension reduction as a first step subsequently the sorm theory is applied to update the reliability index for solving the inverse reliability problem instead of the traditional form method to improve the calculation accuracy by iterative solution and more suitable for the case of nonlinear objective function global energy and local energy are used as the objective functions to determine the two extreme current models the designers can select the corresponding extreme profiles based on different design requirements such as water depth and structural dimension for the current profile model focused on the dynamic problem viv or vim of underwater structures the clara clustering algorithm is used to classify the original large data set then the average silhouette width is used as an index for measuring the clustering quality to output the best classification results 28 cpc profiles and their occurrence percentages are provided the optimal classification results provide more accurate load conditions for the dynamic design of underwater structures each cpc profile can be treated as a load condition for the simulation analysis the simulation results can be weighted for the reliability evaluation of the vibration and fatigue design the results of this study provide references for the determination of regional current loads in the underwater structure design of marine engineering the proposed analysis method can be extended to other ocean areas and can also be used for the analysis of wind fields acoustic fields and other similar field variables as well as multiple variables however some aspects of the proposed method require improvement first the current direction and three dimensional extreme models and their solution methods will be the focus of future studies besides it is desirable to develop a more general current model analysis method applicable to other ocean areas acknowledgements the authors are

22674,existing concrete structures in cool coastal areas are prone to be attacked by both chloride penetration and freeze thaw cycles ftcs this study establishes a multi phase and multi component ionic transport model for concrete serving in cold climate coast or ocean engineering aiming at further exploring chloride transport mechanism under freeze thaw cycles in a quantitative manner unlike the most of existing work herein the time varying porosity is described and involved in both the binding isotherm and diffusion coefficient to consider the pore evolution induced by ftcs by solving the modified mass conservation equations the time dependent relationship between the bound and free chlorides as well as the spatial temporal distributions of multi species is obtained by using this model and its reliability is validated against third party experimental data parametric analysis is carefully performed on a series of significant influencing factors i e water to cement ratios hydroxyl concentrations external chloride concentrations and internal temperature variations which affect chloride binding remarkably during freeze thaw actions bayesian sense is applied to combine the common regularity of numerical models and individual information of experimental by updating the penetration depth which can calculate a more reasonable penetration depth keywords durability degradation chloride binding capacity diffusivity freeze thaw cycles porosity 1 introduction chloride induced corrosion causes serious durability degradation of rc reinforce concrete structures when exposed to ocean environments jin et al 2015 mundra et al 2017 wang et al 2016 mao et al 2019 the concentration gradient of chlorides between the seawater and the internal pore solution of concrete structures leads to the chloride diffusion in concrete the passive film will become unstable once the ratio of cl oh in the concrete increases higher than 0 6 and that will lead to high potential of corrosion of the reinforcing steel bar al gadhib 2010 yang 2006 in addition pore solution within concrete freezes into ice during freezing thawing process and that will generate internal stress when the stress exceeds the strength of the concrete micro cracks may occur and provide interconnecting flow channels for penetrating more chlorides which can accelerate the transport process of chloride ions in cold regions šeps et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b hence the combination process of chloride penetration and freeze thaw action is fatal to offshore engineering such as bridges piers harbors wharves etc li and shao 2014 saito et al 1994 the acceleration of steel corrosion during ftcs leads to more serious loss of cross section of steel bars cracks of concrete cover and reduction of the bond strength between the reinforcement and the concrete this circumstance will seriously reduce the service life of coastal rc structures sakulich and bentz 2012 yu et al 2017b zhu et al 2016 some chlorides are bound at the hydration products of cement paste by chemical combination and physical adsorption during transport process ann and hong 2018 tang and nilsson 1993 yi et al 2018 the reduction of free chlorides directly reduces the diffusivity and meanwhile the generated friedel s salt can fill the pore structure of the matrix which further enhances the chloride resistance of the concrete for this reason chloride binding is a significant beneficial mechanism to the durability design of concrete structures castellote et al 1999 panesar and chidiac 2009 yuan et al 2009 although only free chlorides are supposed to be responsible for the initiation of the rebar corrosion bound chlorides are also deleterious during the process the concentrations of free and bound chlorides are at equilibrium in the pore solution some bound chlorides tend to release into pore solution when the concentration of free chlorides changes as a result of various physical and chemical mechanisms which is known as the chloride binding isotherm olsson et al 2018 ramírez ortíz et al 2018 during free thaw action this isotherm is amended by considering some other issues such as cycles of freeze thaw action temperature variation external chloride concentration hydroxyl concentration water cement ratio transport time and coupling of multi ionic species in this study to describe the mechanism of adsorption desorption of chlorides baroghel bouny et al 2012 bernal et al 2012 the chloride binding isotherm which is the key to the binding capacity and diffusivity on the way chloride front penetrates into concrete unfortunately common descriptions of chloride binding are always simplified as linear langmuir or freundlich isotherms for simple and practical application and that may misrepresent the binding capacity as well as chloride diffusivity particularly when the concrete suffers freeze thaw action ye et al 2016b pore solution will freeze into ice and generate internal stress in the concrete during ftcs which causes the pore structure to expand the time dependent porosity which is better for characterizing pore structures liu et al 2014 she et al 2017 wang et al 2017a hou et al 2018 is needed to represent the pore evolution in such a case the chloride binding cannot reach equilibrium anymore because of the cycling freeze thaw action on the one hand the chloride binding effect becomes more obvious in the concrete since freeze thaw action increase the porosity of concrete which provides more channels for chlorides penetrating the concrete therefore more free chlorides will appear in the concrete and thus the concentration of bound chlorides which is coupled with the concentration of free chlorides will also become greater in the concrete wang and ueda 2011 on the other hand expanded pore structure provides fewer sites for chlorides to be bound because of the reduced solid phase in cement phase which decreases the binding capacity tang and nilsson 1993 liu et al 2015a in this case the chloride binding needs to be carefully modified with the time varying porosity to analyze the influence of freeze thaw actions on the chloride binding capacity chloride binding in concrete is a thermodynamic process panesar and chidiac 2011 ukpata et al 2017 higher temperature enhances the thermal vibration of adsorbates resulting in less bound chlorides on the other hand higher temperature also causes more bound chlorides due to two reasons one is that the higher temperature increases the reaction rate between chloride ions and csh gel the other is that higher temperature also increases the chloride diffusivity which also gives rise to bound chlorides thus temperature effects are crucial for binding isotherm particularly when the concrete is subjected to free and thaw actions in which the temperature changes below and above the freezing point circularly and in a large range feng et al 2018 recent experimental and analytical results showed the influence of temperature variation on chloride diffusivity alhozaimy et al 2012 wang et al 2012 however very few researchers focused on the temperature effect on ionic binding especially when the concrete structures suffer chloride attack and freeze thaw action in marine coastal environments besides there are some other significant factors also increasing the complexity of binding process for example firstly higher external chloride concentration provides more ions penetrating into the concrete and thus more free chlorides tend to be bound at the surface of cement matrix hirao et al 2005 ye et al 2016a 2016b secondly the hydroxyl ions released due to the mechanism of anion exchange will increase the ph value of the pore solution since an increased ph of the chloride solution increases the solubility of friedel s salt the bound chlorides are obviously sensitive with the variation of hydroxide concentration wang et al 2009 thirdly like the effects caused by ftcs higher water to cement ratio also brings two opposite effects it will lead to more bound chloride since higher w c ratio is easier to create more transport channels when suffering freeze thaw actions meira et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 whereas it meanwhile lead to less bound chloride since higher w c ratio also provides fewer sites for chloride binding thomas et al 2012 in addition curing time increases the degree of maturity of c s h gel which is corresponding to a great surface thus the bound chlorides absorbed by csh needs quite a long time to reach equilibrium condition in the pore solution cheewaket et al 2010 medeiros junior et al 2015 she et al 2018a wang et al 2017b hou et al 2019 the coupling of different species in concrete also affects the binding process due to the generated electrostatic potential caused by charge imbalance between cl oh na k etc during multi species transport liu et al 2012 2015a 2015b according to above issues it is necessary to consider these influencing factors in binding isotherm and thus to obtain the binding capacity and diffusivity of chloride in a more quantitative manner the diagrammatic of which is shown in fig 1 in light of afore mentioned complexity of binding isotherm the numerical models are more suitable to isolate the influence of individual variable at pore scale for further understanding the influencing factors during ionic binding abyaneh et al 2014 2016 caggiano et al 2018 some researchers have devoted to modify the binding isotherm model to describe the relationship between free and bound chloride ions in different circumstances xi et al established a two phase material cement paste and aggregate model involving a set of variables e g initial and boundary chloride concentration ratio of pore solution to concrete ratio of c s h to concrete pore structure and curing time to modify the binding isotherm xi and bažant 1999 kim et al adopted a non linear chloride binding isotherm considering concrete mixture proportions binder components curing temperature environmental temperature and also external chloride concentration kim et al 2016 geng et al established a transport model with binding isotherm in which carbonation influenced the adsorption desorption of bound chlorides geng et al 2016 geng and mo 2014 ishida et al developed a ducom model for sound and cracked concrete in which the binding isotherm is modified by cement mineral composition and types of admixtures ishida et al 2009 tang developed a more engineer friendly model called clinconc model in which the binding isotherm was time dependent and had a good correlation with diffusion coefficient tang 2008 it should be mentioned that all above findings are obtained from freeze thaw free environments the evolution of pore structure induced by ftcs affects the binding capacity greatly in cold regions li et al combined the binding isotherm with fick s second law to investigate the influence of freeze thaw action on chloride transport this work considered the interactional effects between environmental exchanges i e influences of chloride binding temperature variation external chloride concentrations and pore size distributions to calculate the chloride diffusivity li et al 2016 jiang et al proposed a mesoscopic model considering binding effect to obtain the chloride profiles which adopted the time dependent porosity during ftcs jiang et al 2018 unfortunately though the porosity and influencing factors influenced the chloride diffusivity the binding capacity was still constant the literature survey shows that only very few researches consider chloride binding capacity and diffusivity simultaneously when concrete structures suffers freeze thaw action it is also noticed that existing models only adopted the common binding isotherms for simplification or practical application neglecting several significant issues especially the frost induced pore evolution of concrete in the cold regions in this study the time varying porosity regarded as the best characterization of the pore structure is involved in both the binding isotherm and diffusion coefficient to consider the pore evolution to develop the ionic transport model besides the time dependent relationship between the bound and free chlorides as well as the spatial temporal distributions of any other ionic species is obtained by using this model and its reliability is validated against third party experimental data in addition parametric analysis is carefully performed on a series of significant influencing factors i e water to cement ratios hydroxyl concentrations external chloride concentrations and internal temperature variations which affect chloride binding remarkably during freeze thaw actions based on these obtained results bayesian sense is applied to combine the common regularity of numerical models and individual information of experimental by updating the penetration depth which can calculate a more reasonable penetration depth these updated results can bring insights to the prediction of the service life of existing concrete structures in ocean environments 2 modeling approach concrete is a kind of porous material that is highly heterogeneous at the micro scale the individual phases such as aggregate particles cement matrix and itzs interfacial transition zones are developed in the numerical models which investigates the effect of individual phase on chloride transport during ftcs du 2019 šavija et al 2014 she et al 2018b the time dependent porosity is a linkage which reflects how freeze thaw action affects the binding capacity and ionic diffusivity tang and gulikers 2007 zhang et al 2017a hence the modeling approach in this study is divided into three modules firstly freeze thaw action affects the pore structure representing by varying porosity in the model secondly time varying porosity affects the ionic diffusivity and it combines with the diffusion coefficient thirdly time varying porosity affects chloride binding capacity which is represented by the modified mass conservation beyond the three parts the adopted binding isotherm also considers other significant influencing factors such as hydroxyl concentration temperature variation transport time and so on 2 1 evolution of pore structure induced by ftcs the evolution of pore structure and the appearance of micro cracks are two most important phenomena during freeze thaw cycles porosity related to the degree of continuity of the pore system is regarded as the most significant parameter of pore structure affecting the transport properties of concrete the influence of micro cracks on chloride transport can be partly reflected by the increased porosity note that the damage evolution of pore structures induced by ftcs herein is defined until the first macro crack appears the influence of freeze thaw action on porosity of cement paste is determined by partial differential equation sun and chen 2011 1 d φ d n l φ where φ is the porosity of the cement paste n represents the number of ftcs and l is an empirical constant relating to the w c ratio eq 1 can be solved as follows 2 φ φ 0 exp l n where φ 0 is the initial porosity of cement paste before suffering freeze thaw action for portland cement the following equation sun et al 2002 are used to estimate φ 0 in eq 2 3 φ 0 w c 0 17 α w c 0 32 where w c represents the water cement ratio and α is the degree of hydration ranging from 0 to 1 regarding to the long term hydration values a complementary equation for solving the relationship between α and w c has been proposed bentz et al 1998 4 α 1 e x p 3 15 w c some empirical or theoretical equations have been developed to calculate the chloride diffusivity in cement paste this work adopts the generalized effective medium theory and develops the diffusion coefficient of cement paste d c p as follows du et al 2015a yu et al 2017a 5 d c p 2 φ 2 75 d 0 φ 1 75 3 φ m 1 φ 2 75 where d 0 represents the ionic diffusivity in pore solution in this equation the solid phase in cement paste is relatively impermeable compared with the pore solution and m is a constant which is set as 14 44 in this study du et al 2014 zheng and zhou 2008 2 2 influencing factors associated with ionic transport when the pore solution freezes it means a large portion of the pore structure will be clogged with ice and this will reduce permeability besides low temperature will also reduce ionic mobility and permeability this mesoscopic numerical model presented in this paper is based on the existing concrete buildings in mature concrete older than 28 days the arrhenius equation could be approximatively applied over a large temperature range 30 c 70 c despite the existence of a sudden change mccarter et al 2015 and the temperature ranges from 10 c to 20 c in the freezing processes and 20 c to 10 c in the thawing processes in this study therefore the relationship between temperature variation and diffusion coefficient is assumed to be described by arrhenius equation 6 d t d c o n e x p e a r 1 t 0 1 t where d t is the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete while d c o n is the coefficient at t 0 t 0 298 15 k e a is the activation energy meaning chloride transport needs enough energy to overcome the activation barrier which is 27 0 kj mol obtained from the immersion tests wang et al 2014 there are several ionic species existing in pore solution including chloride hydroxyl sodium potassium etc the concentration of hydroxyl is determined by the concentrations of sodium and potassium besides the diffusion coefficients of diverse ions are different which generates charge imbalance mathematically nernst planck equation expresses the flux of ions in a multi species solution as follows the chemical activity effect is neglected 7 j k d k c k z k d k f r t 0 c k ϕ where j k is the flux c k is the concentration d k is the diffusion coefficient z k is the charge number f 9 648 10 4 c mol 1 is the faraday constant r 8 314 j m o l 1 k 1 is the laplace differential operator and k stands for the k th ionic specie k 1 2 3 and 4 represent chloride hydroxyl sodium and potassium ϕ is the local electrical potential which maintains electroneutrality in the medium eq 8 is required for ionic species involved in the pore solution due to the mass conservation 8 c k t j k where t is the transport time substituting eqs 7 and 8 it yields 9 c k t d k 2 c k z k d k f r t 0 c k ϕ the following current conservation of all ionic species involved in concrete is obtained 10 i f k 1 n z k j k where i is the local current density substituting eq 7 into eq 10 it yields 11 ϕ i f k 1 n z k d k c k f r t 0 k 1 n z k 2 d k c k since the model in this study is 2 d the local current density in eq 11 needs to be expressed in x and y directions as i x and i y as the current density satisfy i 0 i x ψ x and i y ψ y can be obtained through 2 ψ 2 ψ 2 x 2 ψ 2 y the principle of electroneutrality of four ions is considered and the potential ψ at the boundary condition is defined as 0 2 3 mass conservation considering time varying porosity the ionic transport equations are originally used in electrolyte solution the effect of time varying porosity needs to be considered when it is applied in porous material the mass conservation equation is established in the cement paste rather than the electrolyte solution this work needs to define the flux as the mole number of ionic species transport through the unit area of the cement paste while the standard description of mass concentration is described as the mole number of the ionic species in the unit volume of the electrolyte to solve this contradiction eq 9 uses φ c k rather than c k to represent the concentration of the ionic species in the unit volume of the cement paste jiang et al 2018 hu et al 2018 12 φ 0 exp l n c k t 1 φ 0 exp l n s t φ 0 exp l n j k where s is the concentration of bound chloride substituting eqs 2 and 7 into eq 11 it yields 13 φ 0 exp l n c k t 1 φ 0 exp l n s t φ 0 exp l n d k 2 c k z k d k f r t c k ϕ the mass conservation of bound chloride can be described using the following equilibrium equation 14 s t k b s s e q where k b is the rate constant and s e q is the concentration of bound chloride when the equilibrium of concentration of free and bound chlorides has been reached note that the bound chlorides have the potential to release when s s e q otherwise free chlorides would be bound at hydrated cement geng et al 2016 2 4 modification of binding isotherm generally in order to describe the relationship between free and bound chlorides studies always adopt two kinds of binding isotherms at a given temperature liner isotherm and nonlinear isotherms the former isotherm has been certified to be oversimplified in several researches which may misestimate the concentration of bound chloride martı n pérez et al 2000 however it can be a good choice under long term transport process since a concentration gradient of hydroxyl exists in the pore solution sandberg 1999 the latter kind of isotherm includes langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm which are widely accepted langmuir isotherm assumed as monolayer physical adsorption works better for low chloride concentration in pore solution and freundlich isotherm works best for high concentration thomas et al 2012 during the chloride transport process the linear langmuir and freundlich binding isotherms are often described as follows li and shao 2014 15 s e q α c 1 16 s e q α c 1 1 β c 1 17 s e q α c 1 β where c 1 is the concentration of free chlorides in the pore solution note that though c 1 c 1 s is always regarded as the traditional binding capacity ababneh et al 2003 s c 1 s rather than c 1 c 1 s is more accurate to represent the binding effect since the ratio of concentration of bound chlorides and total chlorides can be more intuitive to reflect the increment of the bound chlorides therefore this work adopts the special binding capacity s c 1 s to better describe the relationships between bound chlorides and total chlorides the higher the value of s c 1 s the slower the transport process of chloride chang 2017 li and shao 2014 tang 2008 xi and bažant 1999 the concentrations of bound chloride at equilibrium need to be modified with several other influencing factors as follows langmuir isotherm is chosen here to represent nonlinear isotherm baroghel bouny et al 2012 tang and nilsson 1993 18 s e q f t k o h k b m k t b n c s h α c 1 c oh 19 s e q f t k o h k b m k t b n c s h α c 1 c oh β c 1 where n c s h is the content of c s h in mol m3 of material α and β are the isotherm parameters which depend on the mix composition of concrete c oh is the concentration of hydroxide ions in the pore solution the exchange between chloride and hydroxyl ions is described as the following reaction equation baroghel bouny et al 2012 yang et al 2017 20 c s h oh na cl c s h cl na oh the time dependent factor f t describes the effect of time on chloride binding 21 f t a t ln t c l 0 5 1 where a t is a constant varying from 0 1 to 0 6 and the value is determined as 0 36 in this study tang 2008 t c l is the contamination time and is determined by the transport depth t c l t is determined at the surface of the concrete and t c l 0 is determined at the depth where chlorides do not reach hence t c l c 1 c s t and eq 17 is modified as the following equation 22 f t a t ln c 1 c s t 0 5 1 where c s is the concentration of free chloride at the exposed concrete surface k o h is the factor reflecting the influence of initial alkalinity of the concrete 23 k o h e 0 59 1 0 043 o h where oh is the initial hydroxide concentration which excludes the transport of hydroxyl ions in the concrete k t b reflects the effect of temperature variation on chloride binding and it is also assumed to be described by arrhenius equation 24 k t b e e b r 1 t 1 t 0 where e b is also set as 27 kj mol k b m is used to investigate the effect of gel content and porosity of the concrete 25 k b m w g e l 1000 φ where w g e l 390 k g m 3 is the gel content the time varying porosity representing the frost induced evolution of pore structure can be determined by eq 2 the effect of porosity on ionic diffusivity is determined by eq 5 the two modified binding isotherms in eqs 15 and 16 calculate the concentration of bound chloride eq 13 calculates the concentration distribution of free chlorides and bound chlorides at any time in saturated concrete when given initial and boundary conditions note that the diffusion coefficient of each phase of concrete in eq 13 needs to be determined respectively 3 model foundation to obtain the chloride concentration distribution of concrete applied to freeze thaw action a 2 d and 3 phase numerical model is developed the specimen is in the size of 50 mm 50 mm four different ionic species chloride hydroxyl sodium and potassium exist in the pore solution of concrete in this study table 1 provides the ionic transport parameters of these species as well as the boundary and initial conditions of the models the concentration of chloride 520 mol m3 is approximately transformed from 3 nacl solution moreover the concentration of the solution remains constant due to the large volume of external seawater the water cement ratio of concrete is 0 4 and the aggregate volume fraction is 0 5 see table 2 and table 3 fig 2 graphically shows the concrete models with the aggregate volume fraction of 0 5 the shape of the aggregates is mixed with circle elliptical triangular and rectangular note that the shape of aggregates are not perfectly regular circles and polygons but the aggregate shape has been certified to be the secondary variables of the influencing factors of ionic diffusivity among the studies of microscopic scale one major parameter used in describing the pores is tortuosity and the mixed aggregates can be effective to investigates the influence of tortuosity of concrete liu et al 2014a liu et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2012 the aggregates with the radius ranging from 1 5 mm to 10 mm in the model are defined as impermeable and they are randomly generated in the geometry the blue annual layers wrapping the aggregates are itz layers whose thicknesses are set as 40 μm because the real thickness of itz layers are 20 50 μm diamond and huang 2001 du et al 2015b in addition the remaining grey region in the concrete specimen represents the homogeneous cement paste existing studies showed that the ratio of diffusion coefficient of ions between itz phases and cement paste phases is about 2 15 depending on the pore structure of concrete and this value is adopted as 3 in this study shane et al 2010 sicat 2014 fig 3 shows the corresponding finite element mesh of the model and there are more than 8 million degrees of freedom the aggregates are not meshed in the model because it is assumed as impermeable which means ions can only transport in the cement paste phases and itz layers it is assumed to be continuous at the interface between the cement paste phases and itz layers the temperature ranges from 10 c to 20 c in the freezing processes and 20 c to 10 c in the thawing processes for both 12 h the transport time are 100 days 100d and the number of ftcs are 100 times 100n note that the temperature here is the inner temperature of concrete models the time varying porosity represents the freeze thaw induced damage of concrete as mentioned earlier chlorides could be bound at the surface of solid phases during the transport process which could be expressed by the two modified binding isotherms it is not clear whether the other three ions have the potential to be bound and what their binding isotherms are thus this study does not involve the binding effect of the other three ions 4 model benchmark some studies presented inverse methods to investigate the chloride binding isotherms nguyen et al baroghel bouny et al and wang et al all developed multi species transport models using freundlich isotherm the numerical inverse method identifies the suitable binding isotherm from the concentration profiles of the experiments baroghel bouny et al 2012 nguyen et al 2006 the binding isotherm describes the relationships between free and bound chlorides which is significantly influenced by the time varying porosity during ftcs this section aims at identifying the most suitable modified binding isotherm and verifying the reliability of the presented model of concrete against a recent third party experiment conducted by zhang et al 2017c one of the proposed models is adjusted to be consistent with the test settings of zhang et al s experiments for the benchmark use the adjusted parameters include size of specimens diameter range of aggregates w c ratio boundary conditions temperature variation and so on note that the maximum concentration needs to be normalized as value of 1 since the unit of concentration is different in the experimental and numerical studies in addition this study selects the least and most numbers of ftcs in zhang et al s experiment 20n and 100n as well as the transport time 100d the continuous lines represent the results from numerical models and the scatter lines receive the data from the experiments illustrated in fig 4 note that the work only compares the chloride distribution from the depth of 2 mm which is the same condition as in the experiments this is because the maximum chloride concentration in experiments always appears near the surface of concrete for the existence of convection three conditions are adopted to study the binding effect of the concrete first the binding effect is neglected thus the free chloride is the same as the total chloride the second one adopts modified linear isotherm in which α 0 07 the third one uses modified nonlinear binding isotherm in which α 0 42 and β 0 8 this study adopts langmuir isotherm in nonlinear isotherms since it has been certified to work better than freundlich isotherm when the chloride concentration is less than 500 mol m3 the maximum chloride concentration is 520 mol m3 in this study tang and nilsson 1993 under these conditions this work with different binding isotherms obtains the order of the concentrations of chloride at a given depth langmuir binding linear binding no binding which is shown in fig 4 the concentration distributions ignoring binding effect seem to be least suited to the results of experiments the concentration distributions which adopt modified linear isotherm overestimate the chloride concentration at low depth of the concrete and underestimate the chloride concentration at high depth the concentration distributions adopted modified langmuir isotherm provide the most reasonable fit to the experimental results therefore this study adopts the modified langmuir isotherm to calculate the concentration of chloride in the concrete when it is subjected to chloride penetration and freeze thaw action simultaneously 5 discussion 5 1 distribution of ionic transport the concentration distribution profiles of different ions at three different times are shown in fig 5 in which x and y coordinates show the position of ions in the 2 d model and the vertical coordinate shows the value of the ionic concentrations these 3 d plots not only provide a clear view on the evolution of ionic transport but also manifest the tortuosity effect and spatial distribution of chlorides the wave fronts become deeper with the increasing time besides the concentrations of sodium and chloride ions increase while the concentrations of potassium and hydroxyl ions reduce in the specimen with the increased time this phenomenon is because sodium and chloride ions are supplied at the boundary but potassium ions and hydroxyl ions are not the rate of the increase of sodium or chloride ions is lower than that of the decrease of potassium or hydroxyl ions the phenomenon is probably due to the lower diffusion coefficient of sodium and chloride ions than that of potassium and hydroxyl ions in addition the wave front of the chlorides is sharp but that of the other three ions show platforms due to the initial concentration of ions obviously free chloride distribution profiles obtained from the presented multi component model considering modified binding isotherms are totally different from previous single component i e only chlorides model considering simplified isotherms jiang et al 2018 this circumstance evidently demonstrates the influence of binding effect and multi species coupling on chloride transport 5 2 freeze thaw effect on ionic transport the damage of concrete suffering from freeze thaw action is reflected by the evolution of pore structure in this study the pore solution in the concrete freezes into ice and this will generate expansion during ftcs the internal structure confines the ice expansion which leads to internal stress in the concrete for this reason the pore structure turns loose which is reflected by the increase of size and number of pores gong et al 2015 wang et al 2017c zhang et al 2017a thus the ionic diffusivity increases due to more channels and the chloride binding capacity decreases due to fewer solid phase the aggregate volume fraction is set as 0 5 and w c ratio is 0 4 5 2 1 binding capacity fig 6 shows the chloride binding capacities of concrete under different numbers of ftcs 0n 10n 50n and 100n in which the x coordinate represents the concentration of total chloride and the y coordinate represents the concentration of bound chloride the binding capacity under different number of ftcs shows irregular variation the binding capacity of concrete under 10n is the highest compared to that under 0n 50n and 100n and the binding capacity under 0n is greater than that under 50n and 100n the binding capacity firstly increases because the effect of increasing diffusivity on binding capacity is dominant at the beginning more chlorides transport into the concrete and the concentration of bound chlorides coupled with free chlorides correspondingly rises the effect of decreasing solid phase on binding capacity turns into dominant when the concrete is subjected to superabundant number of ftcs under these circumstances a transition point where increasing diffusivity and decreasing solid phase reaching equivalence effects on binding capacity must exist in this process unfortunately this transition point is hard to quantify hence this study only selects four representative numbers of ftcs to qualitatively reflect this tendency in addition the binding capacities become relatively smooth at the end of the curves this is because the volume of external solution is much greater than that of the specimen in such a case the concentrations of ionic species at the boundary are assumed as constant the concentration of free chloride decreases sharply near the boundary which causes this phenomenon and this will exist in the whole study 5 2 2 transport of chlorides fig 7 a shows that the concentration of bound chloride is relatively high at the left boundary of concrete and the downtrend is sharp this is because the concentration of free chloride decreases rapidly near the boundary the decrease of the contact time between chlorides and solid phase as the transport depth increases is also responsible for this phenomenon besides the change tendency of the concentration of bound chloride near the boundary accords with the tendency of the binding capacity the concentration of bound chloride is the highest which is under 10n fig 7 b shows that the wave fronts of free chlorides exhibit gradual increase with the increasing number of ftcs the results demonstrate that the permeability resistance of concrete decreases with the rising number of ftcs the penetration depth of free chlorides under 100n is almost 2 4 times of that without ftcs 1 9 times of that under 10n 1 6 times of that under 50n furthermore the penetration depth between 0n and 50n increases slow while the penetration depth between 50n and 100n increases obviously this is because the binding effect of the concrete under foregoing number of ftcs is greater than that of subsequent number of ftcs the penetration depth of bound chlorides appropriately accords with that of free chlorides due to the intercoupling relationship and this phenomenon will exist in the whole study 5 2 3 transport of other species fig 8 provides a good overall view on the evolution of transport of the other three ionic species in the specimen under four different number of ftcs it clearly shows that the wave front of these three ions are obviously accelerated by the increasing numbers of ftcs the difference of penetration depths of these three ions under 0n and 10n are not very obvious while the difference under 100n shows a great gap this means the difference of penetration depths of these three different ions becomes much greater when more ftcs applied besides positive and negative charged ions share different travel speeds hydroxyl ions transport fastest among these three ions which can be reflected by the transport depths and sodium ions transport slowest this phenomenon agrees with the result of liu et al 2015a 5 3 parametric analysis during ftcs in order to examine the influence of a series of significant factors for example w c ratio hydroxyl concentration temperature variation and external chloride concentration on chloride binding capacity and diffusivity under ftcs a systemic parameters analysis is carried out based on the proposed numerical model 5 3 1 w c ratio w c ratio regarded as a micro scale parameter is related to the pore structure of the concrete which is similar to the effect of freeze thaw action the higher the w c ratio the greater the ionic diffusivity and the fewer the solid phase this section chooses four different w c ratios 0 3 0 35 0 4 and 0 45 to investigate the influence of w c ratio on chloride binding capacity and diffusivity fig 9 shows the chloride binding capacities with different w c ratios under both 100n and 100d the total tendency of binding capacity declines as w c ratio increases this phenomenon indicates that the increasing w c ratios play a dominate role on fewer solid phase rather than greater ionic diffusivity which reduces binding capacity tang et al and cheewaket et al both regarded that binding capacity of concrete is not related with the w c ratio cheewaket et al 2010 tang and nilsson 1993 the chloride concentration is expressed by unit weight of solid phase in their findings chloride binding capacity strongly depends on the content of solid phase the deterioration of concrete matrix is a process of cumulative damage during freeze thaw cycles the cement paste of the concrete will reduced and concrete will generate surface scaling then the mass of solid phase decrease especially under 100n chi et al 2014 however the chloride concentration in this study is expressed by the volume of pore solution if we also express the concentration of bound chloride by unit weight of solid phase the decreased content induced by ftcs can increase the value of the concentration of bound chloride under this condition the chloride binding isotherms will show smaller change with different w c ratios the movement front of bound chlorides in the concrete of different w c ratios are plotted in fig 10 a the higher the w c ratio the smaller the concentration of bound chloride near the boundary the fewer solid phase is certainly one reason for this phenomenon another reason is that the pore structure of concrete of high w c ratio is easy to be destroyed during ftcs therefore free chlorides penetrate into the concrete quickly which gives chlorides less time to be bound at the surface for this reason the concentration of free chloride near the boundary decreases sharply when the w c of concrete is small the specimens of higher w c ratio show higher concentration and penetration depth of free chlorides in fig 10 b the penetration depth of free chlorides in the specimen with the w c of 0 45 is approximately as 3 4 times of that with the w c of 0 3 which quite agrees with the existing analytical study chen et al 2013 this phenomenon illustrates that it is an effective way to decrease the w c ratio for reducing penetrating chlorides during ftcs 5 3 2 hydroxyl concentration the concentration of hydroxyl ions may influence the chloride binding capacity and diffusivity in two ways firstly bound chlorides are governed by the exchange of hydroxyl ions in the hydrated solid to guarantee the local electroneutrality according to the double layer theory secondly transport of hydroxyl ions in pore solution has an influence on local electrical potential which affects the transport of free chlorides it is assumed that the specimens have an initial hydroxyl concentration in pore solution depending on the cement type and content they are set as 300 mol m3 150 mol m3 and 100 mol m3 respectively xia and li 2013 the concentration of hydroxyl ions plays a great role in modifying the binding isotherm fig 11 shows that the higher the hydroxyl concentration the smaller the binding capacity under both 100n and 100d the binding capacity of concrete with hydroxyl concentration of 100 mol m3 is about 1 2 times of that with hydroxyl concentration of 150 mol m3 and about 1 4 times of that with hydroxyl concentration of 100 mol m3 the results show that the hydroxyl concentration in the inner environment indeed have an obvious influence on chloride binding capacity the general tendency is the higher the hydroxyl concentration the fewer the amount of bound chloride ions in fig 12 a this result agrees with the results of tritthart et al tritthart 1989 furthermore the maximum concentration of bound chloride with the hydroxyl concentration of 100 mol m3 at the boundary is about 1 3 times of that with 150 mol m3 and 2 2 times of that with 300 mol m3 fig 12 b shows that the concentration profiles are actually very close in three different cases so are the penetration depths of free chlorides this means the concentration of hydroxyl concentration has little influence on the concentration of free chlorides on the one hand a higher concentration of hydroxyl ions hinders the binding of free chlorides and thus more free chlorides are possible to exist in the pore solution which can transport into the deeper place in the concrete nielsen et al 2005 on the other hand the diffusivity of chlorides would be restricted by hydroxyl ions because of the same charge in pore solution where the movement of chlorides is influenced by the local electrostatic field the above two mentioned mechanisms offset each other thus chloride penetration rate in the environment is not dependent on the concentration of hydroxyl ions 5 3 3 temperature the chloride transport and binding effect are both thermodynamic processes and their rates are significantly influenced by temperature variation during ftcs the arrhenius equation can characterize the effect of temperature variation on binding capacity and diffusivity under ftcs mccarter et al 2015 aggregate volume fraction is set as 0 5 and w c ratio is set as 0 4 three different inner temperatures in the analysis are 10 c 30 c 10 c 10 c 20 c 10 c and 20 c 10 c 20 c fig 13 shows the chloride binding capacities of different temperature variations under both 100n and 100d it is noticed that the curves with low temperature are obviously below the curves with high temperature this means the binding capacity increases as temperature increases which is attributed to the occurrence of faster reaction rates and greater chloride diffusivity at high temperature this tendency is consistent with the experimental findings of feng et al 2018 the chloride binding capacity of concrete under temperature of 20 c 10 c 20 c is about 1 2 times as that under temperature of 10 c 20 c 10 c and 1 7 times as that under temperature of 10 c 30 c 10 c obviously the relationship between the concentration of total and bound chlorides has a more linear tendency at the lower temperature which means the binding isotherm has a more linear tendency at the lower temperature thus binding capacity needs to be established as a function of temperature to estimate the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete under ftcs fig 14 a shows that the concentration of bound chloride increases as temperature increases an elevated temperature increases the thermal vibration of chlorides resulting in greater binding capacity the maximum concentration of bound chloride under temperature of 20 c 10 c 20 c is approximately 2 times of that under temperature of 10 c 30 c 10 c and 1 2 times of that under temperature of 10 c 20 c 10 c fig 14 b reflects that higher temperature causes greater diffusivity which increases the penetration depth of free chlorides the penetration depth of free chloride under temperature of 20 c 10 c 20 c is almost 1 6 times deeper than that under temperature of 10 c 30 c 10 c and 1 4 times deeper than that under temperature of 10 c 20 c 10 c in general the curve of free chloride concentration under high temperature is above that under low temperature but the gaps between curves are not obvious this is because the elevated temperature increases not only the chloride diffusivity but also the binding capacity which partly offsets each other the elevated temperature even leads to small concentration of free chloride near the boundary 5 3 4 external chloride concentration the concrete structures are constructed in different circumstances in ocean engineering such as piers in the sea water and off shore platforms more chlorides exist in the pore solution and the rebars in concrete show high potential to corrode when the concrete structures are attacked by high concentration of external chloride solution which reduces the service life of concrete structures bertolini and redaelli 2009 hence it is important to investigate the influence of external chloride concentration on the binding capacity and diffusivity in this model three different external concentrations of chloride 350 520 and 690 mol m3 are set at the left boundary of models which are approximately corresponding to 2 3 and 4 nacl solution respectively the w c ratio is 0 4 and the hydroxyl concentration is 300 mol m3 in this section the chloride binding capacities of concrete suffered different concentrations of external chloride under both 100n and 100d are illustrated in fig 15 with the increase of external chloride concentrations the binding capacity tends to decline this trend agrees with the equation of the binding isotherm langmuir isotherm this conclusion is also certified by ye et al 2016a 2016b it indicates that chloride binding capacity tends to be lower in the skin layer of concrete than that in the deep depth because of the high chloride concentration near the boundary which is more obvious than the influence of more cement pastes near the boundary though more chloride ions have the chance to be bound due to higher chloride concentration in the pore solution the binding capacity which is calculated through the ratio of concentration of bound chloride and the concentration of total chloride is still reduced besides concentration of bound chloride in the concrete has an upper limit and the binding capacity will decrease when the free chloride concentration becomes too high fig 16 a shows the average concentrations of bound chloride suffered different external concentrations of chloride in the concrete in which the x coordinate represents the transport time and the y coordinate represents the value of bound chloride concentration the average concentration of bound chloride in the concrete increases with the increasing external concentration according to the slope of the curves as higher concentration of external chloride applied the time effect on the increase of average concentration of bound chloride becomes more obvious the average concentration of bound chloride suffered external concentration of 690 mol m3 is about 1 1 times of that suffered external concentration of 520 mol m3 and 1 4 times of that suffered external concentration of 350 mol m3 furthermore the curves of average chloride concentrations show fluctuations there are two reasons for this phenomenon first the temperature in each freeze thaw cycle is changing which results in the variation of diffusion coefficient in each freeze thaw cycle second different ionic species sharing different diffusion coefficients generate charge imbalance and create a local electrostatic potential which influence the transport of ions in the model and this phenomenon will become more obvious when the concentration of chloride becomes greater the curves of free chloride concentration suffering different external chloride concentrations show the steady downward trend under 100n in fig 16 b the penetration depth has little difference under different external concentrations since the concentration of external chloride cannot influence the chloride diffusion coefficient in the transport process the unapparent difference of penetration depths ascribes to the different binding capacities the pore structure is expanded by ftcs and thus chlorides have more channels for transporting into the concrete which leads to higher concentrations of free chloride the same conclusion has been observed by li et al 2016 5 4 penetration depth updated by bayesian approach bayesian updating approach is an interpretation of the concept of probability in which probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation this method is introduced to update the results of the numerical models using the results of the experiments this method regards the results of the numerical models as a common priori model and the results of the experiments as a conditional model it combines the common regularity of numerical models with individual information of experiments to calculate more reasonable results sun et al 2014 these updated results bring insights to the prediction on the service life of existing structures suffering chloride attack and freeze thaw action simultaneously suppose that the possible values of a parameter are a set of discrete values θ i i 1 2 n with relative likelihoods p i p θ θ i θ represents the random variable which equals to the possible values of the parameter θ then the prior assumptions of the parameter θ can be modified through bayesian updating approach if we know the additional information let ε denotes the measured results of the experiment then the applying bayesian updating equation can be obtained 26 p θ θ i ε p θ θ i ε p θ θ i i 1 n p ε θ θ i p θ θ i where p θ θ i ε is the probability of the experimental results ε while θ θ i that is the conditional probability of obtaining a particular experimental result assuming that the parameter is θ i p θ θ i is the prior probability of θ θ i that is prior to the availability of the experimental information p θ θ i ε is the posterior probability of θ θ i that is the probability that has been updated by the experimental result ε this equation can be simplified to the following 27 f θ m l θ f θ where f θ is the prior distribution f θ is the posterior distribution m is the normalization constant and l θ is the probability of the experimental results 28 m l θ f θ d θ 1 if the prior distribution f θ and parameter θ obey normal distributions then the posterior distribution f θ and the function l θ are also normal distributions therefore we can obtain the following function assuming that f θ is the normal distribution n θ σ 29 f θ m l θ f θ m n θ x σ n n θ θ σ where n θ x σ n represents density function with mean x and standard deviation σ n then the mean θ and standard deviation σ of posterior distribution can be calculated as follows 30 θ 1 σ 2 1 σ 2 n σ 2 θ n σ 2 1 σ 2 n σ 2 x x σ 2 θ σ 2 n σ 2 σ 2 n 31 σ 1 1 σ 2 n σ 2 σ 2 σ 2 n σ 2 σ 2 n this chapter chooses the chloride penetration depth from numerical models as the prior distribution and chooses the chloride penetration depth form experiments of zhang et al s as the conditional distribution zhang et al 2017a these two results are updated in bayesian sense to estimate a more reasonable penetration depth in concrete structures subjected to chloride attack and freeze thaw action simultaneously a flowchart is shown to explain this process in fig 17 the mean of w c ratio in numerical models is set as 0 2 which is the same as the w c ratio in experiments the standard deviation is set as 5 afterwards monte carlo simulation is adopted to generate 20 w c ratios using normal distribution each w c ratio is adopted to calculate the penetration depth under 20n and 100n thus 40 results of numerical models will show in this section other boundary and initial conditions of numerical models are also modified to be consistent with the test settings of the experiment the standard deviation of penetration depths in the experiments is set as 5 based on the means and standard deviations obtained from the experiments using normal distributions we can update the results of numerical models and experiments using eqs 25 and 26 according to those results we obtain that the updated penetration depth under 20n is 16 39 mm and the updated penetration depth under 100n is 26 63 mm according to the bayesian updating of penetration depth we can get the figures of probability density in fig 18 6 conclusion this work presents a multi phase and multi component ionic transport model of concrete under freeze thaw action in ocean environments in which the modified binding isotherm considers the time varying porosity based on a systematical study of a series of influencing factors the following conclusions is drawn 1 the influence of freeze thaw action on chloride binding capacity has two stage freeze thaw action first increases binding capacity by greater diffusivity and second decreases binding capacity by fewer solid phase besides freeze thaw action significantly increases the concentration and penetration depth of bound and free chlorides 2 the total tendency of binding capacity declines as the w c ratio increases while the binding capacity increases as temperature increases higher w c ratio and temperature can lead to higher concentration and penetration depth of free chlorides in the concrete besides the binding isotherm has a more linear tendency at a lower temperature 3 the higher the concentration of internal hydroxyl and external chloride ions the smaller the binding capacity however the concentration of hydroxyl ions has little influence on the concentration of free chlorides in addition the average concentration of bound chloride tends to increase and shows fluctuations in the transport process 4 bayesian updating approach updates the common regularity of numerical models with the individual information of experiments to calculate a more reasonable penetration depth the updated penetration depth under 20n is 16 39 mm and that under 100n is 26 63 mm this approach brings insights to the prediction of the service life of existing structures acknowledgements funding this work was funded by

22674,existing concrete structures in cool coastal areas are prone to be attacked by both chloride penetration and freeze thaw cycles ftcs this study establishes a multi phase and multi component ionic transport model for concrete serving in cold climate coast or ocean engineering aiming at further exploring chloride transport mechanism under freeze thaw cycles in a quantitative manner unlike the most of existing work herein the time varying porosity is described and involved in both the binding isotherm and diffusion coefficient to consider the pore evolution induced by ftcs by solving the modified mass conservation equations the time dependent relationship between the bound and free chlorides as well as the spatial temporal distributions of multi species is obtained by using this model and its reliability is validated against third party experimental data parametric analysis is carefully performed on a series of significant influencing factors i e water to cement ratios hydroxyl concentrations external chloride concentrations and internal temperature variations which affect chloride binding remarkably during freeze thaw actions bayesian sense is applied to combine the common regularity of numerical models and individual information of experimental by updating the penetration depth which can calculate a more reasonable penetration depth keywords durability degradation chloride binding capacity diffusivity freeze thaw cycles porosity 1 introduction chloride induced corrosion causes serious durability degradation of rc reinforce concrete structures when exposed to ocean environments jin et al 2015 mundra et al 2017 wang et al 2016 mao et al 2019 the concentration gradient of chlorides between the seawater and the internal pore solution of concrete structures leads to the chloride diffusion in concrete the passive film will become unstable once the ratio of cl oh in the concrete increases higher than 0 6 and that will lead to high potential of corrosion of the reinforcing steel bar al gadhib 2010 yang 2006 in addition pore solution within concrete freezes into ice during freezing thawing process and that will generate internal stress when the stress exceeds the strength of the concrete micro cracks may occur and provide interconnecting flow channels for penetrating more chlorides which can accelerate the transport process of chloride ions in cold regions šeps et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b hence the combination process of chloride penetration and freeze thaw action is fatal to offshore engineering such as bridges piers harbors wharves etc li and shao 2014 saito et al 1994 the acceleration of steel corrosion during ftcs leads to more serious loss of cross section of steel bars cracks of concrete cover and reduction of the bond strength between the reinforcement and the concrete this circumstance will seriously reduce the service life of coastal rc structures sakulich and bentz 2012 yu et al 2017b zhu et al 2016 some chlorides are bound at the hydration products of cement paste by chemical combination and physical adsorption during transport process ann and hong 2018 tang and nilsson 1993 yi et al 2018 the reduction of free chlorides directly reduces the diffusivity and meanwhile the generated friedel s salt can fill the pore structure of the matrix which further enhances the chloride resistance of the concrete for this reason chloride binding is a significant beneficial mechanism to the durability design of concrete structures castellote et al 1999 panesar and chidiac 2009 yuan et al 2009 although only free chlorides are supposed to be responsible for the initiation of the rebar corrosion bound chlorides are also deleterious during the process the concentrations of free and bound chlorides are at equilibrium in the pore solution some bound chlorides tend to release into pore solution when the concentration of free chlorides changes as a result of various physical and chemical mechanisms which is known as the chloride binding isotherm olsson et al 2018 ramírez ortíz et al 2018 during free thaw action this isotherm is amended by considering some other issues such as cycles of freeze thaw action temperature variation external chloride concentration hydroxyl concentration water cement ratio transport time and coupling of multi ionic species in this study to describe the mechanism of adsorption desorption of chlorides baroghel bouny et al 2012 bernal et al 2012 the chloride binding isotherm which is the key to the binding capacity and diffusivity on the way chloride front penetrates into concrete unfortunately common descriptions of chloride binding are always simplified as linear langmuir or freundlich isotherms for simple and practical application and that may misrepresent the binding capacity as well as chloride diffusivity particularly when the concrete suffers freeze thaw action ye et al 2016b pore solution will freeze into ice and generate internal stress in the concrete during ftcs which causes the pore structure to expand the time dependent porosity which is better for characterizing pore structures liu et al 2014 she et al 2017 wang et al 2017a hou et al 2018 is needed to represent the pore evolution in such a case the chloride binding cannot reach equilibrium anymore because of the cycling freeze thaw action on the one hand the chloride binding effect becomes more obvious in the concrete since freeze thaw action increase the porosity of concrete which provides more channels for chlorides penetrating the concrete therefore more free chlorides will appear in the concrete and thus the concentration of bound chlorides which is coupled with the concentration of free chlorides will also become greater in the concrete wang and ueda 2011 on the other hand expanded pore structure provides fewer sites for chlorides to be bound because of the reduced solid phase in cement phase which decreases the binding capacity tang and nilsson 1993 liu et al 2015a in this case the chloride binding needs to be carefully modified with the time varying porosity to analyze the influence of freeze thaw actions on the chloride binding capacity chloride binding in concrete is a thermodynamic process panesar and chidiac 2011 ukpata et al 2017 higher temperature enhances the thermal vibration of adsorbates resulting in less bound chlorides on the other hand higher temperature also causes more bound chlorides due to two reasons one is that the higher temperature increases the reaction rate between chloride ions and csh gel the other is that higher temperature also increases the chloride diffusivity which also gives rise to bound chlorides thus temperature effects are crucial for binding isotherm particularly when the concrete is subjected to free and thaw actions in which the temperature changes below and above the freezing point circularly and in a large range feng et al 2018 recent experimental and analytical results showed the influence of temperature variation on chloride diffusivity alhozaimy et al 2012 wang et al 2012 however very few researchers focused on the temperature effect on ionic binding especially when the concrete structures suffer chloride attack and freeze thaw action in marine coastal environments besides there are some other significant factors also increasing the complexity of binding process for example firstly higher external chloride concentration provides more ions penetrating into the concrete and thus more free chlorides tend to be bound at the surface of cement matrix hirao et al 2005 ye et al 2016a 2016b secondly the hydroxyl ions released due to the mechanism of anion exchange will increase the ph value of the pore solution since an increased ph of the chloride solution increases the solubility of friedel s salt the bound chlorides are obviously sensitive with the variation of hydroxide concentration wang et al 2009 thirdly like the effects caused by ftcs higher water to cement ratio also brings two opposite effects it will lead to more bound chloride since higher w c ratio is easier to create more transport channels when suffering freeze thaw actions meira et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 whereas it meanwhile lead to less bound chloride since higher w c ratio also provides fewer sites for chloride binding thomas et al 2012 in addition curing time increases the degree of maturity of c s h gel which is corresponding to a great surface thus the bound chlorides absorbed by csh needs quite a long time to reach equilibrium condition in the pore solution cheewaket et al 2010 medeiros junior et al 2015 she et al 2018a wang et al 2017b hou et al 2019 the coupling of different species in concrete also affects the binding process due to the generated electrostatic potential caused by charge imbalance between cl oh na k etc during multi species transport liu et al 2012 2015a 2015b according to above issues it is necessary to consider these influencing factors in binding isotherm and thus to obtain the binding capacity and diffusivity of chloride in a more quantitative manner the diagrammatic of which is shown in fig 1 in light of afore mentioned complexity of binding isotherm the numerical models are more suitable to isolate the influence of individual variable at pore scale for further understanding the influencing factors during ionic binding abyaneh et al 2014 2016 caggiano et al 2018 some researchers have devoted to modify the binding isotherm model to describe the relationship between free and bound chloride ions in different circumstances xi et al established a two phase material cement paste and aggregate model involving a set of variables e g initial and boundary chloride concentration ratio of pore solution to concrete ratio of c s h to concrete pore structure and curing time to modify the binding isotherm xi and bažant 1999 kim et al adopted a non linear chloride binding isotherm considering concrete mixture proportions binder components curing temperature environmental temperature and also external chloride concentration kim et al 2016 geng et al established a transport model with binding isotherm in which carbonation influenced the adsorption desorption of bound chlorides geng et al 2016 geng and mo 2014 ishida et al developed a ducom model for sound and cracked concrete in which the binding isotherm is modified by cement mineral composition and types of admixtures ishida et al 2009 tang developed a more engineer friendly model called clinconc model in which the binding isotherm was time dependent and had a good correlation with diffusion coefficient tang 2008 it should be mentioned that all above findings are obtained from freeze thaw free environments the evolution of pore structure induced by ftcs affects the binding capacity greatly in cold regions li et al combined the binding isotherm with fick s second law to investigate the influence of freeze thaw action on chloride transport this work considered the interactional effects between environmental exchanges i e influences of chloride binding temperature variation external chloride concentrations and pore size distributions to calculate the chloride diffusivity li et al 2016 jiang et al proposed a mesoscopic model considering binding effect to obtain the chloride profiles which adopted the time dependent porosity during ftcs jiang et al 2018 unfortunately though the porosity and influencing factors influenced the chloride diffusivity the binding capacity was still constant the literature survey shows that only very few researches consider chloride binding capacity and diffusivity simultaneously when concrete structures suffers freeze thaw action it is also noticed that existing models only adopted the common binding isotherms for simplification or practical application neglecting several significant issues especially the frost induced pore evolution of concrete in the cold regions in this study the time varying porosity regarded as the best characterization of the pore structure is involved in both the binding isotherm and diffusion coefficient to consider the pore evolution to develop the ionic transport model besides the time dependent relationship between the bound and free chlorides as well as the spatial temporal distributions of any other ionic species is obtained by using this model and its reliability is validated against third party experimental data in addition parametric analysis is carefully performed on a series of significant influencing factors i e water to cement ratios hydroxyl concentrations external chloride concentrations and internal temperature variations which affect chloride binding remarkably during freeze thaw actions based on these obtained results bayesian sense is applied to combine the common regularity of numerical models and individual information of experimental by updating the penetration depth which can calculate a more reasonable penetration depth these updated results can bring insights to the prediction of the service life of existing concrete structures in ocean environments 2 modeling approach concrete is a kind of porous material that is highly heterogeneous at the micro scale the individual phases such as aggregate particles cement matrix and itzs interfacial transition zones are developed in the numerical models which investigates the effect of individual phase on chloride transport during ftcs du 2019 šavija et al 2014 she et al 2018b the time dependent porosity is a linkage which reflects how freeze thaw action affects the binding capacity and ionic diffusivity tang and gulikers 2007 zhang et al 2017a hence the modeling approach in this study is divided into three modules firstly freeze thaw action affects the pore structure representing by varying porosity in the model secondly time varying porosity affects the ionic diffusivity and it combines with the diffusion coefficient thirdly time varying porosity affects chloride binding capacity which is represented by the modified mass conservation beyond the three parts the adopted binding isotherm also considers other significant influencing factors such as hydroxyl concentration temperature variation transport time and so on 2 1 evolution of pore structure induced by ftcs the evolution of pore structure and the appearance of micro cracks are two most important phenomena during freeze thaw cycles porosity related to the degree of continuity of the pore system is regarded as the most significant parameter of pore structure affecting the transport properties of concrete the influence of micro cracks on chloride transport can be partly reflected by the increased porosity note that the damage evolution of pore structures induced by ftcs herein is defined until the first macro crack appears the influence of freeze thaw action on porosity of cement paste is determined by partial differential equation sun and chen 2011 1 d φ d n l φ where φ is the porosity of the cement paste n represents the number of ftcs and l is an empirical constant relating to the w c ratio eq 1 can be solved as follows 2 φ φ 0 exp l n where φ 0 is the initial porosity of cement paste before suffering freeze thaw action for portland cement the following equation sun et al 2002 are used to estimate φ 0 in eq 2 3 φ 0 w c 0 17 α w c 0 32 where w c represents the water cement ratio and α is the degree of hydration ranging from 0 to 1 regarding to the long term hydration values a complementary equation for solving the relationship between α and w c has been proposed bentz et al 1998 4 α 1 e x p 3 15 w c some empirical or theoretical equations have been developed to calculate the chloride diffusivity in cement paste this work adopts the generalized effective medium theory and develops the diffusion coefficient of cement paste d c p as follows du et al 2015a yu et al 2017a 5 d c p 2 φ 2 75 d 0 φ 1 75 3 φ m 1 φ 2 75 where d 0 represents the ionic diffusivity in pore solution in this equation the solid phase in cement paste is relatively impermeable compared with the pore solution and m is a constant which is set as 14 44 in this study du et al 2014 zheng and zhou 2008 2 2 influencing factors associated with ionic transport when the pore solution freezes it means a large portion of the pore structure will be clogged with ice and this will reduce permeability besides low temperature will also reduce ionic mobility and permeability this mesoscopic numerical model presented in this paper is based on the existing concrete buildings in mature concrete older than 28 days the arrhenius equation could be approximatively applied over a large temperature range 30 c 70 c despite the existence of a sudden change mccarter et al 2015 and the temperature ranges from 10 c to 20 c in the freezing processes and 20 c to 10 c in the thawing processes in this study therefore the relationship between temperature variation and diffusion coefficient is assumed to be described by arrhenius equation 6 d t d c o n e x p e a r 1 t 0 1 t where d t is the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete while d c o n is the coefficient at t 0 t 0 298 15 k e a is the activation energy meaning chloride transport needs enough energy to overcome the activation barrier which is 27 0 kj mol obtained from the immersion tests wang et al 2014 there are several ionic species existing in pore solution including chloride hydroxyl sodium potassium etc the concentration of hydroxyl is determined by the concentrations of sodium and potassium besides the diffusion coefficients of diverse ions are different which generates charge imbalance mathematically nernst planck equation expresses the flux of ions in a multi species solution as follows the chemical activity effect is neglected 7 j k d k c k z k d k f r t 0 c k ϕ where j k is the flux c k is the concentration d k is the diffusion coefficient z k is the charge number f 9 648 10 4 c mol 1 is the faraday constant r 8 314 j m o l 1 k 1 is the laplace differential operator and k stands for the k th ionic specie k 1 2 3 and 4 represent chloride hydroxyl sodium and potassium ϕ is the local electrical potential which maintains electroneutrality in the medium eq 8 is required for ionic species involved in the pore solution due to the mass conservation 8 c k t j k where t is the transport time substituting eqs 7 and 8 it yields 9 c k t d k 2 c k z k d k f r t 0 c k ϕ the following current conservation of all ionic species involved in concrete is obtained 10 i f k 1 n z k j k where i is the local current density substituting eq 7 into eq 10 it yields 11 ϕ i f k 1 n z k d k c k f r t 0 k 1 n z k 2 d k c k since the model in this study is 2 d the local current density in eq 11 needs to be expressed in x and y directions as i x and i y as the current density satisfy i 0 i x ψ x and i y ψ y can be obtained through 2 ψ 2 ψ 2 x 2 ψ 2 y the principle of electroneutrality of four ions is considered and the potential ψ at the boundary condition is defined as 0 2 3 mass conservation considering time varying porosity the ionic transport equations are originally used in electrolyte solution the effect of time varying porosity needs to be considered when it is applied in porous material the mass conservation equation is established in the cement paste rather than the electrolyte solution this work needs to define the flux as the mole number of ionic species transport through the unit area of the cement paste while the standard description of mass concentration is described as the mole number of the ionic species in the unit volume of the electrolyte to solve this contradiction eq 9 uses φ c k rather than c k to represent the concentration of the ionic species in the unit volume of the cement paste jiang et al 2018 hu et al 2018 12 φ 0 exp l n c k t 1 φ 0 exp l n s t φ 0 exp l n j k where s is the concentration of bound chloride substituting eqs 2 and 7 into eq 11 it yields 13 φ 0 exp l n c k t 1 φ 0 exp l n s t φ 0 exp l n d k 2 c k z k d k f r t c k ϕ the mass conservation of bound chloride can be described using the following equilibrium equation 14 s t k b s s e q where k b is the rate constant and s e q is the concentration of bound chloride when the equilibrium of concentration of free and bound chlorides has been reached note that the bound chlorides have the potential to release when s s e q otherwise free chlorides would be bound at hydrated cement geng et al 2016 2 4 modification of binding isotherm generally in order to describe the relationship between free and bound chlorides studies always adopt two kinds of binding isotherms at a given temperature liner isotherm and nonlinear isotherms the former isotherm has been certified to be oversimplified in several researches which may misestimate the concentration of bound chloride martı n pérez et al 2000 however it can be a good choice under long term transport process since a concentration gradient of hydroxyl exists in the pore solution sandberg 1999 the latter kind of isotherm includes langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm which are widely accepted langmuir isotherm assumed as monolayer physical adsorption works better for low chloride concentration in pore solution and freundlich isotherm works best for high concentration thomas et al 2012 during the chloride transport process the linear langmuir and freundlich binding isotherms are often described as follows li and shao 2014 15 s e q α c 1 16 s e q α c 1 1 β c 1 17 s e q α c 1 β where c 1 is the concentration of free chlorides in the pore solution note that though c 1 c 1 s is always regarded as the traditional binding capacity ababneh et al 2003 s c 1 s rather than c 1 c 1 s is more accurate to represent the binding effect since the ratio of concentration of bound chlorides and total chlorides can be more intuitive to reflect the increment of the bound chlorides therefore this work adopts the special binding capacity s c 1 s to better describe the relationships between bound chlorides and total chlorides the higher the value of s c 1 s the slower the transport process of chloride chang 2017 li and shao 2014 tang 2008 xi and bažant 1999 the concentrations of bound chloride at equilibrium need to be modified with several other influencing factors as follows langmuir isotherm is chosen here to represent nonlinear isotherm baroghel bouny et al 2012 tang and nilsson 1993 18 s e q f t k o h k b m k t b n c s h α c 1 c oh 19 s e q f t k o h k b m k t b n c s h α c 1 c oh β c 1 where n c s h is the content of c s h in mol m3 of material α and β are the isotherm parameters which depend on the mix composition of concrete c oh is the concentration of hydroxide ions in the pore solution the exchange between chloride and hydroxyl ions is described as the following reaction equation baroghel bouny et al 2012 yang et al 2017 20 c s h oh na cl c s h cl na oh the time dependent factor f t describes the effect of time on chloride binding 21 f t a t ln t c l 0 5 1 where a t is a constant varying from 0 1 to 0 6 and the value is determined as 0 36 in this study tang 2008 t c l is the contamination time and is determined by the transport depth t c l t is determined at the surface of the concrete and t c l 0 is determined at the depth where chlorides do not reach hence t c l c 1 c s t and eq 17 is modified as the following equation 22 f t a t ln c 1 c s t 0 5 1 where c s is the concentration of free chloride at the exposed concrete surface k o h is the factor reflecting the influence of initial alkalinity of the concrete 23 k o h e 0 59 1 0 043 o h where oh is the initial hydroxide concentration which excludes the transport of hydroxyl ions in the concrete k t b reflects the effect of temperature variation on chloride binding and it is also assumed to be described by arrhenius equation 24 k t b e e b r 1 t 1 t 0 where e b is also set as 27 kj mol k b m is used to investigate the effect of gel content and porosity of the concrete 25 k b m w g e l 1000 φ where w g e l 390 k g m 3 is the gel content the time varying porosity representing the frost induced evolution of pore structure can be determined by eq 2 the effect of porosity on ionic diffusivity is determined by eq 5 the two modified binding isotherms in eqs 15 and 16 calculate the concentration of bound chloride eq 13 calculates the concentration distribution of free chlorides and bound chlorides at any time in saturated concrete when given initial and boundary conditions note that the diffusion coefficient of each phase of concrete in eq 13 needs to be determined respectively 3 model foundation to obtain the chloride concentration distribution of concrete applied to freeze thaw action a 2 d and 3 phase numerical model is developed the specimen is in the size of 50 mm 50 mm four different ionic species chloride hydroxyl sodium and potassium exist in the pore solution of concrete in this study table 1 provides the ionic transport parameters of these species as well as the boundary and initial conditions of the models the concentration of chloride 520 mol m3 is approximately transformed from 3 nacl solution moreover the concentration of the solution remains constant due to the large volume of external seawater the water cement ratio of concrete is 0 4 and the aggregate volume fraction is 0 5 see table 2 and table 3 fig 2 graphically shows the concrete models with the aggregate volume fraction of 0 5 the shape of the aggregates is mixed with circle elliptical triangular and rectangular note that the shape of aggregates are not perfectly regular circles and polygons but the aggregate shape has been certified to be the secondary variables of the influencing factors of ionic diffusivity among the studies of microscopic scale one major parameter used in describing the pores is tortuosity and the mixed aggregates can be effective to investigates the influence of tortuosity of concrete liu et al 2014a liu et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2012 the aggregates with the radius ranging from 1 5 mm to 10 mm in the model are defined as impermeable and they are randomly generated in the geometry the blue annual layers wrapping the aggregates are itz layers whose thicknesses are set as 40 μm because the real thickness of itz layers are 20 50 μm diamond and huang 2001 du et al 2015b in addition the remaining grey region in the concrete specimen represents the homogeneous cement paste existing studies showed that the ratio of diffusion coefficient of ions between itz phases and cement paste phases is about 2 15 depending on the pore structure of concrete and this value is adopted as 3 in this study shane et al 2010 sicat 2014 fig 3 shows the corresponding finite element mesh of the model and there are more than 8 million degrees of freedom the aggregates are not meshed in the model because it is assumed as impermeable which means ions can only transport in the cement paste phases and itz layers it is assumed to be continuous at the interface between the cement paste phases and itz layers the temperature ranges from 10 c to 20 c in the freezing processes and 20 c to 10 c in the thawing processes for both 12 h the transport time are 100 days 100d and the number of ftcs are 100 times 100n note that the temperature here is the inner temperature of concrete models the time varying porosity represents the freeze thaw induced damage of concrete as mentioned earlier chlorides could be bound at the surface of solid phases during the transport process which could be expressed by the two modified binding isotherms it is not clear whether the other three ions have the potential to be bound and what their binding isotherms are thus this study does not involve the binding effect of the other three ions 4 model benchmark some studies presented inverse methods to investigate the chloride binding isotherms nguyen et al baroghel bouny et al and wang et al all developed multi species transport models using freundlich isotherm the numerical inverse method identifies the suitable binding isotherm from the concentration profiles of the experiments baroghel bouny et al 2012 nguyen et al 2006 the binding isotherm describes the relationships between free and bound chlorides which is significantly influenced by the time varying porosity during ftcs this section aims at identifying the most suitable modified binding isotherm and verifying the reliability of the presented model of concrete against a recent third party experiment conducted by zhang et al 2017c one of the proposed models is adjusted to be consistent with the test settings of zhang et al s experiments for the benchmark use the adjusted parameters include size of specimens diameter range of aggregates w c ratio boundary conditions temperature variation and so on note that the maximum concentration needs to be normalized as value of 1 since the unit of concentration is different in the experimental and numerical studies in addition this study selects the least and most numbers of ftcs in zhang et al s experiment 20n and 100n as well as the transport time 100d the continuous lines represent the results from numerical models and the scatter lines receive the data from the experiments illustrated in fig 4 note that the work only compares the chloride distribution from the depth of 2 mm which is the same condition as in the experiments this is because the maximum chloride concentration in experiments always appears near the surface of concrete for the existence of convection three conditions are adopted to study the binding effect of the concrete first the binding effect is neglected thus the free chloride is the same as the total chloride the second one adopts modified linear isotherm in which α 0 07 the third one uses modified nonlinear binding isotherm in which α 0 42 and β 0 8 this study adopts langmuir isotherm in nonlinear isotherms since it has been certified to work better than freundlich isotherm when the chloride concentration is less than 500 mol m3 the maximum chloride concentration is 520 mol m3 in this study tang and nilsson 1993 under these conditions this work with different binding isotherms obtains the order of the concentrations of chloride at a given depth langmuir binding linear binding no binding which is shown in fig 4 the concentration distributions ignoring binding effect seem to be least suited to the results of experiments the concentration distributions which adopt modified linear isotherm overestimate the chloride concentration at low depth of the concrete and underestimate the chloride concentration at high depth the concentration distributions adopted modified langmuir isotherm provide the most reasonable fit to the experimental results therefore this study adopts the modified langmuir isotherm to calculate the concentration of chloride in the concrete when it is subjected to chloride penetration and freeze thaw action simultaneously 5 discussion 5 1 distribution of ionic transport the concentration distribution profiles of different ions at three different times are shown in fig 5 in which x and y coordinates show the position of ions in the 2 d model and the vertical coordinate shows the value of the ionic concentrations these 3 d plots not only provide a clear view on the evolution of ionic transport but also manifest the tortuosity effect and spatial distribution of chlorides the wave fronts become deeper with the increasing time besides the concentrations of sodium and chloride ions increase while the concentrations of potassium and hydroxyl ions reduce in the specimen with the increased time this phenomenon is because sodium and chloride ions are supplied at the boundary but potassium ions and hydroxyl ions are not the rate of the increase of sodium or chloride ions is lower than that of the decrease of potassium or hydroxyl ions the phenomenon is probably due to the lower diffusion coefficient of sodium and chloride ions than that of potassium and hydroxyl ions in addition the wave front of the chlorides is sharp but that of the other three ions show platforms due to the initial concentration of ions obviously free chloride distribution profiles obtained from the presented multi component model considering modified binding isotherms are totally different from previous single component i e only chlorides model considering simplified isotherms jiang et al 2018 this circumstance evidently demonstrates the influence of binding effect and multi species coupling on chloride transport 5 2 freeze thaw effect on ionic transport the damage of concrete suffering from freeze thaw action is reflected by the evolution of pore structure in this study the pore solution in the concrete freezes into ice and this will generate expansion during ftcs the internal structure confines the ice expansion which leads to internal stress in the concrete for this reason the pore structure turns loose which is reflected by the increase of size and number of pores gong et al 2015 wang et al 2017c zhang et al 2017a thus the ionic diffusivity increases due to more channels and the chloride binding capacity decreases due to fewer solid phase the aggregate volume fraction is set as 0 5 and w c ratio is 0 4 5 2 1 binding capacity fig 6 shows the chloride binding capacities of concrete under different numbers of ftcs 0n 10n 50n and 100n in which the x coordinate represents the concentration of total chloride and the y coordinate represents the concentration of bound chloride the binding capacity under different number of ftcs shows irregular variation the binding capacity of concrete under 10n is the highest compared to that under 0n 50n and 100n and the binding capacity under 0n is greater than that under 50n and 100n the binding capacity firstly increases because the effect of increasing diffusivity on binding capacity is dominant at the beginning more chlorides transport into the concrete and the concentration of bound chlorides coupled with free chlorides correspondingly rises the effect of decreasing solid phase on binding capacity turns into dominant when the concrete is subjected to superabundant number of ftcs under these circumstances a transition point where increasing diffusivity and decreasing solid phase reaching equivalence effects on binding capacity must exist in this process unfortunately this transition point is hard to quantify hence this study only selects four representative numbers of ftcs to qualitatively reflect this tendency in addition the binding capacities become relatively smooth at the end of the curves this is because the volume of external solution is much greater than that of the specimen in such a case the concentrations of ionic species at the boundary are assumed as constant the concentration of free chloride decreases sharply near the boundary which causes this phenomenon and this will exist in the whole study 5 2 2 transport of chlorides fig 7 a shows that the concentration of bound chloride is relatively high at the left boundary of concrete and the downtrend is sharp this is because the concentration of free chloride decreases rapidly near the boundary the decrease of the contact time between chlorides and solid phase as the transport depth increases is also responsible for this phenomenon besides the change tendency of the concentration of bound chloride near the boundary accords with the tendency of the binding capacity the concentration of bound chloride is the highest which is under 10n fig 7 b shows that the wave fronts of free chlorides exhibit gradual increase with the increasing number of ftcs the results demonstrate that the permeability resistance of concrete decreases with the rising number of ftcs the penetration depth of free chlorides under 100n is almost 2 4 times of that without ftcs 1 9 times of that under 10n 1 6 times of that under 50n furthermore the penetration depth between 0n and 50n increases slow while the penetration depth between 50n and 100n increases obviously this is because the binding effect of the concrete under foregoing number of ftcs is greater than that of subsequent number of ftcs the penetration depth of bound chlorides appropriately accords with that of free chlorides due to the intercoupling relationship and this phenomenon will exist in the whole study 5 2 3 transport of other species fig 8 provides a good overall view on the evolution of transport of the other three ionic species in the specimen under four different number of ftcs it clearly shows that the wave front of these three ions are obviously accelerated by the increasing numbers of ftcs the difference of penetration depths of these three ions under 0n and 10n are not very obvious while the difference under 100n shows a great gap this means the difference of penetration depths of these three different ions becomes much greater when more ftcs applied besides positive and negative charged ions share different travel speeds hydroxyl ions transport fastest among these three ions which can be reflected by the transport depths and sodium ions transport slowest this phenomenon agrees with the result of liu et al 2015a 5 3 parametric analysis during ftcs in order to examine the influence of a series of significant factors for example w c ratio hydroxyl concentration temperature variation and external chloride concentration on chloride binding capacity and diffusivity under ftcs a systemic parameters analysis is carried out based on the proposed numerical model 5 3 1 w c ratio w c ratio regarded as a micro scale parameter is related to the pore structure of the concrete which is similar to the effect of freeze thaw action the higher the w c ratio the greater the ionic diffusivity and the fewer the solid phase this section chooses four different w c ratios 0 3 0 35 0 4 and 0 45 to investigate the influence of w c ratio on chloride binding capacity and diffusivity fig 9 shows the chloride binding capacities with different w c ratios under both 100n and 100d the total tendency of binding capacity declines as w c ratio increases this phenomenon indicates that the increasing w c ratios play a dominate role on fewer solid phase rather than greater ionic diffusivity which reduces binding capacity tang et al and cheewaket et al both regarded that binding capacity of concrete is not related with the w c ratio cheewaket et al 2010 tang and nilsson 1993 the chloride concentration is expressed by unit weight of solid phase in their findings chloride binding capacity strongly depends on the content of solid phase the deterioration of concrete matrix is a process of cumulative damage during freeze thaw cycles the cement paste of the concrete will reduced and concrete will generate surface scaling then the mass of solid phase decrease especially under 100n chi et al 2014 however the chloride concentration in this study is expressed by the volume of pore solution if we also express the concentration of bound chloride by unit weight of solid phase the decreased content induced by ftcs can increase the value of the concentration of bound chloride under this condition the chloride binding isotherms will show smaller change with different w c ratios the movement front of bound chlorides in the concrete of different w c ratios are plotted in fig 10 a the higher the w c ratio the smaller the concentration of bound chloride near the boundary the fewer solid phase is certainly one reason for this phenomenon another reason is that the pore structure of concrete of high w c ratio is easy to be destroyed during ftcs therefore free chlorides penetrate into the concrete quickly which gives chlorides less time to be bound at the surface for this reason the concentration of free chloride near the boundary decreases sharply when the w c of concrete is small the specimens of higher w c ratio show higher concentration and penetration depth of free chlorides in fig 10 b the penetration depth of free chlorides in the specimen with the w c of 0 45 is approximately as 3 4 times of that with the w c of 0 3 which quite agrees with the existing analytical study chen et al 2013 this phenomenon illustrates that it is an effective way to decrease the w c ratio for reducing penetrating chlorides during ftcs 5 3 2 hydroxyl concentration the concentration of hydroxyl ions may influence the chloride binding capacity and diffusivity in two ways firstly bound chlorides are governed by the exchange of hydroxyl ions in the hydrated solid to guarantee the local electroneutrality according to the double layer theory secondly transport of hydroxyl ions in pore solution has an influence on local electrical potential which affects the transport of free chlorides it is assumed that the specimens have an initial hydroxyl concentration in pore solution depending on the cement type and content they are set as 300 mol m3 150 mol m3 and 100 mol m3 respectively xia and li 2013 the concentration of hydroxyl ions plays a great role in modifying the binding isotherm fig 11 shows that the higher the hydroxyl concentration the smaller the binding capacity under both 100n and 100d the binding capacity of concrete with hydroxyl concentration of 100 mol m3 is about 1 2 times of that with hydroxyl concentration of 150 mol m3 and about 1 4 times of that with hydroxyl concentration of 100 mol m3 the results show that the hydroxyl concentration in the inner environment indeed have an obvious influence on chloride binding capacity the general tendency is the higher the hydroxyl concentration the fewer the amount of bound chloride ions in fig 12 a this result agrees with the results of tritthart et al tritthart 1989 furthermore the maximum concentration of bound chloride with the hydroxyl concentration of 100 mol m3 at the boundary is about 1 3 times of that with 150 mol m3 and 2 2 times of that with 300 mol m3 fig 12 b shows that the concentration profiles are actually very close in three different cases so are the penetration depths of free chlorides this means the concentration of hydroxyl concentration has little influence on the concentration of free chlorides on the one hand a higher concentration of hydroxyl ions hinders the binding of free chlorides and thus more free chlorides are possible to exist in the pore solution which can transport into the deeper place in the concrete nielsen et al 2005 on the other hand the diffusivity of chlorides would be restricted by hydroxyl ions because of the same charge in pore solution where the movement of chlorides is influenced by the local electrostatic field the above two mentioned mechanisms offset each other thus chloride penetration rate in the environment is not dependent on the concentration of hydroxyl ions 5 3 3 temperature the chloride transport and binding effect are both thermodynamic processes and their rates are significantly influenced by temperature variation during ftcs the arrhenius equation can characterize the effect of temperature variation on binding capacity and diffusivity under ftcs mccarter et al 2015 aggregate volume fraction is set as 0 5 and w c ratio is set as 0 4 three different inner temperatures in the analysis are 10 c 30 c 10 c 10 c 20 c 10 c and 20 c 10 c 20 c fig 13 shows the chloride binding capacities of different temperature variations under both 100n and 100d it is noticed that the curves with low temperature are obviously below the curves with high temperature this means the binding capacity increases as temperature increases which is attributed to the occurrence of faster reaction rates and greater chloride diffusivity at high temperature this tendency is consistent with the experimental findings of feng et al 2018 the chloride binding capacity of concrete under temperature of 20 c 10 c 20 c is about 1 2 times as that under temperature of 10 c 20 c 10 c and 1 7 times as that under temperature of 10 c 30 c 10 c obviously the relationship between the concentration of total and bound chlorides has a more linear tendency at the lower temperature which means the binding isotherm has a more linear tendency at the lower temperature thus binding capacity needs to be established as a function of temperature to estimate the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete under ftcs fig 14 a shows that the concentration of bound chloride increases as temperature increases an elevated temperature increases the thermal vibration of chlorides resulting in greater binding capacity the maximum concentration of bound chloride under temperature of 20 c 10 c 20 c is approximately 2 times of that under temperature of 10 c 30 c 10 c and 1 2 times of that under temperature of 10 c 20 c 10 c fig 14 b reflects that higher temperature causes greater diffusivity which increases the penetration depth of free chlorides the penetration depth of free chloride under temperature of 20 c 10 c 20 c is almost 1 6 times deeper than that under temperature of 10 c 30 c 10 c and 1 4 times deeper than that under temperature of 10 c 20 c 10 c in general the curve of free chloride concentration under high temperature is above that under low temperature but the gaps between curves are not obvious this is because the elevated temperature increases not only the chloride diffusivity but also the binding capacity which partly offsets each other the elevated temperature even leads to small concentration of free chloride near the boundary 5 3 4 external chloride concentration the concrete structures are constructed in different circumstances in ocean engineering such as piers in the sea water and off shore platforms more chlorides exist in the pore solution and the rebars in concrete show high potential to corrode when the concrete structures are attacked by high concentration of external chloride solution which reduces the service life of concrete structures bertolini and redaelli 2009 hence it is important to investigate the influence of external chloride concentration on the binding capacity and diffusivity in this model three different external concentrations of chloride 350 520 and 690 mol m3 are set at the left boundary of models which are approximately corresponding to 2 3 and 4 nacl solution respectively the w c ratio is 0 4 and the hydroxyl concentration is 300 mol m3 in this section the chloride binding capacities of concrete suffered different concentrations of external chloride under both 100n and 100d are illustrated in fig 15 with the increase of external chloride concentrations the binding capacity tends to decline this trend agrees with the equation of the binding isotherm langmuir isotherm this conclusion is also certified by ye et al 2016a 2016b it indicates that chloride binding capacity tends to be lower in the skin layer of concrete than that in the deep depth because of the high chloride concentration near the boundary which is more obvious than the influence of more cement pastes near the boundary though more chloride ions have the chance to be bound due to higher chloride concentration in the pore solution the binding capacity which is calculated through the ratio of concentration of bound chloride and the concentration of total chloride is still reduced besides concentration of bound chloride in the concrete has an upper limit and the binding capacity will decrease when the free chloride concentration becomes too high fig 16 a shows the average concentrations of bound chloride suffered different external concentrations of chloride in the concrete in which the x coordinate represents the transport time and the y coordinate represents the value of bound chloride concentration the average concentration of bound chloride in the concrete increases with the increasing external concentration according to the slope of the curves as higher concentration of external chloride applied the time effect on the increase of average concentration of bound chloride becomes more obvious the average concentration of bound chloride suffered external concentration of 690 mol m3 is about 1 1 times of that suffered external concentration of 520 mol m3 and 1 4 times of that suffered external concentration of 350 mol m3 furthermore the curves of average chloride concentrations show fluctuations there are two reasons for this phenomenon first the temperature in each freeze thaw cycle is changing which results in the variation of diffusion coefficient in each freeze thaw cycle second different ionic species sharing different diffusion coefficients generate charge imbalance and create a local electrostatic potential which influence the transport of ions in the model and this phenomenon will become more obvious when the concentration of chloride becomes greater the curves of free chloride concentration suffering different external chloride concentrations show the steady downward trend under 100n in fig 16 b the penetration depth has little difference under different external concentrations since the concentration of external chloride cannot influence the chloride diffusion coefficient in the transport process the unapparent difference of penetration depths ascribes to the different binding capacities the pore structure is expanded by ftcs and thus chlorides have more channels for transporting into the concrete which leads to higher concentrations of free chloride the same conclusion has been observed by li et al 2016 5 4 penetration depth updated by bayesian approach bayesian updating approach is an interpretation of the concept of probability in which probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation this method is introduced to update the results of the numerical models using the results of the experiments this method regards the results of the numerical models as a common priori model and the results of the experiments as a conditional model it combines the common regularity of numerical models with individual information of experiments to calculate more reasonable results sun et al 2014 these updated results bring insights to the prediction on the service life of existing structures suffering chloride attack and freeze thaw action simultaneously suppose that the possible values of a parameter are a set of discrete values θ i i 1 2 n with relative likelihoods p i p θ θ i θ represents the random variable which equals to the possible values of the parameter θ then the prior assumptions of the parameter θ can be modified through bayesian updating approach if we know the additional information let ε denotes the measured results of the experiment then the applying bayesian updating equation can be obtained 26 p θ θ i ε p θ θ i ε p θ θ i i 1 n p ε θ θ i p θ θ i where p θ θ i ε is the probability of the experimental results ε while θ θ i that is the conditional probability of obtaining a particular experimental result assuming that the parameter is θ i p θ θ i is the prior probability of θ θ i that is prior to the availability of the experimental information p θ θ i ε is the posterior probability of θ θ i that is the probability that has been updated by the experimental result ε this equation can be simplified to the following 27 f θ m l θ f θ where f θ is the prior distribution f θ is the posterior distribution m is the normalization constant and l θ is the probability of the experimental results 28 m l θ f θ d θ 1 if the prior distribution f θ and parameter θ obey normal distributions then the posterior distribution f θ and the function l θ are also normal distributions therefore we can obtain the following function assuming that f θ is the normal distribution n θ σ 29 f θ m l θ f θ m n θ x σ n n θ θ σ where n θ x σ n represents density function with mean x and standard deviation σ n then the mean θ and standard deviation σ of posterior distribution can be calculated as follows 30 θ 1 σ 2 1 σ 2 n σ 2 θ n σ 2 1 σ 2 n σ 2 x x σ 2 θ σ 2 n σ 2 σ 2 n 31 σ 1 1 σ 2 n σ 2 σ 2 σ 2 n σ 2 σ 2 n this chapter chooses the chloride penetration depth from numerical models as the prior distribution and chooses the chloride penetration depth form experiments of zhang et al s as the conditional distribution zhang et al 2017a these two results are updated in bayesian sense to estimate a more reasonable penetration depth in concrete structures subjected to chloride attack and freeze thaw action simultaneously a flowchart is shown to explain this process in fig 17 the mean of w c ratio in numerical models is set as 0 2 which is the same as the w c ratio in experiments the standard deviation is set as 5 afterwards monte carlo simulation is adopted to generate 20 w c ratios using normal distribution each w c ratio is adopted to calculate the penetration depth under 20n and 100n thus 40 results of numerical models will show in this section other boundary and initial conditions of numerical models are also modified to be consistent with the test settings of the experiment the standard deviation of penetration depths in the experiments is set as 5 based on the means and standard deviations obtained from the experiments using normal distributions we can update the results of numerical models and experiments using eqs 25 and 26 according to those results we obtain that the updated penetration depth under 20n is 16 39 mm and the updated penetration depth under 100n is 26 63 mm according to the bayesian updating of penetration depth we can get the figures of probability density in fig 18 6 conclusion this work presents a multi phase and multi component ionic transport model of concrete under freeze thaw action in ocean environments in which the modified binding isotherm considers the time varying porosity based on a systematical study of a series of influencing factors the following conclusions is drawn 1 the influence of freeze thaw action on chloride binding capacity has two stage freeze thaw action first increases binding capacity by greater diffusivity and second decreases binding capacity by fewer solid phase besides freeze thaw action significantly increases the concentration and penetration depth of bound and free chlorides 2 the total tendency of binding capacity declines as the w c ratio increases while the binding capacity increases as temperature increases higher w c ratio and temperature can lead to higher concentration and penetration depth of free chlorides in the concrete besides the binding isotherm has a more linear tendency at a lower temperature 3 the higher the concentration of internal hydroxyl and external chloride ions the smaller the binding capacity however the concentration of hydroxyl ions has little influence on the concentration of free chlorides in addition the average concentration of bound chloride tends to increase and shows fluctuations in the transport process 4 bayesian updating approach updates the common regularity of numerical models with the individual information of experiments to calculate a more reasonable penetration depth the updated penetration depth under 20n is 16 39 mm and that under 100n is 26 63 mm this approach brings insights to the prediction of the service life of existing structures acknowledgements funding this work was funded by
