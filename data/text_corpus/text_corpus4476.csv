22380,various methods have been proposed to assess the navigational collision risk of maritime transportation in open sea and restricted waterways however there is a gap in the literature concerning an effective method that studies the same risk in port approach manoeuvrings in this study we fill this gap with a method stemming from two proposals first we present three new parameters distance area and speed to improve the navigational collision risk models applied in port basins second we propose a novel methodology based on machine learning and fuzzy inference to assess the risk of collision in port approach to support our discussion we conduct ship handling simulation experiments with 20 expert pilots and compile a large dataset furthermore we test our methodology in a port approach manoeuvring scenario overall our simulation results show that the proposed method is adequate for weighing both the severity of the port approach manoeuvrings and the relative importance of the involved parameters keywords collision risk evaluation port approach manoeuvring navigation risk parameters maritime safety data analysis machine learning 1 introduction autonomous navigation and navigational collision avoidance systems lead the digital technology transformation in the maritime domain today in fact this rapid change towards digitalisation and automation has been triggered by the increase in maritime traffic consequently safe navigation has also emerged as an important issue in recent years many researchers have focused on navigational collision risk ncr to support ship management vessel traffic operators and officers these stakeholders are in need of safe navigation in waterways such as the open sea and restricted waterways narrow channels busy waters port waters and so on although there are three general views on risk analysis approaches goerlandt and montewka 2015 have extended them to eight classes for maritime transportation applications these are strong realist moderate realist moderate realist with uncertainty quantification scientific proceduralist precautionary constructivist moderate constructivist with uncertainty evaluation moderate constructivist and strong constructivist while the realist risk approaches consider the underlying true risk as an outcome of a technology the constructive risk approaches hold that risk as a mental construct of the experts other than these the proceduralist risk approaches consider different stakeholders such as scientists and risk affected laypersons these approaches have been determined by nine characteristics our ncr model focuses on underlying true risk with scientific models but does not consider uncertainty assessment stakeholder involvement and contextual attributes in addition our ncr model considers expert judgement minimally because of these characteristics our ncr model is a moderate realist approach of maritime transportation risk analysis furthermore the measurement tools used in our study consist of quantitative qualitative indicators rather than probabilistic indicators ncr assessment is one of the fundamental pillars of decision making in safe navigation in spite of the international maritime organization s imo standardisation efforts and the recommendations of the international regulations for preventing collision at sea colreg there are still various approaches for determining collision avoidance decision and collision risk debnath et al 2011 kijima and furukawa 2003 hilgert and baldauf 1997 however there is no consensus on defining the various aspects of ncr because of the complex nature of the maritime environment furthermore single approach may not be applicable for all types of waterways such as the open sea restricted waterways and port manoeuvring basins because of the close distances and the manoeuvrings during approach the port manoeuvring basins are considered different from restricted waterways w zhang et al 2015 have also pointed out the idiosyncrasies of different waterways in this study the definition of the port manoeuvring basin includes not only the navigation area in the port but also the manoeuvring area for berthing inside the port while former ncr studies have focused on the open sea or restricted waterways in the ncr assessment the objective of this study is to present a ncr assessment methodology for ships having encountered land shallowness buoys and other land obstacles until berthing in port manoeuvring basins in order to achieve this objective we have invited experienced pilots to conduct 140 approach manoeuvrings lasting approximately 110 h in total in a jms japan maritime science ship handling simulator the outcome of these simulations presents a unique dataset for the intended area of research we also employ this dataset in the current work in addition we propose three new parameters based on the simulation results for ncr assessment in port basins these three parameters have contributed to the evaluation of the safety of port manoeuvring basins in our study a subsample of the dataset has been classified labelled according to their risk degrees with the help of 20 experienced pilots we then use these labels as a training dataset in our classification analysis with machine learning furthermore in the learning process we employ the log data of the simulation results to increase the applicability of the proposed methodology our ncr assessment methodology has given quite notable results in line with the maritime standards and the regulations moreover the proposed ncr assessment methodology for port basins can enable stakeholders of the maritime industry to instantly evaluate the ncr of ships in the port approach manoeuvrings the paper is organised as follows in the next section we review the related literature on ncr in the third section we introduce the parameters for the ncr assessment in port basins the characteristics of the port manoeuvring scenarios and the data are presented in the forth section in the fifth section we detail the proposed ncr assessment methodology and its components we demonstrate the resulting model of a simulation of a port approaching scenario in the sixth section the results of our methodology along with the conclusions are given in the last two sections 2 related literature the study of goerlandt and montewka 2015 has shown that strong realist moderate realist and moderate constructivist risk approaches are more common in the maritime transportation risk analysis strong realist risk approaches hilgert and baldauf 1997 kijima and furukawa 2003 szlapczynski 2006 śmierzchalski 2005 have exclusively relied on the data collected from sensors for example hilgert and baldauf 1997 have presented four level risk based on closest point of approach cpa and range they have also proposed critical limits such as hydrodynamic safe passing distance safe passing distance safe range critical range and manoeuvring range to establish the boundary between risk levels kijima and furukawa 2003 have presented the watching and blocking area concept determined by ship manoeuvring capability arimura et al 1994 speed and ship length the model assumes collision risk in the case of an overlapping of the watching area of the own ship and the target ships and then initiates evasive action a few years later śmierzchalski 2005 proposed a hexagon shaped area of danger to determine the ncr six distances from the centre of the ship have been formulated to cover the ship domain corners time to closest point of approach tcpa distance at closest point of approach dcpa own speed relative speed ship length and ship breadth parameters have been employed in the model however employing tcpa and dcpa parameters has been considered inept by szlapczynski 2006 who has proposed the temporary approach factor which can be integrated with various ship domain model the temporary approach factor is the ratio of the distance between two encountering ships to the minimum acceptable distance the study of gang et al 2016 proposes a machine learning algorithm to estimate collision risk indexes the study builds a support vector machine model which accepts six navigation indicators as input and result of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation as output however the moderate realist approaches ahn et al 2012 kao et al 2007 w zhang et al 2016 have considered expert judgement as a source of evidence for example kao et al 2007 have proposed a fuzzy logic method to alleviate the vts system s overloading problem three fuzzy membership functions speed length of ship and sea state have been employed to determine the radius of a guarding ring the fuzzy guarding ring is based on the idea that the collisions risk of a vessel increases when the ship domains become closer ahn et al 2012 have proposed an interviewee independent method because the questionnaires can be quite subjective for incorporating the perceived risk level their method is based on a rule based collision risk table modified from the study of hara and hammer 1993 who have used the expertise of watching officers through a ship handling simulator ahn et al 2012 have observed that the rules obtained from hara and hammer 1993 are insufficient to represent the degree of collision risk therefore their study has employed the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system to increase the number of membership functions of dcpa and tcpa the work of ahn et al 2012 is a clear example of applying machine learning algorithm to a ncr problem which is lacking ncr labels different from the realist approaches the moderate constructive models chin and debnath 2009 inoue 2000 perera et al 2011 have presented ncr as cognitive knowledge of experts for instance inoue 2000 has discussed an environmental stress model based on linear regression the model is based on the time to collision ttc parameter to estimate the ship handling difficulty in restricted and congested waterways later chin and debnath 2009 have employed an ordered probit regression model using tcpa and dcpa variables to assess ncr in port waters perera et al 2011 have introduced a fuzzy rule based decision making system based on distance relative bearing of target vessel encounter angle and relative speed to improve the safety of ocean going vessels collision risk models that are based on probabilistic approaches stem from the studies of macduff 1974 and fujii et al 1974 these studies have assumed that the number of vessels over the considered waterway is randomly distributed the proposed models are tested for accident scenarios in different waterways such as the gulf of finland montewka et al 2010 the yangtze river d zhang et al 2013 and the strait of istanbul ulusçu et al 2009 however individual collision risk models can be applied in any given water area open sea restricted waters and so on in respect to the given vessel individual ncr models can assess the risk without the frequency data of any waterway at a higher level furthermore individual ncr models can feed the collision avoidance systems with a risk degree therefore in the rest of this study ncr refers to individual navigational collision risk the detailed literature review of individual ncr assessment studies and techniques they have employed has been provided by ozturk and cicek 2019 this study has showed that not only linear and fuzzy models but also machine learning algorithms are employed in ncr assessment studies these machine learning algorithms have also been employed in different maritime domain such as ship domain analysis zhu et al 2001 patern recognition of ship navigational data j s kim and jeong 2015 prediction of ship pitching sun and shen 2009 and ship classification keskin et al 2016 due to the complex structure of our problem we choose the best machine learning algorithms from the performance comparison results the assessment of ncr is a multi dimensional task and requires deciding upon many different parameters such as speed position orientation heading distance and hydro meteorological data yet obtaining and applying all these parameters in ncr assessment is an insurmountable undertaking therefore ncr assessments in the literature have been conducted based on a limited number of parameters furthermore several studies have introduced some navigation specific parameters such as variance of the compass degree bukhari et al 2013 vessel conflict ranking operator w zhang et al 2015 and safe passing distance hilgert and baldauf 1997 the reason behind this introduction may be due to colreg s lack of clear attention to the safety limits of the navigation domain furthermore the raw data obtained from the sensors may also be incompatible to reflect the ncr situational awareness alone he et al 2017 w zhang et al 2016 3 parameters the parameters introduced by the studies concerning the open sea or restricted waterways may not represent the maritime dimension of the port approach manoeuvring for example the risky distance level of 0 5 nm for the open sea may not be risky for the port approach manoeuvring similarly the slow speed level of 5 kts for restricted waterways may be fast for the port approach manoeuvring w zhang et al 2015 have emphasised these idiosyncrasies by excluding the harbour approaches from their ncr model dcpa tcpa and relative bearing are the most frequently used parameters in the ncr assessment studies for open or restricted waterways own speed distance ship domain length of ship wind speed and water depth present other parameters in the ncr assessment literature here we introduce four parameters speed distance area and wind to represent the maritime dimension of ports in accordance with the related standards and conventions iso central secretary 2016 del estado 1999 the speed parameter has been frequently employed in former ncr studies the same parameter has also been included in the calculation of two commonly used parameters tcpa and dcpa in iso standard iso central secretary 2016 and maritime works recommendations del estado 1999 there is a clear attention to ship speed limit in port basins channel navigation manoeuvring area approach piers and berthing approach iso central secretary 2016 has also introduced design berthing velocity as a function of the navigation conditions and the size of the vessels therefore the speed parameter has been determined as a parameter to assess the ncr in port basin in our study the speed parameter corresponds to the ship s own speed k n o t s and is obtained directly from the simulation log data another parameter which has also been widely used in ncr studies is the distance parameter however the distance limits of other maritime areas may be incompatible for port approach manoeuvrings tam and bucknall 2010 wen et al 2016 xu et al 2010 only the distance parameter calibrated for port approach manoeuvrings can make the intended model suitable for ncr assessment otherwise the ncr model may underestimate close distances w zhang et al 2015 therefore for a more realistic inference result we introduce a novel distance parameter that is adjusted for port approach manoeuvrings consider a setting where we have k obstacles land points shallow waters buoys the distances between five points bow port starboard port quarter starboard quarter of the ship and all the obstacles are obtained in the range of 30 degree of sight of the speed vector if we denote the position of the point n of the ship at time t seconds by s n t and the position of the obstacle k with p k in terms of latitude and longitude then the minimum distance at time t is simply obtained by d min t min s n t p k k 1 k n 1 5 these minimum distances are then divided by the ship length l to obtain the distance parameter d t at time t d t d min t l the distance parameter is the minimum distance among the distances to all obstacles clearly if d 1 then the distance between the ship and the obstacle is less than the ship length in order to plot a safe navigation area ncr studies concerning the open sea or restricted waterways have employed the ship domain approach such as the watching and blocking area kijima and furukawa 2003 the hexagon shaped area śmierzchalski 2005 and the quaternion ship domain wang 2010 however these approaches may be invalid in the case of a limited area in port manoeuvring basins therefore we introduce an area parameter defining the degree of the safe manoeuvring area for port approach manoeuvrings one of the most important layout of ports is the turning circle see fig 1 ships can navigate manoeuvre in the turning circle safely without encountering any obstacles therefore the turning circle in port areas can be deemed a safe manoeuvring area according to the iso standard the turning circle dimension can be up to four times the ship length iso central secretary 2016 in addition the maritime works recommendations have defined the turning circle as five to six times the ship length for twin screw vessels del estado 1999 hence we employ the distance of five times the ship length as safe limit we choose 10 points to calculate the safety area around a ship see fig 2 furthermore a polygon has been formed based on the closest obstacles as shown in fig 2 this is similar to the concept of the safety area in fig 2 ρ θ shows the closest obstacle from the ship within the window of θ 2 π 10 degrees the area which is enclosed by the closest obstacles indicates the current clear manoeuvring area of the ship therefore the area parameter can be given as a t a c t a s where a s is the safe area a c t is the current clear manoeuvring area of the ship and a t is the area parameter at time t of the scenario an illustration of the area parameter is given in fig 3 the area parameter can be considered a representation of the clear area seen by the navigator in the case of navigation in port areas hydro meteorological forces have also rarely been employed in ncr assessment studies however hydro meteorological conditions influence the severity of the encounter kijima and furukawa 2003 pietrzykowski et al 2017 among all the relevant hydro meteorological forces wind is the leading one in sheltered ports for safe approach manoeuvrings the limit of the wind speed is recommended as 17 m sec or below del estado 1999 yet the real parameter affecting ship manoeuvring is not the wind speed but the wind force affecting the ship the wind force can be changed with the projected ship area therefore we also use the wind force affecting ship dynamics in port waters for our ncr assessments we have acquired the wind force formulations from iso standard iso central secretary 2016 f t w t c t w ρ a a l v w 2 t 10 4 f l w t c l w ρ a a l v w 2 t 10 4 and f w t f t w t f l w t here f t w t and f l w t are the transverse and the longitudinal wind forces in time t respectively the last equation gives the total wind force f w affecting the ship the parameter ρ a is the density of the air in k g m 3 the parameter a l is the longitudinal projected area of the vessel above the waterline and the parameter v w t is the design wind speed m s e c in time t finally the parameters c t w and c l w are the transverse and longitudinal wind force coefficients for the aft and the bow respectively the details about formulations and coefficients can be found in iso standard iso central secretary 2016 to obtain the wind parameter in time t the total wind force is divided by the limit wind force f w l this limit is obtained by the limit wind velocity v w 17 m sec affecting the ship directly from port starboard side then we have f w l t c t w ρ a a l 17 2 10 4 c l w ρ a a l 17 2 10 4 and w t f w t f w l t the wind parameter can be considered a degree of the wind force that affects ship manoeuvring we instantly calculate all these parameters from the simulation log data 4 simulation setup and dataset in this section we first present the characteristics of the conducted simulation scenarios then we introduce the dataset used in our experiments 4 1 scenarios we have conducted a total of 140 simulations of port approaching scenario in a jms japan maritime science ship handling simulator the jms ship handling simulator has all the navigation aids arpa radar ecdis rudder tugboat communication equipment gps alarm panels and so on that a real merchant ship has the details of the scenarios comprising the harbour and the manoeuvring type are presented in table 1 all scenarios have been conducted with tugboat assistance and twin screw vessels the number of scenarios by ship tonnage is given in fig 4 we have attempted to come up with diverse scenarios considering different types of harbours sheltered and unsheltered various approaching types berthing and unberthing varying loadings full and ballast and multiple ship lengths in our simulations we included 14 different port areas and 13 varying ship sizes scenarios of port approach manoeuvring were conducted by seven different pilots all pilots had experience of a minimum 10 years as pilot and 15 years as officer on watch 4 2 dataset the dataset of simulation results contain all the log of ship manoeuvring features these features are ship coordinates speed vectors m s n current direction current speed m s n water depth m e t e r length of the ship m e t e r heading wave direction wave height m e t e r wave cycle wind direction wind speed m s n and other features related to navigation operations such as anchorage and boarding we manipulate these fundamental navigation features to obtain ncr dataset described above the ncr dataset contains 395 457 records with no missing fields however there are some outliers in particular when it comes to the distance and wind parameters fig 5 shows the distributions of both parameters del estado 1999 points out two layout requirements for safe navigation within ports 1 bend radius should be at least five times the ship length 2 narrow sections should be sailed in well navigation pass with a distance of at least five times the ship length since we have already normalised the distance parameter with the ship length observations with a distance value above five are treated as outliers as for the wind parameter observations with a value above two are treated as outliers as they are wind gust sudden increase after removing the outliers the new boxplots of the parameters become as shown in fig 5 the correlation plots of the parameters in fig 6 shows that correlations between the parameters are low the highest correlation is between the distance and the area parameter the distributions of the parameters are heavy tailed except the distance parameter furthermore the wind parameter is similar to the weibull distribution as expected histogram plots in fig 7 show the frequency of the parameters the distribution of all parameters is skewed to the right the other most important inference from figs 6 and 7 is that there are no outliers within the dataset 5 methodology in the literature ncr assessment studies use various ways to collect data many statistical approaches however also require labels or output of each observation in the dataset several studies have carried out surveys to obtain these labels chin and debnath 2009 inoue 2000 lopez santander and lawry 2017 ahn et al 2012 have proposed an interview independent method but instead used a rule based collision risk table modified from hara and hammer 1993 all these studies have employed one or two parameters in order to estimate the ncr as we include several parameters we have consulted experts for assessing the output in our dataset to conduct this assessment we have used fuzzy logic fig 8 shows the three layers in our proposed methodology in the first layer we obtain the membership function of the parameters and construct the sample fuzzy inference rules the rules obtained in the first layer label a sample observation set then these rules are fed as input into the second layer observations without labels are labelled in the second layer with semi supervised support vector machines s3vm in the third layer the labels obtained in the second layer along with the raw data of the simulation results are used for training a random forest to obtain the ncr degree 5 1 expert assessments with fuzzy logic the cognitive mechanism of experts related to their assessments can be extracted based on a set of rules however the information given by these experts is generally ambiguous therefore we use fuzzy logic to evaluate the ncr assessments and obtain our training dataset there are also other studies in the literature employing fuzzy inference ahn et al 2012 jean francois balmat et al 2009 jean françois balmat et al 2011 bukhari et al 2013 fuzzy logic is based on a set of rules standing for the linguistic variables of human knowledge these linguistic input output variables are simply represented by the membership functions then the output variables can be extracted defuzzified with the help of several methods such as the centre of area or the centre of gravity to obtain the membership functions for our new parameters we use the fuzzy k means clustering method this method divides the dataset into subsets that belong to different clusters the core of the method is based on minimising the error function revealing the dissimilarity of each cluster enables the dataset to be represented by different linguistic variables the cluster quantity of each parameter is determined with the help of acceptable limits these acceptable limits refer to the related standards iso central secretary 2016 del estado 1999 and the nature of the maritime domain the resulting membership functions of the parameters are shown in fig 9 these functions are then associated with the linguistic variables to construct a fuzzy inference rule table an example set of fuzzy rules without a risk degree is given in table 2 each value in the last column shows the number of observations corresponding to the respective rule the fuzzy inference rule table of ncr can be constructed with expert knowledge bukhari et al 2013 w zhang et al 2017 however constructing all rules in this way can be insurmountable as there exists a total of 1 440 rule combinations therefore we have selected only 20 rules for the survey then 20 experienced maritime pilots are asked to fill out the survey all pilots have at least 10 years of experience and 12 of them have more than 20 years the details of the fuzzy inference rules and the survey results are presented in table 3 to defuzzify the output labels we have made us of the centre of gravity method 5 2 semi supervised support vector machines semi supervised learning algorithms are used when the data is not fully labelled as we have unlabelled dataset corresponding to the non survey rules described above a semi supervised learning algorithm fits to our particular problem to label more data points we used the data labelled after the survey as a training sample and applied a semi supervised support vector machines method support vector machine svm is a classification algorithm based on the vapnik chervonenkis statistical learning theory cortes and vapnik 1995 the algorithms were first introduced in 1992 boser et al 1992 the s3vm objective function places unlabelled data outside the margin consequently the decision boundary stays in a low density gap therefore s3vm determines the decision boundary without the real labels of the independent variables with the help of this approach we have managed to overcome the issue of considering all combinations to fill in the fuzzy rule table it is obvious that any machine learning algorithm can be applied in our setting as our focus is on the overall ncr assessment methodology rather than a particular machine learning algorithm however it is a good practice to compare different techniques and tune hyper parameters in data analysis therefore the accuracy plots of four different semi supervised classification algorithms and hyper parameter tuning results are presented in appendix a these results have showed us that s3vm is computationally the most expensive but a competent alternative for our ncr assessment problem the observations corresponding to the fuzzy inference rules are used as a training sample 1500 observations from each class using s3vm we have labelled 194 750 observations in total a comparison of the fuzzy inference table and the new rules obtained from s3vm are presented in table 4 these results are also examined and validated by domain experts which can be deemed as a domain expert base approach finlayson and compton 2014 the survey results indicate that when the speed distance wind and area parameters are moderate very far calm and free respectively then the risk score is v e r y l o w first comparison when the distance parameter becomes moderate and the other parameters are stable s3vm clustering results indicate that the risk score is m o d e r a t e similarly while the survey results indicate h i g h risk score in the case of moderate speed slightly close distance moderate wind and restricted area the s3vm indicates a m o d e r a t e risk score when the speed parameter becomes very slow furthermore the third comparison shows that the risk level is increased with increasing the distance and area parameters on the other hand after decreasing the wind parameter from very strong to calm the risk level decreases to l o w in the fifth comparison it is important to note that the aim of s3vm is not to obtain new rules but to increase the number of labelled observations the scatter plot in fig 10 shows the training dataset obtained by s3vm while the risk classes are well separated in the case of the speed distance plot the same observation cannot be made in the case of the wind parameter the risk classes are more separated in the area distance comparison than in the case of area speed case in general the risk classes are well separated when the distance parameter is involved this visualisation can provide an additional insight regarding the effects of the proposed parameters on ncr 5 3 training while tree based methods are simple and useful for interpretation they may not be competitive against the more sophisticated learning algorithms such as neural networks and support vector machines however the random forest method which aggregates many decision trees into one is one of the most robust tree based methods a random forest is a supervised learning method requiring dataset labels in our case the labels of the observations obtained by the semi supervised learning method of s3vm have been used since on the ships there exists no equipment that can feed the instantly information about the geographical position of obstacles one has to obtain all of them from another source such as an online geo information provider this can be computationally expensive hence the input parameters of the random forest contain current direction current speed depth length of ship heading speed vector x speed vector y wave direction wave height wind direction and wind speed all these parameters can be instantly obtained through the sensors in the ship one concern at this point may be the correlation among these parameters fig 11 does not indicate that these parameters are correlated we split the dataset into training 80 and test 20 subsets while the constructed random forest is trained with the training dataset the testing dataset is used to consider the performance of the proposed model we have applied five fold cross validation the random forest model is constructed in r programming language with zero classification out of sample error the model has performed extremely well to double check our results we have added synthetic noise to our data and run the random forest model again the classification accuracy of our model has indeed deteriorated with the noisy data see fig 12 this observation reassures the validity of our model since the deterioration is not significant this test also suggests that the proposed random forest model may be robust to data collection errors to further validate the impeccable success of the proposed random forest model we have also tried two other machine learning methods neural networks and gradient boosting after extensive parameter tuning the classification error rate for the resulting neural network model two layers 18 neurans was reduced to 1 likewise our most successful gradient boosting model 20 trees resulted in an error rate of 5 both methods have performed worse than the random forest model the parameter tuning results of the neural network and the gradient boosting models are presented in appendix a as mentioned above any machine learning algorithm can be applied in our problem besides its performance the random forest model gives us the opportunity to analyse partial plots of the navigational parameters fig 13 shows the parameter importance plot that we have obtained with our random forest model as expected one of the speed vectors x has the highest importance among all the variables we observe that the wind speed is the second most important variable 5 4 application we applied the proposed ncr assessment model to a port approach manoeuvring scenario created by the jms ship handling simulator the model was then evaluated according to the manoeuvring conditions within the port basin a depiction of the approach manoeuvring is given in fig 14 the figure includes the ncr classes in every second of the approach manoeuvring until the berthing the ship operated in the simulation is a 70 000 dwt bulk carrier with 225 m overall length and 11 5 m draft some of the indicators of the simulation are presented in fig 15 the time axis in fig 15 is an actual representation of the time stamp of the scenario the random forest model was employed in this application to predict ncr the purpose is to see whether the model appropriately distinguished the manoeuvring situations indicating different ncr levels a high risk level has rarely been observed at the beginning of the manoeuvre according to peak wind and ship speed as can be seen in fig 15 the wind direction started to change as the ship s heading changed t 1 and the lateral area projected on the ship decreased the change of the ship heading and the wind direction can be seen in fig 15 therefore the ncr degree is indicated as very low however the ncr degree increased as the changing of the ship heading continued t 2 in fact the reason behind this increase is the current force because the lateral area of the ship projected to the current direction is very high around that time the ship s course is around 110 as can be seen in the course time graphic in fig 15 one should note that current force can affect the force of the speed vector unproportionally regarding the current direction furthermore the ship is also closer to the berthing area in that position in the berthing situation t 4 risk level is low and moderate which indicates a proper and safe manoeuvring the speed of the ship is below 0 5 knot in the berthing situation as can be seen in the speed time plot the current and wind speed also have little effect on the ship as the ship s heading is about 200 in the berthing situation yet the proposed parameters have also been calculated in the simulation scenario to evaluate the consistency regarding the approach manoeuvring see fig 16 the wind parameter has some peak values along the simulation as the ship s lateral area has been exposed the differing wind speed as the ship get closer to the berthing area the decrease of the area parameter indicates the limitation of the manoeuvring space the distance parameter also has a tendency similar to the area parameter however the distance parameter informs us about the closest distance and not about the area for example the area parameter is about 0 5 and the distance parameter about 1 before the berthing situation t 3 this indicates that the navigator has an acceptable available space to manoeuvre reverse manoeuvre but there is a close obstacle in front of the ship in the berthing situation t 4 both distance and area parameters have decreased this is plausible as the navigable space in such a manoeuvre is usually confined these findings have substantiated the appropriate relationship between the ncr and the proposed parameters 6 results and discussion the proposed ncr methodology incorporates parameters concerning port approach manoeuvring and evaluates how these parameters relate to collision risk unlike other ncr approaches it deals with close distances with the help of the parameters relevant to the collision risk in port approach manoeuvring the severity of manoeuvring is categorised in respect to these parameters while all the details of the proposed methodology are addressed in section 5 there exist several issues requiring further discussion the first issue concerns to the proposed parameters the dcpa and the tcpa parameters employed by most ncr studies are not convenient for port approaches because of the close distances therefore three different parameters have been proposed to represent port basins in a more realistic way furthermore these four parameters have been clustered and defined by linguistic variables this has provided a more convenient way such as fuzzification of the tcpa and the dcpa to obtain expert s cognitive views about the ncr degree of ships in the survey conducted the results of the model show that the proposed distance area and wind parameters are appropriate for ncr assessment in port approach manoeuvrings furthermore it has been observed that the result of the clustering of the speed parameter is in parallel with the iso standard iso central secretary 2016 fuzzy clustering results demonstrate show that speed between 0 and 0 5 knot is very slow indicating proper berthing speed similarly the iso standard iso central secretary 2016 indicates design berthing velocity as maximum 0 5 knot for 50 000 dwt ships these parameters can give useful and practical perceptions about navigation safety as discussed in section on application although the methodology was based on the proposed parameters specialised for port approach manoeuvrings each model has given quite satisfying results with the log data parameters moreover employing the log data of the simulations instead of the proposed parameters can increase the applicability of the model so that it can be used for operational purposes in real life situations this may eventually contribute to navigational safety efforts in port basins the second issue regards the significance of the parameters affecting the ncr one of the speed vectors has the highest correlation with the ncr according to the random forest parameter importance result however it is important to note that the wind parameter also has a strong impact on the ncr under some circumstances different impacts of wind speed in determining each risk degree can be seen in partial plots see figs 17 and 18 this finding also supports previous studies kijima and furukawa 2003 pietrzykowski et al 2017 emphasising the significance of hydro meteorological data in fact the severity of encounter situations is directly affected by hydro meteorological forces in the eye of the officer of the watch the partial plots of the parameters corresponding to v e r y l o w and v e r y h i g h risk class probabilities are presented in figs 17 and 18 respectively for example in the case of determining the v e r y l o w risk class the partial effect of the speed vector x increases between 0 and 2 knot similarly partial effect of the depth increases as its level increases conversely the partial effect of the wind speed decreases after around 7 m sec level the partial effect of the ship length decreases after around 160 m ship length these results imply that while high speed and high depth values have more effect on determining the v e r y l o w risk class high wind speed and high ship length values have little effect as for the v e r y h i g h risk class while the partial effect of the speed vector x increases gradually after 0 knot the partial effect of the depth decreases until it reaches 60 m the partial effect of the wind speed increases after about 7 m sec level which is in parallel with the partial effect in the v e r y l o w class similarly the partial effect of the ship length increases after about 160 m which is also in parallel with the partial effect in the v e r y l o w class these results imply that while the high depth value has little effect on determining the v e r y h i g h risk class high wind speed high ship speed and high ship length values have greater effect the black lines at the bottom of each graphics are the distributions of the related parameters partial plots related to other risk classes are given in appendix b in contrast to the partial effect of speed vector x in the v e r y l o w and the v e r y h i g h risk classes the partial effect of speed vector x in the l o w and m o d e r a t e risk classes decrease after about 0 knots the partial effects of the depth decreases in the l o w m o d e r a t e and h i g h risk classes as its level increases it turns out that the partial effect of the depth values increases only in the v e r y l o w risk class as the depth increases however it has been revealed that the distance parameter has a high relation with the ncr as can be seen in fig 10 risk classes are well separated in the case of the distance parameter this reveals the importance of close distance in port manoeuvring areas as also stated by w zhang et al 2015 therefore our proposed methodology presents a practical way to incorporate close distances into the ncr assessment process as shipping traffic increases so does the number of the port approach manoeuvrings therefore the proposed model can also contribute to monitoring navigation safety in port basins furthermore navigators can determine preventive action in respect to the severity levels since this methodology can also reveal the significance of the parameters affecting the ncr this significance can be employed in prioritising the preventive actions that will be employed by navigators 7 conclusion we have presented a novel methodology to assess the navigational collision risk ncr in port approach manoeuvring we have conducted simulation experiments to obtain a dataset representing these manoeuvrings we believe this dataset presents a unique opportunity to analyse the ncr in port approaches in our model close distances limited manoeuvring area wind force and ship speed are all accounted for these parameters represent the collision risk in port approach manoeuvring for close distances most of the individual collision risk models in the literature have not considered such near manoeuvrings before we have also consulted 20 expert pilots to build a set of fuzzy inference rules the resulting dataset has been trained with different machine learning methods and random forest has shown a superior performance in a port approach scenario different severity levels of the port approach manoeuvring have been discussed considering the parameters and the navigation situation the results show that the proposed ncr assessment methodology gives accurate and reasonable risk degrees in accordance with the navigation environment one of the reason of the consistency of the proposed parameters with the ncr is that some of the characteristics of these parameters are based on the related maritime standards and recommendations the critical and safety limits of these maritime standards and recommendations have had a great contribution to our study as the maritime transportation is evolving within the world trade the port basins are becoming more congested unlike in open and restricted waterways ncr assessment methodology in port basins have to deal with the close distances this is exactly the issue that our study deals with in addition our methodology can also feed an autonomous navigation system and inspire the auto berthing systems cooperative collision avoidance in which vessels only communicate and cooperate with others when there are collision risks chen et al 2018 can be another area of application of our methodology our study may as well be considered in other studies where the main concern is the development of autonomous navigation in port waters furthermore our assessment of the importance of the wind speed parameter implies that the future ncr studies are likely to take this hydro meteorological effect into account however ship traffic current and wave force are also other important factors for navigation we plan to include these parameters in our upcoming work on port approach manoeuvring appendices a accuracy of different

22380,various methods have been proposed to assess the navigational collision risk of maritime transportation in open sea and restricted waterways however there is a gap in the literature concerning an effective method that studies the same risk in port approach manoeuvrings in this study we fill this gap with a method stemming from two proposals first we present three new parameters distance area and speed to improve the navigational collision risk models applied in port basins second we propose a novel methodology based on machine learning and fuzzy inference to assess the risk of collision in port approach to support our discussion we conduct ship handling simulation experiments with 20 expert pilots and compile a large dataset furthermore we test our methodology in a port approach manoeuvring scenario overall our simulation results show that the proposed method is adequate for weighing both the severity of the port approach manoeuvrings and the relative importance of the involved parameters keywords collision risk evaluation port approach manoeuvring navigation risk parameters maritime safety data analysis machine learning 1 introduction autonomous navigation and navigational collision avoidance systems lead the digital technology transformation in the maritime domain today in fact this rapid change towards digitalisation and automation has been triggered by the increase in maritime traffic consequently safe navigation has also emerged as an important issue in recent years many researchers have focused on navigational collision risk ncr to support ship management vessel traffic operators and officers these stakeholders are in need of safe navigation in waterways such as the open sea and restricted waterways narrow channels busy waters port waters and so on although there are three general views on risk analysis approaches goerlandt and montewka 2015 have extended them to eight classes for maritime transportation applications these are strong realist moderate realist moderate realist with uncertainty quantification scientific proceduralist precautionary constructivist moderate constructivist with uncertainty evaluation moderate constructivist and strong constructivist while the realist risk approaches consider the underlying true risk as an outcome of a technology the constructive risk approaches hold that risk as a mental construct of the experts other than these the proceduralist risk approaches consider different stakeholders such as scientists and risk affected laypersons these approaches have been determined by nine characteristics our ncr model focuses on underlying true risk with scientific models but does not consider uncertainty assessment stakeholder involvement and contextual attributes in addition our ncr model considers expert judgement minimally because of these characteristics our ncr model is a moderate realist approach of maritime transportation risk analysis furthermore the measurement tools used in our study consist of quantitative qualitative indicators rather than probabilistic indicators ncr assessment is one of the fundamental pillars of decision making in safe navigation in spite of the international maritime organization s imo standardisation efforts and the recommendations of the international regulations for preventing collision at sea colreg there are still various approaches for determining collision avoidance decision and collision risk debnath et al 2011 kijima and furukawa 2003 hilgert and baldauf 1997 however there is no consensus on defining the various aspects of ncr because of the complex nature of the maritime environment furthermore single approach may not be applicable for all types of waterways such as the open sea restricted waterways and port manoeuvring basins because of the close distances and the manoeuvrings during approach the port manoeuvring basins are considered different from restricted waterways w zhang et al 2015 have also pointed out the idiosyncrasies of different waterways in this study the definition of the port manoeuvring basin includes not only the navigation area in the port but also the manoeuvring area for berthing inside the port while former ncr studies have focused on the open sea or restricted waterways in the ncr assessment the objective of this study is to present a ncr assessment methodology for ships having encountered land shallowness buoys and other land obstacles until berthing in port manoeuvring basins in order to achieve this objective we have invited experienced pilots to conduct 140 approach manoeuvrings lasting approximately 110 h in total in a jms japan maritime science ship handling simulator the outcome of these simulations presents a unique dataset for the intended area of research we also employ this dataset in the current work in addition we propose three new parameters based on the simulation results for ncr assessment in port basins these three parameters have contributed to the evaluation of the safety of port manoeuvring basins in our study a subsample of the dataset has been classified labelled according to their risk degrees with the help of 20 experienced pilots we then use these labels as a training dataset in our classification analysis with machine learning furthermore in the learning process we employ the log data of the simulation results to increase the applicability of the proposed methodology our ncr assessment methodology has given quite notable results in line with the maritime standards and the regulations moreover the proposed ncr assessment methodology for port basins can enable stakeholders of the maritime industry to instantly evaluate the ncr of ships in the port approach manoeuvrings the paper is organised as follows in the next section we review the related literature on ncr in the third section we introduce the parameters for the ncr assessment in port basins the characteristics of the port manoeuvring scenarios and the data are presented in the forth section in the fifth section we detail the proposed ncr assessment methodology and its components we demonstrate the resulting model of a simulation of a port approaching scenario in the sixth section the results of our methodology along with the conclusions are given in the last two sections 2 related literature the study of goerlandt and montewka 2015 has shown that strong realist moderate realist and moderate constructivist risk approaches are more common in the maritime transportation risk analysis strong realist risk approaches hilgert and baldauf 1997 kijima and furukawa 2003 szlapczynski 2006 śmierzchalski 2005 have exclusively relied on the data collected from sensors for example hilgert and baldauf 1997 have presented four level risk based on closest point of approach cpa and range they have also proposed critical limits such as hydrodynamic safe passing distance safe passing distance safe range critical range and manoeuvring range to establish the boundary between risk levels kijima and furukawa 2003 have presented the watching and blocking area concept determined by ship manoeuvring capability arimura et al 1994 speed and ship length the model assumes collision risk in the case of an overlapping of the watching area of the own ship and the target ships and then initiates evasive action a few years later śmierzchalski 2005 proposed a hexagon shaped area of danger to determine the ncr six distances from the centre of the ship have been formulated to cover the ship domain corners time to closest point of approach tcpa distance at closest point of approach dcpa own speed relative speed ship length and ship breadth parameters have been employed in the model however employing tcpa and dcpa parameters has been considered inept by szlapczynski 2006 who has proposed the temporary approach factor which can be integrated with various ship domain model the temporary approach factor is the ratio of the distance between two encountering ships to the minimum acceptable distance the study of gang et al 2016 proposes a machine learning algorithm to estimate collision risk indexes the study builds a support vector machine model which accepts six navigation indicators as input and result of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation as output however the moderate realist approaches ahn et al 2012 kao et al 2007 w zhang et al 2016 have considered expert judgement as a source of evidence for example kao et al 2007 have proposed a fuzzy logic method to alleviate the vts system s overloading problem three fuzzy membership functions speed length of ship and sea state have been employed to determine the radius of a guarding ring the fuzzy guarding ring is based on the idea that the collisions risk of a vessel increases when the ship domains become closer ahn et al 2012 have proposed an interviewee independent method because the questionnaires can be quite subjective for incorporating the perceived risk level their method is based on a rule based collision risk table modified from the study of hara and hammer 1993 who have used the expertise of watching officers through a ship handling simulator ahn et al 2012 have observed that the rules obtained from hara and hammer 1993 are insufficient to represent the degree of collision risk therefore their study has employed the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system to increase the number of membership functions of dcpa and tcpa the work of ahn et al 2012 is a clear example of applying machine learning algorithm to a ncr problem which is lacking ncr labels different from the realist approaches the moderate constructive models chin and debnath 2009 inoue 2000 perera et al 2011 have presented ncr as cognitive knowledge of experts for instance inoue 2000 has discussed an environmental stress model based on linear regression the model is based on the time to collision ttc parameter to estimate the ship handling difficulty in restricted and congested waterways later chin and debnath 2009 have employed an ordered probit regression model using tcpa and dcpa variables to assess ncr in port waters perera et al 2011 have introduced a fuzzy rule based decision making system based on distance relative bearing of target vessel encounter angle and relative speed to improve the safety of ocean going vessels collision risk models that are based on probabilistic approaches stem from the studies of macduff 1974 and fujii et al 1974 these studies have assumed that the number of vessels over the considered waterway is randomly distributed the proposed models are tested for accident scenarios in different waterways such as the gulf of finland montewka et al 2010 the yangtze river d zhang et al 2013 and the strait of istanbul ulusçu et al 2009 however individual collision risk models can be applied in any given water area open sea restricted waters and so on in respect to the given vessel individual ncr models can assess the risk without the frequency data of any waterway at a higher level furthermore individual ncr models can feed the collision avoidance systems with a risk degree therefore in the rest of this study ncr refers to individual navigational collision risk the detailed literature review of individual ncr assessment studies and techniques they have employed has been provided by ozturk and cicek 2019 this study has showed that not only linear and fuzzy models but also machine learning algorithms are employed in ncr assessment studies these machine learning algorithms have also been employed in different maritime domain such as ship domain analysis zhu et al 2001 patern recognition of ship navigational data j s kim and jeong 2015 prediction of ship pitching sun and shen 2009 and ship classification keskin et al 2016 due to the complex structure of our problem we choose the best machine learning algorithms from the performance comparison results the assessment of ncr is a multi dimensional task and requires deciding upon many different parameters such as speed position orientation heading distance and hydro meteorological data yet obtaining and applying all these parameters in ncr assessment is an insurmountable undertaking therefore ncr assessments in the literature have been conducted based on a limited number of parameters furthermore several studies have introduced some navigation specific parameters such as variance of the compass degree bukhari et al 2013 vessel conflict ranking operator w zhang et al 2015 and safe passing distance hilgert and baldauf 1997 the reason behind this introduction may be due to colreg s lack of clear attention to the safety limits of the navigation domain furthermore the raw data obtained from the sensors may also be incompatible to reflect the ncr situational awareness alone he et al 2017 w zhang et al 2016 3 parameters the parameters introduced by the studies concerning the open sea or restricted waterways may not represent the maritime dimension of the port approach manoeuvring for example the risky distance level of 0 5 nm for the open sea may not be risky for the port approach manoeuvring similarly the slow speed level of 5 kts for restricted waterways may be fast for the port approach manoeuvring w zhang et al 2015 have emphasised these idiosyncrasies by excluding the harbour approaches from their ncr model dcpa tcpa and relative bearing are the most frequently used parameters in the ncr assessment studies for open or restricted waterways own speed distance ship domain length of ship wind speed and water depth present other parameters in the ncr assessment literature here we introduce four parameters speed distance area and wind to represent the maritime dimension of ports in accordance with the related standards and conventions iso central secretary 2016 del estado 1999 the speed parameter has been frequently employed in former ncr studies the same parameter has also been included in the calculation of two commonly used parameters tcpa and dcpa in iso standard iso central secretary 2016 and maritime works recommendations del estado 1999 there is a clear attention to ship speed limit in port basins channel navigation manoeuvring area approach piers and berthing approach iso central secretary 2016 has also introduced design berthing velocity as a function of the navigation conditions and the size of the vessels therefore the speed parameter has been determined as a parameter to assess the ncr in port basin in our study the speed parameter corresponds to the ship s own speed k n o t s and is obtained directly from the simulation log data another parameter which has also been widely used in ncr studies is the distance parameter however the distance limits of other maritime areas may be incompatible for port approach manoeuvrings tam and bucknall 2010 wen et al 2016 xu et al 2010 only the distance parameter calibrated for port approach manoeuvrings can make the intended model suitable for ncr assessment otherwise the ncr model may underestimate close distances w zhang et al 2015 therefore for a more realistic inference result we introduce a novel distance parameter that is adjusted for port approach manoeuvrings consider a setting where we have k obstacles land points shallow waters buoys the distances between five points bow port starboard port quarter starboard quarter of the ship and all the obstacles are obtained in the range of 30 degree of sight of the speed vector if we denote the position of the point n of the ship at time t seconds by s n t and the position of the obstacle k with p k in terms of latitude and longitude then the minimum distance at time t is simply obtained by d min t min s n t p k k 1 k n 1 5 these minimum distances are then divided by the ship length l to obtain the distance parameter d t at time t d t d min t l the distance parameter is the minimum distance among the distances to all obstacles clearly if d 1 then the distance between the ship and the obstacle is less than the ship length in order to plot a safe navigation area ncr studies concerning the open sea or restricted waterways have employed the ship domain approach such as the watching and blocking area kijima and furukawa 2003 the hexagon shaped area śmierzchalski 2005 and the quaternion ship domain wang 2010 however these approaches may be invalid in the case of a limited area in port manoeuvring basins therefore we introduce an area parameter defining the degree of the safe manoeuvring area for port approach manoeuvrings one of the most important layout of ports is the turning circle see fig 1 ships can navigate manoeuvre in the turning circle safely without encountering any obstacles therefore the turning circle in port areas can be deemed a safe manoeuvring area according to the iso standard the turning circle dimension can be up to four times the ship length iso central secretary 2016 in addition the maritime works recommendations have defined the turning circle as five to six times the ship length for twin screw vessels del estado 1999 hence we employ the distance of five times the ship length as safe limit we choose 10 points to calculate the safety area around a ship see fig 2 furthermore a polygon has been formed based on the closest obstacles as shown in fig 2 this is similar to the concept of the safety area in fig 2 ρ θ shows the closest obstacle from the ship within the window of θ 2 π 10 degrees the area which is enclosed by the closest obstacles indicates the current clear manoeuvring area of the ship therefore the area parameter can be given as a t a c t a s where a s is the safe area a c t is the current clear manoeuvring area of the ship and a t is the area parameter at time t of the scenario an illustration of the area parameter is given in fig 3 the area parameter can be considered a representation of the clear area seen by the navigator in the case of navigation in port areas hydro meteorological forces have also rarely been employed in ncr assessment studies however hydro meteorological conditions influence the severity of the encounter kijima and furukawa 2003 pietrzykowski et al 2017 among all the relevant hydro meteorological forces wind is the leading one in sheltered ports for safe approach manoeuvrings the limit of the wind speed is recommended as 17 m sec or below del estado 1999 yet the real parameter affecting ship manoeuvring is not the wind speed but the wind force affecting the ship the wind force can be changed with the projected ship area therefore we also use the wind force affecting ship dynamics in port waters for our ncr assessments we have acquired the wind force formulations from iso standard iso central secretary 2016 f t w t c t w ρ a a l v w 2 t 10 4 f l w t c l w ρ a a l v w 2 t 10 4 and f w t f t w t f l w t here f t w t and f l w t are the transverse and the longitudinal wind forces in time t respectively the last equation gives the total wind force f w affecting the ship the parameter ρ a is the density of the air in k g m 3 the parameter a l is the longitudinal projected area of the vessel above the waterline and the parameter v w t is the design wind speed m s e c in time t finally the parameters c t w and c l w are the transverse and longitudinal wind force coefficients for the aft and the bow respectively the details about formulations and coefficients can be found in iso standard iso central secretary 2016 to obtain the wind parameter in time t the total wind force is divided by the limit wind force f w l this limit is obtained by the limit wind velocity v w 17 m sec affecting the ship directly from port starboard side then we have f w l t c t w ρ a a l 17 2 10 4 c l w ρ a a l 17 2 10 4 and w t f w t f w l t the wind parameter can be considered a degree of the wind force that affects ship manoeuvring we instantly calculate all these parameters from the simulation log data 4 simulation setup and dataset in this section we first present the characteristics of the conducted simulation scenarios then we introduce the dataset used in our experiments 4 1 scenarios we have conducted a total of 140 simulations of port approaching scenario in a jms japan maritime science ship handling simulator the jms ship handling simulator has all the navigation aids arpa radar ecdis rudder tugboat communication equipment gps alarm panels and so on that a real merchant ship has the details of the scenarios comprising the harbour and the manoeuvring type are presented in table 1 all scenarios have been conducted with tugboat assistance and twin screw vessels the number of scenarios by ship tonnage is given in fig 4 we have attempted to come up with diverse scenarios considering different types of harbours sheltered and unsheltered various approaching types berthing and unberthing varying loadings full and ballast and multiple ship lengths in our simulations we included 14 different port areas and 13 varying ship sizes scenarios of port approach manoeuvring were conducted by seven different pilots all pilots had experience of a minimum 10 years as pilot and 15 years as officer on watch 4 2 dataset the dataset of simulation results contain all the log of ship manoeuvring features these features are ship coordinates speed vectors m s n current direction current speed m s n water depth m e t e r length of the ship m e t e r heading wave direction wave height m e t e r wave cycle wind direction wind speed m s n and other features related to navigation operations such as anchorage and boarding we manipulate these fundamental navigation features to obtain ncr dataset described above the ncr dataset contains 395 457 records with no missing fields however there are some outliers in particular when it comes to the distance and wind parameters fig 5 shows the distributions of both parameters del estado 1999 points out two layout requirements for safe navigation within ports 1 bend radius should be at least five times the ship length 2 narrow sections should be sailed in well navigation pass with a distance of at least five times the ship length since we have already normalised the distance parameter with the ship length observations with a distance value above five are treated as outliers as for the wind parameter observations with a value above two are treated as outliers as they are wind gust sudden increase after removing the outliers the new boxplots of the parameters become as shown in fig 5 the correlation plots of the parameters in fig 6 shows that correlations between the parameters are low the highest correlation is between the distance and the area parameter the distributions of the parameters are heavy tailed except the distance parameter furthermore the wind parameter is similar to the weibull distribution as expected histogram plots in fig 7 show the frequency of the parameters the distribution of all parameters is skewed to the right the other most important inference from figs 6 and 7 is that there are no outliers within the dataset 5 methodology in the literature ncr assessment studies use various ways to collect data many statistical approaches however also require labels or output of each observation in the dataset several studies have carried out surveys to obtain these labels chin and debnath 2009 inoue 2000 lopez santander and lawry 2017 ahn et al 2012 have proposed an interview independent method but instead used a rule based collision risk table modified from hara and hammer 1993 all these studies have employed one or two parameters in order to estimate the ncr as we include several parameters we have consulted experts for assessing the output in our dataset to conduct this assessment we have used fuzzy logic fig 8 shows the three layers in our proposed methodology in the first layer we obtain the membership function of the parameters and construct the sample fuzzy inference rules the rules obtained in the first layer label a sample observation set then these rules are fed as input into the second layer observations without labels are labelled in the second layer with semi supervised support vector machines s3vm in the third layer the labels obtained in the second layer along with the raw data of the simulation results are used for training a random forest to obtain the ncr degree 5 1 expert assessments with fuzzy logic the cognitive mechanism of experts related to their assessments can be extracted based on a set of rules however the information given by these experts is generally ambiguous therefore we use fuzzy logic to evaluate the ncr assessments and obtain our training dataset there are also other studies in the literature employing fuzzy inference ahn et al 2012 jean francois balmat et al 2009 jean françois balmat et al 2011 bukhari et al 2013 fuzzy logic is based on a set of rules standing for the linguistic variables of human knowledge these linguistic input output variables are simply represented by the membership functions then the output variables can be extracted defuzzified with the help of several methods such as the centre of area or the centre of gravity to obtain the membership functions for our new parameters we use the fuzzy k means clustering method this method divides the dataset into subsets that belong to different clusters the core of the method is based on minimising the error function revealing the dissimilarity of each cluster enables the dataset to be represented by different linguistic variables the cluster quantity of each parameter is determined with the help of acceptable limits these acceptable limits refer to the related standards iso central secretary 2016 del estado 1999 and the nature of the maritime domain the resulting membership functions of the parameters are shown in fig 9 these functions are then associated with the linguistic variables to construct a fuzzy inference rule table an example set of fuzzy rules without a risk degree is given in table 2 each value in the last column shows the number of observations corresponding to the respective rule the fuzzy inference rule table of ncr can be constructed with expert knowledge bukhari et al 2013 w zhang et al 2017 however constructing all rules in this way can be insurmountable as there exists a total of 1 440 rule combinations therefore we have selected only 20 rules for the survey then 20 experienced maritime pilots are asked to fill out the survey all pilots have at least 10 years of experience and 12 of them have more than 20 years the details of the fuzzy inference rules and the survey results are presented in table 3 to defuzzify the output labels we have made us of the centre of gravity method 5 2 semi supervised support vector machines semi supervised learning algorithms are used when the data is not fully labelled as we have unlabelled dataset corresponding to the non survey rules described above a semi supervised learning algorithm fits to our particular problem to label more data points we used the data labelled after the survey as a training sample and applied a semi supervised support vector machines method support vector machine svm is a classification algorithm based on the vapnik chervonenkis statistical learning theory cortes and vapnik 1995 the algorithms were first introduced in 1992 boser et al 1992 the s3vm objective function places unlabelled data outside the margin consequently the decision boundary stays in a low density gap therefore s3vm determines the decision boundary without the real labels of the independent variables with the help of this approach we have managed to overcome the issue of considering all combinations to fill in the fuzzy rule table it is obvious that any machine learning algorithm can be applied in our setting as our focus is on the overall ncr assessment methodology rather than a particular machine learning algorithm however it is a good practice to compare different techniques and tune hyper parameters in data analysis therefore the accuracy plots of four different semi supervised classification algorithms and hyper parameter tuning results are presented in appendix a these results have showed us that s3vm is computationally the most expensive but a competent alternative for our ncr assessment problem the observations corresponding to the fuzzy inference rules are used as a training sample 1500 observations from each class using s3vm we have labelled 194 750 observations in total a comparison of the fuzzy inference table and the new rules obtained from s3vm are presented in table 4 these results are also examined and validated by domain experts which can be deemed as a domain expert base approach finlayson and compton 2014 the survey results indicate that when the speed distance wind and area parameters are moderate very far calm and free respectively then the risk score is v e r y l o w first comparison when the distance parameter becomes moderate and the other parameters are stable s3vm clustering results indicate that the risk score is m o d e r a t e similarly while the survey results indicate h i g h risk score in the case of moderate speed slightly close distance moderate wind and restricted area the s3vm indicates a m o d e r a t e risk score when the speed parameter becomes very slow furthermore the third comparison shows that the risk level is increased with increasing the distance and area parameters on the other hand after decreasing the wind parameter from very strong to calm the risk level decreases to l o w in the fifth comparison it is important to note that the aim of s3vm is not to obtain new rules but to increase the number of labelled observations the scatter plot in fig 10 shows the training dataset obtained by s3vm while the risk classes are well separated in the case of the speed distance plot the same observation cannot be made in the case of the wind parameter the risk classes are more separated in the area distance comparison than in the case of area speed case in general the risk classes are well separated when the distance parameter is involved this visualisation can provide an additional insight regarding the effects of the proposed parameters on ncr 5 3 training while tree based methods are simple and useful for interpretation they may not be competitive against the more sophisticated learning algorithms such as neural networks and support vector machines however the random forest method which aggregates many decision trees into one is one of the most robust tree based methods a random forest is a supervised learning method requiring dataset labels in our case the labels of the observations obtained by the semi supervised learning method of s3vm have been used since on the ships there exists no equipment that can feed the instantly information about the geographical position of obstacles one has to obtain all of them from another source such as an online geo information provider this can be computationally expensive hence the input parameters of the random forest contain current direction current speed depth length of ship heading speed vector x speed vector y wave direction wave height wind direction and wind speed all these parameters can be instantly obtained through the sensors in the ship one concern at this point may be the correlation among these parameters fig 11 does not indicate that these parameters are correlated we split the dataset into training 80 and test 20 subsets while the constructed random forest is trained with the training dataset the testing dataset is used to consider the performance of the proposed model we have applied five fold cross validation the random forest model is constructed in r programming language with zero classification out of sample error the model has performed extremely well to double check our results we have added synthetic noise to our data and run the random forest model again the classification accuracy of our model has indeed deteriorated with the noisy data see fig 12 this observation reassures the validity of our model since the deterioration is not significant this test also suggests that the proposed random forest model may be robust to data collection errors to further validate the impeccable success of the proposed random forest model we have also tried two other machine learning methods neural networks and gradient boosting after extensive parameter tuning the classification error rate for the resulting neural network model two layers 18 neurans was reduced to 1 likewise our most successful gradient boosting model 20 trees resulted in an error rate of 5 both methods have performed worse than the random forest model the parameter tuning results of the neural network and the gradient boosting models are presented in appendix a as mentioned above any machine learning algorithm can be applied in our problem besides its performance the random forest model gives us the opportunity to analyse partial plots of the navigational parameters fig 13 shows the parameter importance plot that we have obtained with our random forest model as expected one of the speed vectors x has the highest importance among all the variables we observe that the wind speed is the second most important variable 5 4 application we applied the proposed ncr assessment model to a port approach manoeuvring scenario created by the jms ship handling simulator the model was then evaluated according to the manoeuvring conditions within the port basin a depiction of the approach manoeuvring is given in fig 14 the figure includes the ncr classes in every second of the approach manoeuvring until the berthing the ship operated in the simulation is a 70 000 dwt bulk carrier with 225 m overall length and 11 5 m draft some of the indicators of the simulation are presented in fig 15 the time axis in fig 15 is an actual representation of the time stamp of the scenario the random forest model was employed in this application to predict ncr the purpose is to see whether the model appropriately distinguished the manoeuvring situations indicating different ncr levels a high risk level has rarely been observed at the beginning of the manoeuvre according to peak wind and ship speed as can be seen in fig 15 the wind direction started to change as the ship s heading changed t 1 and the lateral area projected on the ship decreased the change of the ship heading and the wind direction can be seen in fig 15 therefore the ncr degree is indicated as very low however the ncr degree increased as the changing of the ship heading continued t 2 in fact the reason behind this increase is the current force because the lateral area of the ship projected to the current direction is very high around that time the ship s course is around 110 as can be seen in the course time graphic in fig 15 one should note that current force can affect the force of the speed vector unproportionally regarding the current direction furthermore the ship is also closer to the berthing area in that position in the berthing situation t 4 risk level is low and moderate which indicates a proper and safe manoeuvring the speed of the ship is below 0 5 knot in the berthing situation as can be seen in the speed time plot the current and wind speed also have little effect on the ship as the ship s heading is about 200 in the berthing situation yet the proposed parameters have also been calculated in the simulation scenario to evaluate the consistency regarding the approach manoeuvring see fig 16 the wind parameter has some peak values along the simulation as the ship s lateral area has been exposed the differing wind speed as the ship get closer to the berthing area the decrease of the area parameter indicates the limitation of the manoeuvring space the distance parameter also has a tendency similar to the area parameter however the distance parameter informs us about the closest distance and not about the area for example the area parameter is about 0 5 and the distance parameter about 1 before the berthing situation t 3 this indicates that the navigator has an acceptable available space to manoeuvre reverse manoeuvre but there is a close obstacle in front of the ship in the berthing situation t 4 both distance and area parameters have decreased this is plausible as the navigable space in such a manoeuvre is usually confined these findings have substantiated the appropriate relationship between the ncr and the proposed parameters 6 results and discussion the proposed ncr methodology incorporates parameters concerning port approach manoeuvring and evaluates how these parameters relate to collision risk unlike other ncr approaches it deals with close distances with the help of the parameters relevant to the collision risk in port approach manoeuvring the severity of manoeuvring is categorised in respect to these parameters while all the details of the proposed methodology are addressed in section 5 there exist several issues requiring further discussion the first issue concerns to the proposed parameters the dcpa and the tcpa parameters employed by most ncr studies are not convenient for port approaches because of the close distances therefore three different parameters have been proposed to represent port basins in a more realistic way furthermore these four parameters have been clustered and defined by linguistic variables this has provided a more convenient way such as fuzzification of the tcpa and the dcpa to obtain expert s cognitive views about the ncr degree of ships in the survey conducted the results of the model show that the proposed distance area and wind parameters are appropriate for ncr assessment in port approach manoeuvrings furthermore it has been observed that the result of the clustering of the speed parameter is in parallel with the iso standard iso central secretary 2016 fuzzy clustering results demonstrate show that speed between 0 and 0 5 knot is very slow indicating proper berthing speed similarly the iso standard iso central secretary 2016 indicates design berthing velocity as maximum 0 5 knot for 50 000 dwt ships these parameters can give useful and practical perceptions about navigation safety as discussed in section on application although the methodology was based on the proposed parameters specialised for port approach manoeuvrings each model has given quite satisfying results with the log data parameters moreover employing the log data of the simulations instead of the proposed parameters can increase the applicability of the model so that it can be used for operational purposes in real life situations this may eventually contribute to navigational safety efforts in port basins the second issue regards the significance of the parameters affecting the ncr one of the speed vectors has the highest correlation with the ncr according to the random forest parameter importance result however it is important to note that the wind parameter also has a strong impact on the ncr under some circumstances different impacts of wind speed in determining each risk degree can be seen in partial plots see figs 17 and 18 this finding also supports previous studies kijima and furukawa 2003 pietrzykowski et al 2017 emphasising the significance of hydro meteorological data in fact the severity of encounter situations is directly affected by hydro meteorological forces in the eye of the officer of the watch the partial plots of the parameters corresponding to v e r y l o w and v e r y h i g h risk class probabilities are presented in figs 17 and 18 respectively for example in the case of determining the v e r y l o w risk class the partial effect of the speed vector x increases between 0 and 2 knot similarly partial effect of the depth increases as its level increases conversely the partial effect of the wind speed decreases after around 7 m sec level the partial effect of the ship length decreases after around 160 m ship length these results imply that while high speed and high depth values have more effect on determining the v e r y l o w risk class high wind speed and high ship length values have little effect as for the v e r y h i g h risk class while the partial effect of the speed vector x increases gradually after 0 knot the partial effect of the depth decreases until it reaches 60 m the partial effect of the wind speed increases after about 7 m sec level which is in parallel with the partial effect in the v e r y l o w class similarly the partial effect of the ship length increases after about 160 m which is also in parallel with the partial effect in the v e r y l o w class these results imply that while the high depth value has little effect on determining the v e r y h i g h risk class high wind speed high ship speed and high ship length values have greater effect the black lines at the bottom of each graphics are the distributions of the related parameters partial plots related to other risk classes are given in appendix b in contrast to the partial effect of speed vector x in the v e r y l o w and the v e r y h i g h risk classes the partial effect of speed vector x in the l o w and m o d e r a t e risk classes decrease after about 0 knots the partial effects of the depth decreases in the l o w m o d e r a t e and h i g h risk classes as its level increases it turns out that the partial effect of the depth values increases only in the v e r y l o w risk class as the depth increases however it has been revealed that the distance parameter has a high relation with the ncr as can be seen in fig 10 risk classes are well separated in the case of the distance parameter this reveals the importance of close distance in port manoeuvring areas as also stated by w zhang et al 2015 therefore our proposed methodology presents a practical way to incorporate close distances into the ncr assessment process as shipping traffic increases so does the number of the port approach manoeuvrings therefore the proposed model can also contribute to monitoring navigation safety in port basins furthermore navigators can determine preventive action in respect to the severity levels since this methodology can also reveal the significance of the parameters affecting the ncr this significance can be employed in prioritising the preventive actions that will be employed by navigators 7 conclusion we have presented a novel methodology to assess the navigational collision risk ncr in port approach manoeuvring we have conducted simulation experiments to obtain a dataset representing these manoeuvrings we believe this dataset presents a unique opportunity to analyse the ncr in port approaches in our model close distances limited manoeuvring area wind force and ship speed are all accounted for these parameters represent the collision risk in port approach manoeuvring for close distances most of the individual collision risk models in the literature have not considered such near manoeuvrings before we have also consulted 20 expert pilots to build a set of fuzzy inference rules the resulting dataset has been trained with different machine learning methods and random forest has shown a superior performance in a port approach scenario different severity levels of the port approach manoeuvring have been discussed considering the parameters and the navigation situation the results show that the proposed ncr assessment methodology gives accurate and reasonable risk degrees in accordance with the navigation environment one of the reason of the consistency of the proposed parameters with the ncr is that some of the characteristics of these parameters are based on the related maritime standards and recommendations the critical and safety limits of these maritime standards and recommendations have had a great contribution to our study as the maritime transportation is evolving within the world trade the port basins are becoming more congested unlike in open and restricted waterways ncr assessment methodology in port basins have to deal with the close distances this is exactly the issue that our study deals with in addition our methodology can also feed an autonomous navigation system and inspire the auto berthing systems cooperative collision avoidance in which vessels only communicate and cooperate with others when there are collision risks chen et al 2018 can be another area of application of our methodology our study may as well be considered in other studies where the main concern is the development of autonomous navigation in port waters furthermore our assessment of the importance of the wind speed parameter implies that the future ncr studies are likely to take this hydro meteorological effect into account however ship traffic current and wave force are also other important factors for navigation we plan to include these parameters in our upcoming work on port approach manoeuvring appendices a accuracy of different

22381,the floating wind turbine fwt based on the tension leg platform tlp plays an important role in addressing the issue of energy pinch but the central characteristic for tlp is that in vertical direction it is similar to a rigid structure with tension tendons to restrain motion while in horizontal direction it seems to be compliant with less constrain the large amplitude motions in the horizontal plane caused by this compliance will seriously affect the performance of the platform under harsh environmental conditions to address this problem a new type of tension leg platform wind turbine connected with a series of buoys serbuoys tlp is proposed a time domain simulation program dutmst for the tlp and serbuoys tlp based on matlab is provided with consideration of the multi body coupling effect between the body tension leg and buoy that is each buoy can be analysed as a separate mass structure connected on the tension leg the accuracy of dutmst is discussed via comparison with the results of an experiment and aqwa the dynamic responses of tlp and serbuoys tlp are presented in dutmst the results show that the serbuoys tlp can significantly reduce the horizontal response of the tlp in addition the horizontal response suppression effects of serbuoys tlp are investigated by varying the wave factor and parameters of buoys additionally the parameters of buoys adapted to the east china sea are given keywords offshore wind turbines owt serbuoys tlp dynamic analysis model test multibody effect 1 introduction with the exhaustion of traditional energy the past decade has seen the rapid development of new renewable energies in many fields such as solar energy wave energy tidal energy and wind energy bevrani et al 2010 floating wind turbines fwts as an important component of offshore structures is playing a key role in capturing wind energy from deep water area and have thus attracted increasing attention in recent years leung and yang 2012 since heronemus 1972 proposed the concept of offshore fwts in 1972 the spar type wind turbine hywind in the north sea and the semi submersible wind turbine windfloat in portuguese waters have carried out full scale prototype sea trials and grid connected power generation roddier et al 2010 skaare et al 2015 as a professional institute in floating foundations for offshore wind ideol has been engineering and accompanying floating offshore wind projects from conception to installation they have also developed a series of new projects such as floatgen which is installed in france and hibiki installed in japan http www ideol offshore com the damping pool system of ideol has been tested and will be applied in japan beyer et al 2015 all the recent studies above demonstrate an exciting prospect for fwts compared with other fwts the appearance of tension leg type fwts is late the national renewable energy laboratory nrel proposed the concept of a tension leg type fwt in 2005 and compared it with spar type and semi submersible wind turbines musial et al 2004 matha et al under the support of nrel comprehensively studied the dynamic performance of a 5 mw tension leg type fwt in 2009 this study confirmed the superiority of tension leg platform foundations in fwt application matha 2009 a tlp is a typical compliant offshore platform with a vertical mooring system similar to application in the offshore oil industry the dynamic response has always been the focus of scholars attention because the large amplitude dynamic response will affect the normal operation of the wind turbines bangga et al 2018 several theories on the dynamic response of tlp have been proposed jain 1997 presented dynamic response analysis of a tlp to deterministic first order wave forces considering coupling between the degrees of freedom of surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw joseph et al 2004 reported the results of a detailed experimental and numerical investigation of the coupled dynamic behaviour of a mini tlp abaiee et al 2016 developed two different numerical models the finite element model fem based on the morison equation and the boundary element model bem based on a 3d diffraction radiation theory some scholars also have conducted the fully coupled dynamic analysis of tlp fowts in time domain bae et al 2013 developed a numerical simulation tool including aero blade tower dynamics and control mooring dynamics and platform motions yang et al 2010 developed a time domain nonlinear global motion analysis program for floating hulls coupled with risers mooring lines to check the survivability of a tlp with the loss of one or two tendons by accident nematbakhsh et al 2015 compared the wave load effects on a tlp wind turbine by using computational fluid dynamics and potential flow theory approaches studies over the past two decades have provided important information on how to simulate the dynamic response of a tlp however data from these studies suggest that there are some disadvantages inherent in the dynamic response of a typical tlp like the large motion response therefore many of the current studies on tlps pay particular attention to improving the structure form to reduce the dynamic response in the horizontal plane bachynski et al 2012 wang et al 2014 proposed the conceptualization of a floating offshore wind turbine tension leg platform hit fowt tlp that a concrete ballast model is arranged underneath the spoke bottom plane to serve as permanent ballast and compared it to the traditional nrel tlp model rao et al 2012 proposed a new concept of a tension based tlp tbtlp and obtained response amplitude operators raos of the tbtlp with one tension base in terms of the surge heave and pitch comparing it with a tlp without a tension base these studies provide new insights into conceptual design of tlp but the improvements mentioned above are more effective for heave in previous studies on the design of a system with low motions gicon tlp with the angled ropes is relatively mature adam et al have carried out comprehensive research including numerical simulation and model experiments adam et al 2014 a pilot plant of gicon tlp has been designed for this offshore location in the baltic sea however the applicable water depth of gicon tlp wind turbine is limited due to the economic viability with the increase of applied water depth this paper gives the concept of a new type of tension leg type wind turbine connected with a series of buoys serbuoys tlp which attempts to reduce the dynamic response of the tlp in the horizontal plane however much of the calculation software up to now cannot consider the coupling dynamic response of a series of buoys therefore this paper provides a time domain simulation program dutmst based on matlab with consideration of the multi body coupling between the body tension leg and buoy dynamic analysis of the tlp and serbuoys tlp by dutmst is performed and compared to the results of an experiment and commercial software aqwa using the proposed program dutmst some numerical studies are conducted in order to highlight the effect of a few important parameters on the serbuoys tlp response 2 methodology 2 1 proposed serbuoys tlp the serbuoys tlp is a typical tlp wind turbine which consists of a central column pontoons and tendons in addition a series of buoys are connected to the tendon legs the wind turbine is the 5 mw model proposed by nrel a sketch of the serbuoys tlp is shown in fig 1 a and b for multibody structures coupling forces are predominant in the analysis process to incorporate the coupling phenomena the equation of motion describing the dynamic equilibrium between the wind turbine foundation and buoys can be assembled as follows 1 m x c x k x f e j 1 4 f mj x x j t where m is the diagonal mass matrix for all six degrees of freedom including platform mass and additional mass c is the radiation damping matrix k is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix fe is the vector of forcing apart from the mooring force f mj is the vector of mooring force provided by tension leg j and x x and x are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of the platform respectively x x y z r x r y r z t each buoy can be analysed as a separate mass structure connected on the tension leg establishing the buoys equation of motion j 1 2 3 4 2 m j x j c j x j f mj x x j t f mj x j t where m j is the mass matrix of buoy j for all six degrees of freedom including buoy mass and additional mass c j is the damping matrix of buoy j f mj is the same as f mj in equation 1 f mj is the vector of force provided by the lower section of tension leg j and x j x j and x j are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of buoy j respectively 2 2 numerical implementation the coupling effect between buoys and platform is the dominant factor in the analysis of serbuoys tlp nevertheless the traditional software aqwa cannot consider the coupling dynamic response brought by the buoys and only equips the buoys as a tension leg with an increased diameter therefore dutmst has been developed to investigate the coupling dynamic response of the serbuoys tlp frequency domain analysis can only perform the linear analysis which is cheap and easy low et al 2009 to incorporate the nonlinear phenomena dutmst adopts time domain analysis using the runge kutta alexander et al 1977 step by step numerical integration technique to solve equations 1 and 2 the solution flow chart of dutmst is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the kernel of dutmst mainly consists of two parts the obtaining of hydrodynamic parameters and the calculation of mooring force related to the displacement the details of these two parts are showed in section 2 3 and 2 4 alineread is a function to obtain the hydrodynamic results 2 3 hydrodynamic force vectors there are three main types of study design used to identify predicted wave loads acting on offshore floating bodies the diffraction radiation theory mei et al 1978 the morison s type equation morison et al 1950 and computational fluid dynamics cfd nematbakhsh et al 2013 the morison s type equation is an empirical formula and the accuracy of it depends heavily on the choice of coefficients cd and cm the results of cfd are relatively accurate however the calculation of cfd requires large amount of computation resource nematbakhsh et al 2015 therefore the diffraction radiation theory may be better compared with the other two methods one advantage of the diffraction radiation theory is that it avoids the problem of a long calculation time the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp can be simulated in a multi group working condition to explore the effect of buoys another advantage of the diffraction radiation theory is that this method is more mature many commercial software packages have utilized it to solve practical problems and obtain proven results zheng et al 2004 the relevant hydrodynamic coefficients of platform and buoys are obtained by aqwa it contains two model settings for simplifying the tension leg a massless spring model spring element and a nonlinear beam model tube element the tube element can better consider the added mass and radiation damping dutmst provides a function alineread which can obtain the hydrodynamic results of any structure calculated by aqwa including the added mass a jk radiation damping b jk and wave forces under different wave frequencies f ω yeung et al 1982 a jk b jk and f ω are written as 3 a j k ρ ω s 0 im ϕ r k x n j d s 4 b j k ρ s 0 re ϕ r k x n j d s 5 f ω i ω ρ s 0 ϕ i x n j d s i ω ρ s 0 ϕ d x n j d s where ρ is water density ω is the wave frequency ϕ r k x is the radiation wave potential ϕ i x and ϕ d x are the incident wave potential with unit wave amplitude and the corresponding diffraction wave potential respectively and n j is the unit normal vector of the floating body surface the numerical model in aqwa is shown in fig 3 a and b whose size is consistent with the prototype the models of the platform and buoys are established in aqwa separately by means of the function alineread provided by dutmst we can obtain the added mass matrix radiation damping matrix and wave forces of the platform it is assumed that the buoys are not affected by waves because the buoys are far from the surface of the water for example the maximum wave excitation force is merely 3 5t equalling to the 1 5 of a buoy displacement when wave period is 18s and buoy displacement is 250t it indicated that the wave force acting on the buoys are negligible and are thus not considered here we only obtain the added mass matrix and radiation damping matrix of the buoys by alineread based on the results of the calculation in aqwa the wave forces in dutmst are given as 6 f t a f ω e i ω t k x cos χ y sin χ φ where a is the wave amplitude k is the wave number x y is the barycentric coordinate of the platform χ is the incident angle of the wave φ is the initial phase and f ω is the wave forces under different wave frequencies both f ω and φ are obtained by alineread 2 4 tension vector in the process of solving equations we should firstly establish the relationship between tension and the position of buoys and platform only in this way can we achieve the positions of platform and buoys in next step through the tension in this time step the tension calculation includes two sections f mj and f mj simplifying the tension leg as a massless spring model the force analysis diagram is shown in fig 4 a the tension vector of a tether can be given as 7 f mj t 0 e a l u 0 pu l u 0 pu pu 8 f mj t 0 4 f b e a l d 0 ad l d 0 ad ad 9 pu x u x p 2 y u y p 2 z u z p 2 10 ad x d x a 2 y d y a 2 z d z a 2 where fmj and f mj are the same as in equations 1 and 2 point p x p y p z p is the point of the tension leg attached on the foundation points u x u y u z u and d x d y d z d are the points of the tension leg attached on the buoy and point a x a y a z a is the tension leg anchor point therefore they denote the instantaneous vector joining the endpoints of the tether e is the young s modulus a is the cross sectional area of the tether l u 0 and l d 0 are the initial length of the upper and lower sections of the tether respectively and t 0 and f b are the net force of the foundation and buoys for the nonlinear model in the present study the tension vector is a nonlinear function of the displacements because higher order components are considered in the calculation of the instantaneous length of the tether cheng et al 2018 therefore the acquisition of the coordinates of points p u and d is especially important a method of coordinate conversion is given to obtain the coordinates of the platform and the upper and lower nodes of the buoys sugita et al 2016 two right handed cartesian coordinate systems oxyz and cogζηξ are defined in fig 4 b oxyz is the space fixed coordinate system where plane oxy coincides with the undisturbed calm water surface cogζηξ is the body fixed coordinate system where cog coincides with the centre of gravity of the platform the coordinate of point p x p j y p j z p j in oxyz is 11 x p j y p j z p j x y z r z r x r y x p y p z p where x x y z r x r y r z t is the displacement vectors of the platform x y z t is the barycentric coordinate of the platform rx ry rz t is the roll pitch and yaw of the platform and x p y p z p t is the coordinate of point p in cogζηξ r z cos r z cos r z 0 sin r z sin r z 0 0 0 1 r y cos r y 0 sin r y 0 sin r y 0 sin r y 0 cos r y 12 r x 1 0 0 0 cos r x sin r x 0 sin r x cos r x the coordinates of points u and d in oxyz can also be obtained according to this method only need to change the x into the barycentric coordinate of the buoys x j and change x p y p z p t into the coordinate of point u and d in cogζηξ in this way the instantaneous tension of the tension leg can be calculated based on the displacements of the platform and buoys in real time 3 validation of the numerical model 3 1 set up of the physical test the serbuoys tlp model being considered is square in plan view as shown in fig 1 with four buoys attached to the tension leg to verify the accuracy of the program dutmst scale model tests of the serbuoys tlp system have been performed in the advanced wind tunnel and wave flume joint laboratory at the harbin institute of technology hit the experimental model of the floating wind turbine foundation is shown in fig 5 a and that of the buoys is shown in fig 5 b comprehensively considering the condition of the laboratory and the size of the full scale serbuoys tlp system the scale ratio of the serbuoys tlp test model has been designed to be 1 50 in line with froude scaling laws ren et al 2012 the main design parameters of the serbuoys tlp and wave data are given in table 1 3 2 comparison between numerical and experimental studies the serbuoys tlp is a multi body coupling system so each buoy should be analysed as a separate mass structure the experimental model of the serbuoys tlp is consistent with the dutmst program considering buoys connected on the tension leg nevertheless aqwa cannot consider the serbuoys tlp as a multi body system and the buoy can only be equivalent to a tension leg with an increased diameter however as the basis of dutmst aqwa is also carried out in the process of the numerical study in order to primarily study the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp the numerical model in aqwa is the same as in section 2 3 considering that the surge responses usually play a dominant role for the serbuoys tlp floating system we are more concerned about the surge of the tlp the results of surge in aqwa dutmst and the experiment are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a is the time history of serbuoys tlp under the work condition in table 1 the ordinate of fig 6 b is dimensionless parameters represented by the average amplitude of the time domain results under wave period 5 66 s 7 07 s 8 48 s 9 90 s 11 31 s 12 73 s 14 70 s and similar conclusions can be drawn from the two figures as shown in fig 6 the results indicate that the numerical results of both dutmst and aqwa have a good agreement with the experimental data although compared with the results of dutmst it is illogical that the surge obtained in the aqwa are smaller than the experimental value because of without accounting for the damping effect completely in the scale test model the numerical results should be larger than the experimental value teigen et al 1998 it may be caused by the unreasonable simplification that the buoy is equivalent to a tension leg with an increased diameter in aqwa as far as this is concerned the results obtained in dutmst are more logical in addition dutmst is an open source program implemented by matlab therefore it is more convenient for advanced development to investigate the factors on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp compared with aqwa 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the serbuoys tlp and a typical tlp to compare the differences between the serbuoys tlp and a typical tlp dutmst also provides a time domain simulation program for a typical tlp which is exactly the same as the serbuoys tlp except that no buoys are on the tension leg compared with the serbuoys tlp the analysis of the typical tlp is simpler because only equation 1 needs to be solved using the runge kutta step by step numerical integration technique to assess the accuracy of dutmst for the typical tlp the time histories of the surge predicted by dutmst are compared with the numerical results of aqwa in fig 7 it is worth noting that the tension leg in aqwa is also simplified to spring element here like the dutmst the wave data of the numerical study is the same as in table 1 wave period t 8 485 s wave height h 3 m it is apparent from fig 7 that the results obtained from dutmst have good agreement with the results of aqwa it has been verified that this trend remains under different wave conditions based on the above research the dynamic response of the typical tlp and serbuoys tlp has been simulated in dutmst under four different wave conditions the time histories of the surge are shown in fig 8 to compare the dynamic responses of the tlp and serbuoys tlp in the plane from fig 8 a b and c we can see that the surge of the serbuoys tlp is obviously less than that of the tlp this result indicates that the serbuoys tlp can exhibit effective improvement in the dynamic responses compared to the tlp in the plane and exhibits a good effect in suppressing the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane however the suppressive effect is different under the different wave conditions surprisingly suppression of the surge of the tlp is not observed in fig 8 d instead the surge of the serbuoys tlp is larger than that of the tlp under this wave conditions wave period t 6 s these results suggest that the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp on the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane is affected by wave parameters therefore the next section of the study was concerned with factors that affect the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp 4 2 influence of wave factors on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp are calculated under 27 wave conditions consisting of different wave periods wave heights and wave heading angles these wave parameters are listed in table 2 to display the results more conveniently dynamic responses under each wave condition are represented by the average amplitude of the time domain results between 100 s and 200 s the surge motion amplitudes of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp under wave condition a are shown in fig 9 the surge motion amplitudes of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp both increase gradually as the wave period increases when the wave period is approximately 7 s the dynamic response of the serbuoys tlp exhibits a peak value before the wave period reaches this peak the serbuoys tlp cannot suppress the surge motions of the tlp and the surge motions of it become larger than those of the tlp after the wave period reaches this peak the serbuoys tlp has a good suppression effect on the dynamic response of the tlp in the plane and the suppression effect decreases with the increase of the wave period a possible reason for these results is that the natural frequency of the serbuoys tlp coincides with the frequency of the incident wave causing resonance therefore when the parameters of the serbuoys tlp are determined the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp under different wave periods should be discussed the surge motion amplitude of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp under wave conditions b and c are shown in fig 10 a and b the suppressive rates for the surge motion of the tlp are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 10 and table 3 although the surge motions of the serbuoys tlp and tlp are different under different wave conditions the suppressive rate is basically constant as the wave height and wave incident angle change when the incident angle of the wave is 90 the surge motions of the tlp and serbuoys tlp are very small so it is meaningless to discuss the suppressive rate here 4 3 influence of buoy factors on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp the analysis of section 4 2 indicates that the wave period plays an important role in the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp on the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane the main reason is that the buoys connected on the tension leg change the natural frequency of the serbuoys tlp in actual conditions it is particularly important to investigate the applicability of buoy parameters therefore the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp are calculated under working conditions d e f and g to investigate the influence of the position of and displacement of buoys on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp the working conditions are listed in table 4 and each group includes 11 situations of wave periods from 3 s to 15 s wave height h 1 m incident angle of wave θ 0 the surge motions of the tlp and serbuoys tlp are shown in fig 11 a preliminary analysis of the variation in the wave period corresponding to the peak with the buoy parameters is given as seen from fig 11 the numerical results obtain a good agreement with the results of group a and a peak value also exist in the time histories of the serbuoys tlp however as the position of the buoys become deeper and the displacement of the buoys increases the wave period corresponding to the peak t p is larger the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp also is influenced by the t p the suppressive effect under work condition g seem to be the best and the suppressive efficiency is listed in table 5 the change of t p accompanied with the buoy factors may be caused by the change of mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp in order to further interpret this phenomenon and discuss the influence of buoy factors on mooring stiffness the static analysis of serbuoys tlp is carried out and the results are shown in fig 12 the δ x in fig 12 is the initial offset of the platform in the surge and f x is the horizontal restoring force caused by δ x based on the results obtained above we can see that the mooring stiffness will decrease as the position of the buoys become deeper according to eq 16 we can observe that t p increases with the decrease of stiffness when the total mass is constant therefore the increase of t p will occur as the position of the buoys become deeper the mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp will increase as the displacement of the buoys increase surprisingly although the mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp increases with the increase displacement of the buoys the t p increased as well this unusual phenomenon is because the total mass of serbuoys tlp increases with the increase of displacement of buoys therefore we can conclude that the mass of the buoys also has a great influence on the natural frequency of the total system 13 ω 2 π t p k 11 m the tlp provided in this paper is more suitable for the east china sea zheng et al 2012 where the common wave periods are 6 s 8 s based on this trend it is practical in the east china sea on condition that the buoys will be located 60 m underwater and the displacement of buoys be set as 250 t the suppressive efficiency under the corresponding working condition d is listed in table 6 in this way the serbuoys tlp can effectively suppress the horizontal dynamic responses of the tlp 5 conclusions in this study a concept of serbuoys tlp is provided firstly and the dynamic behaviors of serbuoys tlp have been investigated both experimentally and numerically using the time domain simulation program dutmst dutmst which is based on matlab take consideration of the multi body coupling effect between the foundation tension legs and buoys the results of dutmst are compared with data from experiment and aqwa the comparisons showed that the numerical results of dutmst obtain a better agreement with experimental results compared to the numerical results of aqwa the following conclusions are summed up based on the numerical studies conducted with dutmst under different working conditions a the serbuoys tlp has a certain suppressive effect on the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane the highest suppressive rates under the different working conditions d e f and g are 54 21 16 62 24 73 and 67 97 b the change of mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp will accompanied with the addition of buoys on the tendons a wave period t p which corresponds to resonance in the time histories of the surge exists the suppressive effect is not good or even worse in the motion response of the tlp near this wave period therefore the wave period should be given more attention in the application of serbuoys tlp c as the position of the buoys becomes deeper and the displacement of buoys increases the wave period corresponding to t p becomes larger according to the static analysis method we can draw the conclusion that both mooring stiffness and the mass of buoys have certain influence on the suppressive effect based on this trend we can make the wave period corresponding to resonance avoid the common wave periods under the actual sea conditions by changing the parameters of the buoys and the parameters of buoys adapted to the east china sea are given 6 future works many challenges related to the feasibility of the serbuoys tlp system still remain and the development of the concept for actual deployment requires further investigation challenges will include the redistribution of the tension the installation process of buoys analysis of the effect of long term fatigue and effective survival strategies for extreme sea cases the study of these aspects should be included in future research acknowledgements this research was supported by the

22381,the floating wind turbine fwt based on the tension leg platform tlp plays an important role in addressing the issue of energy pinch but the central characteristic for tlp is that in vertical direction it is similar to a rigid structure with tension tendons to restrain motion while in horizontal direction it seems to be compliant with less constrain the large amplitude motions in the horizontal plane caused by this compliance will seriously affect the performance of the platform under harsh environmental conditions to address this problem a new type of tension leg platform wind turbine connected with a series of buoys serbuoys tlp is proposed a time domain simulation program dutmst for the tlp and serbuoys tlp based on matlab is provided with consideration of the multi body coupling effect between the body tension leg and buoy that is each buoy can be analysed as a separate mass structure connected on the tension leg the accuracy of dutmst is discussed via comparison

the east china sea are given keywords offshore wind turbines owt serbuoys tlp dynamic analysis model test multibody effect 1 introduction with the exhaustion of traditional energy the past decade has seen the rapid development of new renewable energies in many fields such as solar energy wave energy tidal energy and wind energy bevrani et al 2010 floating wind turbines fwts as an important component of offshore structures is playing a key role in capturing wind energy from deep water area and have thus attracted increasing attention in recent years leung and yang 2012 since heronemus 1972 proposed the concept of offshore fwts in 1972 the spar type wind turbine hywind in the north sea and the semi submersible wind turbine windfloat in portuguese waters have carried out full scale prototype sea trials and grid connected power generation roddier et al 2010 skaare et al 2015 as a professional institute in floating foundations for offshore wind ideol has been engineering and accompanying floating offshore wind projects from conception to installation they have also developed a series of new projects such as floatgen which is installed in france and hibiki installed in japan http www ideol offshore com the damping pool system of ideol has been tested and will be applied in japan beyer et al 2015 all the recent studies above demonstrate an exciting prospect for fwts compared with other fwts the appearance of tension leg type fwts is late the national renewable energy laboratory nrel proposed the concept of a tension leg type fwt in 2005 and compared it with spar type and semi submersible wind turbines musial et al 2004 matha et al under the support of nrel comprehensively studied the dynamic performance of a 5 mw tension leg type fwt in 2009 this study confirmed the superiority of tension leg platform foundations in fwt application matha 2009 a tlp is a typical compliant offshore platform with a vertical mooring system similar to application in the offshore oil industry the dynamic response has always been the focus of scholars attention because the large amplitude dynamic response will affect the normal operation of the wind turbines bangga et al 2018 several theories on the dynamic response of tlp have been proposed jain 1997 presented dynamic response analysis of a tlp to deterministic first order wave forces considering coupling between the degrees of freedom of surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw joseph et al 2004 reported the results of a detailed experimental and numerical investigation of the coupled dynamic behaviour of a mini tlp abaiee et al 2016 developed two different numerical models the finite element model fem based on the morison equation and the boundary element model bem based on a 3d diffraction radiation theory some scholars also have conducted the fully coupled dynamic analysis of tlp fowts in time domain bae et al 2013 developed a numerical simulation tool including aero blade tower dynamics and control mooring dynamics and platform motions yang et al 2010 developed a time domain nonlinear global motion analysis program for floating hulls coupled with risers mooring lines to check the survivability of a tlp with the loss of one or two tendons by accident nematbakhsh et al 2015 compared the wave load effects on a tlp wind turbine by using computational fluid dynamics and potential flow theory approaches studies over the past two decades have provided important information on how to simulate the dynamic response of a tlp however data from these studies suggest that there are some disadvantages inherent in the dynamic response of a typical tlp like the large motion response therefore many of the current studies on tlps pay particular attention to improving the structure form to reduce the dynamic response in the horizontal plane bachynski et al 2012 wang et al 2014 proposed the conceptualization of a floating offshore wind turbine tension leg platform hit fowt tlp that a concrete ballast model is arranged underneath the spoke bottom plane to serve as permanent ballast and compared it to the traditional nrel tlp model rao et al 2012 proposed a new concept of a tension based tlp tbtlp and obtained response amplitude operators raos of the tbtlp with one tension base in terms of the surge heave and pitch comparing it with a tlp without a tension base these studies provide new insights into conceptual design of tlp but the improvements mentioned above are more effective for heave in previous studies on the design of a system with low motions gicon tlp with the angled ropes is relatively mature adam et al have carried out comprehensive research including numerical simulation and model experiments adam et al 2014 a pilot plant of gicon tlp has been designed for this offshore location in the baltic sea however the applicable water depth of gicon tlp wind turbine is limited due to the economic viability with the increase of applied water depth this paper gives the concept of a new type of tension leg type wind turbine connected with a series of buoys serbuoys tlp which attempts to reduce the dynamic response of the tlp in the horizontal plane however much of the calculation software up to now cannot consider the coupling dynamic response of a series of buoys therefore this paper provides a time domain simulation program dutmst based on matlab with consideration of the multi body coupling between the body tension leg and buoy dynamic analysis of the tlp and serbuoys tlp by dutmst is performed and compared to the results of an experiment and commercial software aqwa using the proposed program dutmst some numerical studies are conducted in order to highlight the effect of a few important parameters on the serbuoys tlp response 2 methodology 2 1 proposed serbuoys tlp the serbuoys tlp is a typical tlp wind turbine which consists of a central column pontoons and tendons in addition a series of buoys are connected to the tendon legs the wind turbine is the 5 mw model proposed by nrel a sketch of the serbuoys tlp is shown in fig 1 a and b for multibody structures coupling forces are predominant in the analysis process to incorporate the coupling phenomena the equation of motion describing the dynamic equilibrium between the wind turbine foundation and buoys can be assembled as follows 1 m x c x k x f e j 1 4 f mj x x j t where m is the diagonal mass matrix for all six degrees of freedom including platform mass and additional mass c is the radiation damping matrix k is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix fe is the vector of forcing apart from the mooring force f mj is the vector of mooring force provided by tension leg j and x x and x are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of the platform respectively x x y z r x r y r z t each buoy can be analysed as a separate mass structure connected on the tension leg establishing the buoys equation of motion j 1 2 3 4 2 m j x j c j x j f mj x x j t f mj x j t where m j is the mass matrix of buoy j for all six degrees of freedom including buoy mass and additional mass c j is the damping matrix of buoy j f mj is the same as f mj in equation 1 f mj is the vector of force provided by the lower section of tension leg j and x j x j and x j are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of buoy j respectively 2 2 numerical implementation the coupling effect between buoys and platform is the dominant factor in the analysis of serbuoys tlp nevertheless the traditional software aqwa cannot consider the coupling dynamic response brought by the buoys and only equips the buoys as a tension leg with an increased diameter therefore dutmst has been developed to investigate the coupling dynamic response of the serbuoys tlp frequency domain analysis can only perform the linear analysis which is cheap and easy low et al 2009 to incorporate the nonlinear phenomena dutmst adopts time domain analysis using the runge kutta alexander et al 1977 step by step numerical integration technique to solve equations 1 and 2 the solution flow chart of dutmst is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the kernel of dutmst mainly consists of two parts the obtaining of hydrodynamic parameters and the calculation of mooring force related to the displacement the details of these two parts are showed in section 2 3 and 2 4 alineread is a function to obtain the hydrodynamic results 2 3 hydrodynamic force vectors there are three main types of study design used to identify predicted wave loads acting on offshore floating bodies the diffraction radiation theory mei et al 1978 the morison s type equation morison et al 1950 and computational fluid dynamics cfd nematbakhsh et al 2013 the morison s type equation is an empirical formula and the accuracy of it depends heavily on the choice of coefficients cd and cm the results of cfd are relatively accurate however the calculation of cfd requires large amount of computation resource nematbakhsh et al 2015 therefore the diffraction radiation theory may be better compared with the other two methods one advantage of the diffraction radiation theory is that it avoids the problem of a long calculation time the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp can be simulated in a multi group working condition to explore the effect of buoys another advantage of the diffraction radiation theory is that this method is more mature many commercial software packages have utilized it to solve practical problems and obtain proven results zheng et al 2004 the relevant hydrodynamic coefficients of platform and buoys are obtained by aqwa it contains two model settings for simplifying the tension leg a massless spring model spring element and a nonlinear beam model tube element the tube element can better consider the added mass and radiation damping dutmst provides a function alineread which can obtain the hydrodynamic results of any structure calculated by aqwa including the added mass a jk radiation damping b jk and wave forces under different wave frequencies f ω yeung et al 1982 a jk b jk and f ω are written as 3 a j k ρ ω s 0 im ϕ r k x n j d s 4 b j k ρ s 0 re ϕ r k x n j d s 5 f ω i ω ρ s 0 ϕ i x n j d s i ω ρ s 0 ϕ d x n j d s where ρ is water density ω is the wave frequency ϕ r k x is the radiation wave potential ϕ i x and ϕ d x are the incident wave potential with unit wave amplitude and the corresponding diffraction wave potential respectively and n j is the unit normal vector of the floating body surface the numerical model in aqwa is shown in fig 3 a and b whose size is consistent with the prototype the models of the platform and buoys are established in aqwa separately by means of the function alineread provided by dutmst we can obtain the added mass matrix radiation damping matrix and wave forces of the platform it is assumed that the buoys are not affected by waves because the buoys are far from the surface of the water for example the maximum wave excitation force is merely 3 5t equalling to the 1 5 of a buoy displacement when wave period is 18s and buoy displacement is 250t it indicated that the wave force acting on the buoys are negligible and are thus not considered here we only obtain the added mass matrix and radiation damping matrix of the buoys by alineread based on the results of the calculation in aqwa the wave forces in dutmst are given as 6 f t a f ω e i ω t k x cos χ y sin χ φ where a is the wave amplitude k is the wave number x y is the barycentric coordinate of the platform χ is the incident angle of the wave φ is the initial phase and f ω is the wave forces under different wave frequencies both f ω and φ are obtained by alineread 2 4 tension vector in the process of solving equations we should firstly establish the relationship between tension and the position of buoys and platform only in this way can we achieve the positions of platform and buoys in next step through the tension in this time step the tension calculation includes two sections f mj and f mj simplifying the tension leg as a massless spring model the force analysis diagram is shown in fig 4 a the tension vector of a tether can be given as 7 f mj t 0 e a l u 0 pu l u 0 pu pu 8 f mj t 0 4 f b e a l d 0 ad l d 0 ad ad 9 pu x u x p 2 y u y p 2 z u z p 2 10 ad x d x a 2 y d y a 2 z d z a 2 where fmj and f mj are the same as in equations 1 and 2 point p x p y p z p is the point of the tension leg attached on the foundation points u x u y u z u and d x d y d z d are the points of the tension leg attached on the buoy and point a x a y a z a is the tension leg anchor point therefore they denote the instantaneous vector joining the endpoints of the tether e is the young s modulus a is the cross sectional area of the tether l u 0 and l d 0 are the initial length of the upper and lower sections of the tether respectively and t 0 and f b are the net force of the foundation and buoys for the nonlinear model in the present study the tension vector is a nonlinear function of the displacements because higher order components are considered in the calculation of the instantaneous length of the tether cheng et al 2018 therefore the acquisition of the coordinates of points p u and d is especially important a method of coordinate conversion is given to obtain the coordinates of the platform and the upper and lower nodes of the buoys sugita et al 2016 two right handed cartesian coordinate systems oxyz and cogζηξ are defined in fig 4 b oxyz is the space fixed coordinate system where plane oxy coincides with the undisturbed calm water surface cogζηξ is the body fixed coordinate system where cog coincides with the centre of gravity of the platform the coordinate of point p x p j y p j z p j in oxyz is 11 x p j y p j z p j x y z r z r x r y x p y p z p where x x y z r x r y r z t is the displacement vectors of the platform x y z t is the barycentric coordinate of the platform rx ry rz t is the roll pitch and yaw of the platform and x p y p z p t is the coordinate of point p in cogζηξ r z cos r z cos r z 0 sin r z sin r z 0 0 0 1 r y cos r y 0 sin r y 0 sin r y 0 sin r y 0 cos r y 12 r x 1 0 0 0 cos r x sin r x 0 sin r x cos r x the coordinates of points u and d in oxyz can also be obtained according to this method only need to change the x into the barycentric coordinate of the buoys x j and change x p y p z p t into the coordinate of point u and d in cogζηξ in this way the instantaneous tension of the tension leg can be calculated based on the displacements of the platform and buoys in real time 3 validation of the numerical model 3 1 set up of the physical test the serbuoys tlp model being considered is square in plan view as shown in fig 1 with four buoys attached to the tension leg to verify the accuracy of the program dutmst scale model tests of the serbuoys tlp system have been performed in the advanced wind tunnel and wave flume joint laboratory at the harbin institute of technology hit the experimental model of the floating wind turbine foundation is shown in fig 5 a and that of the buoys is shown in fig 5 b comprehensively considering the condition of the laboratory and the size of the full scale serbuoys tlp system the scale ratio of the serbuoys tlp test model has been designed to be 1 50 in line with froude scaling laws ren et al 2012 the main design parameters of the serbuoys tlp and wave data are given in table 1 3 2 comparison between numerical and experimental studies the serbuoys tlp is a multi body coupling system so each buoy should be analysed as a separate mass structure the experimental model of the serbuoys tlp is consistent with the dutmst program considering buoys connected on the tension leg nevertheless aqwa cannot consider the serbuoys tlp as a multi body system and the buoy can only be equivalent to a tension leg with an increased diameter however as the basis of dutmst aqwa is also carried out in the process of the numerical study in order to primarily study the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp the numerical model in aqwa is the same as in section 2 3 considering that the surge responses usually play a dominant role for the serbuoys tlp floating system we are more concerned about the surge of the tlp the results of surge in aqwa dutmst and the experiment are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a is the time history of serbuoys tlp under the work condition in table 1 the ordinate of fig 6 b is dimensionless parameters represented by the average amplitude of the time domain results under wave period 5 66 s 7 07 s 8 48 s 9 90 s 11 31 s 12 73 s 14 70 s and similar conclusions can be drawn from the two figures as shown in fig 6 the results indicate that the numerical results of both dutmst and aqwa have a good agreement with the experimental data although compared with the results of dutmst it is illogical that the surge obtained in the aqwa are smaller than the experimental value because of without accounting for the damping effect completely in the scale test model the numerical results should be larger than the experimental value teigen et al 1998 it may be caused by the unreasonable simplification that the buoy is equivalent to a tension leg with an increased diameter in aqwa as far as this is concerned the results obtained in dutmst are more logical in addition dutmst is an open source program implemented by matlab therefore it is more convenient for advanced development to investigate the factors on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp compared with aqwa 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the serbuoys tlp and a typical tlp to compare the differences between the serbuoys tlp and a typical tlp dutmst also provides a time domain simulation program for a typical tlp which is exactly the same as the serbuoys tlp except that no buoys are on the tension leg compared with the serbuoys tlp the analysis of the typical tlp is simpler because only equation 1 needs to be solved using the runge kutta step by step numerical integration technique to assess the accuracy of dutmst for the typical tlp the time histories of the surge predicted by dutmst are compared with the numerical results of aqwa in fig 7 it is worth noting that the tension leg in aqwa is also simplified to spring element here like the dutmst the wave data of the numerical study is the same as in table 1 wave period t 8 485 s wave height h 3 m it is apparent from fig 7 that the results obtained from dutmst have good agreement with the results of aqwa it has been verified that this trend remains under different wave conditions based on the above research the dynamic response of the typical tlp and serbuoys tlp has been simulated in dutmst under four different wave conditions the time histories of the surge are shown in fig 8 to compare the dynamic responses of the tlp and serbuoys tlp in the plane from fig 8 a b and c we can see that the surge of the serbuoys tlp is obviously less than that of the tlp this result indicates that the serbuoys tlp can exhibit effective improvement in the dynamic responses compared to the tlp in the plane and exhibits a good effect in suppressing the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane however the suppressive effect is different under the different wave conditions surprisingly suppression of the surge of the tlp is not observed in fig 8 d instead the surge of the serbuoys tlp is larger than that of the tlp under this wave conditions wave period t 6 s these results suggest that the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp on the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane is affected by wave parameters therefore the next section of the study was concerned with factors that affect the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp 4 2 influence of wave factors on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp are calculated under 27 wave conditions consisting of different wave periods wave heights and wave heading angles these wave parameters are listed in table 2 to display the results more conveniently dynamic responses under each wave condition are represented by the average amplitude of the time domain results between 100 s and 200 s the surge motion amplitudes of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp under wave condition a are shown in fig 9 the surge motion amplitudes of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp both increase gradually as the wave period increases when the wave period is approximately 7 s the dynamic response of the serbuoys tlp exhibits a peak value before the wave period reaches this peak the serbuoys tlp cannot suppress the surge motions of the tlp and the surge motions of it become larger than those of the tlp after the wave period reaches this peak the serbuoys tlp has a good suppression effect on the dynamic response of the tlp in the plane and the suppression effect decreases with the increase of the wave period a possible reason for these results is that the natural frequency of the serbuoys tlp coincides with the frequency of the incident wave causing resonance therefore when the parameters of the serbuoys tlp are determined the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp under different wave periods should be discussed the surge motion amplitude of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp under wave conditions b and c are shown in fig 10 a and b the suppressive rates for the surge motion of the tlp are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 10 and table 3 although the surge motions of the serbuoys tlp and tlp are different under different wave conditions the suppressive rate is basically constant as the wave height and wave incident angle change when the incident angle of the wave is 90 the surge motions of the tlp and serbuoys tlp are very small so it is meaningless to discuss the suppressive rate here 4 3 influence of buoy factors on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp the analysis of section 4 2 indicates that the wave period plays an important role in the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp on the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane the main reason is that the buoys connected on the tension leg change the natural frequency of the serbuoys tlp in actual conditions it is particularly important to investigate the applicability of buoy parameters therefore the dynamic responses of the serbuoys tlp and typical tlp are calculated under working conditions d e f and g to investigate the influence of the position of and displacement of buoys on the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp the working conditions are listed in table 4 and each group includes 11 situations of wave periods from 3 s to 15 s wave height h 1 m incident angle of wave θ 0 the surge motions of the tlp and serbuoys tlp are shown in fig 11 a preliminary analysis of the variation in the wave period corresponding to the peak with the buoy parameters is given as seen from fig 11 the numerical results obtain a good agreement with the results of group a and a peak value also exist in the time histories of the serbuoys tlp however as the position of the buoys become deeper and the displacement of the buoys increases the wave period corresponding to the peak t p is larger the suppressive effect of the serbuoys tlp also is influenced by the t p the suppressive effect under work condition g seem to be the best and the suppressive efficiency is listed in table 5 the change of t p accompanied with the buoy factors may be caused by the change of mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp in order to further interpret this phenomenon and discuss the influence of buoy factors on mooring stiffness the static analysis of serbuoys tlp is carried out and the results are shown in fig 12 the δ x in fig 12 is the initial offset of the platform in the surge and f x is the horizontal restoring force caused by δ x based on the results obtained above we can see that the mooring stiffness will decrease as the position of the buoys become deeper according to eq 16 we can observe that t p increases with the decrease of stiffness when the total mass is constant therefore the increase of t p will occur as the position of the buoys become deeper the mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp will increase as the displacement of the buoys increase surprisingly although the mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp increases with the increase displacement of the buoys the t p increased as well this unusual phenomenon is because the total mass of serbuoys tlp increases with the increase of displacement of buoys therefore we can conclude that the mass of the buoys also has a great influence on the natural frequency of the total system 13 ω 2 π t p k 11 m the tlp provided in this paper is more suitable for the east china sea zheng et al 2012 where the common wave periods are 6 s 8 s based on this trend it is practical in the east china sea on condition that the buoys will be located 60 m underwater and the displacement of buoys be set as 250 t the suppressive efficiency under the corresponding working condition d is listed in table 6 in this way the serbuoys tlp can effectively suppress the horizontal dynamic responses of the tlp 5 conclusions in this study a concept of serbuoys tlp is provided firstly and the dynamic behaviors of serbuoys tlp have been investigated both experimentally and numerically using the time domain simulation program dutmst dutmst which is based on matlab take consideration of the multi body coupling effect between the foundation tension legs and buoys the results of dutmst are compared with data from experiment and aqwa the comparisons showed that the numerical results of dutmst obtain a better agreement with experimental results compared to the numerical results of aqwa the following conclusions are summed up based on the numerical studies conducted with dutmst under different working conditions a the serbuoys tlp has a certain suppressive effect on the dynamic responses of the tlp in the plane the highest suppressive rates under the different working conditions d e f and g are 54 21 16 62 24 73 and 67 97 b the change of mooring stiffness of serbuoys tlp will accompanied with the addition of buoys on the tendons a wave period t p which corresponds to resonance in the time histories of the surge exists the suppressive effect is not good or even worse in the motion response of the tlp near this wave period therefore the wave period should be given more attention in the application of serbuoys tlp c as the position of the buoys becomes deeper and the displacement of buoys increases the wave period corresponding to t p becomes larger according to the static analysis method we can draw the conclusion that both mooring stiffness and the mass of buoys have certain influence on the suppressive effect based on this trend we can make the wave period corresponding to resonance avoid the common wave periods under the actual sea conditions by changing the parameters of the buoys and the parameters of buoys adapted to the east china sea are given 6 future works many challenges related to the feasibility of the serbuoys tlp system still remain and the development of the concept for actual deployment requires further investigation challenges will include the redistribution of the tension the installation process of buoys analysis of the effect of long term fatigue and effective survival strategies for extreme sea cases the study of these aspects should be included in future research acknowledgements this research was supported by the

22382,rotor stator interaction and tip clearance between rotor blade tip and shroud of a pump jet propulsor can induce strong pressure fluctuations and vibrations which may cause damage of the propulsion system at some severe working conditions this paper investigates numerically the effects of tip clearance on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations in a pump jet propulsor the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model together with the sliding mesh technique are adopted to simulate the three dimensional unsteady flow the accuracy of the computation results is verified through available experimental data of propulsion performance with a tip clearance of 1 mm the comparison of hydrodynamic performance for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 0 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm shows that the thrust and propulsion efficiency can be reduced significantly due to the increase of tip clearance sizes further results indicate that the decrease of thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor with tip clearance is mainly caused by the change of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade in the range of 0 8r 1 0r where r is the rotor diameter in addition a method based on statistics is applied to reveal the characteristics of pressure fluctuations at all grid nodes on the whole blade surface and the result shows that the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations increase significantly on the blade surface when the tip clearance size is enlarged especially on the blade tip blade root and the leading edge moreover it is found that the tip clearance effects do not change the main frequency of thrust and torque fluctuations while it has a significant impact on the amplitudes of fluctuations especially in the higher frequency band keywords pump jet propulsor tip clearance propulsion performance pressure fluctuation 1 introduction over the past few decades pump jet propulsor pjp has been widely used in underwater vehicles such as torpedoes and submarines owing to its high propulsion efficiency and low noise property at medium and high speed pump jet propulsors are typically composed of a stationary vane system stator a rotating vane system rotor and an axisymmetric shroud completely surrounding the rotor and stator with an airfoil section which prevents the inner noise emitting into the outside flow field bruce et al 1974 furuya and chiang 1986 however the application of shroud around the rotor usually cause a complex problem of tip clearance flow which has a considerable effect on propulsion performance pressure fluctuation vibration and radiated noise of pump jet propulsor liu et al 2018 the tip clearance flow problems such as evolution of tip leakage vortex tlv and flow mechanism in gap region have motivated a lot of experimental and numerical studies liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 limited by the complexity of flow characteristics and mechanical structures many experimental studies on tlv and on the associated cavitation problem focus mainly on the fixed hydrofoil with one end fixed and with a gap near the other end decaix et al 2015 dreyer et al 2014 gopalan et al 2002 guo et al 2016 higashi et al 2002

cavitation characteristics have been well identified further studies on the influence of gap flow point out that tlv and its associated cavitation are very sensitive to the tip clearance size tip geometry surface roughness and its operating environment dreyer et al 2014 gopalan et al 2002 katz and galdo 1989 lei et al 2017 liu and tan 2018 thapa et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 and part of these research results are summarized in liu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 by using numerical simulation methods the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations of pumps and turbines has been extensively investigated zhang et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of pressure fluctuation in a low specific speed mixed flow pump with different tip clearance sizes by using the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model and concluded that the pressure fluctuation in the whole passage of the pump will increase significantly if the gap increases beyond a certain range feng et al 2016 proposed a new method based on pressure statistics to evaluate pressure fluctuations on all grid nodes inside an axial flow pump the result indicated that the gap flow introduces some lower multiples of the rotation frequency to the pressure spectrum and magnifies the pressure fluctuation in the whole impeller region greatly further studies based on numerical simulation show that the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations is ubiquitous in pumps and turbines and this influence varies greatly with the changing of operation conditions such as non cavitation condition or cavitation condition the tip clearance sizes and especially the geometrical construction liu et al 2017 tan et al 2015 xu et al 2017 however different from pumps and turbines the length of axial symmetry shroud of pump jet propulsor is usually finite and thus the flow outside the shroud may interact with the internal flow which leads to more complex flow field and pressure fluctuations several studies have been conducted on the performance and flow characteristics of pump jet propulsors furuya and chiang 1986 combined the streamline curvature method scm with blade to blade flow theory and then proposed a three dimensional design method for pump jet propulsor system by using momentum defect principle for propulsion performance in a wind tunnel facility the performance and the complex inner flow field of a pump jet propulsor for high reynolds number are experimentally studied suryanarayana et al 2010 ahn and kwon 2015 numerically studied the propulsion performance and flow fields of a pump jet propulsor with ring rotor at the blade tip by using an incompressible rans flow solver their results suggested that the addition of tip ring at the blade tip may reduce tip vortex strength without losing any propulsion efficiency even though it could cause a slight drop of thrust tip clearance effect on the propulsion performance of pump jet propulsor have been investigated by using numerical simulation method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model and the simulation results shown that the efficiency of pump jet propulsor drop sharply with the increase of tip clearance size lu et al 2016 in engineering practice the vibration of hull caused by the fluctuations of thrust and torque of the propeller usually contributes most to the radiated noise for underwater vehicles compared with other factors therefore reducing the fluctuations of rotor thrust and torque is of great significance to improve the acoustic radiation performance and the operating stability for underwater vehicles however above mentioned researches mainly focused on propulsion performance and flow characteristics of pump jet propulsors relatively scarce work has been devoted to the effects of tip clearance on the unsteady pressures and forces which have great effects on the operation stability and underwater radiation noise for pump jet propulsors aiming at overcoming the limitations highlighted above this paper contributes a numerical investigation on the influence of the tip clearance on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations in pump jet propulsor by using the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model significant contribution is achieved by verifying the computation result through the experimental data of the pump jet propulsor with a tip clearance of 1 mm moreover the unsteady flow fields hydrodynamic performance time averaged pressure distributions pressure fluctuations and also the fluctuations of thrust and torque in pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 0 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm are numerically studied and compared 2 research object 2 1 pump jet configuration a physical scale model of pump jet propulsor according to the experiment conditions of the cavitation tunnel is designed in the present work to explore the influence rule of the tip clearance the basic configuration of the pump jet propulsor consists of three parts an inlet guide vane system stator an impeller rotor and an axisymmetric shroud see in fig 1 the length of the shroud is l 230 mm with an inlet diameter of d 1 316 mm and an outlet diameter of d 2 284 mm the stators have a right turn angle of 7 5 with a chord length of 60 mm the axial distance between the leading edge of shroud and the leading edge of stator blades is 20 mm the detailed parameters of the sections of shroud and stator blade are listed in table 1 where y u and y l are the dimensionless coordinate values of the upper and lower surface for the airfoil in cartesian coordinate system respectively the diameter of the rotor hub is d h 74 mm and the outer diameter of the rotor blades is d r 294 mm with a tip clearance of 1 mm to the inner wall of shroud the rotor has five three dimensional blades equipped with seven guide vanes upstream the rotor the axial distance between the rotor and stator is 1 5 times the chord length of guide vanes table 2 gives the detailed parameters of the rotor blade where l r is the chordwise distance from the leading edge of blade sections to the blade reference line usually the rake and skew of the rotor blade are composed of two parts the initial rake and skew of the blade reference line and the rake and skew in the chordwise direction relative to the blade reference line which is given by l r in the present research object the initial rake and skew of the blade reference line which is perpendicular to the rotor axis of the rotor blade are all zero at all spanwise sections under the design operating condition the inlet flow velocity is 3 m s and the rotor blades rotate at 600 rpm with a speed of 9 72 m s at the blade tip the local reynolds number based on the chord length of blade tip and the inlet flow velocity at the blade tip is 5 8 105 to evaluate the influence of tip clearance on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations in the pump jet propulsor tip clearances of 2 mm and 4 mm along with no tip clearance are also employed all the pump jet propulsors have the same geometric parameters with the pump jet propulsor shown in fig 1 for pump jet propulsor without tip clearance its shroud diameter is slightly reduced to eliminate the tip clearance between rotor blade tip and the inner wall of the shroud and for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 2 mm or 4 mm the shroud diameter is slightly increased in this way the parameters of rotor blades are kept unchanged and hence the possible influence induced by the variation of rotor parameters can be avoided 2 2 meshing the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model menter 1994 combines the advantages of stability of the original k omega turbulence model and independent of the external boundary k ε turbulence model and leads to major improvements in the prediction of adverse pressure gradient flows according to the existing study by ji et al 2010 and huang et al 2010 the sst k omega turbulence model with the sliding mesh technique are employed to simulate the unsteady flows through the pump jet propulsor with and without tip clearance with the commercial code ansys fluent in the present computations considering the rotation of rotor in unsteady flow computation the whole computation domain is separated into two parts as show in fig 2 a namely the rotating domain and the stationary domain the rotating domain is a cylinder around the propeller and the two bottom surfaces of the cylinder which act as the interface of rotating domain and stationary domain are located upstream and downstream of the rotor respectively the stationary domain is a large cylinder that surrounds the geometric model of pump jet propulsor with a diameter much larger than the shroud in general the convergence of computations and the accuracy of computation results are strongly dependent on the quality of the computational meshes both the hexa structured and hybrid unstructured meshes can obtain similar levels of accuracy during numerical simulation of flow field but the hybrid unstructured meshes are less suitable for detailed investigations of the flow field morgut and nobile 2012 because of the complexity of twisted geometry and the efforts of grids generation the hexa structured meshes are combined with the hybrid unstructured meshes to solve the navier stokes equations ji et al 2010 huang et al 2010 as show in figs 2 b and fig 3 the stationary domain is discretized by hexa structured meshes and the rotating domain is discretized by hybrid unstructured meshes considering that the flow fields vary violently near the blade tip a local mesh refinement scheme has been applied to the mesh generation at blade tip because the numerical results of wall pressure fluctuations are very sensitive to the size and quality of near wall meshes boundary layer elements are applied in the solid surface to get the flow and pressure fields near the wall accurately the first layer of boundary layers in the duct and stator blade wall is 0 01 mm with a maximum y of approximately 1 in the stator blades and most areas of the duct wall in some areas at the duct wall near the blade tip the maximum values of y is found slightly greater than 1 about 1 6 but it has little effect on the convergence of the calculation 20 layers of prismatic cells are placed around the rotor blade surface and the thickness of the first layer is 0 002 mm where the value of y is about 1 to evaluate the influence of the grids density on computation results three sets of meshes see in table 3 are selected to conduct the numerical simulation and the variation of unsteady pressures at some arbitrarily selected monitoring points see in fig 5 on rotor blade surface are compared as shown in fig 4 t is the rotor rotation period the comparisons for other monitoring points are similar it is suggested that the grids density of case 2 has shown good convergence even the number of grids increased by 50 percent as in case 3 no more significant changes of the pressure fluctuation curves can be found at both positions considering the balance of the accuracy and the computational efficiency the grids of case2 are employed in the subsequent computations 2 3 boundary conditions as stated in menter 1994 and huang et al 2010 the reliability and the convergence speed of the cfd simulation depends tremendously on the definition of boundary conditions and in this work the parallel algorithm based on a domain decomposition method is adopted to maintain a balance between efficiency and accuracy the inlet of the computation domain is set as velocity inlet boundary condition where the velocity components are set as axial velocity with no radial and circumferential components and the initial turbulence intensity is assumed to be 2 83 with the external diameter of the shroud as the characteristic length in order to reduce the influence of far field boundary of computation domain the same velocity boundary condition with the inlet boundary is also applied to the far field boundary see fig 2 a for the outlet boundary the static pressure outlet boundary condition with a reference pressure of 0 pa is defined no slip boundary condition is applied to solid surfaces such as shroud wall and rotor blades in this way all components of velocity and the normal gradient of static pressure would vanish on solid surfaces in addition the shroud inner wall around the rotor blades in the rotating domain is given a reverse rotational speed which is equal to the rotational speed of the rotational domain relative to the adjacent cell zone to keep the shroud wall absolutely stationary in the absolute coordinate system the overlapped surfaces the interface of the rotating domain and the stationary domain between the stationary and the rotating domain are defined as sliding interfaces in order to exchange the flow field information between the stationary and the rotating domains simultaneously the convergence criterion is set as follows the continuity and velocity residual error are less than 10 4 the energy residual error is less than 10 7 and the relative error of mass flow rate at the inlet and outlet of pump jet propulsor is less than 0 1 in the present work the convergence usually occurs after 3000 steps in steady calculation and for unsteady calculation due to the initial condition is the result of steady calculation the convergence usually occurs after one rotor revolution after the process converges the continuity residual error is less than 10 4 the velocity residual error is close to 10 6 the energy residual error is less than 10 7 and the relative error of mass flow rate is about 0 1 2 4 monitoring points setting to obtain the characteristic of fluctuating pressures on the blade surface six sets of monitoring points are set in the rotor blade fig 5 shows the locations of monitoring points in the rotor blade surfaces for each spanwise section points from ss 1 to ss 5 are the points on suction surface listed from blade leading edge to trailing edge and on the pressure surface there are corresponding points ps 1 to ps 5 in addition the monitoring points are equidistant in the chordwise direction in every spanwise sections the points le and te represent the monitoring points at leading edge and trailing edge respectively 3 experimental verification of the numerical method to assure the reliability and efficiency of the developed numerical model experimental data available for the pump jet propulsor with a tip clearance of 1 mm 0 676 r where r is the radius of the rotor is used to validate the numerical results specially the propulsion performance is tested in the cavitation tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu the cavitation tunnel is composed of a closed loop with a rectangular test section of 1 m 1 m 6 1m as inner dimensions a metal screen is installed in the contraction section upstream of the test section to avoid flow rotation and to reduce the turbulence intensity in general the velocity non uniformity is less than 1 and the turbulence intensity at the inlet of test section is less than 0 5 the maximum free stream velocity at the inlet of test section v is 15 m s the propeller dynamometer is installed downstream the pump jet propulsor model and its maximum revolution speed is 1200 revolutions per minute rpm different from the conventional experiments of propellers the propulsion performance experiment for pump jet propulsor includes the tests of forces acting on both the rotor and the stator as well as the shroud the rotor is fixed on the horizontal axis of propeller dynamometer see in fig 6 and the horizontal thrust and torque acted on the rotor blades can be directly measured in real time in order to measure the resistance acted on stator and shroud a three component balance was installed in the equipment box above the experimental model by a high strength stainless steel rod by using a unified measuring control system the required operating condition could be satisfied easily and the forces acted on the shroud including stator and rotor could be measured simultaneously by the three component balance and the propeller dynamometer for the convenience of expression the non dimensional thrusts and torque can be defined 1 k t r t r ρ n 2 d 4 k t s t s ρ n 2 d 4 k t t r t s ρ n 2 d 4 k t r k t s 10 k q 10 q r ρ n 2 d 5 where t r is the thrust of rotor t s is the thrust resistance in high advance ratio of shroud and stator q r is the rotor toque and ρ n and d represent the fluid density the revolution speed and the rotor diameter respectively and then the efficiency of pump jet propulsor can be defined 2 η 0 t r t s v a 2 π n q j 2 π k t k q where j v a n d is the advance ratio and v a is the inlet velocity the comparison of numerical and experimental results for propulsion performance is shown in fig 7 it is observed that the maximum numerical error of rotor torque relative to the experimental result is 2 7 and those for the thrust on rotor and the thrust on stator blades and shroud are respectively 4 6 and 3 2 relatively small tolerable error illustrates the consistency between the simulation results and the experimental results which demonstrates feasibility of the present numerical calculation 4 results and discussions 4 1 propulsion performance based on the same numerical method fig 8 shows the comparison of propulsion performance for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 0 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm as can be seen the variation trends of performance curves such as dimensionless forces and propulsion efficiency are nearly the same for pump jet propulsor with and without tip clearance unlike conventional highly skewed propellers tian et al 2017 which can only maintain high efficiency in a small range of advance ratio near the design operating point the pump jet propulsor can maintain a very high propulsion efficiency at a large range of advance ratio for both cases with or without tip clearance compared with the case of gap 0 the rotor thrust of the case of gap 1 mm dropped by 6 9 and the rotor torque dropped by 3 5 consequently the propulsion efficiency dropped by about 5 8 at the design operating point for the case of gap 2 mm and gap 4 mm the decrease of rotor thrust and torque is more significant and eventually lead to a more significant reduction of propulsion efficiency relative to case of gap 1 mm however for the resistance of shroud and stator blades the influence of tip clearance is relatively small the existence of tip clearance leads to a significant decrease in rotor thrust and torque but the propulsion efficiency almost remains unchanged at lower advance ratio and decreases significantly at high advance ratio furthermore the four cases all reach the maximum efficiency at about j 1 0 which indicate that the existence of tip clearance and its sizes do not change the advance ratio corresponding to the maximum efficiency point of the propeller 4 2 time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade to investigate the influence of tip clearance on time averaged pressure distributions and pressure fluctuations on rotor blades all unsteady computation results presented are obtained at the design operating point the total time for the unsteady computation is set for the rotor to rotate 6 revolutions after the convergence of computation and the total flow time is 0 6 s the time step is δt 2 10 5 which means that there are 5000 sampling points for every monitoring points for every revolution of the rotor the computation results of propulsion performance show that the existence of tip clearance mainly changes the thrust and torque of the rotor blades and the resistance on shroud and stator blades is almost unchanged therefore the influence of tip clearance on propulsion performance can be explained by the analysis of circumferentially averaged time averaged pressure distributions eq 4 on rotor blade surface fig 9 shows the comparison of dimensionless circumferentially averaged pressure distributions one revolution on rotor blade surface at selected spanwise sections the dimensionless pressure is defined as 3 c p p p 1 2 ρ v a 2 as can be seen from the figure the circumferentially averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade are almost the same in the range of r 0 8r for the four cases however in the range of r 0 8r the pressures on pressure surface for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance are much lower than that on pressure surface for pump jet propulsor without tip clearance and the pressures near the blade trailing edge on suction surface for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance are much lower than that on suction surface for pump jet propulsor without tip clearance but overall the larger the tip clearance size the smaller the pressure difference between pressure surface and suction surface of the rotor blade it shows that the decrease of thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor with tip clearance is mainly caused by the change of circumferentially averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade in the range of 0 8r 1 0r fig 10 shows the instantaneous streamline distributions at the blade tip and fig 11 shows the instantaneous pressure distributions near the blade tip for the case of gap 0 the main flow is free from the influence of gap flow therefore the flow near the blade tip is relatively stable and the streamline distribution is uniform along the blade surface for the case of gap 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm because of the interaction of the gap inverse flow and the main flow the flow near the blade tip is chaotic and partial streamlines shed from the pressure surface to the suction surface near the leading edge of the blade tip and mingle with each other near the blade trailing edge it shows that the fluid near the blade tip flows from the pressure surface to the suction surface under the pressure difference between pressure surface and suction surface thus neutralizing the pressures on both sides of the rotor blade which in turn leads to the significant decrease of pressure difference between pressure surface and suction surface see in fig 11 from fig 9 a c and fig 10 the larger the tip clearance size the more significant decrease of pressure difference between the two sides of the rotor blade see in fig 9 a b in addition for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance the negative pressure is mainly observed at the core area of tip leakage vortex which has an angle of about 15 with the chord direction of blade tip and the larger the tip clearance size the lower the negative pressure at the core area of tip leakage vortex as can be seen from fig 9 a the influence of tip leakage vortices on the circumferentially averaged pressure distributions especially the circumferentially averaged pressures on suction surface near the trailing edge of the blade tip is very significant mainly because the tip leakage vortex is fully formed in the suction surface near the trailing edge of the blade tip 4 3 influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations fig 12 shows the frequency spectrogram of pressure fluctuations at representative monitoring points on blade surface from r r 0 6 to r r 1 0 for the case of gap 0 and gap 1 mm the monitoring points located on the position as given in fig 4 it is observed that the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 1 mm increased significantly at most of the monitoring points compared with the pump jet propulsor without tip clearance especially at the monitoring points located on the leading edge furthermore points le at all selected spanwise sections of pump jet propulsor with or without tip clearance have the biggest amplitudes of fluctuating pressures and it is mainly due to that the points located at the leading edge are affected most significantly by the interaction of rotor and stator it suggests that although the pre swirl stators are generally considered to make the incoming flow more uniform they are also an inducing factors of non uniform flow field for the inflow of rotor blades the stator blade passing frequency fs relative to the rotating coordinate system which is the product of stator numbers ns and the rotor revolution frequency fn are the main frequency of pressure fluctuations on rotor blade for both propulsors although tip clearance significantly increases the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations on the rotor blade surface it does not change the main frequency of these pressure fluctuations the spectrum analysis only gives the local spectrum characteristics of pressure fluctuations at selected monitoring points to reveal the characteristics of pressure fluctuations on the whole blade surface the statistical method which can intuitively show the fluctuation of instantaneous pressures at each grid node is applied to the analysis in present work in general the unsteady pressure at each grid node consists of two parts namely the circumferentially averaged part depending on the location of grid node eq 4 and the fluctuating part changing periodically with the relative position of grid node during the rotation of rotor eq 5 feng et al 2016 4 p r 1 n t i 1 n t p r i δ t 5 p ˆ r t p r t p r where r x r θ is the coordinates of grid nodes in rotating coordinate system n t is the number of time steps for one revolution and δt is the time step used for the computation hence the standard deviation of fluctuating pressure can be defined as eq 6 to evaluate the amount of pressure variation for a serial of fluctuating pressures at each grid node 6 σ r 1 n t i 1 n t p r i δ t p r 2 1 n t i 1 n t p ˆ 2 r i δ t based on the method shown in eq 6 fig 13 and fig 14 give the contour of standard deviation of pressure fluctuations on the whole rotor blade surface colored with the standard deviation of fluctuating pressures the figures plot a detailed information of pressure variations on the rotor blade it is obvious that the standard deviation σ generally increases with the increase of tip clearance sizes on most areas of the blade surface which illustrates that despite the influence of tip clearance on static pressure distributions is mainly focused on the blade tip region the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations works throughout the rotor blade surface in general for the four cases with advance ratio of j 1 0 the standard deviation σ on blade tip and blade leading edge is much larger than that on other areas and the standard deviation σ is larger on the suction surface than that on the pressure surface moreover the standard deviation σ on the blade root increase sharply with the increase of tip clearance mainly because the increasing of tip clearance sizes reduces the effective velocities at the rotor plane according to the calculation result of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade when the tip clearance size increases the blade loads will decrease and in turn leads to the decrease of induced velocities at the rotor plane and thus promotes the evolution of blade root vortices the integral of unsteady pressures along the blade surface is the blade thrust and torque of the rotor the unsteady thrust and torque usually consist of two parts namely the time averaged part eq 7 depending on the operating condition and the fluctuating part eq 8 changing periodically with the rotation of rotor blade the engineering practice shows that the time averaged parts of thrust and torque are presented as the propulsion performance of a pump jet propeller and the fluctuation parts of thrust and torque are usually the main factor inducing the hull vibration for modern underwater vehicles 7 k t r 1 n t i 1 n t f i δ t k q 1 n t i 1 n t m i δ t 8 f x f t k t r m x m t k q where f and m are the dimensionless unsteady thrust and torque of the rotor blade respectively according to eqs 7 and 8 the fluctuation of thrust and torque for a single blade of rotor and their frequency spectra are shown in figs 13 and 14 both the thrust fluctuation amplitudes and torque fluctuation amplitudes increase significantly with the increase the tip clearance sizes and the stator blade passing frequency f s is the main frequency for the case of gap 0 the fluctuation of thrust and torque is relatively regular and the amplitude of the third order frequency is significantly less than that of the first order and second order frequencies however for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance the amplitude of the third order frequency increases significantly with the increase of tip clearance sizes and the amplitude of the third order frequency is approximately equal to the amplitude of the second order frequency for case of gap 2 mm and gap 4 mm it shows that the tip clearance effects do not change the main frequency of thrust and torque fluctuations but it has a significant impact on the amplitudes of fluctuations especially in the higher frequency band f 3fs 5 conclusions this study presents numerical investigation of tip clearance effects on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations of a pump jet propulsor the sst k omega turbulence model based on rans method and the sliding mesh technique are employed to compute the unsteady flow at the design operating point propulsion performance experiment for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 1 mm is also carried out to validate the numerical computation method the propulsion performance of pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm are computed and compared with that without tip clearance the results reveal that although the tip clearance size is very small with respect to the rotor diameter only 0 676 2 7 percent of the rotor radius the reduction of rotor thrust and propulsion efficiency caused by the tip clearance is very significant and especially when the tip clearance size is enlarged these effects will be more significant for the case of gap 1 mm due to the influence of tip clearance the rotor thrust and torque dropped by 6 9 and 3 5 respectively compared with the case of gap 0 and consequently the propulsion efficiency reduced by about 5 8 at the design operating point the decrease of thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor with tip clearance is mainly caused by the change of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade in the range of 0 8r 1 0r and the larger the tip clearance size the more significant decrease of pressure difference between the two sides of the rotor blade the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations can be observed throughout the whole rotor blade surface the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations increase significantly on the rotor blade surface when the tip clearance is enlarged especially on the blade tip blade root and the leading edge but the main frequency of the pressure fluctuations is not affected in addition for thrust and torque fluctuations the tip clearance has magnified greatly the amplitudes of force fluctuations especially in the higher frequency band the amplitudes of thrust and torque fluctuations increase along with the increase of tip clearance sizes and the amplitudes corresponding to the third order fourth order and even the fifth order frequencies are obviously increasing more significant if the tip clearance effects can be eliminated or suppressed effectively the pressure and force fluctuations will decrease

22382,rotor stator interaction and tip clearance between rotor blade tip and shroud of a pump jet propulsor can induce strong pressure fluctuations and vibrations which may cause damage of the propulsion system at some severe working conditions this paper investigates numerically the effects of tip clearance on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations in a pump jet propulsor the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model together with the sliding mesh technique are adopted to simulate the three dimensional unsteady flow the accuracy of the computation results is verified through available experimental data of propulsion performance with a tip clearance of 1 mm the comparison of hydrodynamic performance for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 0 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm shows that the thrust and propulsion efficiency can be reduced significantly due to the increase of tip clearance sizes further results indicate that the decrease of thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor with tip clearance is mainly caused by the change of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade in the range of 0 8r 1 0r where r is the rotor diameter in addition a method based on statistics is applied to reveal the characteristics of pressure fluctuations at all grid nodes on the whole blade surface and the result shows that the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations increase significantly on the blade surface when the tip clearance size is enlarged especially on the blade tip blade root and the leading edge moreover it is found that the tip clearance effects do not change the main frequency of thrust and torque fluctuations while it has a significant impact on the amplitudes of fluctuations especially in the higher frequency band keywords pump jet propulsor tip clearance propulsion performance pressure fluctuation 1 introduction over the past few decades pump jet propulsor pjp has been widely used in underwater vehicles such as torpedoes and submarines owing to its high propulsion efficiency and low noise property at medium and high speed pump jet propulsors are typically composed of a stationary vane system stator a rotating vane system rotor and an axisymmetric shroud completely surrounding the rotor and stator with an airfoil section which prevents the inner noise emitting into the outside flow field bruce et al 1974 furuya and chiang 1986 however the application of shroud around the rotor usually cause a complex problem of tip clearance flow which has a considerable effect on propulsion performance pressure fluctuation vibration and radiated noise of pump jet propulsor liu et al 2018 the tip clearance flow problems such as evolution of tip leakage vortex tlv and flow mechanism in gap region have motivated a lot of experimental and numerical studies liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 limited by the complexity of flow characteristics and mechanical structures many experimental studies on tlv and on the associated cavitation problem focus mainly on the fixed hydrofoil with one end fixed and with a gap near the other end decaix et al 2015 dreyer et al 2014 gopalan et al 2002 guo et al 2016 higashi et al 2002 murayama et al 2005 watanabe et al 2009 based on these experimental studies the flow mechanism in gap region including the flow pattern the temporal and spatial evolution of various vortices and the cavitation characteristics have been well identified further studies on the influence of gap flow point out that tlv and its associated cavitation are very sensitive to the tip clearance size tip geometry surface roughness and its operating environment dreyer et al 2014 gopalan et al 2002 katz and galdo 1989 lei et al 2017 liu and tan 2018 thapa et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 and part of these research results are summarized in liu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 by using numerical simulation methods the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations of pumps and turbines has been extensively investigated zhang et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of pressure fluctuation in a low specific speed mixed flow pump with different tip clearance sizes by using the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model and concluded that the pressure fluctuation in the whole passage of the pump will increase significantly if the gap increases beyond a certain range feng et al 2016 proposed a new method based on pressure statistics to evaluate pressure fluctuations on all grid nodes inside an axial flow pump the result indicated that the gap flow introduces some lower multiples of the rotation frequency to the pressure spectrum and magnifies the pressure fluctuation in the whole impeller region greatly further studies based on numerical simulation show that the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations is ubiquitous in pumps and turbines and this influence varies greatly with the changing of operation conditions such as non cavitation condition or cavitation condition the tip clearance sizes and especially the geometrical construction liu et al 2017 tan et al 2015 xu et al 2017 however different from pumps and turbines the length of axial symmetry shroud of pump jet propulsor is usually finite and thus the flow outside the shroud may interact with the internal flow which leads to more complex flow field and pressure fluctuations several studies have been conducted on the performance and flow characteristics of pump jet propulsors furuya and chiang 1986 combined the streamline curvature method scm with blade to blade flow theory and then proposed a three dimensional design method for pump jet propulsor system by using momentum defect principle for propulsion performance in a wind tunnel facility the performance and the complex inner flow field of a pump jet propulsor for high reynolds number are experimentally studied suryanarayana et al 2010 ahn and kwon 2015 numerically studied the propulsion performance and flow fields of a pump jet propulsor with ring rotor at the blade tip by using an incompressible rans flow solver their results suggested that the addition of tip ring at the blade tip may reduce tip vortex strength without losing any propulsion efficiency even though it could cause a slight drop of thrust tip clearance effect on the propulsion performance of pump jet propulsor have been investigated by using numerical simulation method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model and the simulation results shown that the efficiency of pump jet propulsor drop sharply with the increase of tip clearance size lu et al 2016 in engineering practice the vibration of hull caused by the fluctuations of thrust and torque of the propeller usually contributes most to the radiated noise for underwater vehicles compared with other factors therefore reducing the fluctuations of rotor thrust and torque is of great significance to improve the acoustic radiation performance and the operating stability for underwater vehicles however above mentioned researches mainly focused on propulsion performance and flow characteristics of pump jet propulsors relatively scarce work has been devoted to the effects of tip clearance on the unsteady pressures and forces which have great effects on the operation stability and underwater radiation noise for pump jet propulsors aiming at overcoming the limitations highlighted above this paper contributes a numerical investigation on the influence of the tip clearance on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations in pump jet propulsor by using

experiment conditions of the cavitation tunnel is designed in the present work to explore the influence rule of the tip clearance the basic configuration of the pump jet propulsor consists of three parts an inlet guide vane system stator an impeller rotor and an axisymmetric shroud see in fig 1 the length of the shroud is l 230 mm with an inlet diameter of d 1 316 mm and an outlet diameter of d 2 284 mm the stators have a right turn angle of 7 5 with a chord length of 60 mm the axial distance between the leading edge of shroud and the leading edge of stator blades is 20 mm the detailed parameters of the sections of shroud and stator blade are listed in table 1 where y u and y l are the dimensionless coordinate values of the upper and lower surface for the airfoil in cartesian coordinate system respectively the diameter of the rotor hub is d h 74 mm and the outer diameter of the rotor blades is d r 294 mm with a tip clearance of 1 mm to the inner wall of shroud the rotor has five three dimensional blades equipped with seven guide vanes upstream the rotor the axial distance between the rotor and stator is 1 5 times the chord length of guide vanes table 2 gives the detailed parameters of the rotor blade where l r is the chordwise distance from the leading edge of blade sections to the blade reference line usually the rake and skew of the rotor blade are composed of two parts the initial rake and skew of the blade reference line and the rake and skew in the chordwise direction relative to the blade reference line which is given by l r in the present research object the initial rake and skew of the blade reference line which is perpendicular to the rotor axis of the rotor blade are all zero at all spanwise sections under the design operating condition the inlet flow velocity is 3 m s and the rotor blades rotate at 600 rpm with a speed of 9 72 m s at the blade tip the local reynolds number based on the chord length of blade tip and the inlet flow velocity at the blade tip is 5 8 105 to evaluate the influence of tip clearance on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations in the pump jet propulsor tip clearances of 2 mm and 4 mm along with no tip clearance are also employed all the pump jet propulsors have the same geometric parameters with the pump jet propulsor shown in fig 1 for pump jet propulsor without tip clearance its shroud diameter is slightly reduced to eliminate the tip clearance between rotor blade tip and the inner wall of the shroud and for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 2 mm or 4 mm the shroud diameter is slightly increased in this way the parameters of rotor blades are kept unchanged and hence the possible influence induced by the variation of rotor parameters can be avoided 2 2 meshing the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model menter 1994 combines the advantages of stability of the original k omega turbulence model and independent of the external boundary k ε turbulence model and leads to major improvements in the prediction of adverse pressure gradient flows according to the existing study by ji et al 2010 and huang et al 2010 the sst k omega turbulence model with the sliding mesh technique are employed to simulate the unsteady flows through the pump jet propulsor with and without tip clearance with the commercial code ansys fluent in the present computations considering the rotation of rotor in unsteady flow computation the whole computation domain is separated into two parts as show in fig 2 a namely the rotating domain and the stationary domain the rotating domain is a cylinder around the propeller and the two bottom surfaces of the cylinder which act as the interface of rotating domain and stationary domain are located upstream and downstream of the rotor respectively the stationary domain is a large cylinder that surrounds the geometric model of pump jet propulsor with a diameter much larger than the shroud in general the convergence of computations and the accuracy of computation results are strongly dependent on the quality of the computational meshes both the hexa structured and hybrid unstructured meshes can obtain similar levels of accuracy during numerical simulation of flow field but the hybrid unstructured meshes are less suitable for detailed investigations of the flow field morgut and nobile 2012 because of the complexity of twisted geometry and the efforts of grids generation the hexa structured meshes are combined with the hybrid unstructured meshes to solve the navier stokes equations ji et al 2010 huang et al 2010 as show in figs 2 b and fig 3 the stationary domain is discretized by hexa structured meshes and the rotating domain is discretized by hybrid unstructured meshes considering that the flow fields vary violently near the blade tip a local mesh refinement scheme has been applied to the mesh generation at blade tip because the numerical results of wall pressure fluctuations are very sensitive to the size and quality of near wall meshes boundary layer elements are applied in the solid surface to get the flow and pressure fields near the wall accurately the first layer of boundary layers in the duct and stator blade wall is 0 01 mm with a maximum y of approximately 1 in the stator blades and most areas of the duct wall in some areas at the duct wall near the blade tip the maximum values of y is found slightly greater than 1 about 1 6 but it has little effect on the convergence of the calculation 20 layers of prismatic cells are placed around the rotor blade surface and the thickness of the first layer is 0 002 mm where the value of y is about 1 to evaluate the influence of the grids density on computation results three sets of meshes see in table 3 are selected to conduct the numerical simulation and the variation of unsteady pressures at some arbitrarily selected monitoring points see in fig 5 on rotor blade surface are compared as shown in fig 4 t is the rotor rotation period the comparisons for other monitoring points are similar it is suggested that the grids density of case 2 has shown good convergence even the number of grids increased by 50 percent as in case 3 no more significant changes of the pressure fluctuation curves can be found at both positions considering the balance of the accuracy and the computational efficiency the grids of case2 are employed in the subsequent computations 2 3 boundary conditions as stated in menter 1994 and huang et al 2010 the reliability and the convergence speed of the cfd simulation depends tremendously on the definition of boundary conditions and in this work the parallel algorithm based on a domain decomposition method is adopted to maintain a balance between efficiency and accuracy the inlet of the computation domain is set as velocity inlet boundary condition where the velocity components are set as axial velocity with no radial and circumferential components and the initial turbulence intensity is assumed to be 2 83 with the external diameter of the shroud as the characteristic length in order to reduce the influence of far field boundary of computation domain the same velocity boundary condition with the inlet boundary is also applied to the far field boundary see fig 2 a for the outlet boundary the static pressure outlet boundary condition with a reference pressure of 0 pa is defined no slip boundary condition is applied to solid surfaces such as shroud wall and rotor blades in this way all components of velocity and the normal gradient of static pressure would vanish on solid surfaces in addition the shroud inner wall around the rotor blades in the rotating domain is given a reverse rotational speed which is equal to the rotational speed of the rotational domain relative to the adjacent cell zone to keep the shroud wall absolutely stationary in the absolute coordinate system the overlapped surfaces the interface of the rotating domain and the stationary domain between the stationary and the rotating domain are defined as sliding interfaces in order to exchange the flow field information between the stationary and the rotating domains simultaneously the convergence criterion is set as follows the continuity and velocity residual error are less than 10 4 the energy residual error is less than 10 7 and the relative error of mass flow rate at the inlet and outlet of pump jet propulsor is less than 0 1 in the present work the convergence usually occurs after 3000 steps in steady calculation and for unsteady calculation due to the initial condition is the result of steady calculation the convergence usually occurs after one rotor revolution after the process converges the continuity residual error is less than 10 4 the velocity residual error is close to 10 6 the energy residual error is less than 10 7 and the relative error of mass flow rate is about 0 1 2 4 monitoring points setting to obtain the characteristic of fluctuating pressures on the blade surface six sets of monitoring points are set in the rotor blade fig 5 shows the locations of monitoring points in the rotor blade surfaces for each spanwise section points from ss 1 to ss 5 are the points on suction surface listed from blade leading edge to trailing edge and on the pressure surface there are corresponding points ps 1 to ps 5 in addition the monitoring points are equidistant in the chordwise direction in every spanwise sections the points le and te represent the monitoring points at leading edge and trailing edge respectively 3 experimental verification of the numerical method to assure the reliability and efficiency of the developed numerical model experimental data available for the pump jet propulsor with a tip clearance of 1 mm 0 676 r where r is the radius of the rotor is used to validate the numerical results specially the propulsion performance is tested in the cavitation tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu the cavitation tunnel is composed of a closed loop with a rectangular test section of 1 m 1 m 6 1m as inner dimensions a metal screen is installed in the contraction section upstream of the test section to avoid flow rotation and to reduce the turbulence intensity in general the velocity non uniformity is less than 1 and the turbulence intensity at the inlet of test section is less than 0 5 the maximum free stream velocity at the inlet of test section v is 15 m s the propeller dynamometer is installed downstream the pump jet propulsor model and its maximum revolution speed is 1200 revolutions per minute rpm different from the conventional experiments of propellers the propulsion performance experiment for pump jet propulsor includes the tests of forces acting on both the rotor and the stator as well as the shroud the rotor is fixed on the horizontal axis of propeller dynamometer see in fig 6 and the horizontal thrust and torque acted on the rotor blades can be directly measured in real time in order to measure the resistance acted on stator and shroud a three component balance was installed in the equipment box above the experimental model by a high strength stainless steel rod by using a unified measuring control system the required operating condition could be satisfied easily and the forces acted on the shroud including stator and rotor could be measured simultaneously by the three component balance and the propeller dynamometer for the convenience of expression the non dimensional thrusts and torque can be defined 1 k t r t r ρ n 2 d 4 k t s t s ρ n 2 d 4 k t t r t s ρ n 2 d 4 k t r k t s 10 k q 10 q r ρ n 2 d 5 where t r is the thrust of rotor t s is the thrust resistance in high advance ratio of shroud and stator q r is the rotor toque and ρ n and d represent the fluid density the revolution speed and the rotor diameter respectively and then the efficiency of pump jet propulsor can be defined 2 η 0 t r t s v a 2 π n q j 2 π k t k q where j v a n d is the advance ratio and v a is the inlet velocity the comparison of numerical and experimental results for propulsion performance is shown in fig 7 it is observed that the maximum numerical error of rotor torque relative to the experimental result is 2 7 and those for the thrust on rotor and the thrust on stator blades and shroud are respectively 4 6 and 3 2 relatively small tolerable error illustrates the consistency between the simulation results and the experimental results which demonstrates feasibility of the present numerical calculation 4 results and discussions 4 1 propulsion performance based on the same numerical method fig 8 shows the comparison of propulsion performance for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 0 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm as can be seen the variation trends of performance curves such as dimensionless forces and propulsion efficiency are nearly the same for pump jet propulsor with and without tip clearance unlike conventional highly skewed propellers tian et al 2017 which can only maintain high efficiency in a small range of advance ratio near the design operating point the pump jet propulsor can maintain a very high propulsion efficiency at a large range of advance ratio for both cases with or without tip clearance compared with the case of gap 0 the rotor thrust of the case of gap 1 mm dropped by 6 9 and the rotor torque dropped by 3 5 consequently the propulsion efficiency dropped by about 5 8 at the design operating point for the case of gap 2 mm and gap 4 mm the decrease of rotor thrust and torque is more significant and eventually lead to a more significant reduction of propulsion efficiency relative to case of gap 1 mm however for the resistance of shroud and stator blades the influence of tip clearance is relatively small the existence of tip clearance leads to a significant decrease in rotor thrust and torque but the propulsion efficiency almost remains unchanged at lower advance ratio and decreases significantly at high advance ratio furthermore the four cases all reach the maximum efficiency at about j 1 0 which indicate that the existence of tip clearance and its sizes do not change the advance ratio corresponding to the maximum efficiency point of the propeller 4 2 time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade to investigate the influence of tip clearance on time averaged pressure distributions and pressure fluctuations on rotor blades all unsteady computation results presented are obtained at the design operating point the total time for the unsteady computation is set for the rotor to rotate 6 revolutions after the convergence of computation and the total flow time is 0 6 s the time step is δt 2 10 5 which means that there are 5000 sampling points for every monitoring points for every revolution of the rotor the computation results of propulsion performance show that the existence of tip clearance mainly changes the thrust and torque of the rotor blades and the resistance on shroud and stator blades is almost unchanged therefore the influence of tip clearance on propulsion performance can be explained by the analysis of circumferentially averaged time averaged pressure distributions eq 4 on rotor blade surface fig 9 shows the comparison of dimensionless circumferentially averaged pressure distributions one revolution on rotor blade surface at selected spanwise sections the dimensionless pressure is defined as 3 c p p p 1 2 ρ v a 2 as can be seen from the figure the circumferentially averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade are almost the same in the range of r 0 8r for the four cases however in the range of r 0 8r the pressures on pressure surface for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance are much lower than that on pressure surface for pump jet propulsor without tip clearance and the pressures near the blade trailing edge on suction surface for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance are much lower than that on suction surface for pump jet propulsor without tip clearance but overall the larger the tip clearance size the smaller the pressure difference between pressure surface and suction surface of the rotor blade it shows that the decrease of thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor with tip clearance is mainly caused by the change of circumferentially averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade in the range of 0 8r 1 0r fig 10 shows the instantaneous streamline distributions at the blade tip and fig 11 shows the instantaneous pressure distributions near the blade tip for the case of gap 0 the main flow is free from the influence of gap flow therefore the flow near the blade tip is relatively stable and the streamline distribution is uniform along the blade surface for the case of gap 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm because of the interaction of the gap inverse flow and the main flow the flow near the blade tip is chaotic and partial streamlines shed from the pressure surface to the suction surface near the leading edge of the blade tip and mingle with each other near the blade trailing edge it shows that the fluid near the blade tip flows from the pressure surface to the suction surface under the pressure difference between pressure surface and suction surface thus neutralizing the pressures on both sides of the rotor blade which in turn leads to the significant decrease of pressure difference between pressure surface and suction surface see in fig 11 from fig 9 a c and fig 10 the larger the tip clearance size the more significant decrease of pressure difference between the two sides of the rotor blade see in fig 9 a b in addition for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance the negative pressure is mainly observed at the core area of tip leakage vortex which has an angle of about 15 with the chord direction of blade tip and the larger the tip clearance size the lower the negative pressure at the core area of tip leakage vortex as can be seen from fig 9 a the influence of tip leakage vortices on the circumferentially averaged pressure distributions especially the circumferentially averaged pressures on suction surface near the trailing edge of the blade tip is very significant mainly because the tip leakage vortex is fully formed in the suction surface near the trailing edge of the blade tip 4 3 influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations fig 12 shows the frequency spectrogram of pressure fluctuations at representative monitoring points on blade surface from r r 0 6 to r r 1 0 for the case of gap 0 and gap 1 mm the monitoring points located on the position as given in fig 4 it is observed that the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 1 mm increased significantly at most of the monitoring points compared with the pump jet propulsor without tip clearance especially at the monitoring points located on the leading edge furthermore points le at all selected spanwise sections of pump jet propulsor with or without tip clearance have the biggest amplitudes of fluctuating pressures and it is mainly due to that the points located at the leading edge are affected most significantly by the interaction of rotor and stator it suggests that although the pre swirl stators are generally considered to make the incoming flow more uniform they are also an inducing factors of non uniform flow field for the inflow of rotor blades the stator blade passing frequency fs relative to the rotating coordinate system which is the product of stator numbers ns and the rotor revolution frequency fn are the main frequency of pressure fluctuations on rotor blade for both propulsors although tip clearance significantly increases the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations on the rotor blade surface it does not change the main frequency of these pressure fluctuations the spectrum analysis only gives the local spectrum characteristics of pressure fluctuations at selected monitoring points to reveal the characteristics of pressure fluctuations on the whole blade surface the statistical method which can intuitively show the fluctuation of instantaneous pressures at each grid node is applied to the analysis in present work in general the unsteady pressure at each grid node consists of two parts namely the circumferentially averaged part depending on the location of grid node eq 4 and the fluctuating part changing periodically with the relative position of grid node during the rotation of rotor eq 5 feng et al 2016 4 p r 1 n t i 1 n t p r i δ t 5 p ˆ r t p r t p r where r x r θ is the coordinates of grid nodes in rotating coordinate system n t is the number of time steps for one revolution and δt is the time step used for the computation hence the standard deviation of fluctuating pressure can be defined as eq 6 to evaluate the amount of pressure variation for a serial of fluctuating pressures at each grid node 6 σ r 1 n t i 1 n t p r i δ t p r 2 1 n t i 1 n t p ˆ 2 r i δ t based on the method shown in eq 6 fig 13 and fig 14 give the contour of standard deviation of pressure fluctuations on the whole rotor blade surface colored with the standard deviation of fluctuating pressures the figures plot a detailed information of pressure variations on the rotor blade it is obvious that the standard deviation σ generally increases with the increase of tip clearance sizes on most areas of the blade surface which illustrates that despite the influence of tip clearance on static pressure distributions is mainly focused on the blade tip region the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations works throughout the rotor blade surface in general for the four cases with advance ratio of j 1 0 the standard deviation σ on blade tip and blade leading edge is much larger than that on other areas and the standard deviation σ is larger on the suction surface than that on the pressure surface moreover the standard deviation σ on the blade root increase sharply with the increase of tip clearance mainly because the increasing of tip clearance sizes reduces the effective velocities at the rotor plane according to the calculation result of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade when the tip clearance size increases the blade loads will decrease and in turn leads to the decrease of induced velocities at the rotor plane and thus promotes the evolution of blade root vortices the integral of unsteady pressures along the blade surface is the blade thrust and torque of the rotor the unsteady thrust and torque usually consist of two parts namely the time averaged part eq 7 depending on the operating condition and the fluctuating part eq 8 changing periodically with the rotation of rotor blade the engineering practice shows that the time averaged parts of thrust and torque are presented as the propulsion performance of a pump jet propeller and the fluctuation parts of thrust and torque are usually the main factor inducing the hull vibration for modern underwater vehicles 7 k t r 1 n t i 1 n t f i δ t k q 1 n t i 1 n t m i δ t 8 f x f t k t r m x m t k q where f and m are the dimensionless unsteady thrust and torque of the rotor blade respectively according to eqs 7 and 8 the fluctuation of thrust and torque for a single blade of rotor and their frequency spectra are shown in figs 13 and 14 both the thrust fluctuation amplitudes and torque fluctuation amplitudes increase significantly with the increase the tip clearance sizes and the stator blade passing frequency f s is the main frequency for the case of gap 0 the fluctuation of thrust and torque is relatively regular and the amplitude of the third order frequency is significantly less than that of the first order and second order frequencies however for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance the amplitude of the third order frequency increases significantly with the increase of tip clearance sizes and the amplitude of the third order frequency is approximately equal to the amplitude of the second order frequency for case of gap 2 mm and gap 4 mm it shows that the tip clearance effects do not change the main frequency of thrust and torque fluctuations but it has a significant impact on the amplitudes of fluctuations especially in the higher frequency band f 3fs 5 conclusions this study presents numerical investigation of tip clearance effects on propulsion performance and pressure fluctuations of a pump jet propulsor the sst k omega turbulence model based on rans method and the sliding mesh technique are employed to compute the unsteady flow at the design operating point propulsion performance experiment for pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 1 mm is also carried out to validate the numerical computation method the propulsion performance of pump jet propulsor with tip clearance of 1 mm 2 mm and 4 mm are computed and compared with that without tip clearance the results reveal that although the tip clearance size is very small with respect to the rotor diameter only 0 676 2 7 percent of the rotor radius the reduction of rotor thrust and propulsion efficiency caused by the tip clearance is very significant and especially when the tip clearance size is enlarged these effects will be more significant for the case of gap 1 mm due to the influence of tip clearance the rotor thrust and torque dropped by 6 9 and 3 5 respectively compared with the case of gap 0 and consequently the propulsion efficiency reduced by about 5 8 at the design operating point the decrease of thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor with tip clearance is mainly caused by the change of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade in the range of 0 8r 1 0r and the larger the tip clearance size the more significant decrease of pressure difference between the two sides of the rotor blade the influence of tip clearance on pressure fluctuations can be observed throughout the whole rotor blade surface the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations increase significantly on the rotor blade surface when the tip clearance is enlarged especially on the blade tip blade root and the leading edge but the main frequency of the pressure fluctuations is not affected in addition for thrust and torque fluctuations the tip clearance has magnified greatly the amplitudes of force fluctuations especially in the higher frequency band the amplitudes of thrust and torque fluctuations increase along with the increase of tip clearance sizes and the amplitudes corresponding to the third order fourth order and even the fifth order frequencies are obviously increasing more significant if the tip clearance effects can be eliminated or suppressed effectively the pressure and force fluctuations will decrease

22383,seabed scour induced by a pile supported horizontal axis tidal stream turbine is likely to cause structural instability therefore it s significant to gain an insight into scour process around a tidal stream turbine to make energy harness from tidal stream commercially viable this study experimentally investigates seabed scour around a horizontal axis tidal stream turbine with a mono pile foundation results of the analyses indicate that the existence of a spinning rotor amplifies scour process around the pile due to flow acceleration between blade tip and seabed flow intensity and tip clearance play an important role in effecting the scour process around the turbine model the scour depth generally increases with increasing of flow intensity and decreasing of tip clearance when the flow intensity increases or the tip clearance decreases to a certain value the depth or size of scour hole could increase greatly if the velocity of accelerated flow exceeds the critical velocity of sediment materials compared with flow intensity and tip clearance the impact of distance between rotor and pile seems to be minor based on experimental results empirical equations are proposed for

continuous consumption of fossil fuel has led to serious environmental pollution worldly tidal stream energy has been considered as one of the most promising renewable energy resources to reduce

this is similar to the velocity acceleration occurring between the bottom tip and seabed in the case of a hatsts chen and lam 2014b the boundary effects on characteristics of propeller jets were also extensively investigated by wei et al 2017 and wei and chiew 2019 2018 with the confinement of boundary the propeller jet varies significantly from the unconfined condition and resultantly affects the

between rotor and pile are studied based on experimental results empirical equations are proposed for predicting seabed scour around the hatst the outcomes of this study can help to further understand scour nature of a hatst and may also contribute to its scour protection design 2 experimental set up a series of clear water scour tests have been conducted in a 50 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 8 deep circulating flume with transparent glass walls for visualization the test section is positioned 20 m downstream of the flume inlet after water was pumped into the flume it passes through a honeycomb flow straighter at the upstream end breaking the turbulence structure created from the pump and supply pipes a uniform flow is obtained before it enters the test section the tested turbine consists of a rotor a nacelle and a mono pile all of which are made of stainless steel reasonable tip speed ratio tsr are maintained by the internal friction forces of the device fig 1 shows the set up of experiments with d indicating the rotor diameter d t i p indicating the tip clearance and d r p indicating the clearance between the rotor and pile the turbine model used is a three bladed hatst with a rotor diameter d 0 27 m the diameter of the supporting mono pile d p is 0 027 m the length of nacelle is about 0 8 d with a diameter of 0 04 m a sediment recess 10 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 2 m deep is constructed inside the flume and the turbine model is embedded in the middle of the sediment recess the sediment recess and turbine model are placed in such a domain that the scour process during the experiments is least affected by the inlet and outlet boundary conditions at both the upstream and downstream ends of the sediment recess two inclined plates with a slope of 1 4 are used to fix the sand bed see fig 1 the use of these slopes is to ensure a smooth flow into the test section so that the sediment is not disturbed no sediment transport is observed in the vicinity of the slope during the experiment before carryout of each experiment the sand bed is first leveled carefully using a sand leveler then the flume is filled with water from both upstream and downstream ends at a low rate to prevent disturbance of the leveled sand bed during the experiments scour depth at red points around the pile see fig 2 is recorded manually with the help of scale marks painted on the surface of the mono pile the water depth h 0 54 m above the sand bed is maintained throughout the experiments the sediment used in the experiments is coarse sand with median diameter d 50 0 8 m m and specific gravity of 2 65 the sediment size distribution is near uniform with a geometric standard deviation σ g d 84 d 16 1 32 the critical shear velocity u c 0 0206 m s and mean critical velocity u c r 0 42 m s were determined based on the shields diagram for the respective particle size melville 1997 all experimental conditions are listed in table 1 the mean approach velocity u m e a n is estimated at 0 386 h guan et al 2014 from the vertical velocity profile see fig 3 the reynolds number and froude number are calculated using r e u m e a n h ν and f r u m e a n g h respectively tip speed ratio tsr is estimated by tsr ω d 2 u m e a n where ω is the rotating speed of rotor tsr is about 4 0 throughout the experiments the vertical velocity profile see fig 3 is measured before the turbine model is placed inside the flume it is measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv from seabed to water surface in 2 d upstream of rotor plane the sampling rate is 100 hz throughout the measurements the signal to noise ratio snr is maintained above 15 and the filter is set to remove spikes and data with low correlation more details could be referred to guan et al 2014 during the scouring tests the adv is still put 2 d upstream of rotor plane to monitor the steadiness of approach velocity table 2 summarizes key parameters that are adopted in this study at the end of each test the scour profile around the turbine model is measured using seatek s multiple transducer arrays seatek instrumentation florida this instrument is an ultrasonic ranging system comprising 32 transducers these transducers can detect the distance from the sensors to reflective objects the measuring accuracy of the system is approximately 1 mm a detailed description of this device can be found in guan et al 2016 the transducers are mounted on a carriage that can be moved both along the longitudinal and transverse direction of the flume see fig 4 the system is operated at 5 hz and measurement in the whole scour ron can be finished with half an hour the final resolution of each bed profile is 1 cm 1 cm fig 5 shows details for experimental set up in this study the no 1 case in table 1 with 0 9 flow intensity 0 3 tip clearance and 0 35 rotor pile clearance is conducted three times repeatedly and the temporal scour depth s t is plotted in fig 6 the variation of the final scour depth s d between these three tests is less than 5 which shows the reliability and repeatability of the tests 3 results and discussions experimental results will be presented in this section horizontal edges of scour holes and profiles along the centerline of turbine will be firstly displayed followed by results of temporal variation of scour depth scour process around the turbine model will then be discussed 3 1 horizontal edges of scour hole horizontal edges of scour holes under various conditions are plotted in fig 7 in which the black circle in fig 7 illustrates the location of the monopole the figure shows half the edge of scour holes at the end of each test the origin in the figure indicates the center of supporting mono pile on the initial seabed x indicates distance from the center of mono pile in the stream wise direction and y indicates distance from the center of mono pile in the transverse direction as shown in fig 7 a w h 0 which means the half width of scour hole edge at x 0 increases gradually from 2 2 d p to 3 3 d p when flow intensity increases from 0 71 to 0 83 however when flow intensity increases from 0 83 to 0 90 it sees a large increase w h 0 is about 5 2 d p in the case of 0 9 flow intensity which is about 57 larger than that in the case of 0 83 flow intensity as shown in fig 7 b the scour hole changes slightly with tip clearance varying from 0 1 d to 0 5 d the maximum w h 0 is 5 2 d p at d t i p 0 3 d which is about 18 larger than the minimum w h 0 at d t i p 0 5 d in fig 7 c the size of scour edges with different d r p is similar with a maximum variation of 27 generally the horizontal edges of scour holes increase with increasing of flow intensity tip clearance and rotor pile clearances also affect the edge of scour hole slightly 3 2 scour profiles along the centerline of turbine the final scour profiles along the centerline of tidal turbine under various conditions are plotted in fig 8 s means vertical distance of final seabed from the initial seabed the horizontal dash line indicates the initial seabed and the vertical one indicates the location of supporting pile as shown in fig 8 an adverse slope is formed downstream the pile which is flatter than the upstream slope in fig 8 a it can be clearly seen that the size of scour hole increases with the increasing of flow intensity especially when the flow intensity increases from 0 83 to 0 90 the length of scour hole l p which is defined as the length from the upstream end to the downstream end of the scour hole reaches 12 8 d p in the case of 0 90 flow intensity which is almost 50 larger than that in the case of 0 83 flow intensity as shown in fig 8 b c scour profiles along the centerline of turbine under various tip clearance and rotor pile clearance have a similar size a dune formed behind the turbine can be observed the range of formed dune is closely related to the size of scour hole and is mostly affected by the flow intensity 3 3 temporal variation of scour depth fig 9 illustrates the temporal scour depth s t under different conditions s t is taken as the maximum value among those recorded at the red points in fig 2 during each test for all the tests the scouring rate is pretty low after 36 h testing and it can be reasonably expected that a quasi equilibrium state is reached at the end of each test the majority of scour of all tests occurs in the first 5 h reaching at least 70 of the final scour depth s d as shown in fig 9 a the final scour depth after 36 h testing increases with the increasing of flow intensity it is about 1 3 d p in the case of 0 71 flow intensity and is about 1 8 d p when flow intensity increases to 0 83 when the flow intensity further increases to 0 9 the final scour depth increases greatly by 22 reaching 2 3 d p in fig 9 b it sees that the final scour depth also increases as the tip clearance decreases the temporal development of scour depth could be categorized into two types d t i p 0 3 d and d t i p 0 4 d the final scour depth is 2 2 2 35 d p with d t i p 0 3 d and decreases by 10 to 2 0 d p with d t i p 0 4 d as shown in fig 9 c the final scour depth fluctuates around 2 1 d p with d r p varying from 0 2 d to 0 5 d generally the scour depth development is greatly affected by flow intensity and tip clearance also has significant impacts on it 3 4 scour process the sizes of final scour holes under various conditions are listed in table 3 based on the results above the scour process around the pile foundation of a hatst can be presented in this section the seabed scour around the pile foundation is mainly driven by the horse shoe vortex system which is much like scour at piles sun et al 2018 the existence of an operational rotor complicates the phenomenon flow velocity within the swept area decreases after passing through the turbine rotor due to energy loss and the ambient flow is accelerated as a result of mass conservation besides the flow acceleration also occurs between the turbine rotor and seabed due to boundary constraints chen and lam 2014b the ambient flow acceleration induced by both energy loss and boundary constraints will strengthen the horse shoe vortex around the pile foundation and therefore amplify its scour flow intensity has a significant impact on the scour process around pile foundation of a hatst the size of final scour hole after 36 h testing increases with the increasing of flow intensity and the depth of scour develops in a faster rate with a higher flow intensity this is expectable as higher flow velocity generates stronger horse shoe vortices around the pile and wake vortices in the lee side melville 1975 it s worth noting that a significant increase in both the size and depth of scour hole occurs when flow intensity increases from 0 83 to 0 90 this unexpected increase could be due to flow acceleration between rotor and seabed when the mean approach velocity is close to the critical velocity the flow velocity between rotor and seabed after being accelerated could possibly exceed the critical velocity before reaching the pile resultantly the scour around the pile could behave like a local live bed scour in addition to the horse shoe vortex the scour hole is also affected by the collapse of seabed the horizontal and vertical extent of scour hole develops due to the action of down flow along with the sand bed erosion until reaching the equilibrium state because of this the final size of scour hole increases by 50 60 see figs 7 a and fig 8 a and the scour depth increases by 22 see fig 9 a with flow intensity increasing from 0 83 to 0 9 however when flow intensity is lower than 0 83 the flow velocity between the blade tip and seabed doesn t exceed the critical velocity even after acceleration the sediment before the pile foundation is mainly removed by down flow and the wake vortex removes the bed material in the lee side of pile scour hole no longer develops when down flow cannot remove particles around the pile in addition to the flow intensity tip clearance is also related to the scour process around a hatst its impact on scour induced by a tidal turbine has been studied in chen et al 2017b sun et al 2018 the scour depth is found to increase with decreasing of tip clearance which is consistent with chen et al 2017b and sun et al 2018 flow acceleration beneath the blade tip is more prominent as the tip clearance decreases and the impact of seabed on flow contraction becomes more significant this acceleration enhances the strengths of horse shoe vortices around the pile and therefore amplifying the scouring in addition when the tip clearance decreases to a certain level such as 0 3 d in this study the accelerated flow velocity could exceed the critical velocity and have the scour acting like a local live bed scour this surpassing over critical velocity enlarges the scour depth unexpectedly when the tip clearance decreases from 0 4 d to 0 3 d the final scour depth increases by 20 as shown in table 3 in sun et al 2018 it was found that the scour depth no longer increased when the acceralted flow velocity surpassed the critical velocity however the scour depth is still dependent on the tip clearance even when the accelerated flow velocity is larger than the critical velocity in the current study this could be due to that sun et al 2018 used a vatst instead of a horizontal one in the current study the flow field beneath the turbine rotor is essentially different between these two types of turbines as for the rotor pile clearance its impact on the scour around the pile foundation of a hatst seems minor both the size and depth of scour holes with various rotor pile clearance are close to each other when the rotor pile clearance is small the rotor could be positioned above the scour hole after the scour process starts this make the clearance between blade tip and seabed become larger and larger as the scour develops and the flow acceleration beneath the blade tip could be affected however if the rotor pile clearance is large the impact of flow acceleration beneath the blade tip is also less significant due to wake recovery of the turbine model as listed in table 3 the case of d r p 0 35 d has the maximum scour depth compared with other cases of different d r p nevertheless the impact of rotor pile clearance is still negligible compared with the other two factors in the current study above all the flow intensity and tip clearance are significant in the scour process around the pile foundation of a hatst although the rotor pile clearance is also noteworthy its impacts seems to be minor 4 prediction equations based on experimental results empirical equations will be proposed in this section for predicting the scour around the pile foundation of the hatst the empirical equations includes prediction of scour depth scour profiles along the centerline of turbine and edges of scour hole 4 1 the final scour depth prediction research to date in predicting scour depth around a tidal stream turbine is limited the final scour depth induced by a tidal turbine is assumed to depend on following variables 1 s d f 1 u m e a n d d p d t i p d r p d 50 ρ ρ s g h ν where ρ and ρ s represent density of water and sediment respectively which are considered constant g represents acceleration of gravity and ν is water viscosity as mentioned in l chen et al 2017a hong et al 2013 the fluid viscosity could be neglected when the reynolds number is greater than 10 000 as listed in table 1 the reynolds number of each case is more than 100 000 and therefore the viscosity term is ignored in following analyses besides the effect of rotor pile clearance on scour depth seems to be minor and it is also neglected because this experimental study uses the same sediment bed materials rotor geometry and water depth eq 1 can be simplified to the following dimensionless form 2 s d d p f 2 u m e a n u c r d t i p d p therefore the final scour depth around the tst model is assumed in the following form 3 s d k t i p k i s m a x where k i k t i p are factors of flow intensity and normalized tip clearance respectively and s m a x is the potential maximum scour depth when k i 1 and k t i p 1 fig 10 presents the final scour depth from the experiments with different tip clearance the dash line indicates the final scour depth in the case of single pile see table 1 it clearly shows that the scour depth increases with the decreasing of tip clearance and when tip clearance decreases to 3 d p a significant increase in scour depth occurs this indicates the scour has started acting like a live bed scour due to flow acceleration beneath the blade tip on the other side if the tip clearance continues increasing the impact of turbine becomes less and less significant it can be reasonably expected that the final scour depth would be close to that in the case of single pile if tip clearance is large enough in order to estimate the impact of tip clearance k t i p in eq 3 is defined as k t i p s d s d d t i p 0 3 d then relationship between k t i p and tip clearance can be obtained as shown in fig 11 in which the dash line shows the scour depth in the case of single pile the impact of tip clearance on scour depth is described as linear and quadratic functions respectively when d t i p 3 d p and d t i p 3 d p when d t i p 9 2 d p it predicts a scour depth equal to that in the case of single pile which indicates the impact of turbine is no longer significant therefore k t i p can be proposed as follows 4 k t i p 0 03 d t i p d p 1 09 d t i p d p 3 0 5 k t i p 0 08 d t i p d p 0 71 2 0 77 3 0 d t i p d p 9 2 6 k t i p 0 77 9 2 d t i p d p it should be noted that both the rotor and nacelle are excluded in the case of single pile and the pile is fully immersed underwater however the existence of nacelle in other tests could result in a different horse shoe and wake vortex system as the lower boundary of k t i p 0 77 is determined by the normalized scour depth of the single pile the impact of nacelle is ignored here more researches can be conducted in the future to study its impact besides the threshold value of tip clearance 9 2 d p where the impact of turbine turns to be insignificant is away from the tested range 1 d p 5 d p more data are necessary for its determination anyway caution shall apply in the use of eq 11 13 especially when the tip clearance is beyond 5 d p fig 12 shows the results of final scour depth with flow intensity varying from 0 71 to 0 90 with d t i p 3 d p i e k t i p 1 from the best fitting line through the data results the maximum scour depth s m a x that could reasonably be expected from this experimental set up is 2 65 d p with flow intensity equal to 1 besides flow intensity for the initiation of scour around the tst model is estimated 0 42 by considering s d 0 this value to initiate the scour around the tst could be closely related to the pile diameter and sediment materials by normalizing the scour depth against s m a x the equation for k i can be obtained 7 k i 1 71 u m e a n u c r 0 71 0 42 u m e a n u c r 1 the empirical equation for predicting the final scour depth is then obtain as 8 s d d p 2 65 k t i p k i a comparison of the measured final scour depth and estimated scour depth is shown in fig 13 the root mean square error rmse of the estimated s d in eq 8 is 2 03 mm which confirms the accuracy of the empirical equation 4 2 prediction of scour profiles along the centerline of turbine fig 14 presents the scour profiles along the centerline of the turbine in the dimensionless coordinate x ˆ z ˆ where x ˆ x l p and z ˆ s s d as plotted in fig 14 the data collapse into one curve and separated into two parts by the pile in order to describe the scour profiles along the centerline of the turbine model the measured dimensionless scour profiles are compared with three independently polynomials as follows 9 z ˆ a 3 x ˆ 3 a 2 x ˆ 2 a 1 x ˆ a 0 x ˆ 0 10 z ˆ b 3 x ˆ 3 b 2 x ˆ 2 b 1 x ˆ b 0 x ˆ 0 where a 0 3 and b 0 3 are coefficients the scour profiles can be fitted by the least square method and the boundary condition x ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 shall be satisfied then one can obtain the empirical equations as follows 11 z ˆ 0 4 x ˆ 3 0 3 x ˆ 2 1 4 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 0 12 z ˆ 35 4 x ˆ 3 20 9 x ˆ 2 1 x ˆ 0 s d can be obtained from eq 8 and l p is assumed to be in a linear relationship with s d as shown in fig 15 fig 16 shows a comparison of scour profiles with the main scour hole profile induced by a propeller hamill 1987 hong et al 2013 in the dimensionless coordinate x ˆ z ˆ as there is no pile in hamill 1987 hong et al 2013 x ˆ 0 indicates the location of maximum scour depth as shown in fig 16 the profile of scour hole induced by propeller is nearly symmetry about x ˆ 0 however for the profile around the hatst it is asymmetry with a steeper slope in the upstream of the pile and a flatter slope in the downstream this difference between their scour profiles is reasonable for a propeller scour occurs mainly due to the jet flow and its induced high shear force between the propeller and seabed however for a pile supported hatst the scour is much like a pier subjected to an accelerated flow this accelerated flow strengthens the horse shoe vortex around the pile foundation of the hatst and amplifies its scour 4 3 prediction of edge of scour holes fig 17 shows the edge of scour hole in the dimensionless coordinate x ˆ y ˆ where y ˆ y w h 0 similar to scour profiles along the centerline of turbine the dimensionless edge profiles can be fitted using cubic polynomials as follows 13 y ˆ 2 7 x ˆ 3 4 x ˆ 2 1 3 x ˆ 1 y ˆ 0 w h 0 can be fitted by linear function against s d as shown in fig 18 5 conclusions the presence of rotor amplifies the scour process around the pile foundation of a hatst this amplification of scour is due to flow acceleration between turbine rotor and seabed both flow intensity and tip clearance play an important role in affecting the scour while the impact of rotor pile clearance is relatively insignificant generally the size of scour holes increases with increasing of flow intensity and decreasing of tip clearance in this study the maximum scour depth occurs in the case of 0 9 flow intensity and 0 1 d tip clearance and the least scour depth occurs in the case of 0 71 flow intensity when flow intensity is large enough or the tip clearance is low enough the accelerated flow velocity beneath the blade tip could possibly exceed the critical velocity and introduce a significant increase in the scour depth based on experimental results empirical equations are proposed for prediction of scour around the pile foundation of a hatst the factor of flow intensity k i and tip clearance k t i p are obtained in addition equations are also proposed for prediction of scour profiles along centerline of turbine and edge of scour holes the proposed empirical equations are capable of giving a general description of scour around the pile supported hatst in the current study the present of nacelle could result in horse shoe vortices and wake vortices different from that formed around a bridge pier pile in future research works it is suggested to investigate its impact on seabed scour around hatsts as well as

22383,seabed scour induced by a pile supported horizontal axis tidal stream turbine is likely to cause structural instability therefore it s significant to gain an insight into scour process around a tidal stream turbine to make energy harness from tidal stream commercially viable this study experimentally investigates seabed scour around a horizontal axis tidal stream turbine with a mono pile foundation results of the analyses indicate that the existence of a spinning rotor amplifies scour process around the pile due to flow acceleration between blade tip and seabed flow intensity and tip clearance play an important role in effecting the scour process around the turbine model the scour depth generally increases with increasing of flow intensity and decreasing of tip clearance when the flow intensity increases or the tip clearance decreases to a certain value the depth or size of scour hole could increase greatly if the velocity of accelerated flow exceeds the critical velocity of sediment materials compared with flow intensity and tip clearance the impact of distance between rotor and pile seems to be minor based on experimental results empirical equations are proposed for

continuous consumption of fossil fuel has led to serious environmental pollution worldly tidal stream energy has been considered as one of the most promising renewable energy resources to reduce environmental pollution and ease energy shortages løvdal and neumann 2011 mejia olivares et al 2018 compared with other sustainable resources tidal stream energy has advantages of high density wide distribution as well as high predictability lamy and azevedo 2018 interest in the development of tidal stream energy has been growing worldwide over the past years guillou et al 2016 robins et al 2015 work et al 2013 horizontal axis tidal stream turbines hatsts has been widely used to harness energy from tidal stream a deep understanding into environmental impacts of hatsts is important to make hatsts commercially viable ahmadian et al 2012 copping et al 2014 the impact of structures on seabed scouring is one of the most significant issues that need to be addressed when applying these structures azamathulla et al 2011 sharafati et al 2018 in the field for a hatst local scour around the supporting pile is likely to cause structural instability chen and lam 2014a however the underpinning scour mechanisms would be pretty complicated as it involves the combination of a pile and a moving rotor ramírez mendoza et al 2018 a number of researches have been carried out to study scour around a pile or pier in the past years melville and chiew 1999 studied the maximum scour depth development for a given pier sediment and approaching flow velocity sumer and fredsoe 2001 experimentally investigated local scour around piers under combined wave and currents kothyari and kumar 2010 improved an existing model to predict temporal variation of scour depth using data from experiments and field investigation khosronejad et al 2012 studied scour around piers with different cross sectional shapes both experimentally and numerically hong et al 2017 investigated the scour

flow field in a developing clear water scour hole at a circular pier guan et al 2019a investigated scour mechanics of current induced scour at mono pile subjected to lateral vibrations more mathematical methods have been proposed for predicting scour depth around piles piers in the past decades guven et al 2009 developed a linear genetic programming model for prediction of scour depth

2009 and ebtehaj et al 2018 used artificial intelligence techniques to predict scour around piers based on a large number of sample data researches on scour around a pier or pile can lay a solid foundation for studying the seabed scour around a mono pile supported hatst in addition to scour around piers or piles scour induced by propeller wash hong et al 2013 can also be references for scour around hatsts lam et al 2013 studied initial wash profiles from a ship propeller using cfd method lam and chen 2014 and lam et al 2015 further proposed analytical models to predict wake characteristics of hatsts based on the fundamental works of ship propeller wash johnston et al 2013 found the axial velocity near the boundary was significantly increased with a propeller presented this is similar to the velocity acceleration occurring between the bottom tip and seabed in the case of a hatsts chen and lam 2014b the boundary effects on characteristics of propeller jets were also extensively investigated by wei et al 2017 and wei and chiew 2019 2018 with the confinement of boundary the propeller jet varies significantly from the unconfined condition and resultantly affects the seabed scouring process wei et al 2018 wei and chiew 2017 the wake of a hatst shares similarities especially in the induced swirl flow and the wake mixing with ambient flow with a propeller jet lam and chen 2014 lam et al 2015 thus the researches on propeller can provide significant insights for hatst induced scour chen and lam 2014a the existence of a spinning rotor would change the boundary layer profile and consequently alter the horse shoe vortex making the seabed scour phenomenon more complex sun et al 2018 the investigation of flow field around a hatst is an initial input to study seabed scour around the hatst stallard et al 2013 measured three dimensional velocities in the wake of a turbine model and found the linear expansion of the shear layer in the near wake tedds et al 2014 experimentally investigated near wake characteristics of a hatst a strongly anisotropic turbulence filed behind the turbine was observed ramirez mendoza et al 2015 studied the wake s vertical profiles using a turbine rotor fixed over a mobile seabed a detailed measurement in the wake of a tidal stream turbine was conducted by chen et al 2017b in which the authors claimed that the support structure effect should not be neglected when the near wake characteristics were of interest to date researches that focus on scour process around tidal stream turbines are still limited hill et al 2014 experimentally investigated scour around tidal stream turbines under both clear water and live bed conditions the authors found that scour depth were amplified under live bed conditions compared to clear water conditions chen and lam 2014b proposed potential equations to predict scour induced by tidal stream turbines and suggested considering rotor effects into existing equations for future researches zhang et al 2015 developed a mathematical model numerically investigating the fluid structure interaction and its induced scour process around a hatst chen et al 2017b studied impacts of tip clearance on seabed scour process using laboratory experiments and found that scour depth increased with a decreasing tip clearance ramírez mendoza et al 2018 investigated sediment behavior with a hatst installed above a mobile sediment bed in which a horse shoe shaped scour pit was observed in the near wake ron and a depositional heap was formed in the far wake sun et al 2018 investigated scour process around a vertical axis tidal stream turbine vatst and proposed empirical models for prediction of scour depth and scour profiles previous researches mainly focused on impacts of seabed conditions or tip clearance on scour process around tidal turbines however flow field around a turbine can be affected by others factors such as approaching flow velocity or the clearance between a turbine rotor and its supporting pile in this study laboratory experiments are carried out to investigate scour process around a model hatst impacts of flow intensity tip clearance and clearance between rotor and pile are studied based on experimental results empirical equations are proposed for predicting seabed scour around the hatst the outcomes of this study can help to further understand scour nature of a hatst and may also contribute to its scour protection design 2 experimental set up a series of clear water scour tests have been conducted in a 50 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 8 deep circulating flume with transparent glass walls for visualization the test section is positioned 20 m downstream of the flume inlet after water was pumped into the flume it passes through a honeycomb flow straighter at the upstream end breaking the turbulence structure created from the pump and supply pipes a uniform flow is obtained before it enters the test section the tested turbine consists of a rotor a nacelle and a mono pile all of which are made of stainless steel reasonable tip speed ratio tsr are maintained by the internal friction forces of the device fig 1 shows the set up of experiments with d indicating the rotor diameter d t i p indicating the tip clearance and d r p indicating the clearance between the rotor and pile the turbine model used is a three bladed hatst with a rotor diameter d 0 27 m the diameter of the supporting mono pile d p is 0 027 m the length of nacelle is about 0 8 d with a diameter of 0 04 m a sediment recess 10 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 2 m deep is constructed inside the flume and the turbine model is embedded in the middle of the sediment recess the sediment recess and turbine model are placed in such a domain that the scour process during the experiments is least affected by the inlet and outlet boundary conditions at both the upstream and downstream ends of the sediment recess two inclined plates with a slope of 1 4 are used to fix the sand bed see fig 1 the use of these slopes is to ensure a smooth flow into the test section so that the sediment is not disturbed no sediment transport is observed in the vicinity of the slope during the experiment before carryout of each experiment the sand bed is first leveled carefully using a sand leveler then the flume is filled with water from both upstream and downstream ends at a low rate to prevent disturbance of the leveled sand bed during the experiments scour depth at red points around the pile see fig 2 is recorded manually with the help of scale marks painted on the surface of the mono pile the water depth h 0 54 m above the sand bed is maintained throughout the experiments the sediment used in the experiments is coarse sand with median diameter d 50 0 8 m m and specific gravity of 2 65 the sediment size distribution is near uniform with a geometric standard deviation σ g d 84 d 16 1 32 the critical shear velocity u c 0 0206 m s and mean critical velocity u c r 0 42 m s were determined based on the shields diagram for the respective particle size melville 1997 all experimental conditions are listed in table 1 the mean approach velocity u m e a n is estimated at 0 386 h guan et al 2014 from the vertical velocity profile see fig 3 the reynolds number and froude number are calculated using r e u m e a n h ν and f r u m e a n g h respectively tip speed ratio tsr is estimated by tsr ω d 2 u m e a n where ω is the rotating speed of rotor tsr is about 4 0 throughout the experiments the vertical velocity profile see fig 3 is measured before the turbine model is placed inside the flume it is measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv from seabed to water surface in 2 d upstream of rotor plane the sampling rate is 100 hz throughout the measurements the signal to noise ratio snr is maintained above 15 and the filter is set to remove spikes and data with low correlation more details could be referred to guan et al 2014 during the scouring tests the adv is still put 2 d upstream of rotor plane to monitor the steadiness of approach velocity table 2 summarizes key parameters that are adopted in this study at the end of each test the scour profile around the turbine model is measured using seatek s multiple transducer arrays seatek instrumentation florida this instrument is an ultrasonic ranging system comprising 32 transducers these transducers can detect the distance from the sensors to reflective objects the measuring accuracy of the system is approximately 1 mm a detailed description of this device can be found in guan et al 2016 the transducers are mounted on a carriage that can be moved both along the longitudinal and transverse direction of the flume see fig 4 the system is operated at 5 hz and measurement in the whole scour ron can be finished with half an hour the final resolution of each bed profile is 1 cm 1 cm fig 5 shows details for experimental set up in this study the no 1 case in table 1 with 0 9 flow intensity 0 3 tip clearance and 0 35 rotor pile clearance is conducted three times repeatedly and the temporal scour depth s t is plotted in fig 6 the variation of the final scour depth s d between these three tests is less than 5 which shows the reliability and repeatability of the tests 3 results and discussions experimental results will be presented in this section horizontal edges of scour holes and profiles along the centerline of turbine will be firstly displayed followed by results of temporal variation of scour depth scour process around the turbine model will then be discussed 3 1 horizontal edges of scour hole horizontal edges of scour holes under various conditions are plotted in fig 7 in which the black circle in fig 7 illustrates the location of the monopole the figure shows half the edge of scour holes at the end of each test the origin in the figure indicates the center of supporting mono pile on the initial seabed x indicates distance from the center of mono pile in the stream wise direction and y indicates distance from the center of mono pile in the transverse direction as shown in fig 7 a w h 0 which means the half width of scour hole edge at x 0 increases gradually from 2 2 d p to 3 3 d p when flow intensity increases from 0 71 to 0 83 however when flow intensity increases from 0 83 to 0 90 it sees a large increase w h 0 is about 5 2 d p in the case of 0 9 flow intensity which is about 57 larger than that in the case of 0 83 flow intensity as shown in fig 7 b the scour hole changes slightly with tip clearance varying from 0 1 d to 0 5 d the maximum w h 0 is 5 2 d p at d t i p 0 3 d which is about 18 larger than the minimum w h 0 at d t i p 0 5 d in fig 7 c the size of scour edges with different d r p is similar with a maximum variation of 27 generally the horizontal edges of scour holes increase with increasing of flow intensity tip clearance and rotor pile clearances also affect the edge of scour hole slightly 3 2 scour profiles along the centerline of turbine the final scour profiles along the centerline of tidal turbine under various conditions are plotted in fig 8 s means vertical distance of final seabed from the initial seabed the horizontal dash line indicates the initial seabed and the vertical one indicates the location of supporting pile as shown in fig 8 an adverse slope is formed downstream the pile which is flatter than the upstream slope in fig 8 a it can be clearly seen that the size of scour hole increases with the increasing of flow intensity especially when the flow intensity increases from 0 83 to 0 90 the length of scour hole l p which is defined as the length from the upstream end to the downstream end of the scour hole reaches 12 8 d p in the case of 0 90 flow intensity which is almost 50 larger than that in the case of 0 83 flow intensity as shown in fig 8 b c scour profiles along the centerline of turbine under various tip clearance and rotor pile clearance have a similar size a dune formed behind the turbine can be observed the range of formed dune is closely related to the size of scour hole and is mostly affected by the flow intensity 3 3 temporal variation of scour depth fig 9 illustrates the temporal scour depth s t under different conditions s t is taken as the maximum value among those recorded at the red points in fig 2 during each test for all the tests the scouring rate is pretty low after 36 h testing and it can be reasonably expected that a quasi equilibrium state is reached at the end of each test the majority of scour of all tests occurs in the first 5 h reaching at least 70 of the final scour depth s d as shown in fig 9 a the final scour depth after 36 h testing increases with the increasing of flow intensity it is about 1 3 d p in the case of 0 71 flow intensity and is about 1 8 d p when flow intensity increases to 0 83 when the flow intensity further increases to 0 9 the final scour depth increases greatly by 22 reaching 2 3 d p in fig 9 b it sees that the final scour depth also increases as the tip clearance decreases the temporal development of scour depth could be categorized into two types d t i p 0 3 d and d t i p 0 4 d the final scour depth is 2 2 2 35 d p with d t i p 0 3 d and decreases by 10 to 2 0 d p with d t i p 0 4 d as shown in fig 9 c the final scour depth fluctuates around 2 1 d p with d r p varying from 0 2 d to 0 5 d generally the scour depth development is greatly affected by flow intensity and tip clearance also has significant impacts on it 3 4 scour process the sizes of final scour holes under various conditions are listed in table 3 based on the results above the scour process around the pile foundation of a hatst can be presented in this section the seabed scour around the pile foundation is mainly driven by the horse shoe vortex system which is much like scour at piles sun et al 2018 the existence of an operational rotor complicates the phenomenon flow velocity within the swept area decreases after passing through the turbine rotor due to energy loss and the ambient flow is accelerated as a result of mass conservation besides the flow acceleration also occurs between the turbine rotor and seabed due to boundary constraints chen and lam 2014b the ambient flow acceleration induced by both energy loss and boundary constraints will strengthen the horse shoe vortex around the pile foundation and therefore amplify its scour flow intensity has a significant impact on the scour process around pile foundation of a hatst the size of final scour hole after 36 h testing increases with the increasing of flow intensity and the depth of scour develops in a faster rate with a higher flow intensity this is expectable as higher flow velocity generates stronger horse shoe vortices around the pile and wake vortices in the lee side melville 1975 it s worth noting that a significant increase in both the size and depth of scour hole occurs when flow intensity increases from 0 83 to 0 90 this unexpected increase could be due to flow acceleration between rotor and seabed when the mean approach velocity is close to the critical velocity the flow velocity between rotor and seabed after being accelerated could possibly exceed the critical velocity before reaching the pile resultantly the scour around the pile could behave like a local live bed scour in addition to the horse shoe vortex the scour hole is also affected by the collapse of seabed the horizontal and vertical extent of scour hole develops due to the action of down flow along with the sand bed erosion until reaching the equilibrium state because of this the final size of scour hole increases by 50 60 see figs 7 a and fig 8 a and the scour depth increases by 22 see fig 9 a with flow intensity increasing from 0 83 to 0 9 however when flow intensity is lower than 0 83 the flow velocity between the blade tip and seabed doesn t exceed the critical velocity even after acceleration the sediment before the pile foundation is mainly removed by down flow and the wake vortex removes the bed material in the lee side of pile scour hole no longer develops when down flow cannot remove particles around the pile in addition to the flow intensity tip clearance is also related to the scour process around a hatst its impact on scour induced by a tidal turbine has been studied in chen et al 2017b sun et al 2018 the scour depth is found to increase with decreasing of tip clearance which is consistent with chen et al 2017b and sun et al 2018 flow acceleration beneath the blade tip is more prominent as the tip clearance decreases and the impact of seabed on flow contraction becomes more significant this acceleration enhances the strengths of horse shoe vortices around the pile and therefore amplifying the scouring in addition when the tip clearance decreases to a certain level such as 0 3 d in this study the accelerated flow velocity could exceed the critical velocity and have the scour acting like a local live bed scour this surpassing over critical velocity enlarges the scour depth unexpectedly when the tip clearance decreases from 0 4 d to 0 3 d the final scour depth increases by 20 as shown in table 3 in sun et al 2018 it was found that the scour depth no longer increased when the acceralted flow velocity surpassed the critical velocity however the scour depth is still dependent on the tip clearance even when the accelerated flow velocity is larger than the critical velocity in the current study this could be due to that sun et al 2018 used a vatst instead of a horizontal one in the current study the flow field beneath the turbine rotor is essentially different between these two types of turbines as for the rotor pile clearance its impact on the scour around the pile foundation of a hatst seems minor both the size and depth of scour holes with various rotor pile clearance are close to each other when the rotor pile clearance is small the rotor could be positioned above the scour hole after the scour process starts this make the clearance between blade tip and seabed become larger and larger as the scour develops and the flow acceleration beneath the blade tip could be affected however if the rotor pile clearance is large the impact of flow acceleration beneath the blade tip is also less significant due to wake recovery of the turbine model as listed in table 3 the case of d r p 0 35 d has the maximum scour depth compared with other cases of different d r p nevertheless the impact of rotor pile clearance is still negligible compared with the other two factors in the current study above all the flow intensity and tip clearance are significant in the scour process around the pile foundation of a hatst although the rotor pile clearance is also noteworthy its impacts seems to be minor 4 prediction equations based on experimental results empirical equations will be proposed in this section for predicting the scour around the pile foundation of the hatst the empirical equations includes prediction of scour depth scour profiles along the centerline of turbine and edges of scour hole 4 1 the final scour depth prediction research to date in predicting scour depth around a tidal stream turbine is limited the final scour depth induced by a tidal turbine is assumed to depend on following variables 1 s d f 1 u m e a n d d p d t i p d r p d 50 ρ ρ s g h ν where ρ and ρ s represent density of water and sediment respectively which are considered constant g represents acceleration of gravity and ν is water viscosity as mentioned in l chen et al 2017a hong et al 2013 the fluid viscosity could be neglected when the reynolds number is greater than 10 000 as listed in table 1 the reynolds number of each case is more than 100 000 and therefore the viscosity term is ignored in following analyses besides the effect of rotor pile clearance on scour depth seems to be minor and it is also neglected because this experimental study uses the same sediment bed materials rotor geometry and water depth eq 1 can be simplified to the following dimensionless form 2 s d d p f 2 u m e a n u c r d t i p d p therefore the final scour depth around the tst model is assumed in the following form 3 s d k t i p k i s m a x where k i k t i p are factors of flow intensity and normalized tip clearance respectively and s m a x is the potential maximum scour depth when k i 1 and k t i p 1 fig 10 presents the final scour depth from the experiments with different tip clearance the dash line indicates the final scour depth in the case of single pile see table 1 it clearly shows that the scour depth increases with the decreasing of tip clearance and when tip clearance decreases to 3 d p a significant increase in scour depth occurs this indicates the scour has started acting like a live bed scour due to flow acceleration beneath the blade tip on the other side if the tip clearance continues increasing the impact of turbine becomes less and less significant it can be reasonably expected that the final scour depth would be close to that in the case of single pile if tip clearance is large enough in order to estimate the impact of tip clearance k t i p in eq 3 is defined as k t i p s d s d d t i p 0 3 d then relationship between k t i p and tip clearance can be obtained as shown in fig 11 in which the dash line shows the scour depth in the case of single pile the impact of tip clearance on scour depth is described as linear and quadratic functions respectively when d t i p 3 d p and d t i p 3 d p when d t i p 9 2 d p it predicts a scour depth equal to that in the case of single pile which indicates the impact of turbine is no longer significant therefore k t i p can be proposed as follows 4 k t i p 0 03 d t i p d p 1 09 d t i p d p 3 0 5 k t i p 0 08 d t i p d p 0 71 2 0 77 3 0 d t i p d p 9 2 6 k t i p 0 77 9 2 d t i p d p it should be noted that both the rotor and nacelle are excluded in the case of single pile and the pile is fully immersed underwater however the existence of nacelle in other tests could result in a different horse shoe and wake vortex system as the lower boundary of k t i p 0 77 is determined by the normalized scour depth of the single pile the impact of nacelle is ignored here more researches can be conducted in the future to study its impact besides the threshold value of tip clearance 9 2 d p where the impact of turbine turns to be insignificant is away from the tested range 1 d p 5 d p more data are necessary for its determination anyway caution shall apply in the use of eq 11 13 especially when the tip clearance is beyond 5 d p fig 12 shows the results of final scour depth with flow intensity varying from 0 71 to 0 90 with d t i p 3 d p i e k t i p 1 from the best fitting line through the data results the maximum scour depth s m a x that could reasonably be expected from this experimental set up is 2 65 d p with flow intensity equal to 1 besides flow intensity for the initiation of scour around the tst model is estimated 0 42 by considering s d 0 this value to initiate the scour around the tst could be closely related to the pile diameter and sediment materials by normalizing the scour depth against s m a x the equation for k i can be obtained 7 k i 1 71 u m e a n u c r 0 71 0 42 u m e a n u c r 1 the empirical equation for predicting the final scour depth is then obtain as 8 s d d p 2 65 k t i p k i a comparison of the measured final scour depth and estimated scour depth is shown in fig 13 the root mean square error rmse of the estimated s d in eq 8 is 2 03 mm which confirms the accuracy of the empirical equation 4 2 prediction of scour profiles along the centerline of turbine fig 14 presents the scour profiles along the centerline of the turbine in the dimensionless coordinate x ˆ z ˆ where x ˆ x l p and z ˆ s s d as plotted in fig 14 the data collapse into one curve and separated into two parts by the pile in order to describe the scour profiles along the centerline of the turbine model the measured dimensionless scour profiles are compared with three independently polynomials as follows 9 z ˆ a 3 x ˆ 3 a 2 x ˆ 2 a 1 x ˆ a 0 x ˆ 0 10 z ˆ b 3 x ˆ 3 b 2 x ˆ 2 b 1 x ˆ b 0 x ˆ 0 where a 0 3 and b 0 3 are coefficients the scour profiles can be fitted by the least square method and the boundary condition x ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 shall be satisfied then one can obtain the empirical equations as follows 11 z ˆ 0 4 x ˆ 3 0 3 x ˆ 2 1 4 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 0 12 z ˆ 35 4 x ˆ 3 20 9 x ˆ 2 1 x ˆ 0 s d can be obtained from eq 8 and l p is assumed to be in a linear relationship with s d as shown in fig 15 fig 16 shows a comparison of scour profiles with the main scour hole profile induced by a propeller hamill 1987 hong et al 2013 in the dimensionless coordinate x ˆ z ˆ as there is no pile in hamill 1987 hong et al 2013 x ˆ 0 indicates the location of maximum scour depth as shown in fig 16 the profile of scour hole induced by propeller is nearly symmetry about x ˆ 0 however for the profile around the hatst it is asymmetry with a steeper slope in the upstream of the pile and a flatter slope in the downstream this difference between their scour profiles is reasonable for a propeller scour occurs mainly due to the jet flow and its induced high shear force between the propeller and seabed however for a pile supported hatst the scour is much like a pier subjected to an accelerated flow this accelerated flow strengthens the horse shoe vortex around the pile foundation of the hatst and amplifies its scour 4 3 prediction of edge of scour holes fig 17 shows the edge of scour hole in the dimensionless coordinate x ˆ y ˆ where y ˆ y w h 0 similar to scour profiles along the centerline of turbine the dimensionless edge profiles can be fitted using cubic polynomials as follows 13 y ˆ 2 7 x ˆ 3 4 x ˆ 2 1 3 x ˆ 1 y ˆ 0 w h 0 can be fitted by linear function against s d as shown in fig 18 5 conclusions the presence of rotor amplifies the scour process around the pile foundation of a hatst this amplification of scour is due to flow acceleration between turbine rotor and seabed both flow intensity and tip clearance play an important role in affecting the scour while the impact of rotor pile clearance is relatively insignificant generally the size of scour holes increases with increasing of flow intensity and decreasing of tip clearance in this study the maximum scour depth occurs in the case of 0 9 flow intensity and 0 1 d tip clearance and the least scour depth occurs in the case of 0 71 flow intensity when flow intensity is large enough or the tip clearance is low enough the accelerated flow velocity beneath the blade tip could possibly exceed the critical velocity and introduce a significant increase in the scour depth based on experimental results empirical equations are proposed for prediction of scour around the pile foundation of a hatst the factor of flow intensity k i and tip clearance k t i p are obtained in addition equations are also proposed for prediction of scour profiles along centerline of turbine and edge of scour holes the proposed empirical equations are capable of giving a general description of scour around the pile supported hatst in the current study the present of nacelle could result in horse shoe vortices and wake vortices different from that formed around a bridge pier pile in future research works it is suggested to investigate its impact on seabed scour around hatsts as well as

22384,air injection artificial upwelling is considered as a way to promote the growth of phytoplankton and improve carbon sequestration some air injection artificial upwelling systems have been established such as in norway and china however one of major obstacles for large scale field application is lack of theoretical model to predict the effect of bubble entrained plume s bep influence factors which is helpful to control bubble entrained plumes design the air injection system and improve the efficiency of air injection system in this paper a theoretical model is proposed to predict the maximum height of bep and effect of bep s influence factors to validate the theoretical model laboratory experiments were conducted in a circulating water flume the results show that the theoretical approach can be used to calculate critical parameters of air injection artificial upwelling system such as beps maximum height design volume flow rate of air injection efficiency of air injection system and so on by using the theoretical result to design air injection system and predict the optimal air injection volume flow rate the system can adopt to almost all velocity conditions in field application and the efficiency of air injection system has an improvement about 8 33 12 38 which makes the system feasible and efficient in the usage keywords artificial upwelling bubble entrained plumes crossflow air injection density difference 1 introduction artificial upwelling is a sustainable way to fertilize oceans lovelock and rapley 2007 as it could be used to bring appropriate nutrient rich water up to the euphotic layer and enhances the ocean mariculture kirke 2003 williamson et al 2012 the upwelling also has good effects on the fish productivity carbon sequestration through the biological pump and high density mariculture jiao et al 2010 pan et al 2015 in all types of artificial upwelling air injection artificial upwelling is one of the most efficient ways to fertilize oceans pan et al 2016 although the air injection process can also be entrained by movement of sea water such as plunging breakers chanson et al 2002 however limited by its quantity and depth it is difficult to generate plenty of upwelling in specific area air injection artificial upwelling generates bubble entrained plumes beps by injecting air into underwater nozzles liang and peng 2005 mcclimans et al 2010 and beps can lift the nutrient rich overlying water to the euphotic layer studying beps factors can help us control artificial upwelling system and improve its lifting efficiency under the quiescent water condition some features of beps such as the centerline velocity of an entrained plume the influence factors of beps flux and bubble velocities have been studied in the laboratory brevik and kristiansen 2002 liang and peng 2005 seol et al 2009 in the crossflow the separation point between the bubble swarm and beps the trajectory and properties of beps also have been studied ansong et al 2011 qiang et al 2018 socolofsky and adams 2002 the bubble plume behavior was also studied in stratified environment asaeda and imberger 1993 sato and sato 2001 however these theoretical studies are not enough for field applications such as the air bubble pump system in norway mcclimans et al 2010 and air injection artificial upwelling in shallow coastal waters of china pan et al 2016 for example an air injection artificial upwelling system was built in aoshan bay located at 36 25 45 43 n and 120 43 43 34 e in yellow sea of china the bay is chosen for its water exchange rate not enough for dense raft culture shi and wei 2009 and its low nutrient concentration especially the concentration of nitrate zhu et al 2006 which leads to a lot of algae declining hlaili et al 2006 li et al 2017 the air injection system can bring nutrient rich water up to the aquaculture area of kelp fig 1 and enhance the growth of kelp and avoid the white rot of kelp however due to the limitation of electric power generated by solar platform how to use available energy to achieve efficient air injection artificial upwelling is an important issue to improve the efficiency of artificial upwelling and make beps controllable we need to understand the relationship between bep s influence factors and make beps reach specified height by controlling the running time and volume flow rate of air injection there are three beps factors needed to be concerned the first one is volume flow rate of injected air q a to make beps reach the euphotic layer in a crossflow fig 2 how much air is needed to be injected and how to determine the maximum volume flow rate of injected air required for the system the second one is crossflow velocity u limited by the maximum volume flow rate of injected air not all crossflow velocities are suit to artificial upwelling system after the feasible velocity range of crossflow is calculated the running time of artificial system can be obtained the last one is density difference between the ambient water and overlying water δ ρ studying the effects of density difference will be helpful to understand its influence on beps maximum height z m feasible velocity range of crossflow and so on in this paper a theoretical model is proposed to predict the regulation between beps factors then laboratory experiments are conducted in a circulating water flume coloring agent is used to trace beps and pictures are taken to record beps maximum height the theoretical model is validated by comparing experimental results and theoretical results for field application the sea condition in aoshan bay is used to analysis the model s influence in practical sea area maximum and optimal volume flow rate of injected air required for the system the feasible velocity range of crossflow and the effect of density difference are obtained some conclusions will be helpful to improve the efficiency of air injection system 2 mathematical model in this paper a fundamental model is proposed to predict bep maximum height and effect of bep s influence factors such as volume flow rate of injected air crossflow velocity and density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water fig 2 to simplify the model the temperature s influence on the density of fluids is not considered and the crossflow is assumed to be uniform the nutrient concentration in deeper layer is higher than that in upper ni et al 2017 wang et al 2011 and according to the research of dongji isles there is an obvious density interface at about 17 m deep yang et al 2017 hence we assume that the density interface between two layers is obvious there are two stages during the movement process of beps firstly before beps separate from the bubble plumes beps are influenced by the drag force from bubbles a lot of factors such as the flow rate of the bubbles the velocity of crossflow and so on can influence the separation point between the beps and bubble plumes crounse 2000 davidson and pun 1999 socolofsky and adams 2002 the empirical formula of beps separation height z d is given as follow socolofsky and adams 2002 1 z d 5 1 b u u s 2 4 0 88 where u is the velocity of the crossflow u s is the slip velocity of bubbles b is the initial jet kinematic buoyancy and can be determined as 2 b g q a δ ρ ρ w0 g q a ρ w0 ρ 0 ρ w0 where ρ w 0 is the density of overlying water ρ 0 is ambient water density q a is the volume flow rate of injected air g is gravity acceleration due to the viscous boundary layer generated by the seabed the maximum crossflow velocitiy of the crossflow measured from experiments u exp is different from the mean velocity of crossflow u 3 u k u exp where k is the correction factor of crossflow velocity for turbulence flow as the increase of the crossflow velocity the thickness of viscous boundary layer will be smaller and its influence on the crossflow will be less the correction factor of crossflow velocity k is related with the thickness of boundary layer and the shape of boundary for laminar flow in a round tube the mean velocity in the tube is half of the maximum velocity in it the correction factor k should be 0 5 secondly after the beps separates from bubble plumes the movement process of beps can be calculated by the approach used in the negatively buoyant fountain ansong et al 2011 this approach is mainly based on the spreading hypothesis and newton s second law the viscosity force is added into the approach as a new factor before using this approach the initial conditions at separation point need to be given such as the half width b d mean vertical velocity u m d and vertical momentum m d of beps the density of water ρ d the bep buoyancy flux f d these parameters can be written respectively as follow 4 b d 1 2 α z d δ z where δ z is the virtual displacement of nozzle α is the entrainment coefficient and they can be determined

the bep near the nozzle and q d is volume flow rate of injected air near the separation point in the negatively buoyant jets only buoyancy flux f g d including the gravity and buoyancy is considered in the previous study ansong et al 2011 but we think the viscous resistance flux also need to be considered in the movement process of the beps the bep buoyancy flux f g d the bep viscous resistance flux f μ d and the resultant force flux f d near the separation point can be calculated as 10 f g d π b d 2 u m d g d 11 f μ d 0 b d μ d u d e r 2 b d 2 d r d π r 2 ρ d 4 3 b d μ u d π e ρ d 12 f d f

where the vertical momentum after and at separation point respectively can be written as m π b 2 u m 2 and m d π b d 2 u m d 2 u m is the mean centerline vertical velocity after separation point substituting m π b 2 u m 2 into eq 15 and it can be rewritten as 14 u m m d f d t t d π b 2 according to the spreading hypothesis the growth rate of the bep s radial is fixed and can be written as follow 15 β d b d z d b u m d t where z is vertical coordinate β is the spreading coefficient and equal to 0 17 lee and chu 2012 substituting eq 16 into eq 17 and solving the new differential equation

experimental setup the schematic of experimental facilities is shown in fig 3 the bubble entrained plume experiments were conducted in a 0 6 1 2 m cross section annular flume in our ocean artificial upwelling laboratory the air injection facility was placed 8 m away from water inlet the crossflow needs to be uniform in this experiment hence a straightener was installed at the inlet of the annular flume to keep the flow stable the depth of water in the flume was controlled in 99 100 cm and the velocities of crossflow were changed from 0 072 to 0 165 m s one side of flume has an observation window which can be used to observe and record the beps the container was used to simulate the condition of overlying water it was filled with high density solution which was compound by saline water and potassium permanganate used as the dye the density difference between the ambition water and high density water were 2 4 6 kg m3 respectively in this experiment and the ambient water s density measured by the salimeter was 996 4 kg m3 the high density solution was pumped through the tube by a peristaltic pump and its flow rate is controlled by a throttle valve to reduce its influence on the bubble plume the velocity of solution flow need to be stable the air was pumped to an aquarium air stone by the air pump the velocity of air was controlled by a throttle valve and monitored by a rotameter the bubble plume generated from the aquarium air stone could bring up the high density solution and formed the beps to provide soft light source a led lightbox was placed on the top of observation area a digital single lens reflex slr camera canon eos60d was used to take pictures of beps the heights of beps were observed from the images and recorded in the experiments the crossflow velocities were 0 072 0 097 0 141 0 165 m s and the volume flow rate of injected air were 0 3 0 5 0 7 1 0 1 5 2 0 l min each volume flow rate of injected air will be tested under all different crossflow velocities meanwhile the density difference between the ambition water and high density water were 2 4 6 kg m3 respectively hence there were 72 experiments carried out and 66 sets of experimental data observed from the images 3 2 conditions for model and prototype the purpose of this paper is providing a theoretical model for an established system air injection artificial upwelling in aoshan bay shown in fig 1 to predict the effect of bubble entrained plume s influence factors hence it s necessary to make this model useful in our prototype scales similitude criterion can guarantee the similarity between the model and natural phenomena the bep s similarity law follows densimetric froude number in which inertial force and gravity are mainly considered firstly the length ratio l r is attained by the geometric similarity and described as follow 24 l r l p l m where l p and l m represent the length of prototype and the model respectively the length such as the radius of air stone and the depth of water are all scaled in the ratio l r to use the mathematical model in the field application the l r is 20 in this study hence the radius of air stone and the depth of water in model 0 02 m and 1 m respectively are correspond to them in prototype 0 4 m and 20 m secondly the densimetric froude number in prototype and model are required to be same by dynamic similitude and it can be described as follow 25 f r m f r p u m g δ ρ m ρ a m l m 1 2 u p g δ ρ p ρ a p l p 1 2 where f r is densimetric froude number u represents the crossflow velocity or the velocity of beps g is gravitational acceleration ρ a is the density of ambient water the m and p respectively represent the model and prototype finally the ratios of the crossflow velocity can be described as 26 u r u p u m g δ ρ p ρ a p l p 1 2 g δ ρ m ρ a m l m 1 2 δ ρ ρ a r l r 1 2 where u r is the crossflow velocity ratio the density difference ratio in this experiment is 0 25 hence the crossflow velocity ratio u r is 5 the ratio of the volume flow rate of injected air q a r can be written as follow and the summarization of the model and prototype is shown in table 1 27 q a r u r l r 2 due to the difference between prototype and model scale mathematical model needs to be improved eq 1 only apply to the laboratory scale therefore the calculation of beps separation height z d needs to use experiment parameters and then the separation height need be magnified by using the similarity theory hence the experiment parameters are substituted into eqs 1 and 2 and then separation height in laboratory scale is magnified by multiplying length ratio the calculation is shown as follow 28 b exp g q a q a r δ ρ ρ w0 g q a q a r ρ w0 ρ a ρ w0 29 z d exp 5 1 b exp u u r u s 2 4 0 88 30 z d l r z d exp where b exp and z d exp represent the initial jet kinematic buoyancy and beps separation height in the laboratory scale z d is the magnified beps separation height 4 results and discussion in laboratory experiments the maximum height of beps are recorded in different crossflow velocity volume flow rate of air injection and density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water the experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions to validate the accuracy of mathematical model the effects of bep influence factors are discussed in detail 4 1 the maximum height of beps in fig 3 beps initial momentum is given by bubbles and the maximum height of beps is influenced by air injection volume flow rate crossflow velocity and density difference under the effect of crossflow bep separates from the bubble swarms during the rising process as the crossflow velocity increases the bubbles have less contact time with beps and the nutrient plumes will separate from bubble plumes earlier after the separation point bep only depend on gravity bouyancy and viscosity force and become negatively buoyant fountain beps velocity will slow down and become zero when it reaches the maximum height which is defined as the vertical distance between the highest point of beps centerline and bubble outlet fig 4 finally it reverses the direction and goes back to the water bottom in the whole process a lot of factors such as the volume flow rate of air injection crossflow velocity density difference between overlying water and ambient water can influence the maximum heights of beps hence a variety of beps maximum heights are available in different crossflow velocity volume flow rate of air injection and density difference conditions one kind of classification method depends on the height of beps by observing the experiment pictures taken by slr camera the maximum height of beps can be classified into three types fig 5 shows different types of beps height under different volume flow rate of air injection while the crossflow velocity u 0 097 m s and density difference δ ρ 4 kg m3 are constant in type 1 the trajectory of beps distributes as a parabolic trend as shown in fig 5a b and c the maximum height of bep can be obtained clearly in type 2 when the volume flow rates of injected air increases the rising process of bep is still obvious but the falling process is invisible in fig 5d and e the beps maximum height is available from the tail end of trajectories which approaches to be horizontal in type 3 the rising process is so fast that the peak of trajectory goes out of the observation window hence the maximum height of bep is unavailable fig 5f according to this classification the effective data of beps maximum height could be obtained in type 1 and 2 beside observing the height of beps there are also some phenomena attracting our attention firstly the boundary of beps become blurring as increasing of air injection volume flow rates increasing the volume flow rates of air injection will provide more initial momentum to beps and prolong bep s rising process as the time spent on rising process increases the width of beps will become wider according to eq 17 and the ambient water will be entrained into the beps and make the color of dye lighter the diluted dye under the effect of turbulence is hard to be captured secondly the bep has a separation phenomenon at the rising process in fig 5e the main reason causing the phenomenon is the nonuniform distribution of density as the high density water is lifted up constantly the ambient water is entrained into the container and the horizontal diffusion of high density water also occurs in the container the mixing process is complex and could make the distribution of density nonuniform and it is obvious when density difference between the ambient water and overlying water is large when the nonuniform density water is lifted up by the bubbles the high density beps will fall faster than the relatively low density beps hence the separation phenomenon can be observed 4 2 validation of mathematical model to validate the mathematical model 72 sets of experiment in different crossflow velocities volume flow rates of injected air and density differences were performed in the circulating water flume by observing the beps pictures there are 66 photos which can be classified to type 1 and 2 and 6 photos are type 3 hence the beps heights z m are available in 66 sets of experiment and could be used to compare with the mathematical results in the same conditions before using mathematical model there are several coefficients need to be confirmed firstly the slip velocity u s 0 3 m s can be determined by recording the movement time of the bubbles mcdougall 1978 secondly to simplify the model the correction factor of crossflow velocity k is assumed to be 0 5 depending on all these factors and eq 19 the mathematical results of beps maximum heights can be calculated and the comparison of experimental and mathematical beps maximum heights are shown in fig 6 in fig 6a most of experimental results are close to mathematical results and the biggest difference between experimental and mathematical results is 0 5 m q a 626 1 l min and 1 5 kg m3 in fig 6b and c the differences between the mathematical and experimental results are getting bigger to clarify the variation of mathematical and experimental difference the average deviations between the experiment results and mathematical results are calculated in every curves of fig 6 and the results are shown in table 2 as we can see from table 2 three columns correspond to three figures in fig 6 in each column the average deviations of different density differences were calculated and it will decrease with the increasing of density differences for example when crossflow velocity is 0 217 m s and density differences change from 0 5 to 1 5 the average deviations will decrease from 0 3252 to 0 2129 and the similar trend can also be found in other crossflow velocities the reason for this trend is that the larger density differences will make the maximum height of beps becomes lower the lower layer of water is more stable than upper layer which will reduce the disturbance and average deviation of beps from the average value of the deviation it can be found that as the crossflow become faster the average value of the average deviation will increase from 0 2859 to 0 3859 which means the experimental results are more dispersive the flow disturbance causes this phenomenon although the flow straightener was installed to make the flow uniform the distribution of velocity is still nonuniform which will make beps trajectories disturbed by the turbulent flow and the influence will be larger as the increasing of crossflow velocity other factors can also cause the errors between the experimental and theoretical results for example the lift force generated from the bubble is unstable and will change with the size of bubble which disturbs the spreading process of beps and increases the width of beps hence it will influence the observation of beps maximum height and increase the observation error and the choose of viscosity coefficient could also cause errors in the mathematical model the viscosity coefficient is considered to be constant but actually it will change with the temperature and salinity of water to make the calculation more precise these factors need to be considered while there is deviation exists in the experimental and mathematical results experimental results of beps maximum heights generally correspond with the mathematical results in different density differences 4 3 the effective velocity range of crossflow the effective velocity range of crossflow 0 u max which can make sure beps reach the specific height determines the running time of artificial upwelling system hence it is important for the field application by using the maximum volume flow rate of injected air q a max and specific height that beps are expected to reach h 0 s p e the effective range of crossflow velocity 0 u max could be calculated by using eqs 22 and 23 for example we apply the theoretical model to calculate the effective range of crossflow velocity in aoshan bay located at 36 25 45 43 n and 120 43 43 34 e in yellow sea of china beps are expected to reach 1 m below the sea level and increase nutrient concentration of surface water to release nutrient limitation in this condition the specified height h 0 s p e is defined as the distance from sea bottom to 1 m below sea surface the sea level and crossflow velocity were measured by using acoustic doppler current profilers in aoshan bay the depth of water changed from 7 1 m to 9 4 m and crossflow velocity is less than 0 25 m s hence the range of specified height h 0 s p e is 6 1 8 4 m and beps maximum height z m should not smaller than specified height h 0 s p e the maximum volume flow rate of injected air q a max will change with the power of air pump in this case q a max 800 1100 1400 1700 l min is taken as the available volume flow rate the density difference between the overlying water and ambient water will change with seasons δ ρ 0 5 kg m3 is assumed as the density difference in summer then the relationship between maximum effective crossflow velocity u max and the specific height h 0 s p e that beps need to reach is shown in fig 7 no matter when density difference is 0 5 kg m3 or 1 0 kg m3 increasing beps specific height h 0 s p e will narrow down the effective range of crossflow velocity 0 u max in different maximum volume flow rate of injected air for aoshan bay maximum crossflow velocity is less than 0 25 m s hence if maximum effective crossflow velocity is bigger than it beps certainly can reach specified height it is clear from fig 6a and b that larger density difference will reduce maximum effective crossflow velocity and limit the application range of the system when δ ρ is 0 5 kg m3 q a max larger than 1300 l min is enough for most of specified heights however whether q a max is 1100 l min is adequate for air injection system needs further discussion in practical sea area when water reaches high tide the crossflow velocity is the smallest it is easy for beps to reach the specific height hence to get the running time of artificial upwelling system only getting the relationship between the maximum effective crossflow velocity and the specific height of beps is not enough the relationship between sea level and crossflow velocity is necessary when sea level and crossflow velocity change with time and maximum volume flow rates of injected air are assumed to be 800 and 1000 l min respectively whether the maximum height of beps could reach the specified height should be estimated aoshan bay has regular semidiurnal tide jun 2004 the relationships of sea level and crossflow velocity are accordance with the sinusoidal variation the specified height h 0 s p e changes from 6 1 to 8 4 m and the maximum velocity is 0 25 m s the crossflow velocity and beps specified height both change with time and they can be calculated as follow 31 u t u max sin 2 π t t 32 h 0 s p e t z m d cos 2 π t t substituting q m and u t into eq 21 the bep s maximum height under the maximum volume flow rate can be written as 33 z m t f q m u t δ ρ the result of beps maximum heights under the maximum volume flow rate and beps specified height present in fig 8 due to the electric power is limited in a fjord or a bay the maximum volume flow rate supplied by air pump may be not enough for all crossflow velocity condition when the maximum height of beps is higher than the specified height the artificial upwelling system is effective as fig 8 shows the system could work in most time of one tide period when q a max is 1000 l min there is about 1 8 h long between the high tide and low tide that beps could not reach specified height although this maximum volume flow rate of injected air cannot guarantee the system works in all condition this system can run about 20 4 h a day in aoshan bay as the maximum volume flow rate of injected air decreases from 1000 l min to 800 l min the running time also change from 20 4 to 19 4 h a day 4 4 the optimal volume flow rate of air injection bringing the nutrient rich water to the surface can stimulate primary productivity of algae and phytoplankton fan et al 2016 karl and letelier 2008 lovelock and rapley 2007 how much air should be injected into the water to bring the nutrient rich overlying water up to sea surface if too much air is injected into the water beps will go above the specific height and the efficiency will be decreased while if the volume flow rate of injected air is not enough beps cannot reach the specified height to stimulate the marine primary productivity the relationship between the optimal volume flow rate of air injection and the maximum height of beps can be calculated by eqs 20 and 21 as the increasing of beps maximum height the volume flow rate of air injection increases and when crossflow velocity gets larger it needs more air to make beps reach the specified height under the effect of tides both sea level and crossflow velocity change with time how much should the design maximum volume flow rate of injected air be designed the design maximum volume flow rate of injected air q a d could be defined as the minimum volume flow rate of injected air required to reach specified height in all conditions when the crossflow velocity u max is maximum the water reaches mean sea level z m d and the optimal volume flow rate of air injection is 1133 l min fig 9 when the water reaches high tide crossflow velocity is small and it just need much less volume flow rate of air injection to simplify the model the influence of spring tide and neap tide isn t considered the crossflow velocity and sea level take on sinusoidal distribution to get the design volume flow rate of injected air q a d the tangency points between beps specified height h 0 s p e and maximum heights of beps under the design volume flow rate of injected air z m need to be calculated for aoshan bay the mean sea level is 8 25 m hence the maximum beps height need to reach 7 25 m the maximum crossflow velocity is 0 25 m s density difference is assumed to be 0 5 kg m3 in summer by changing the volume flow rate of injected air there is a critical point where all z m are just higher than h 0 s p e and it represents design volume flow rate of injected air under different density differences the tangency points are almost at the same place fig 10 however the design volume flow rates of injected air q a d are different and they respectively are 1145 1477 and 1661 l min as the density differences increase from 0 5 to 1 5 kg m3 obviously when the volume flow rate of air injection is controlled according to the sea level and crossflow velocity its efficiency is higher than the air injection mode which always use the maximum volume flow rate however we want to get numerical value of the improvement the total volume flow of two different conditions in 12 h are calculated by eqs 34 and 35 and the improved efficiency η is listed in table 3 34 q t 0 12 60 q a h 0 s p e t u t δ ρ d t 35 q t max q a d 12 60 36 η q t max q t q t max as table 3 shows there is a significant improvement of efficiency and it changes with the density differences from 8 33 to 12 38 the smaller density difference is the better controlled volume flow rate of air injection will performance 4 5 effect of density difference on bep the density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water changes with seasons and locations and the maximum density different often appears in summer the relative difference of density is about 0 1 0 4 pan et al 2015 for example in dong ji isles 30 07 n 122 46 e the density interface can be found at the depth of 17 m the ambience water density is 1014 kg m3 and density difference is about 1 kg m3 in summer qiang et al 2018 to study the effects of density difference about beps maximum height the volume flow rate of air injection and crossflow velocity the density difference δ ρ 0 1 4 0 kg m3 is chosen in the mathematical calculation there are three pictures shown the relationships respectively as follow the relationship between the density difference and bep s maximum height the volume flow rate of air injection and maximum effective crossflow velocity are calculated respectively by using eqs 19 20 and 22 with the increasing of density difference the bep s maximum height and maximum effective crossflow velocity will decrease however the optimal volume flow rate of air injection will increase from fig 11 a b and c when density difference increases from 0 5 to 4 kg m3 bep s maximum height and maximum effective crossflow velocity have an exponential decrease and the requirement of optimal volume flow rate of air injection increases 2 3 times because density difference will change with season and its obvious influence on other factors it needs to be measured frequently only the density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water is determined the calculation about other factors could be accurate 5 conclusions in this paper the effects of beps influence factors including volume flow rate of injected air crossflow velocity and density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water are studied theoretically and experimentally by using similarity criterion the model can adapt to field application experimental results are compared with theoretical results to confirm the performance of theoretical model although the presented model needs improvement the results of experiments and theoretical model is basically accordant three main influence factors of bep were investigated the first one is volume flow rate of injected air required to be controlled to make beps reach the specific height if the volume flow rate is insufficient beps cannot reach the specific height when too much air is injected into the water bep will rush out of water surface and part of kinetic energy is wasted therefore the efficiency will be decreased analyzing the effect of volume flow rate of injected air can help us determine the design maximum volume flow rate of air injection system and improve air injection efficiency by 8 33 12 38 secondly determining the feasible crossflow velocity could help us to figure out whether artificial upwelling system could work and evaluate the running time finally the density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water has significant influence on bep s maximum height feasible crossflow velocity and optimal volume flow rate of air injection it is necessary to measure the density difference accurately and frequently artificial upwelling could bring nutrient rich water up to euphotic zone to promote the growth of phytoplankton and increase the production of fishing grounds recognizing the effect of beps influence factor will be helpful to design artificial upwelling system for field application such as the artificial upwelling system in aoshan bay and improve air injection efficiency however the theoretical model proposed in this paper can only be used in unstratified crossflow beps characters in stratified crossflow needs to be studied in the future acknowledgements this research is financially funded by the national natural science funds of china no

22384,air injection artificial upwelling is considered as a way to promote the growth of phytoplankton and improve carbon sequestration some air injection artificial upwelling systems have been established such as in norway and china however one of major obstacles for large scale field application is lack of theoretical model to predict the effect of bubble entrained plume s bep influence factors which is helpful to control bubble entrained plumes design the air injection system and improve the efficiency of air injection system in this paper a theoretical model is proposed to predict the maximum height of bep and effect of bep s influence factors to validate the theoretical model laboratory experiments were conducted in a circulating water flume the results show that the theoretical approach can be used to calculate critical parameters of air injection artificial upwelling system such as beps maximum height design volume flow rate of air injection efficiency of air injection system and so on by using the theoretical result to design air injection system and predict the optimal air injection volume flow rate the system can adopt to almost all velocity conditions in field application and the efficiency of air injection system has an improvement about 8 33 12 38 which makes the system feasible and efficient in the usage keywords artificial upwelling bubble entrained plumes crossflow air injection density difference 1 introduction artificial upwelling is a sustainable way to fertilize oceans lovelock and rapley 2007 as it could be used to bring appropriate nutrient rich water up to the euphotic layer and enhances the ocean mariculture kirke 2003 williamson et al 2012 the upwelling also has good effects on the fish productivity carbon sequestration through the biological pump and high density mariculture jiao et al 2010 pan et al 2015 in all types of artificial upwelling air injection artificial upwelling is one of the most efficient ways to fertilize oceans pan et al 2016 although the air injection process can also be entrained by movement of sea water such as plunging breakers chanson et al 2002 however limited by its quantity and depth it is difficult to generate plenty of upwelling in specific area air injection artificial upwelling generates bubble entrained plumes beps by injecting air into underwater nozzles liang and peng 2005 mcclimans et al 2010 and beps can lift the nutrient rich overlying water to the euphotic layer studying beps factors can help us control artificial upwelling system and improve its lifting efficiency under the quiescent water condition some features of beps such as the centerline velocity of an entrained plume the influence factors of beps flux and bubble velocities have been studied in the laboratory brevik and kristiansen 2002 liang and peng 2005 seol et al 2009 in the crossflow the separation point between the bubble swarm and beps the trajectory and properties of beps also have been studied ansong et al 2011 qiang et al 2018 socolofsky and adams 2002 the bubble plume behavior was also studied in stratified environment asaeda and imberger 1993 sato and sato 2001 however these theoretical studies are not enough for field applications such as the air bubble pump system in norway mcclimans et al 2010 and air injection artificial upwelling in shallow coastal waters of china pan et al 2016 for example an air injection artificial upwelling system was built in aoshan bay located at 36 25 45 43 n and 120 43 43 34 e in yellow sea of china the bay is chosen for its water exchange rate not enough for dense raft culture shi and wei 2009 and its low nutrient concentration especially the concentration of nitrate zhu et al 2006 which leads to a lot of algae declining hlaili et al 2006 li et al 2017 the air injection system can bring nutrient rich water up to the aquaculture area of kelp fig 1 and enhance the growth of kelp and avoid the white rot of kelp however due to the limitation of electric power generated by solar platform how to use available energy to achieve efficient air injection artificial upwelling is an important issue to improve the efficiency of artificial upwelling and make beps controllable we need to understand the relationship between bep s influence factors and make beps reach specified height by controlling the running time and volume flow rate of air injection there are three beps factors needed to be concerned the first one is volume flow rate of injected air q a to make beps reach the euphotic layer in a crossflow fig 2 how much air is needed to be injected and how to determine the maximum volume flow rate of injected air required for the system the second one is crossflow velocity u limited by the maximum volume flow rate of injected air not all crossflow velocities are suit to artificial upwelling system after the feasible velocity range of crossflow is calculated the running time of artificial system can be obtained the last one is density difference between the ambient water and overlying water δ ρ studying the effects of density difference will be helpful to understand its influence on beps maximum height z m feasible velocity range of crossflow and so on in this paper a theoretical model is proposed to predict the regulation between beps factors then laboratory experiments are conducted in a circulating water flume coloring agent is used to trace beps and pictures are taken to record beps maximum height the theoretical model is validated by comparing experimental results and theoretical results for field application the sea condition in aoshan bay is used to analysis the model s influence in practical sea area maximum and optimal volume flow rate of injected air required for the system the feasible velocity range of crossflow and the effect of density difference are obtained some conclusions will be helpful to improve the efficiency of air injection system 2 mathematical model in this paper a fundamental model is proposed to predict bep maximum height and effect of bep s influence factors such as volume flow rate of injected air crossflow velocity and density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water fig 2 to simplify the model the temperature s influence on the density of fluids is not considered and the crossflow is assumed to be uniform the nutrient concentration in deeper layer is higher than that in upper ni et al 2017 wang et al 2011 and according to the research of dongji isles there is an obvious density interface at about 17 m deep yang et al 2017 hence we assume that the density interface between two layers is obvious there are two stages during the movement process of beps firstly before beps separate from the bubble plumes beps are influenced by the drag force from bubbles a lot of factors such as the flow rate of the bubbles the velocity of crossflow and so on can influence the separation point between the beps and bubble plumes crounse 2000 davidson and pun 1999 socolofsky and adams 2002 the empirical formula of beps separation height z d is given as follow socolofsky and adams 2002 1 z d 5 1 b u u s 2 4 0 88 where u is the velocity of the crossflow u s is the slip velocity of bubbles b is the initial jet kinematic buoyancy and can be determined as 2 b g q a δ ρ ρ w0 g q a ρ w0 ρ 0 ρ w0 where ρ w 0 is the density of overlying water ρ 0 is ambient water density q a is the volume flow rate of injected air g is gravity acceleration due to the viscous boundary layer generated by the seabed the maximum crossflow velocitiy of the crossflow measured from experiments u exp is different from the mean velocity of crossflow u 3 u k u exp where k is the correction factor of crossflow velocity for turbulence flow as the increase of the crossflow velocity the thickness of viscous boundary layer will be smaller and its influence on the crossflow will be less the correction factor of crossflow velocity k is related with the thickness of boundary layer and the shape of boundary for laminar flow in a round tube the mean velocity in the tube is half of the maximum velocity in it the correction factor k should be 0 5 secondly after the beps separates from bubble plumes the movement process of beps can be calculated by the approach used in the negatively buoyant fountain ansong et al 2011 this approach is mainly based on the spreading hypothesis and newton s second law the viscosity force is added into the approach as a new factor before using this approach the initial conditions at separation point need to be given such as the half width b d mean vertical velocity u m d and vertical momentum m d of beps the density of water ρ d the bep buoyancy flux f d these parameters can be written respectively as follow 4 b d 1 2 α z d δ z where δ z is the virtual displacement of nozzle α is the entrainment coefficient and they can be determined respectively as δ z b 0 1 2 α and α 0 082 tanh g q a h 0 3 u s 3 8 kobus 1969 b 0 is the radius of airs tone h 0 is atmospheric pressure and u s is the slip velocity of bubbles the centerline vertical

corresponds to the gaussian distribution and it can be calculated by integrating along with radial direction the width of beps 3 2 b d can cover 99 7 of velocity s probability hence the mean vertical

the bep near the nozzle and q d is volume flow rate of injected air near the separation point in the negatively buoyant jets only buoyancy flux f g d including the gravity and buoyancy is considered in the previous study ansong et al 2011 but we think the viscous resistance flux also need to be considered in the movement process of the beps the bep buoyancy flux f g d the bep viscous resistance flux f μ d and the resultant force flux f d near the separation point can be calculated as 10 f g d π b d 2 u m d g d 11 f μ d 0 b d μ d u d e r 2 b d 2 d r d π r 2 ρ d 4 3 b d μ u d π e ρ d 12 f d f

uniform ambient conservation of momentum implies that the momentum flux of the slab changes in time due to the buoyancy flux the change of density is ignored in the slab of a plume 13 m m d f d t t d where the vertical momentum after and at separation point respectively can be written as m π b 2 u m 2 and m d π b d 2 u m d 2 u m is the mean centerline vertical velocity after separation point substituting m π b 2 u m 2 into eq 15 and it can be rewritten as 14 u m m d f d t t d π b 2 according to the spreading hypothesis the growth rate of the bep s radial is fixed and can be written as follow 15 β d b d z d b u m d t where z is vertical coordinate β is the spreading coefficient and equal to 0 17 lee and chu 2012 substituting eq 16 into eq 17 and solving the new differential equation

experimental setup the schematic of experimental facilities is shown in fig 3 the bubble entrained plume experiments were conducted in a 0 6 1 2 m cross section annular flume in our ocean artificial upwelling laboratory the air injection facility was placed 8 m away from water inlet the crossflow needs to be uniform in this experiment hence a straightener was installed at the inlet of the annular flume to keep the flow stable the depth of water in the flume was controlled in 99 100 cm and the velocities of crossflow were changed from 0 072 to 0 165 m s one side of flume has an observation window which can be used to observe and record the beps the container was used to simulate the condition of overlying water it was filled with high density solution which was compound by saline water and potassium permanganate used as the dye the density difference between the ambition water and high density water were 2 4 6 kg m3 respectively in this experiment and the ambient water s density measured by the salimeter was 996 4 kg m3 the high density solution was pumped through the tube by a peristaltic pump and its flow rate is controlled by a throttle valve to reduce its influence on the bubble plume the velocity of solution flow need to be stable the air was pumped to an aquarium air stone by the air pump the velocity of air was controlled by a throttle valve and monitored by a rotameter the bubble plume generated from the aquarium air stone could bring up the high density solution and formed the beps to provide soft light source a led lightbox was placed on the top of observation area a digital single lens reflex slr camera canon eos60d was used to take pictures of beps the heights of beps were observed from the images and recorded in the experiments the crossflow velocities were 0 072 0 097 0 141 0 165 m s and the volume flow rate of injected air were 0 3 0 5 0 7 1 0 1 5 2 0 l min each volume flow rate of injected air will be tested under all different crossflow velocities meanwhile the density difference between the ambition water and high density water were 2 4 6 kg m3 respectively hence there were 72 experiments carried out and 66 sets of experimental data observed from the images 3 2 conditions for model and prototype the purpose of this paper is providing a theoretical model for an established system air injection artificial upwelling in aoshan bay shown in fig 1 to predict the effect of bubble entrained plume s influence factors hence it s necessary to make this model useful in our prototype scales similitude criterion can guarantee the similarity between the model and natural phenomena the bep s similarity law follows densimetric froude number in which inertial force and gravity are mainly considered firstly the length ratio l r is attained by the geometric similarity and described as follow 24 l r l p l m where l p and l m represent the length of prototype and the model respectively the length such as the radius of air stone and the depth of water are all scaled in the ratio l r to use the mathematical model in the field application the l r is 20 in this study hence the radius of air stone and the depth of water in model 0 02 m and 1 m respectively are correspond to them in prototype 0 4 m and 20 m secondly the densimetric froude number in prototype and model are required to be same by dynamic similitude and it can be described as follow 25 f r m f r p u m g δ ρ m ρ a m l m 1 2 u p g δ ρ p ρ a p l p 1 2 where f r is densimetric froude number u represents the crossflow velocity or the velocity of beps g is gravitational acceleration ρ a is the density of ambient water the m and p respectively represent the model and prototype finally the ratios of the crossflow velocity can be described as 26 u r u p u m g δ ρ p ρ a p l p 1 2 g δ ρ m ρ a m l m 1 2 δ ρ ρ a r l r 1 2 where u r is the crossflow velocity ratio the density difference ratio in this experiment is 0 25 hence the crossflow velocity ratio u r is 5 the ratio of the volume flow rate of injected air q a r can be written as follow and the summarization of the model and prototype is shown in table 1 27 q a r u r l r 2 due to the difference between prototype and model scale mathematical model needs to be improved eq 1 only apply to the laboratory scale therefore the calculation of beps separation height z d needs to use experiment parameters and then the separation height need be magnified by using the similarity theory hence the experiment parameters are substituted into eqs 1 and 2 and then separation height in laboratory scale is magnified by multiplying length ratio the calculation is shown as follow 28 b exp g q a q a r δ ρ ρ w0 g q a q a r ρ w0 ρ a ρ w0 29 z d exp 5 1 b exp u u r u s 2 4 0 88 30 z d l r z d exp where b exp and z d exp represent the initial jet kinematic buoyancy and beps separation height in the laboratory scale z d is the magnified beps separation height 4 results and discussion in laboratory experiments the maximum height of beps are recorded in different crossflow velocity volume flow rate of air injection and density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water the experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions to validate the accuracy of mathematical model the effects of bep influence factors are discussed in detail 4 1 the maximum height of beps in fig 3 beps initial momentum is given by bubbles and the maximum height of beps is influenced by air injection volume flow rate crossflow velocity and density difference under the effect of crossflow bep separates from the bubble swarms during the rising process as the crossflow velocity increases the bubbles have less contact time with beps and the nutrient plumes will separate from bubble plumes earlier after the separation point bep only depend on gravity bouyancy and viscosity force and become negatively buoyant fountain beps velocity will slow down and become zero when it reaches the maximum height which is defined as the vertical distance between the highest point of beps centerline and bubble outlet fig 4 finally it reverses the direction and goes back to the water bottom in the whole process a lot of factors such as the volume flow rate of air injection crossflow velocity density difference between overlying water and ambient water can influence the maximum heights of beps hence a variety of beps maximum heights are available in different crossflow velocity volume flow rate of air injection and density difference conditions one kind of classification method depends on the height of beps by observing the experiment pictures taken by slr camera the maximum height of beps can be classified into three types fig 5 shows different types of beps height under different volume flow rate of air injection while the crossflow velocity u 0 097 m s and density difference δ ρ 4 kg m3 are constant in type 1 the trajectory of beps distributes as a parabolic trend as shown in fig 5a b and c the maximum height of bep can be obtained clearly in type 2 when the volume flow rates of injected air increases the rising process of bep is still obvious but the falling process is invisible in fig 5d and e the beps maximum height is available from the tail end of trajectories which approaches to be horizontal in type 3 the rising process is so fast that the peak of trajectory goes out of the observation window hence the maximum height of bep is unavailable fig 5f according to this classification the effective data of beps maximum height could be obtained in type 1 and 2 beside observing the height of beps there are also some phenomena attracting our attention firstly the boundary of beps become blurring as increasing of air injection volume flow rates increasing the volume flow rates of air injection will provide more initial momentum to beps and prolong bep s rising process as the time spent on rising process increases the width of beps will become wider according to eq 17 and the ambient water will be entrained into the beps and make the color of dye lighter the diluted dye under the effect of turbulence is hard to be captured secondly the bep has a separation phenomenon at the rising process in fig 5e the main reason causing the phenomenon is the nonuniform distribution of density as the high density water is lifted up constantly the ambient water is entrained into the container and the horizontal diffusion of high density water also occurs in the container the mixing process is complex and could make the distribution of density nonuniform and it is obvious when density difference between the ambient water and overlying water is large when the nonuniform density water is lifted up by the bubbles the high density beps will fall faster than the relatively low density beps hence the separation phenomenon can be observed 4 2 validation of mathematical model to validate the mathematical model 72 sets of experiment in different crossflow velocities volume flow rates of injected air and density differences were performed in the circulating water flume by observing the beps pictures there are 66 photos which can be classified to type 1 and 2 and 6 photos are type 3 hence the beps heights z m are available in 66 sets of experiment and could be used to compare with the mathematical results in the same conditions before using mathematical model there are several coefficients need to be confirmed firstly the slip velocity u s 0 3 m s can be determined by recording the movement time of the bubbles mcdougall 1978 secondly to simplify the model the correction factor of crossflow velocity k is assumed to be 0 5 depending on all these factors and eq 19 the mathematical results of beps maximum heights can be calculated and the comparison of experimental and mathematical beps maximum heights are shown in fig 6 in fig 6a most of experimental results are close to mathematical results and the biggest difference between experimental and mathematical results is 0 5 m q a 626 1 l min and 1 5 kg m3 in fig 6b and c the differences between the mathematical and experimental results are getting bigger to clarify the variation of mathematical and experimental difference the average deviations between the experiment results and mathematical results are calculated in every curves of fig 6 and the results are shown in table 2 as we can see from table 2 three columns correspond to three figures in fig 6 in each column the average deviations of different density differences were calculated and it will decrease with the increasing of density differences for example when crossflow velocity is 0 217 m s and density differences change from 0 5 to 1 5 the average deviations will decrease from 0 3252 to 0 2129 and the similar trend can also be found in other crossflow velocities the reason for this trend is that the larger density differences will make the maximum height of beps becomes lower the lower layer of water is more stable than upper layer which will reduce the disturbance and average deviation of beps from the average value of the deviation it can be found that as the crossflow become faster the average value of the average deviation will increase from 0 2859 to 0 3859 which means the experimental results are more dispersive the flow disturbance causes this phenomenon although the flow straightener was installed to make the flow uniform the distribution of velocity is still nonuniform which will make beps trajectories disturbed by the turbulent flow and the influence will be larger as the increasing of crossflow velocity other factors can also cause the errors between the experimental and theoretical results for example the lift force generated from the bubble is unstable and will change with the size of bubble which disturbs the spreading process of beps and increases the width of beps hence it will influence the observation of beps maximum height and increase the observation error and the choose of viscosity coefficient could also cause errors in the mathematical model the viscosity coefficient is considered to be constant but actually it will change with the temperature and salinity of water to make the calculation more precise these factors need to be considered while there is deviation exists in the experimental and mathematical results experimental results of beps maximum heights generally correspond with the mathematical results in different density differences 4 3 the effective velocity range of crossflow the effective velocity range of crossflow 0 u max which can make sure beps reach the specific height determines the running time of artificial upwelling system hence it is important for the field application by using the maximum volume flow rate of injected air q a max and specific height that beps are expected to reach h 0 s p e the effective range of crossflow velocity 0 u max could be calculated by using eqs 22 and 23 for example we apply the theoretical model to calculate the effective range of crossflow velocity in aoshan bay located at 36 25 45 43 n and 120 43 43 34 e in yellow sea of china beps are expected to reach 1 m below the sea level and increase nutrient concentration of surface water to release nutrient limitation in this condition the specified height h 0 s p e is defined as the distance from sea bottom to 1 m below sea surface the sea level and crossflow velocity were measured by using acoustic doppler current profilers in aoshan bay the depth of water changed from 7 1 m to 9 4 m and crossflow velocity is less than 0 25 m s hence the range of specified height h 0 s p e is 6 1 8 4 m and beps maximum height z m should not smaller than specified height h 0 s p e the maximum volume flow rate of injected air q a max will change with the power of air pump in this case q a max 800 1100 1400 1700 l min is taken as the available volume flow rate the density difference between the overlying water and ambient water will change with seasons δ ρ 0 5 kg m3 is assumed as the density difference in summer then the relationship between maximum effective crossflow velocity u max and the specific height h 0 s p e that beps need to reach is shown in fig 7 no matter when density difference is 0 5 kg m3 or 1 0 kg m3 increasing beps specific height h 0 s p e will narrow down the effective range of crossflow velocity 0 u max in different maximum volume flow rate of injected air for aoshan bay maximum crossflow velocity is less than 0 25 m s hence if maximum effective crossflow velocity is bigger than it beps certainly can reach specified height it is clear from fig 6a and b that larger density difference will reduce maximum effective crossflow velocity and limit the application range of the system when δ ρ is 0 5 kg m3 q a max larger than 1300 l min is enough for most of specified heights however whether q a max is 1100 l min is adequate for air injection system needs further discussion in practical sea area when water reaches high tide the crossflow velocity is the smallest it is easy for beps to reach the specific height hence to get the running time of artificial upwelling system only getting the relationship between the maximum effective crossflow velocity and the specific height of beps is not enough the relationship between sea level and crossflow velocity is necessary when sea level and crossflow velocity change with time and maximum volume flow rates of injected air are assumed to be 800 and 1000 l min respectively whether the maximum height of beps could reach the specified height should be estimated aoshan bay has regular semidiurnal tide jun 2004 the relationships of sea level and crossflow velocity are accordance with the sinusoidal variation the specified height h 0 s p e changes from 6 1 to 8 4 m and the maximum velocity is 0 25 m s the crossflow velocity and beps specified height both change with time and they can be calculated as follow 31 u t u max sin 2 π t t 32 h 0 s p e t z m d cos 2 π t t substituting q m and u t into eq 21 the bep s maximum height under the maximum volume flow rate can be written as 33 z m t f q m u t δ ρ the result of beps maximum heights under the maximum volume flow rate and beps specified height present in fig 8 due to the electric power is limited in a fjord or a bay the maximum volume flow rate supplied by air pump may be not enough for all crossflow velocity condition when the maximum height of beps is higher than the specified height the artificial upwelling system is effective as fig 8 shows the system could work in most time of one tide period when q a max is 1000 l min there is about 1 8 h long between the high tide and low tide that beps could not reach specified height although this maximum volume flow rate of injected air cannot guarantee the system works in all condition this system can run about 20 4 h a day in aoshan bay as the maximum volume flow rate of injected air decreases from 1000 l min to 800 l min the running time also change from 20 4 to 19 4 h a day 4 4 the optimal volume flow rate of air injection bringing the nutrient rich water to the surface can stimulate primary productivity of algae and phytoplankton fan et al 2016 karl and letelier 2008 lovelock and rapley 2007 how much air should be injected into the water to bring the nutrient rich overlying water up to sea surface if too much air is injected into the water beps will go above the specific height and the efficiency will be decreased while if the volume flow rate of injected air is not enough beps cannot reach the specified height to stimulate the marine primary productivity the relationship between the optimal volume flow rate of air injection and the maximum height of beps can be calculated by eqs 20 and 21 as the increasing of beps maximum height the volume flow rate of air injection increases and when crossflow velocity gets larger it needs more air to make beps reach the specified height under the effect of tides both sea level and crossflow velocity change with time how much should the design maximum volume flow rate of injected air be designed the design maximum volume flow rate of injected air q a d could be defined as the minimum volume flow rate of injected air required to reach specified height in all conditions when the crossflow velocity u max is maximum the water reaches mean sea level z m d and the optimal volume flow rate of air injection is 1133 l min fig 9 when the water reaches high tide crossflow velocity is small and it just need much less volume flow rate of air injection to simplify the model the influence of spring tide and neap tide isn t considered the crossflow velocity and sea level take on sinusoidal distribution to get the design volume flow rate of injected air q a d the tangency points between beps specified height h 0 s p e and maximum heights of beps under the design volume flow rate of injected air z m need to be calculated for aoshan bay the mean sea level is 8 25 m hence the maximum beps height need to reach 7 25 m the maximum crossflow velocity is 0 25 m s density difference is assumed to be 0 5 kg m3 in summer by changing the volume flow rate of injected air there is a critical point where all z m are just higher than h 0 s p e and it represents design volume flow rate of injected air under different density differences the tangency points are almost at the same place fig 10 however the design volume flow rates of injected air q a d are different and they respectively are 1145 1477 and 1661 l min as the density differences increase from 0 5 to 1 5 kg m3 obviously when the volume flow rate of air injection is controlled according to the sea level and crossflow velocity its efficiency is higher than the air injection mode which always use the maximum volume flow rate however we want to get numerical value of the improvement the total volume flow of two different conditions in 12 h are calculated by eqs 34 and 35 and the improved efficiency η is listed in table 3 34 q t 0 12 60 q a h 0 s p e t u t δ ρ d t 35 q t max q a d 12 60 36 η q t max q t q t max as table 3 shows there is a significant improvement of efficiency and it changes with the density differences from 8 33 to 12 38 the smaller density difference is the better controlled volume flow rate of air injection will performance 4 5 effect of density difference on bep the density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water changes with seasons and locations and the maximum density different often appears in summer the relative difference of density is about 0 1 0 4 pan et al 2015 for example in dong ji isles 30 07 n 122 46 e the density interface can be found at the depth of 17 m the ambience water density is 1014 kg m3 and density difference is about 1 kg m3 in summer qiang et al 2018 to study the effects of density difference about beps maximum height the volume flow rate of air injection and crossflow velocity the density difference δ ρ 0 1 4 0 kg m3 is chosen in the mathematical calculation there are three pictures shown the relationships respectively as follow the relationship between the density difference and bep s maximum height the volume flow rate of air injection and maximum effective crossflow velocity are calculated respectively by using eqs 19 20 and 22 with the increasing of density difference the bep s maximum height and maximum effective crossflow velocity will decrease however the optimal volume flow rate of air injection will increase from fig 11 a b and c when density difference increases from 0 5 to 4 kg m3 bep s maximum height and maximum effective crossflow velocity have an exponential decrease and the requirement of optimal volume flow rate of air injection increases 2 3 times because density difference will change with season and its obvious influence on other factors it needs to be measured frequently only the density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water is determined the calculation about other factors could be accurate 5 conclusions in this paper the effects of beps influence factors including volume flow rate of injected air crossflow velocity and density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water are studied theoretically and experimentally by using similarity criterion the model can adapt to field application experimental results are compared with theoretical results to confirm the performance of theoretical model although the presented model needs improvement the results of experiments and theoretical model is basically accordant three main influence factors of bep were investigated the first one is volume flow rate of injected air required to be controlled to make beps reach the specific height if the volume flow rate is insufficient beps cannot reach the specific height when too much air is injected into the water bep will rush out of water surface and part of kinetic energy is wasted therefore the efficiency will be decreased analyzing the effect of volume flow rate of injected air can help us determine the design maximum volume flow rate of air injection system and improve air injection efficiency by 8 33 12 38 secondly determining the feasible crossflow velocity could help us to figure out whether artificial upwelling system could work and evaluate the running time finally the density difference between nutrient rich water and surface water has significant influence on bep s maximum height feasible crossflow velocity and optimal volume flow rate of air injection it is necessary to measure the density difference accurately and frequently artificial upwelling could bring nutrient rich water up to euphotic zone to promote the growth of phytoplankton and increase the production of fishing grounds recognizing the effect of beps influence factor will be helpful to design artificial upwelling system for field application such as the artificial upwelling system in aoshan bay and improve air injection efficiency however the theoretical model proposed in this paper can only be used in unstratified crossflow beps characters in stratified crossflow needs to be studied in the future acknowledgements this research is financially funded by the national natural science funds of china no
