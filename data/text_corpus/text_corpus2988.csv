14940,conventional aerobic ch4 oxidizing bacteria mob are frequently detected in anoxic environments but their survival strategy and ecological contribution are still enigmatic here we explore the role of mob in enrichment cultures under o2 gradients and an iron rich lake sediment in situ by combining microbiological and geochemical techniques we found that enriched mob consortium used ferric oxides as alternative electron acceptors for oxidizing ch4 with the help of riboflavin when o2 was unavailable within the mob consortium mob transformed ch4 to low molecular weight organic matter such as acetate for consortium bacteria as a carbon source while the latter secrete riboflavin to facilitate extracellular electron transfer eet iron reduction coupled to ch4 oxidation mediated by the mob consortium was also demonstrated in situ reducing 40 3 of the ch4 emission in the studied lake sediment our study indicates how mobs survive under anoxia and expands the knowledge of this previously overlooked ch4 sink in iron rich sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane oxidation ferric oxides electron acceptors stable isotope metagenome data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ch4 is an important greenhouse gas that contributes about 16 to global warming and climate change rosentreter et al 2021 microbial ch4 oxidation acts as a biofilter and prevents over 90 of ch4 reaching the atmosphere dean et al 2018 traditionally ch4 oxidation can be divided into aerobic ch4 oxidation and anaerobic oxidation of ch4 aom according to whether o2 is the electron acceptor aerobic ch4 oxidizing bacteria mob within proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia phyla contain the ch4 monooxygenase which oxidizes ch4 to methanol mediated by o2 followed by subsequent oxidation via formaldehyde and formate to co2 due to the general o2 dependent characteristics of mob previous studies suggested that ch4 consumption mainly occurs at the oxic anoxic interface where the diffusion of ch4 from below and dissolved oxygen do from above provide a suitable niche for mob hanson and hanson 1996 reim et al 2012 below the oxic anoxic interface where o2 is depleted recent studies have reported ch4 oxidation coupled with various electron acceptors such as so4 2 no2 no3 and metal oxides boetius et al 2000 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 beal et al 2009 which are governed by distinct groups of anaerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions he et al 2019 however the interface between aerobic and anaerobic ch4 oxidation can be unclear with studies showing increasingly that mob can persist and even have unexpected transcriptional activity outside their main niches suggesting the use of other electron acceptors than o2 rahalkar et al 2009 biderre petit et al 2011 oswald et al 2016 naqvi et al 2018 thamdrup et al 2019 the metabolic potential that mob use no3 as an alternative electron acceptor in o2 limited conditions offers new directions for research kits et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 because some mob possess genetic material including genes encoding for denitrification they can catalyze both denitrification and ch4 oxidation independently when do is lower than 50 nm kits et al 2015 additionally the pyrophosphate mediated glycolytic pathway of mob and the consequent secretion of carbon intermediates under hypoxia provide trophic links between mob and denitrifiers in a consortium wherein mob excrete ch4 derived intermediates for denitrifiers as a carbon source and then the latter catalyze denitrification kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 the coupling between methanotrophy and denitrification mediated by mob potentially facilitates the rapid loss of reactive nitrogen to n2 and mitigates ch4 emissions to the atmosphere in freshwater ecosystems naqvi et al 2018 iron oxides could be an alternative electron acceptor for mob under o2 limited conditions bar or et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 he et al 2022 because cells cannot take up solid iron oxides extracellular electron transfer eet is important in microbial iron reduction there are three possible mechanisms involved electrically conductive pili e pili putative multiheme c type cytochromes mhcs and electron shuttles lovley 2017 the e pili are composed of a plia monomer e pilin that is homologous to type iv pila proteins and the electron shuttles are redox substances secreted by microbes such as flavin that can transport intracellular electrons out of the cell and transfer extracellular electrons holmes et al 2017 marsili et al 2008 some studies have found that mob or its enrichment contains key genes involved in eet cisternas et al 2018 however the microbial mechanism of using ferric oxides as the alternative electron acceptor by mob and its ecological contribution remain inconclusive given that iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth and generally abundant in lacustrine sediment using ferric oxides as electron acceptor maybe a critical lifestyle for mob and an important ch4 sink on early earth where anoxic conditions are ubiquitously present here we hypothesize that iron oxides could help mob survive under anoxia by eet in sediments of iron rich lakes to verify the hypothesis above an enriched mob consortium was obtained from the sediment of lake fuxian an iron rich freshwater lake followed by ch4 oxidation and iron reduction determination under decreasing o2 gradients then dna stable isotope probing dna sip linked to metagenome sequencing was conducted to reveal the metabolic pathways involved in ch4 oxidation and eet furthermore in situ microbial community was investigated based on 16s rrna gene sequencing at both dna and rna level combining with in situ porewater geochemistry and stable isotope tracing to unveil the ecological contribution of this ch4 sink mediated by mob in the ferruginous lake 2 methods 2 1 study site and sample collection lake fuxian is an iron rich freshwater lake in southwest china hypoxic hypolimnion and abundant ch4 and fe iii oxides in the sediment provide suitable conditions for our study li et al 2020 li et al 2021 in april july and december 2019 we retrieved sediment cores at the deepest site using a gravity corer fig s1 the sample collection and chemical analysis was detailed in supplementary materials 2 2 enrichment culture of an aerobic ch4 oxidizing bacteria mob consortium the purpose for enrichment here is to obtain a consortium within which mob is the core species and other species are maintained by the intermediate metabolites of ch4 oxidation approximately 1 g of sediment was inoculated into 20 ml of sterile ammonium mineral salt ams zheng et al 2020 medium in 100 ml headspace vials with 80 ml headspace of air after sealing with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps the headspace was injected with ch4 to obtain an initial concentration of 1 v v and incubated at 25 c with shaking 180 rpm enrichment cultures were transferred into fresh ams medium at a 1 20 dilution and the headspace was reestablished to an initial 1 v v ch4 concentration every week passage cultivation lasted for two years with headspace ch4 and co2 measurements before and after each transfer 2 3 iron reduction of mob enrichment under o2 gradients three headspace o2 concentration treatments including 20 o2 80 n2 2 o2 98 n2 and 0 o2 100 n2 were established in a hypoxia anoxia workstation baker ruskinn concept m 500 usa then 0 5 ml of mob enrichment was added to 10 ml of ams medium containing 20 mm ferrihydrite in 20 ml headspace vials followed by ch4 addition to obtain an initial concentration of 1 v v in the headspace treatment without ferrihydrite addition in each group was set as a control the headspace ch4 and dissolved fe2 were measured every 3 days and 9 days respectively the absorbance at 254 nm a254 and the riboflavin concentrations of the supernatant under different o2 concentrations on day 0 and day 27 were determined by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer shimadzu uv2700 japan fig s2 zanetti polzi et al 2017 furthermore the potential organic compounds derived from ch4 in the supernatant was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 usa equipped with a 4 6 250 mm agilent zorbax aq 5 micron column after 27 days mob enrichment in each o2 group was centrifuged at 12 000 g followed by filtration sterilization 0 22 μm the supernatant from the 2 o2 group was purged with high purity he 99 999 v v then added to the mob biomass in the 0 o2 group and incubated under anoxia with headspace ch4 and dissolved fe2 determination every 3 days due to the fact that the adsorbed solid fe ii is the major iron reduction product whereas the dissolved fe2 only account for a minor part at the end of incubation above data not shown as well as with the aim of verifying no o2 leakage during incubation we did a detailed analysis for solid fe ii and a real time monitoring for do in a 1 l air tight bottle detailed in supplementary materials moreover in the ferrihydrite addition group 1 ml of mixture supernatant ferrihydrite and biomass was centrifuged and the precipitate was extracted for analyzing solid fe ii according to cai et al 2018 the specific step are as follows 1 1 m mgcl2 at ph 7 for 2 h was used to extract adsorbed fe ii 2 1 m sodium acetate at ph 4 5 for 24 h to extract fe ii from fe ii carbonate cai et al 2018 2 4 dna sip and metagenome sequencing in order to clarify the microbial mechanism for that the supernatant from the 2 o2 group facilitated ch4 oxidation coupling to iron reduction under 0 o2 group incubations for sip were conducted in mob enrichment under 2 o2 with ferrihydrite addition the microcosms were injected with 13ch4 or 12ch4 99 atom 13c or 12c to 1 of the headspace and each treatment was performed in 8 replicates to obtain sufficient dna for metagenome sequencing after 4 weeks dna was extracted by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mo bio laboratories usa following the manufacturer s instructions samples of 2 μg dna were combined with cesium chloride cscl solution at an initial buoyant density bd of 1 725 g ml placed in beckman polyallomer quickseal centrifuge tubes 13 51 mm heat sealed and spun in an nvt 100 rotor via an optima xpn 100 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter usa at 50 000 rpm and 20 c for 44 h gradients were fractionated into 15 fractions with the bd ranging from 1 68 to 1 80 g ml by displacement with sterilized deionized water using a syringe pump dna in each fraction was purified according to a previous method neufeld et al 2007 the distribution of heavy fractions containing 13c labeled dna in gradient fractions was identified by qpcr using primers targeting the pmoa gene a189f mb661r and bacterial 16s rrna gene 515f 806r he et al 2022 barnett et al 2021 then at least 1 μg of heavy dna was used for metagenome sequencing the raw reads of metagenome sequencing were deposited into the national omics data encyclopedia node database with accession number oep002958 the procedures of metagenome sequencing and identification for key genes involved in ch4 oxidation and eet were detailed in supplementary materials 2 5 microbial community composition along sediment depth genomic dna and total rna were extracted from the sediment samples by using the fastdna spin kit for soil and fastrna pro soil direct kit respectively according to the manufacturer s instructions after rna extraction rna reverse transcription was immediately performed by using a quantinava reverse transcription kit qiagen gmbh germany and cdna was obtained the quality and quantity of dna and cdna were checked by using agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd1000 uv vis spectrophotometer the v4 v5 region of prokaryotic 16s rrna gene were amplified by pcr using primers 515f 907r then both dna and cdna library was paired end sequenced the raw reads of 16s rrna gene sequencing were deposited into the node database with accession number oep003601 the sequencing procedure was detailed in supplementary materials 2 6 profile model calculation the objective of utilizing the profile model here is to infer the potential electron acceptors coupled to ch4 oxidation by analyzing the overlap of the sediment layer between ch4 oxidation and the reduction of electron acceptors here the dataset of solute distribution along the sediment including ch4 do mn2 fe2 and so4 2 were analyzed by profile version 1 0 software it is worth noting that the dissolved mn2 and fe2 production rates are generally lower than mn iv and fe iii reduction rates because in many cases amorphous mn ii and fe ii solid species are the main reduction products melton et al 2014 kappler et al 2021 2 7 sediment microcosm incubation with isotope tracer here stable isotope tracer was used to estimate the relative contribution to ch4 oxidation by various electron acceptors prior to incubation sterile deionized water was added to the wet sediment at a ratio of 3 1 v w to make slurries under a magnetic stirrer in the anaerobic group the slurries were purged with high purity he for 1 h and then microcosms were established with a 10 ml slurry in 20 ml headspace vials in an anaerobic glovebox after preincubation on a shaker 180 rpm at room temperature for 2 days to remove the residual o2 the vials were injected with 100 μl of he degassed stock solutions of either sodium nitrate nano3 sodium nitrite nano2 birnessite na4mn14o27 9h2o ferrihydrite fe5ho8 4h2o and sodium sulfate na2so4 to give a final concentration of 10 mm for each reagent and control slurries were left unamended ferrihydrite and birnessite synthesis followed previous protocols conell and schwetmann 2003 golden et al 1987 the microcosms for the aerobic group were prepared in the same way as the anaerobic group except that the he was replaced by air and without preincubation finally 13ch4 was injected to obtain 1 v v of the headspace all microcosms were incubated on a shaker 180 rpm at 13 c in situ temperature of bottom water in lake fuxian triplicate vials were killed every 12 h by adding 300 μl of 50 w v zncl2 with 7 treatments 5 sediment layers 5 time points 3 replicates 525 microcosms in total and then the headspace 13co2 was determined using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer agilent 7890 5975c inert msd usa the ch4 oxidation rate was calculated by the slope difference of linear regression during time courses between the amendments and the control shen et al 2019 3 results 3 1 response of ch4 oxidation and iron reduction of mob enrichment to decreasing o2 conditions after two years enrichment an enriched mob consortium was obtained which consists of methylomonas and several heterotrophic bacteria but without anaerobic methanotrophs fig s3 response of ch4 oxidation and iron reduction of mob enrichment to decreasing o2 conditions was significantly different specifically under 20 o2 conditions the headspace ch4 concentration decreased from 672 49 3 μm to 10 5 0 6 μm every 9 days with a decreasing rate of 0 668 0 018 μmol ch4 d when ferrihydrite was not added no significant variation in ch4 oxidation was observed between ferrihydrite amendment and unamendment and almost no dissolved fe2 could be detected with ferrihydrite addition throughout the incubation under 2 o2 conditions the headspace ch4 concentration decreased from 641 57 1 μm to 381 31 7 μm every 9 days without ferrihydrite amendment moreover ch4 oxidation could be divided into two stages when regarding the third day as the turning point the headspace ch4 was quickly declined with a consumption rate of 0 586 0 061 μmol ch4 d at stage i and slowly dropped with a rate of 0 096 0 011 μmol ch4 d at stage ii resulting for a total decrease of 2 47 μmol ch4 ferrihydrite addition significantly enhanced ch4 oxidation at stage ii reducing the ch4 concentration to 281 25 5 μm with a total decrease of 3 42 μmol ch4 within 9 days simultaneously the dissolved fe2 consistently accumulated from 7 9 1 8 μm to 31 4 4 4 μm within 27 days in both ferrihydrite amendment and unamendment do was exhausted less than two days fig s4 under 0 o2 conditions almost no ch4 and iron reduction occurred in either ferrihydrite amendment or unamendment within 27 days when the supernatant from 2 o2 conditions on day 27 was added to enrichment incubated under 0 o2 with and without ferrihydrite a significant difference was observed in ferrihydrite amendments ch4 consumption occurred from 658 35 2 μm to 511 41 7 μm within 9 days with a decreasing rate of 0 098 0 011 μmol ch4 and the dissolved fe2 simultaneously increased from 7 7 0 4 μm to 17 1 2 4 μm while no ch4 oxidation was detected without ferrihydrite addition fig 1 a 1 b according to the real time monitoring of do and detailed analysis for solid fe ii in a 1 l air tight bottle the supernatant did not bring over o2 at the very beginning and also with no o2 leakage during the 9 days incubation fig 1 c at the same time the ratio of solid fe ii production and ch4 consumption 49 5 6 7 was close to the stoichiometric ratio of iron reduction and ch4 oxidation 8 1 fig 1 d the value of a254 ranged from 0 028 0 032 m 1 on day 0 with no significant differences among all groups however the a254 values for the 2 o2 group was increased to 0 074 0 007 m 1 and 0 072 0 004 m 1 with and without ferrihydrite addition respectively nearly double that in the 20 and 0 o2 groups fig 1 e similar trends were also observed in riboflavin concentration with maximum values of 1 59 0 03 mg l and 1 18 0 15 mg l under 2 o2 conditions on day 27 with and without ferrihydrite addition respectively fig 1 f the morphology characteristics of ferrihydrite varied significantly under o2 gradients wherein the ferrihydrite was dispersed with smooth surface under 20 o2 and 0 o2 conditions but agglomerated together with ellipsoidal substances attached to the surface under 2 o2 conditions figs s5 s6 3 2 active microorganisms with fe iii amendment according to dna sip the heavy dna fractions with buoyant densities between 1 74 and 1 76 g ml corresponded to the microorganisms that actively consumed 13ch4 and eventual cross feeding fig s7 nearly 99 2 of the microbial community was covered through metagenome sequencing of the heavy dna samples fig s8 wherein a total of nine species including six high quality mags with an integrity of 94 6 99 9 and pollution rates below 5 were found among these species 31 1 and 35 2 of the reads were assigned to methylomonas and methylophilus belonging to type i mob and methylotrophic bacteria respectively the other four heterotrophic bacteria belonging to pararheinheimera pseudomonas didemnitutus and 46 32 genera were also detected accounting for 13 8 9 4 8 0 and 1 2 of the total reads respectively table s1 3 3 key genes involved in ch4 metabolism and eet the six mags recovered from heavy dna metagenome encoded a variety of functional genes related to ch4 metabolism and eet the genes pmoa pmob and pmoc encoding particulate ch4 monooxygenase pmmo which catalyzes ch4 oxidation to methanol were only detected in the mob methylomonas the genes mxaa mxac mxad mxag mxaj mxak and mxal encoding methanol dehydrogenase mdh which further catalyzes methanol oxidation to formaldehyde were detected in methylomonas and methylophilus however neither methylomonas nor methylophilus have complete genes involved in the serine cycle and rump cycle the two pathways for formaldehyde assimilation the genes involved in the tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt dependent oxidation of formaldehyde to formate including fae mtdb mch and ftr as well as the genes involved in formate oxidation to co2 including fdha fdhf and fdsd were detected in methylomonas and methylophilus moreover some genes encoding pyruvate fermentation ec 1 1 1 37 ec 4 2 1 2 ec 1 3 5 4 ec 1 1 2 4 ec 2 3 1 8 ec 2 7 2 1 were detected in methylomonas enabling pyruvate to succinate and acetate fig 2 a 2 b nearly all genes encoding aerobic respiration including four complexes and coenzyme q were detected in the six mags additionally the genes encoding eet are ubiquitous in these mags first the pila gene encoding e pili was detected in methylomonas methylophilus pseudomonas and perarheinheimera second the genes involved in putative periplasmic mhcs were detected in methylomonas methylophilus didemnitutus and 46 32 however putative extracellular mhcs was only detected in methylomonas third the genes encoding electron shuttles particularly riboflavin including riba ribba ribd ribe ribf and ribh were present in all six mags fig 3 a 3 b 3 4 distribution of methanotrophic microbes along sediment depth at the dna level many mob genera such as methylomicrobium methylobacter methylocystis and methylocaldum consistently presented along the sediment depth jointly accounting for 1 4 4 3 of the total prokaryotic abundance although anaerobic methanotrophs were also detected in most of the sediment layers the relative abundances of anme 2d and nc 10 bacteria were below 0 09 and 0 07 respectively at the rna level methylomonas was the dominant mob genus along the sediments accounting for 2 7 9 6 of the total prokaryotic abundance fig s9 other mob such as methylobacterium methylomicrobium methylobacter and methylocaldum were also transcriptionally active in the deeper sediment layers jointly accounting for 0 05 1 2 as for anaerobic methanotrophs anme 2d was detected below 4 cm of the depth and corresponded to 0 01 0 14 of the total active microbes and nc 10 bacteria only present at few depths with the relative abundance of 0 03 0 14 the methylotrophs methylotenera and methylophilus were transcriptionally active throughout the sediment layers with a relative abundance of 4 9 17 4 and 0 05 0 4 respectively fig 4 3 5 in situ electron acceptor characteristics along sediment depth the ch4 concentration decreased from 2000 μm at a depth of 20 cm to 74 1 μm at the sediment water interface swi δ13c ch4 significantly enriched and most of the enrichment was found in the upper 8 cm of the sediment where δ13c ch4 increased from 82 to 69 at the swi the do consistently decreased from the overlying water to the sediment with an o2 penetration depth less than 0 2 cm the extractable no2 and no3 were lower than 0 05 μmol g dw and 0 15 μmol g dw respectively with extractable nh4 concentrations ranging from 2 6 μmol g dw the concentrations of mn iv oxides increased from 5 μmol g dw at the swi then decreased along the sediment depth and reached a maximum value of 9 μmol g dw at 2 5 cm accompanied by a maximum mn2 concentration of 35 μm the concentration of fe iii oxides consistently increased from 20 μmol g dw to 55 7 μmol g dw along depth with the dissolved fe2 concentration increasing from 10 μm at the swi to 50 μm at a depth of 16 cm the so4 2 concentration decreased from the swi to a depth of 5 6 cm except for a few layers in april s2 was always below the detection limit fig 5 a 3 6 ch4 oxidation rates coupled to various electron acceptors along the sediments the profile model showed that ch4 oxidation overlapped with aerobic respiration and the reduction of mn iv fe iii and so4 2 at the depth of 0 07 0 2 cm 0 4 cm 3 10 cm and 0 7 cm respectively fig 5 b according to stable isotope tracing aerobic ch4 oxidation was the major pathway to mitigate ch4 at the oxic layer reaching 3 4 nmol cm3 d in the upper 1 cm of sediment at the anoxic layers fe iii and mn iv reduction coupled with ch4 oxidation dominated the ch4 sink with ranges of 3 8 13 4 nmol cm3 d and 1 2 10 1 nmol cm3 d jointly accounting for 62 5 73 8 of the total ch4 sink in addition ch4 oxidation coupled with the reduction of no2 no3 and so4 2 also occurred along the depth with 1 6 10 8 times lower rates than that with the reduction of fe iii when converting the ch4 oxidation rate at each layer to the whole sediment we found that fe iii and mn iv were the most two important electron acceptors mitigating 40 3 and 30 0 of the ch4 produced in the deeper layer respectively followed by no3 no2 and so4 2 with each of them oxidizing 8 8 9 2 of the ch4 because most of the ch4 was consumed in the anoxic sediment layers by the electron acceptors above only 2 7 of the ch4 was oxidized in the upper oxic layers fig 5 c 4 discussion 4 1 fe iii oxides and electron shuttles help mob circumvent the requirement of o2 under anoxia an enrichment dominated by methylomonas and several other heterotrophs was obtained to study the potential iron reduction capacity under decreasing o2 concentrations under 20 o2 conditions nearly no dissolved fe2 was produced because sufficient o2 inhibited microbial iron reduction melton et al 2014 kappler et al 2021 headspace ch4 was oxidized linearly and fe iii amendment had no significant effect on ch4 oxidation suggesting that o2 was the sole electron acceptor for ch4 oxidation dissolved fe2 concentration consistently increased under 2 o2 conditions fig 1 a 1 b similar to previous results that a type i mob methylomonas catalyzed ch4 dependent iron reduction under 0 89 mg l o2 zheng et al 2020 our incubation test also showed that o2 was exhausted less than two days under initial 2 o2 conditions fig s4 and the lack of o2 slowed down ch4 oxidation thereafter furthermore fe iii addition enhanced ch4 oxidation by nearly 40 indicating that iron oxides probably act as a potential alternative electron acceptor for mob when o2 is limited under 0 o2 which is more suitable for iron reduction neither ch4 oxidation nor fe iii reduction occurred fig 1 a 1 b although ch4 was still not consumed without fe iii addition when the supernatant of 2 o2 group was combined with mob biomass in 0 o2 group both processes reoccurred near a stoichiometric ratio by adding ferrihydrite fig 1 d these results suggest that some mediators in 2 o2 group may link ch4 oxidation and iron reduction under anoxia given that iron reduction relies on eet including mhc nanowires and electron shuttles lovley 2017 we suspected that electron shuttles may play an important role in the occurrence of iron reduction because only this mechanism involves extracellular secretion into the shared extracellular metabolite pool okamoto et al 2014 here we found riboflavin a typical kind of electron shuttle in 2 o2 group was significantly higher than that in the 20 and 0 o2 groups especially with ferrihydrite amendment fig 1 f moreover combining the electrochemical test and the determination of other potential electron shuttles such as phenazine we verified that riboflavin is the dominant electron mediator in the supernatant figs s10 s12 previous studies also showed that some fe iii reducing bacteria could secrete flavins to promote eet and further reduce insoluble metal oxides cisternas et al 2018 vitreschak et al 2002 consequently riboflavin is a potential mediator to assist mob in circumventing the requirement of o2 and is coupled to iron reduction under anoxia 4 2 microbial mechanism for mob enrichment coupling ch4 oxidation with iron reduction in the heavy dna layer of the sip microcosm only one kind of mob methylomonas was present containing a full complement of key genes involved in ch4 oxidation and enabling it to oxidize ch4 completely to co2 fig 2 a the existence of multiple active heterotrophic bacteria indicated that they may rely on ch4 conversion to obtain carbon sources table s1 he et al 2022 krause et al 2017 previous studies have reported that mob can release low molecular weight organic matter lmw om through glycolysis under hypoxia kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 here methylomonas also carried a variety of genes for pyruvate fermentation and was a potential producer of succinic acid and acetate fig 2 b consequently these ch4 derived fermentation products can form cross feeding between methanotrophs and heterotrophic bacteria brankovits et al 2017 a recent study further verified that 56 6 57 8 of the ch4 transmitted to lmw om in o2 limited environments which was significantly higher than that in high o2 conditions 36 1 37 6 he et al 2020 in this study we also found that the a254 values in 2 o2 group were nearly double those in 20 and 0 o2 groups fig 1 e indicating that more ch4 was converted as lmw om fu et al 2006 acetate and formaldehyde are the major lmw om derived from ch4 in 2 o2 conditions whereas that in 20 and 0 o2 conditions are negligible fig s13 additionally the aggregation under 2 o2 may be attributed to ch4 transformation to extracellular polymeric substance eps formation wei et al 2015 all six mags contained genes involved in riboflavin metabolism besides aerobic respiratory pathway enabling them to complete iron reduction through riboflavin secretion when o2 is limited melin and hellwig 2020 shi et al 2016 fig 3 a 3 b notably four of the six mags contained e pili and no microorganisms contained both periplasmic mhc and outer membrane mhc except for methylomonas fig 3 b implicating riboflavin secretion as the main mechanism for eet in the present study thus mob and these heterotrophic bacteria is likely to form a consortium to oxidize ch4 with ferrihydrite amendments specifically part of the ch4 was catalyzed to lmw om like acetate and formaldehyde by mob and further utilized by heterotrophic bacteria moreover the electron donated by ch4 was transported to extracellular and accepted by fe iii oxides with the help riboflavin fig 6 in natural habitats electron shuttles such as flavins are ubiquitous at nanomolar concentrations making the sediments electric monteverde et al 2018 pennisi 2020 multiple kinds of lmw om were also present in the iron rich sediment of lake fuxian such as acetate 3 7 mg l formate 1 2 mg l and lactate 0 04 mg l thus we speculate that active mob may also exist in the anoxic sediments of lake fuxian as we expected various mob indeed existed and were transcriptionally active in the anoxic sediment layers below the depth of 0 2 cm orders of magnitude more abundant than anme 2d fig 4 results of qpcr also showed that mob dominated methanotrophs with anme 2d and nc 10 only present in few layers but other kinds of anme consistently absent fig s14 this phenomenon was in accordance with many previous studies rahalkar et al 2009 biderre petit et al 2011 oswald et al 2016 naqvi et al 2018 thamdrup et al 2019 additionally some other taxa associated with the heavy fractions obtained from sip incubations were also associated with in situ sediments at rna level such as pseudomonas 2 3 8 0 and methylophilus 0 1 0 4 fig s9 this shows that the mob consortium may also in an active state in the sediment which has a potential to couple ch4 oxidation with iron reduction under anoxia 4 3 geochemical evidence for ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction the profile model showed that ch4 was net oxidized in nearly the upper 8 cm of sediments fig 5 b direct evidence for ch4 oxidation was the systematic shift in δ13c ch4 in the upper 8 cm due to that isotopically light ch4 was preferentially consumed during ch4 oxidation and led to a progressive enrichment of the residual ch4 in δ13c ch4 alperin et al 1988 fig 5 a dissolved and extractable nox in the sediment were likely depleted along the whole sediment depth making nox unlikely to be the dominant electron acceptors for ch4 oxidation in lake fuxian the isotope tracer tests further verified that the contributions of no3 and no2 as the electron acceptors never exceeded 10 of the total ch4 sink throughout the sediment fig 5 a probably because of the low transcriptional activity of anme 2d and nc 10 bacteria fig 4 ferric oxides were consistently present throughout the sediment with the dissolved fe2 generally increasing downward fig 5 a suggesting that iron reduction increases along the depth the contents of fe iii oxides and dissolved fe2 in lake fuxian are close to those in lake kinneret where ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction has also been demonstrated sivan et al 2011 profile model further showed overlap between fe2 production and ch4 oxidation within the depth of 3 10 cm fig 5 b indicating that fe iii oxides may be electron acceptors for ch4 oxidation although an order of magnitude lower than fe iii oxides and fe2 mn iv oxides and mn2 were also consistently present along the depth with overlap between mn2 production and ch4 oxidation within the depth of 0 4 cm fig 5 b indicating that mn iv oxides may be the electron acceptors for ch4 oxidation the stable isotope tracer test further demonstrated that fe iii and mn iv as the electron acceptor contributed 40 3 and 30 0 of the total ch4 sink respectively fig 5 c to our knowledge only two studies have focused on the contribution of ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction to total ch4 removal both of which focused on coastal sediments by using geochemical models egger et al 2015 rooze et al 2016 these results showed that ferric oxides as the electron acceptor only account for 3 10 of the total ch4 sink in coastal sediments partly attributed to the high so4 2 concentration 5 6 mm enhanced the competition of so4 2 and fe iii for ch4 oxidation although the profile model showed an overlap between so4 2 reduction and ch4 oxidation in the upper 7 cm of the sediments fig 5 b the electron donor of so4 2 reduction was more likely to be organic matter instead of ch4 based on the stable isotope tracer test ch4 oxidation rate was only 1 6 2 9 nmol cm3 d under so4 2 amendment fig 5 c which was significantly lower than that under fe iii and mn iv amendment in order to rule out that ch4 oxidation is coupled to a cryptic sulfur cycle su et al 2020 which could be supported by metal oxides through oxidation of reduced sulfur species to so4 2 the sulfate reduction inhibitor 20 mm of molybdate was added to the sediment and results showed that there was no significant differences between molybdate amendment and unamendment indicating the electron acceptor of ch4 oxidation was fe iii instead of so4 2 re oxidized by fe iii fig s15 5 conclusion from a microcosmic to macroscopic perspective our study provides evidence that mob can couple ch4 oxidation and fe iii reduction under anoxia with the help of electron shuttles such as riboflavin we cannot rule out that mob survive with microaerobic condition that is lower than the detection limit of microelectrode 0 625 μm but such a low do concentration could hardly maintain ch4 oxidation for over a week there is also a possibility that some kinds of oxygenic processes provide o2 for mob and immediately consumed by the latter however no genes encoding for oxygenic processes like nitric oxide dismutase in nc 10 bacteria and methanobactins mediated o2 generation in some alphaproteobacteria mob dershwitz et al 2021 are found in our mag data consequently we believe mob have a metabolic versatility under anoxia which is outside their preferential geochemical niche moreover this new kind of ch4 oxidation pathway is a considerable ch4 sink that contributes over 40 of the total ch4 consumption in an iron rich freshwater lake given that iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth fe iii as alternative electron acceptors to oxidize ch4 by mob may be a widespread important ch4 sink and potentially played a crucial role in the ancient atmosphere which contained limited o2 but abundant ch4 author contributions b l b l h p x and q l w designed the research b l q

14940,conventional aerobic ch4 oxidizing bacteria mob are frequently detected in anoxic environments but their survival strategy and ecological contribution are still enigmatic here we explore the role of mob in enrichment cultures under o2 gradients and an iron rich lake sediment in situ by combining microbiological and geochemical techniques we found that enriched mob consortium used ferric oxides as alternative electron acceptors for oxidizing ch4 with the help of riboflavin when o2 was unavailable within the mob consortium mob transformed ch4 to low molecular weight organic matter such as acetate for consortium bacteria as a carbon source while the latter secrete riboflavin to facilitate extracellular electron transfer eet iron reduction coupled to ch4 oxidation mediated by the mob consortium was also demonstrated in situ reducing 40 3 of the ch4 emission in the studied lake sediment our study indicates how mobs survive under anoxia and expands the knowledge of this previously overlooked ch4 sink in iron rich sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane oxidation ferric oxides electron acceptors stable isotope metagenome data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ch4 is an important greenhouse gas that contributes about 16 to global warming and climate change rosentreter et al 2021 microbial ch4 oxidation acts as a biofilter and prevents over 90 of ch4 reaching the atmosphere dean et al 2018 traditionally ch4 oxidation can be divided into aerobic ch4 oxidation and anaerobic oxidation of ch4 aom according to whether o2 is the electron acceptor aerobic ch4 oxidizing bacteria mob within proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia phyla contain the ch4 monooxygenase which oxidizes ch4 to methanol mediated by o2 followed by subsequent oxidation via formaldehyde and formate to co2 due to the general o2 dependent characteristics of mob previous studies suggested that ch4 consumption mainly occurs at the oxic anoxic interface where the diffusion of ch4 from below and dissolved oxygen do from above provide a suitable niche for mob hanson and hanson 1996 reim et al 2012 below the oxic anoxic interface where o2 is depleted recent studies have reported ch4 oxidation coupled with various electron acceptors such as so4 2 no2 no3 and metal oxides boetius et al 2000 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 beal et al 2009 which are governed by distinct groups of anaerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions he et al 2019 however the interface between aerobic and anaerobic ch4 oxidation can be unclear with studies showing increasingly that mob can persist and even have unexpected transcriptional activity outside their main niches suggesting the use of other electron acceptors than o2 rahalkar et al 2009 biderre petit et al 2011 oswald et al 2016 naqvi et al 2018 thamdrup et al 2019 the metabolic potential that mob use no3 as an alternative electron acceptor in o2 limited conditions offers new directions for research kits et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 because some mob possess genetic material including genes encoding for denitrification they can catalyze both denitrification and ch4 oxidation independently when do is lower than 50 nm kits et al 2015 additionally the pyrophosphate mediated glycolytic pathway of mob and the consequent secretion of carbon intermediates under hypoxia provide trophic links between mob and denitrifiers in a consortium wherein mob excrete ch4 derived intermediates for denitrifiers as a carbon source and then the latter catalyze denitrification kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 the coupling between methanotrophy and denitrification mediated by mob potentially facilitates the rapid loss of reactive nitrogen to n2 and mitigates ch4 emissions to the atmosphere in freshwater ecosystems naqvi et al 2018 iron oxides could be an alternative electron acceptor for mob under o2 limited conditions bar or et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 he et al 2022 because cells cannot take up solid iron oxides extracellular electron transfer eet is important in microbial iron reduction there are three possible mechanisms involved electrically conductive pili e pili putative multiheme c type cytochromes mhcs and electron shuttles lovley 2017 the e pili are composed of a plia monomer e pilin that is homologous to type iv pila proteins and the electron shuttles are redox substances secreted by microbes such as flavin that can transport intracellular electrons out of the cell and transfer extracellular electrons holmes et al 2017 marsili et al 2008 some studies have found that mob or its enrichment contains key genes involved in eet cisternas et al 2018 however the microbial mechanism of using ferric oxides as the alternative electron acceptor by mob and its ecological contribution remain inconclusive given that iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth and generally abundant in lacustrine sediment using ferric oxides as electron acceptor maybe a critical lifestyle for mob and an important ch4 sink on early earth where anoxic conditions are ubiquitously present here we hypothesize that iron oxides could help mob survive under anoxia by eet in sediments of iron rich lakes to verify the hypothesis above an enriched mob consortium was obtained from the sediment of lake fuxian an iron rich freshwater lake followed by ch4 oxidation and iron reduction determination under decreasing o2 gradients then dna stable isotope probing dna sip linked to metagenome sequencing was conducted to reveal the metabolic pathways involved in ch4 oxidation and eet furthermore in situ microbial community was investigated based on 16s rrna gene sequencing at both dna and rna level combining with in situ porewater geochemistry and stable isotope tracing to unveil the ecological contribution of this ch4 sink mediated by mob in the ferruginous lake 2 methods 2 1 study site and sample collection lake fuxian is an iron rich freshwater lake in southwest china hypoxic hypolimnion and abundant ch4 and fe iii oxides in the sediment provide suitable conditions for our study li et al 2020 li et al 2021 in april july and december 2019 we retrieved sediment cores at the deepest site using a gravity corer fig s1 the sample collection and chemical analysis was detailed in supplementary materials 2 2 enrichment culture of an aerobic ch4 oxidizing bacteria mob consortium the purpose for enrichment here is to obtain a consortium within which mob is the core species and other species are maintained by the intermediate metabolites of ch4 oxidation approximately 1 g of sediment was inoculated into 20 ml of sterile ammonium mineral salt ams zheng et al 2020 medium in 100 ml headspace vials with 80 ml headspace of air after sealing with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps the headspace was injected with ch4 to obtain an initial concentration of 1 v v and incubated at 25 c with shaking 180 rpm enrichment cultures were transferred into fresh ams medium at a 1 20 dilution and the headspace was reestablished to an initial 1 v v ch4 concentration every week passage cultivation lasted for two years with headspace ch4 and co2 measurements before and after each transfer 2 3 iron reduction of mob enrichment under o2 gradients three headspace o2 concentration treatments including 20 o2 80 n2 2 o2 98 n2 and 0 o2 100 n2 were established in a hypoxia anoxia workstation baker ruskinn concept m 500 usa then 0 5 ml of mob enrichment was added to 10 ml of ams medium containing 20 mm ferrihydrite in 20 ml headspace vials followed by ch4 addition to obtain an initial concentration of 1 v v in the headspace treatment without ferrihydrite addition in each group was set as a control the headspace ch4 and dissolved fe2 were measured every 3 days and 9 days respectively the absorbance at 254 nm a254 and the riboflavin concentrations of the supernatant under different o2 concentrations on day 0 and day 27 were determined by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer shimadzu uv2700 japan fig s2 zanetti polzi et al 2017 furthermore the potential organic compounds derived from ch4 in the supernatant was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 usa equipped with a 4 6 250 mm agilent zorbax aq 5 micron column after 27 days mob enrichment in each o2 group was centrifuged at 12 000 g followed by filtration sterilization 0 22 μm the supernatant from the 2 o2 group was purged with high purity he 99 999 v v then added to the mob biomass in the 0 o2 group and incubated under anoxia with headspace ch4 and dissolved fe2 determination every 3 days due to the fact that the adsorbed solid fe ii is the major iron reduction product whereas the dissolved fe2 only account for a minor part at the end of incubation above data not shown as well as with the aim of verifying no o2 leakage during incubation we did a detailed analysis for solid fe ii and a real time monitoring for do in a 1 l air tight bottle detailed in supplementary materials moreover in the ferrihydrite addition group 1 ml of mixture supernatant ferrihydrite and biomass was centrifuged and the precipitate was extracted for analyzing solid fe ii according to cai et al 2018 the specific step are as follows 1 1 m mgcl2 at ph 7 for 2 h was used to extract adsorbed fe ii 2 1 m sodium acetate at ph 4 5 for 24 h to extract fe ii from fe ii carbonate cai et al 2018 2 4 dna sip and metagenome sequencing in order to clarify the microbial mechanism for that the supernatant from the 2 o2 group facilitated ch4 oxidation coupling to iron reduction under 0 o2 group incubations for sip were conducted in mob enrichment under 2 o2 with ferrihydrite addition the microcosms were injected with 13ch4 or 12ch4 99 atom 13c or 12c to 1 of the headspace and each treatment was performed in 8 replicates to obtain sufficient dna for metagenome sequencing after 4 weeks dna was extracted by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mo bio laboratories usa following the manufacturer s instructions samples of 2 μg dna were combined with cesium chloride cscl solution at an initial buoyant density bd of 1 725 g ml placed in beckman polyallomer quickseal centrifuge tubes 13 51 mm heat sealed and spun in an nvt 100 rotor via an optima xpn 100 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter usa at 50 000 rpm and 20 c for 44 h gradients were fractionated into 15 fractions with the bd ranging from 1 68 to 1 80 g ml by displacement with sterilized deionized water using a syringe pump dna in each fraction was purified according to a previous method neufeld et al 2007 the distribution of heavy fractions containing 13c labeled dna in gradient fractions was identified by qpcr using primers targeting the pmoa gene a189f mb661r and bacterial 16s rrna gene 515f 806r he et al 2022 barnett et al 2021 then at least 1 μg of heavy dna was used for metagenome sequencing the raw reads of metagenome sequencing were deposited into the national omics data encyclopedia node database with accession number oep002958 the procedures of metagenome sequencing and identification for key genes involved in ch4 oxidation and eet were detailed in supplementary materials 2 5 microbial community composition along sediment depth genomic dna and total rna were extracted from the sediment samples by using the fastdna spin kit for soil and fastrna pro soil direct kit respectively according to the manufacturer s instructions after rna extraction rna reverse transcription was immediately performed by using a quantinava reverse transcription kit qiagen gmbh germany and cdna was obtained the quality and quantity of dna and cdna were checked by using agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd1000 uv vis spectrophotometer the v4 v5 region of prokaryotic 16s rrna gene were amplified by pcr using primers 515f 907r then both dna and cdna library was paired end sequenced the raw reads of 16s rrna gene sequencing were deposited into the node database with accession number oep003601 the sequencing procedure was detailed in supplementary materials 2 6 profile model calculation the objective of utilizing the profile model here is to infer the potential electron acceptors coupled to ch4 oxidation by analyzing the overlap of the sediment layer between ch4 oxidation and the reduction of electron acceptors here the dataset of solute distribution along the sediment including ch4 do mn2 fe2 and so4 2 were analyzed by profile version 1 0 software it is worth noting that the dissolved mn2 and fe2 production rates are generally lower than mn iv and fe iii reduction rates because in many cases amorphous mn ii and fe ii solid species are the main reduction products melton et al 2014 kappler et al 2021 2 7 sediment microcosm incubation with isotope tracer here stable isotope tracer was used to estimate the relative contribution to ch4 oxidation by various electron acceptors prior to incubation sterile deionized water was added to the wet sediment at a ratio of 3 1 v w to make slurries under a magnetic stirrer in the anaerobic group the slurries were purged with high purity he for 1 h and then microcosms were established with a 10 ml slurry in 20 ml headspace vials in an anaerobic glovebox after preincubation on a shaker 180 rpm at room temperature for 2 days to remove the residual o2 the vials were injected with 100 μl of he degassed stock solutions of either sodium nitrate nano3 sodium nitrite nano2 birnessite na4mn14o27 9h2o ferrihydrite fe5ho8 4h2o and sodium sulfate na2so4 to give a final concentration of 10 mm for each reagent and control slurries were left unamended ferrihydrite and birnessite synthesis followed previous protocols conell and schwetmann 2003 golden et al 1987 the microcosms for the aerobic group were prepared in the same way as the anaerobic group except that the he was replaced by air and without preincubation finally 13ch4 was injected to obtain 1 v v of the headspace all microcosms were incubated on a shaker 180 rpm at 13 c in situ temperature of bottom water in lake fuxian triplicate vials were killed every 12 h by adding 300 μl of 50 w v zncl2 with 7 treatments 5 sediment layers 5 time points 3 replicates 525 microcosms in total and then the headspace 13co2 was determined using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer agilent 7890 5975c inert msd usa the ch4 oxidation rate was calculated by the slope difference of linear regression during time courses between the amendments and the control shen et al 2019 3 results 3 1 response of ch4 oxidation and iron reduction of mob enrichment to decreasing o2 conditions after two years enrichment an enriched mob consortium was obtained which consists of methylomonas and several heterotrophic bacteria but without anaerobic methanotrophs fig s3 response of ch4 oxidation and iron reduction of mob enrichment to decreasing o2 conditions was significantly different specifically under 20 o2 conditions the headspace ch4 concentration decreased from 672 49 3 μm to 10 5 0 6 μm every 9 days with a decreasing rate of 0 668 0 018 μmol ch4 d when ferrihydrite was not added no significant variation in ch4 oxidation was observed between ferrihydrite amendment and unamendment and almost no dissolved fe2 could be detected with ferrihydrite addition throughout the incubation under 2 o2 conditions the headspace ch4 concentration decreased from 641 57 1 μm to 381 31 7 μm every 9 days without ferrihydrite amendment moreover ch4 oxidation could be divided into two stages when regarding the third day as the turning point the headspace ch4 was quickly declined with a consumption rate of 0 586 0 061 μmol ch4 d at stage i and slowly dropped with a rate of 0 096 0 011 μmol ch4 d at stage ii resulting for a total decrease of 2 47 μmol ch4 ferrihydrite addition significantly enhanced ch4 oxidation at stage ii reducing the ch4 concentration to 281 25 5 μm with a total decrease of 3 42 μmol ch4 within 9 days simultaneously the dissolved fe2 consistently accumulated from 7 9 1 8 μm to 31 4 4 4 μm within 27 days in both ferrihydrite amendment and unamendment do was exhausted less than two days fig s4 under 0 o2 conditions almost no ch4 and iron reduction occurred in either ferrihydrite amendment or unamendment within 27 days when the supernatant from 2 o2 conditions on day 27 was added to enrichment incubated under 0 o2 with and without ferrihydrite a significant difference was observed in ferrihydrite amendments ch4 consumption occurred from 658 35 2 μm to 511 41 7 μm within 9 days with a decreasing rate of 0 098 0 011 μmol ch4 and the dissolved fe2 simultaneously increased from 7 7 0 4 μm to 17 1 2 4 μm while no ch4 oxidation was detected without ferrihydrite addition fig 1 a 1 b according to the real time monitoring of do and detailed analysis for solid fe ii in a 1 l air tight bottle the supernatant did not bring over o2 at the very beginning and also with no o2 leakage during the 9 days incubation fig 1 c at the same time the ratio of solid fe ii production and ch4 consumption 49 5 6 7 was close to the stoichiometric ratio of iron reduction and ch4 oxidation 8 1 fig 1 d the value of a254 ranged from 0 028 0 032 m 1 on day 0 with no significant differences among all groups however the a254 values for the 2 o2 group was increased to 0 074 0 007 m 1 and 0 072 0 004 m 1 with and without ferrihydrite addition respectively nearly double that in the 20 and 0 o2 groups fig 1 e similar trends were also observed in riboflavin concentration with maximum values of 1 59 0 03 mg l and 1 18 0 15 mg l under 2 o2 conditions on day 27 with and without ferrihydrite addition respectively fig 1 f the morphology characteristics of ferrihydrite varied significantly under o2 gradients wherein the ferrihydrite was dispersed with smooth surface under 20 o2 and 0 o2 conditions but agglomerated together with ellipsoidal substances attached to the surface under 2 o2 conditions figs s5 s6 3 2 active microorganisms with fe iii amendment according to dna sip the heavy dna fractions with buoyant densities between 1 74 and 1 76 g ml corresponded to the microorganisms that actively consumed 13ch4 and eventual cross feeding fig s7 nearly 99 2 of the microbial community was covered through metagenome sequencing of the heavy dna samples fig s8 wherein a total of nine species including six high quality mags with an integrity of 94 6 99 9 and pollution rates below 5 were found among these species 31 1 and 35 2 of the reads were assigned to methylomonas and methylophilus belonging to type i mob and methylotrophic bacteria respectively the other four heterotrophic bacteria belonging to pararheinheimera pseudomonas didemnitutus and 46 32 genera were also detected accounting for 13 8 9 4 8 0 and 1 2 of the total reads respectively table s1 3 3 key genes involved in ch4 metabolism and eet the six mags recovered from heavy dna metagenome encoded a variety of functional genes related to ch4 metabolism and eet the genes pmoa pmob and pmoc encoding particulate ch4 monooxygenase pmmo which catalyzes ch4 oxidation to methanol were only detected in the mob methylomonas the genes mxaa mxac mxad mxag mxaj mxak and mxal encoding methanol dehydrogenase mdh which further catalyzes methanol oxidation to formaldehyde were detected in methylomonas and methylophilus however neither methylomonas nor methylophilus have complete genes involved in the serine cycle and rump cycle the two pathways for formaldehyde assimilation the genes involved in the tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt dependent oxidation of formaldehyde to formate including fae mtdb mch and ftr as well as the genes involved in formate oxidation to co2 including fdha fdhf and fdsd were detected in methylomonas and methylophilus moreover some genes encoding pyruvate fermentation ec 1 1 1 37 ec 4 2 1 2 ec 1 3 5 4 ec 1 1 2 4 ec 2 3 1 8 ec 2 7 2 1 were detected in methylomonas enabling pyruvate to succinate and acetate fig 2 a 2 b nearly all genes encoding aerobic respiration including four complexes and coenzyme q were detected in the six mags additionally the genes encoding eet are ubiquitous in these mags first the pila gene encoding e pili was detected in methylomonas methylophilus pseudomonas and perarheinheimera second the genes involved in putative periplasmic mhcs were detected in methylomonas methylophilus didemnitutus and 46 32 however putative extracellular mhcs was only detected in methylomonas third the genes encoding electron shuttles particularly riboflavin including riba ribba ribd ribe ribf and ribh were present in all six mags fig 3 a 3 b 3 4 distribution of methanotrophic microbes along sediment depth at the dna level many mob genera such as methylomicrobium methylobacter methylocystis and methylocaldum consistently presented along the sediment depth jointly accounting for 1 4 4 3 of the total prokaryotic abundance although anaerobic methanotrophs were also detected in most of the sediment layers the relative abundances of anme 2d and nc 10 bacteria were below 0 09 and 0 07 respectively at the rna level methylomonas was the dominant mob genus along the sediments accounting for 2 7 9 6 of the total prokaryotic abundance fig s9 other mob such as methylobacterium methylomicrobium methylobacter and methylocaldum were also transcriptionally active in the deeper sediment layers jointly accounting for 0 05 1 2 as for anaerobic methanotrophs anme 2d was detected below 4 cm of the depth and corresponded to 0 01 0 14 of the total active microbes and nc 10 bacteria only present at few depths with the relative abundance of 0 03 0 14 the methylotrophs methylotenera and methylophilus were transcriptionally active throughout the sediment layers with a relative abundance of 4 9 17 4 and 0 05 0 4 respectively fig 4 3 5 in situ electron acceptor characteristics along sediment depth the ch4 concentration decreased from 2000 μm at a depth of 20 cm to 74 1 μm at the sediment water interface swi δ13c ch4 significantly enriched and most of the enrichment was found in the upper 8 cm of the sediment where δ13c ch4 increased from 82 to 69 at the swi the do consistently decreased from the overlying water to the sediment with an o2 penetration depth less than 0 2 cm the extractable no2 and no3 were lower than 0 05 μmol g dw and 0 15 μmol g dw respectively with extractable nh4 concentrations ranging from 2 6 μmol g dw the concentrations of mn iv oxides increased from 5 μmol g dw at the swi then decreased along the sediment depth and reached a maximum value of 9 μmol g dw at 2 5 cm accompanied by a maximum mn2 concentration of 35 μm the concentration of fe iii oxides consistently increased from 20 μmol g dw to 55 7 μmol g dw along depth with the dissolved fe2 concentration increasing from 10 μm at the swi to 50 μm at a depth of 16 cm the so4 2 concentration decreased from the swi to a depth of 5 6 cm except for a few layers in april s2 was always below the detection limit fig 5 a 3 6 ch4 oxidation rates coupled to various electron acceptors along the sediments the profile model showed that ch4 oxidation overlapped with aerobic respiration and the reduction of mn iv fe iii and so4 2 at the depth of 0 07 0 2 cm 0 4 cm 3 10 cm and 0 7 cm respectively fig 5 b according to stable isotope tracing aerobic ch4 oxidation was the major pathway to mitigate ch4 at the oxic layer reaching 3 4 nmol cm3 d in the upper 1 cm of sediment at the anoxic layers fe iii and mn iv reduction coupled with ch4 oxidation dominated the ch4 sink with ranges of 3 8 13 4 nmol cm3 d and 1 2 10 1 nmol cm3 d jointly accounting for 62 5 73 8 of the total ch4 sink in addition ch4 oxidation coupled with the reduction of no2 no3 and so4 2 also occurred along the depth with 1 6 10 8 times lower rates than that with the reduction of fe iii when converting the ch4 oxidation rate at each layer to the whole sediment we found that fe iii and mn iv were the most two important electron acceptors mitigating 40 3 and 30 0 of the ch4 produced in the deeper layer respectively followed by no3 no2 and so4 2 with each of them oxidizing 8 8 9 2 of the ch4 because most of the ch4 was consumed in the anoxic sediment layers by the electron acceptors above only 2 7 of the ch4 was oxidized in the upper oxic layers fig 5 c 4 discussion 4 1 fe iii oxides and electron shuttles help mob circumvent the requirement of o2 under anoxia an enrichment dominated by methylomonas and several other heterotrophs was obtained to study the potential iron reduction capacity under decreasing o2 concentrations under 20 o2 conditions nearly no dissolved fe2 was produced because sufficient o2 inhibited microbial iron reduction melton et al 2014 kappler et al 2021 headspace ch4 was oxidized linearly and fe iii amendment had no significant effect on ch4 oxidation suggesting that o2 was the sole electron acceptor for ch4 oxidation dissolved fe2 concentration consistently increased under 2 o2 conditions fig 1 a 1 b similar to previous results that a type i mob methylomonas catalyzed ch4 dependent iron reduction under 0 89 mg l o2 zheng et al 2020 our incubation test also showed that o2 was exhausted less than two days under initial 2 o2 conditions fig s4 and the lack of o2 slowed down ch4 oxidation thereafter furthermore fe iii addition enhanced ch4 oxidation by nearly 40 indicating that iron oxides probably act as a potential alternative electron acceptor for mob when o2 is limited under 0 o2 which is more suitable for iron reduction neither ch4 oxidation nor fe iii reduction occurred fig 1 a 1 b although ch4 was still not consumed without fe iii addition when the supernatant of 2 o2 group was combined with mob biomass in 0 o2 group both processes reoccurred near a stoichiometric ratio by adding ferrihydrite fig 1 d these results suggest that some mediators in 2 o2 group may link ch4 oxidation and iron reduction under anoxia given that iron reduction relies on eet including mhc nanowires and electron shuttles lovley 2017 we suspected that electron shuttles may play an important role in the occurrence of iron reduction because only this mechanism involves extracellular secretion into the shared extracellular metabolite pool okamoto et al 2014 here we found riboflavin a typical kind of electron shuttle in 2 o2 group was significantly higher than that in the 20 and 0 o2 groups especially with ferrihydrite amendment fig 1 f moreover combining the electrochemical test and the determination of other potential electron shuttles such as phenazine we verified that riboflavin is the dominant electron mediator in the supernatant figs s10 s12 previous studies also showed that some fe iii reducing bacteria could secrete flavins to promote eet and further reduce insoluble metal oxides cisternas et al 2018 vitreschak et al 2002 consequently riboflavin is a potential mediator to assist mob in circumventing the requirement of o2 and is coupled to iron reduction under anoxia 4 2 microbial mechanism for mob enrichment coupling ch4 oxidation with iron reduction in the heavy dna layer of the sip microcosm only one kind of mob methylomonas was present containing a full complement of key genes involved in ch4 oxidation and enabling it to oxidize ch4 completely to co2 fig 2 a the existence of multiple active heterotrophic bacteria indicated that they may rely on ch4 conversion to obtain carbon sources table s1 he et al 2022 krause et al 2017 previous studies have reported that mob can release low molecular weight organic matter lmw om through glycolysis under hypoxia kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 here methylomonas also carried a variety of genes for pyruvate fermentation and was a potential producer of succinic acid and acetate fig 2 b consequently these ch4 derived fermentation products can form cross feeding between methanotrophs and heterotrophic bacteria brankovits et al 2017 a recent study further verified that 56 6 57 8 of the ch4 transmitted to lmw om in o2 limited environments which was significantly higher than that in high o2 conditions 36 1 37 6 he et al 2020 in this study we also found that the a254 values in 2 o2 group were nearly double those in 20 and 0 o2 groups fig 1 e indicating that more ch4 was converted as lmw om fu et al 2006 acetate and formaldehyde are the major lmw om derived from ch4 in 2 o2 conditions whereas that in 20 and 0 o2 conditions are negligible fig s13 additionally the aggregation under 2 o2 may be attributed to ch4 transformation to extracellular polymeric substance eps formation wei et al 2015 all six mags contained genes involved in riboflavin metabolism besides aerobic respiratory pathway enabling them to complete iron reduction through riboflavin secretion when o2 is limited melin and hellwig 2020 shi et al 2016 fig 3 a 3 b notably four of the six mags contained e pili and no microorganisms contained both periplasmic mhc and outer membrane mhc except for methylomonas fig 3 b implicating riboflavin secretion as the main mechanism for eet in the present study thus mob and these heterotrophic bacteria is likely to form a consortium to oxidize ch4 with ferrihydrite amendments specifically part of the ch4 was catalyzed to lmw om like acetate and formaldehyde by mob and further utilized by heterotrophic bacteria moreover the electron donated by ch4 was transported to extracellular and accepted by fe iii oxides with the help riboflavin fig 6 in natural habitats electron shuttles such as flavins are ubiquitous at nanomolar concentrations making the sediments electric monteverde et al 2018 pennisi 2020 multiple kinds of lmw om were also present in the iron rich sediment of lake fuxian such as acetate 3 7 mg l formate 1 2 mg l and lactate 0 04 mg l thus we speculate that active mob may also exist in the anoxic sediments of lake fuxian as we expected various mob indeed existed and were transcriptionally active in the anoxic sediment layers below the depth of 0 2 cm orders of magnitude more abundant than anme 2d fig 4 results of qpcr also showed that mob dominated methanotrophs with anme 2d and nc 10 only present in few layers but other kinds of anme consistently absent fig s14 this phenomenon was in accordance with many previous studies rahalkar et al 2009 biderre petit et al 2011 oswald et al 2016 naqvi et al 2018 thamdrup et al 2019 additionally some other taxa associated with the heavy fractions obtained from sip incubations were also associated with in situ sediments at rna level such as pseudomonas 2 3 8 0 and methylophilus 0 1 0 4 fig s9 this shows that the mob consortium may also in an active state in the sediment which has a potential to couple ch4 oxidation with iron reduction under anoxia 4 3 geochemical evidence for ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction the profile model showed that ch4 was net oxidized in nearly the upper 8 cm of sediments fig 5 b direct evidence for ch4 oxidation was the systematic shift in δ13c ch4 in the upper 8 cm due to that isotopically light ch4 was preferentially consumed during ch4 oxidation and led to a progressive enrichment of the residual ch4 in δ13c ch4 alperin et al 1988 fig 5 a dissolved and extractable nox in the sediment were likely depleted along the whole sediment depth making nox unlikely to be the dominant electron acceptors for ch4 oxidation in lake fuxian the isotope tracer tests further verified that the contributions of no3 and no2 as the electron acceptors never exceeded 10 of the total ch4 sink throughout the sediment fig 5 a probably because of the low transcriptional activity of anme 2d and nc 10 bacteria fig 4 ferric oxides were consistently present throughout the sediment with the dissolved fe2 generally increasing downward fig 5 a suggesting that iron reduction increases along the depth the contents of fe iii oxides and dissolved fe2 in lake fuxian are close to those in lake kinneret where ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction has also been demonstrated sivan et al 2011 profile model further showed overlap between fe2 production and ch4 oxidation within the depth of 3 10 cm fig 5 b indicating that fe iii oxides may be electron acceptors for ch4 oxidation although an order of magnitude lower than fe iii oxides and fe2 mn iv oxides and mn2 were also consistently present along the depth with overlap between mn2 production and ch4 oxidation within the depth of 0 4 cm fig 5 b indicating that mn iv oxides may be the electron acceptors for ch4 oxidation the stable isotope tracer test further demonstrated that fe iii and mn iv as the electron acceptor contributed 40 3 and 30 0 of the total ch4 sink respectively fig 5 c to our knowledge only two studies have focused on the contribution of ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction to total ch4 removal both of which focused on coastal sediments by using geochemical models egger et al 2015 rooze et al 2016 these results showed that ferric oxides as the electron acceptor only account for 3 10 of the total ch4 sink in coastal sediments partly attributed to the high so4 2 concentration 5 6 mm enhanced the competition of so4 2 and fe iii for ch4 oxidation although the profile model showed an overlap between so4 2 reduction and ch4 oxidation in the upper 7 cm of the sediments fig 5 b the electron donor of so4 2 reduction was more likely to be organic matter instead of ch4 based on the stable isotope tracer test ch4 oxidation rate was only 1 6 2 9 nmol cm3 d under so4 2 amendment fig 5 c which was significantly lower than that under fe iii and mn iv amendment in order to rule out that ch4 oxidation is coupled to a cryptic sulfur cycle su et al 2020 which could be supported by metal oxides through oxidation of reduced sulfur species to so4 2 the sulfate reduction inhibitor 20 mm of molybdate was added to the sediment and results showed that there was no significant differences between molybdate amendment and unamendment indicating the electron acceptor of ch4 oxidation was fe iii instead of so4 2 re oxidized by fe iii fig s15 5 conclusion from a microcosmic to macroscopic perspective our study provides evidence that mob can couple ch4 oxidation and fe iii reduction under anoxia with the help of electron shuttles such as riboflavin we cannot rule out that mob survive with microaerobic condition that is lower than the detection limit of microelectrode 0 625 μm but such a low do concentration could hardly maintain ch4 oxidation for over a week there is also a possibility that some kinds of oxygenic processes provide o2 for mob and immediately consumed by the latter however no genes encoding for oxygenic processes like nitric oxide dismutase in nc 10 bacteria and methanobactins mediated o2 generation in some alphaproteobacteria mob dershwitz et al 2021 are found in our mag data consequently we believe mob have a metabolic versatility under anoxia which is outside their preferential geochemical niche moreover this new kind of ch4 oxidation pathway is a considerable ch4 sink that contributes over 40 of the total ch4 consumption in an iron rich freshwater lake given that iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth fe iii as alternative electron acceptors to oxidize ch4 by mob may be a widespread important ch4 sink and potentially played a crucial role in the ancient atmosphere which contained limited o2 but abundant ch4 author contributions b l b l h p x and q l w designed the research b l q

14941,while co oxidation is widely used to biodegrade halogenated organic pollutants hops a considerable amount of organic primary substrate is required adding organic primary substrates increases the operating cost and also leads to extra carbon dioxide release in this study we evaluated a two stage reduction and oxidation synergistic platform rosp which integrated catalytic reductive dehalogenation with biological co oxidation for hops removal the rosp was a combination of an h2 based membrane catalytic film reactor h2 mcfr and an o2 based membrane biofilm reactor o2 mbfr 4 chlorophenol 4 cp was used as a model hop to evaluate the performance of rosp in the mcfr stage zero valent palladium nanoparticles pd0nps catalyzed reductive hydrodechlorination that converted 4 cp to phenol with a conversion yield over 92 in the mbfr stage the phenol was oxidized and used as a primary substrate that supported the co oxidation of residual 4 cp genomic dna sequencing revealed that phenol produced from 4 cp reduction enriched bacteria having genes for functional enzymes for phenol biodegradation in the biofilm community in the rosp over 99 of 60 mg l 4 cp was removed and mineralized during continuous operation effluent 4 cp and chemical oxygen demand concentrations were below 0 1 and 3 mg l respectively h2 was the only added electron donor to the rosp which means no extra carbon dioxide was produced by primary substrate oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords synergistic platform catalytic dechlorination biofilm co oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the toxicity and inhibitory effects of halogenated organic pollutants hops hops biodegradation often has slow rates of substrate utilization and bacterial growth chan et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 introduction of primary substrates that allow co oxidation can increase the amount of biomass and biodegradation kinetics while minimizing the accumulation of inhibitory intermediates fan et al 2017 gaza et al 2015 hao et al 2002 jesus et al 2016 mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 when an hop cannot support the growth of bacteria a primary substrate must be utilized by the bacteria as their electron donor and carbon source the primary substrate often is a structurally analogous compound to the hop since its metabolism can selectively enrich the biomass in enzymes relevant to biodegradation of the hop which also reduces its the inhibition effects awala et al 2021 pacholak et al 2018 for example methane and propane are commonly used as primary substrates to enhance the oxidation of chlorinated aliphatics such as trichloroethylene tce dichloroethylene dce and tetrachloroethane teca chang and criddle 1997 frascari et al 2006 mcfarland et al 1992 phenol is used as a primary substrate for chlorinated aromatics such the chlorophenols tetrabromobisphenol a and 1 2 dibromoethane baek et al 2014 fan et al 2017 wang et al 2015 however addition of a primary substrate increases the operating costs and its mineralization leads to carbon dioxide co2 release an alternative source of the primary substrate could be the products of reductive dehalogenation of the hops biotic enzymes and abiotic catalysts can catalyze reductive dehalogenation converting hops to less or non halogenated organic pollutants ops for example tce is widely investigated for bacterial reductive dechlorination bacteria of the genera dehalococcoides dehalobacter dehalospirillum and desulfitobacterium can use h2 pyruvate or acetate as electron donors to reduce tce scheutz et al 2011 scholz muramatsu et al 1995 sung et al 2006 suyama et al 2002 accumulation of vinyl chloride vc or cis 1 2 dichloroethylen dce is commonly observed in bacteria dechlorination grostern et al 2009 yu et al 2005 and only dehalococcoides mccartyi can completely dechlorinate tce to ethene löffler et al 2013 in contrast zero valent palladium nanoparticles pd0np can abiotically and rapidly catalyze hydrodechlorination of tce to ethane and chlorophenol to phenol in the presence of h2 li et al 2015 luo et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 both reductive dehalogenation products of tce and chlorophenol can serve as the primary substrate for hops co oxidation removal semprini 1997 tobajas et al 2012 to avoid using additional organic primary substrates for co oxidation we propose a two stage reduction and oxidation synergistic platform rosp that integrates catalytic reductive dehalogenation with co oxidation for complete hops removal and mineralization rosp is a combination of an h2 based membrane catalytic film reactor h2 mcfr and an o2 based membrane biofilm reactor o2 mbfr both systems deliver a gaseous reactant e g h2 or o2 from the lumen of bubble free gas transfer membranes to a catalytic film on the outer surface of the membrane luo et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 the h2 mcfr has a catalytic film of pd0 nanoparticles pd0nps which achieved continuous conversion of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp to phenol or cyclohexanone in our pervious study cai et al 2021 luo et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 the o2 mbfr has a biofilm with bacteria active to perform aerobic biodegradation of products from the mcfr cui et al 2022 lai et al 2017 liu et al 2018 as the catalyst and the biofilm accumulate on their separate membrane surfaces the catalytic reduction and bio oxidations are completely separated furthermore the reactions take place almost exclusively in the films not is suspension martin and nerenberg 2012 nerenberg 2016 for example water co contaminated by tce 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and 1 4 dioxane was successfully treated by a rosp tce and tca were first reductively dechlorinated in the h2 mcfr and converted to ethane luo et al 2021a in the subsequent o2 mbfr the ethane produced was used as a primary substrate to support the removal of 1 4 dioxane through co oxidation this study evaluates the performance of the rosp for removal of hops 4 cp is selected as model pollutant for hop as it is a common chemical industrial raw material for various halogenated organics 4 cp is first reductively dechlorinated in the h2 mcfr and converted to phenol then phenol and a small fraction of residual 4 cp are transferred to the o2 mbfr to be biodegraded by the biofilm through co oxidation in the o2 mbfr phenol is used as the primary substrate for the co oxidation of 4 cp because h2 and o2 are the only chemical inputs the mineralization of 4 cp is accomplished without the addition of an organic electron donor 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and media preparation a schematic of the rosp is in fig s1 and it demonstrates the configurations of previous mcfr and mbfr studies cai et al 2021 luo et al

bacterial film was attached to the surface of the hollow fiber membrane near the membrane surface of the h2 mcfr are many clusters of small pd0nps fig 1 b and c whose particle distribution pattern is

previous studies of the h2 mcfr cai et al 2022 2021 luo et al 2022 these studies showed no significant changes to the catalyst characteristics after experiments on 4 cp reductive dechlorination 3 2 reductive dechlorination of 4 cp in h2 mcfr in the batch test of the h2 mcfr over 99 of the initial 0 5 mm 4 cp was reductively dechlorinated and converted to phenol in 40 min fig s2 after dechlorination about 24 of the produced phenol was further hydrogenated to chn in 120 min fig 2 a and b show that 98 4 cp was removed in the 28 days of continuous operation when the influent 4 cp concentration was 0 5 mm the selectivity to phenol gradually increased from 80 to 95 when the hrt was decreased to 3 h and the h2 pressure was decreased to 3 psig or 1 2 atm absolute from 9 psig 1 6 atm reducing the hrt and h2 pressure narrowed the difference between the maximum h2 delivery capacity and the h2 demand for dechlorination when h2 was insufficient for further phenol hydrogenation in the last stage the product selectivity to phenol reached its highest level the results confirm that the h2 mcfr could convert most of the 4 cp to phenol continuously it also was possible to reduce phenol to chn if the h2 supply was sufficient more details about the selective production of phenol and chn were investigated in our pervious study luo et al 2022 3 3 co oxidation of phenol and 4 cp 3 3 1 4 cp co oxidation with different primary substrates to compare the efficiency of different primary substrates for 4 cp co oxidation we first conducted biodegradation batch tests in serum bottles the triplicate serum bottles were inoculated with activated sludge and the initial biomass concentrations were around 50 mg cod l or od600 0 05 fig s3 shows that four groups of bottles were fed with initial 4 cp concentration of 0 1 mm and the primary substrates were 2 mm phenol 2 mm benzene and 10 mm acetate in the absence of a primary substrate the concentration of 4 cp decreased gradually with about 33 removal achieved during the 180 h test the 4 cp concentration in the abiotic negative control was 3 during the batch test when phenol was used as primary substrate 2 mm phenol was consumed in 100 h and over 98 of the initial 4 cp was removed in the following 80 h the highest 4 cp removal rate with phenol as primary substrate was 0 026 mm day when benzene or acetate was used as primary substrate the 4 cp removal rate was about 0 004 and 0 005 mm day respectively overall using phenol as the primary substrate achieved the best 4 cp biodegradation probably because of its chemical structure similarity with 4 cp thus we chose phenol to enrich the biofilm in o2 mbfr and as the primary substrate for continuous 4 cp removal 3 3 2 4 cp co oxidation in o2 mbfr with different phenol 4 cp ratios in the beginning of stage i 1 the o2 mbfr was inoculated with activated sludge the reactor was fed continuously with an aqueous medium containing 1 mm phenol at a constant hrt of 3 h giving a phenol surface loading rate of 19 62 0 35 mmol m2 d fig 2c and d show that the biofilm reached steady state and achieved over 99 removal of phenol after 2 months of enrichment performance data for all stages are listed in table 1 in stage i 2 0 1 mm phenol was replaced with 4 cp in the influent so that the phenol 4 cp mole ratio was 9 after three weeks of continuous operation phenol and 4 cp were completely removed effluent concentration below their detection limits when the influent 4 cp concentration was increased to 0 2 mm the phenol 4 cp mole ratio decreased to 4 in stage i 3 and the removal of 4 cp gradually dropped eventually to less than 5 phenol removal also was inhibited by the increased concentration of 4 cp reaching its steady state removal of 58 2 in stage i 4 the phenol 4 cp mole ratio was set to 1 biodegradations of phenol and 4 cp were almost completely inhibited with removals dropping to 12 1 and 3 respectively the results from continuous 4 cp removal in o2 mbfr indicate that co oxidation of 4 cp required a sufficient supply of the primary substrate which was phenol when phenol addition was sufficient i e a mole ratio of 4 4 cp as well as phenol were completely removed 3 4 4 cp removal in the rosp 3 4 1 4 cp reductive dechlorination followed by co oxidation fig 3 presents the 4 cp and phenol concentrations in the h2 mcfr and o2 mbfr after the reactors were connected as the rosp in the first stage of continuous operation the rosp was continuously fed with the medium containing 0 5 mm 4 cp at a constant hrt of 3 h for the h2 mcfr and 6 h for o2 mbfr 9 h for the whole platform table 2 summarizes the performance data for both reactors in each stage at steady state including substrate surface loading flux effluent concentrations of 4 cp phenol and scod table s2 summarizes the h2 and o2 delivery fluxes and demands during continuous operation of the rosp the table documents the on demand supply of h2 in the h2 mcfr and over supplied o2 in the o2 mbfr in stage ii 1 over 99 of the 0 5 mm 4 cp was removed by reductive dechlorination and converted to phenol with selectivity of 95 in the effluent of the h2 mcfr i e the influent of o2 mbfr the phenol 4 cp mole ratio was over 100 produced phenol and residual 4 cp were completely removed effluent concentration below detection limits in the subsequent o2 mbfr in stage ii 2 when the 4 cp concentration was increased to 0 75 mm the effluent 4 cp concentration of h2 mcfr increased to 0 042 mm and the phenol 4 cp mole ratio decreased to 16 5 although the residual 4 cp concentration increased phenol and 4 cp were completely removed in the subsequent o2 mbfr in stages ii 1 and ii 2 the effluent scod was always less than 3 mg l which indicated nearly complete mineralization of 4 cp 3 4 2 biodegradation inhibited by high concentration residual 4 cp in stage ii 3 when the influent 4 cp concentration was further increased to 1 0 mm the effluent 4 cp concentration of h2 mcfr increased to 0 21 mm reducing the phenol 4 cp mole ratio to 3 7 with the high residual 4 cp fed into the o2 mbfr biodegradations of phenol and 4 cp were inhibited in the o2 mbfr the removal of 4 cp decreased to 80 for the whole platform and the effluent phenol concentration increased to 0 16 mm a further increase of the 4 cp influent concentration in stage ii 4 led to a large decrease in the removal of 4 cp and production of phenol thus complete removal and mineralization of 4 cp could be achieved in the rosp as long as enough 4 cp was reduced to phenol in the h2 mcfr 3 4 3 comparison between the rsop and co oxidation although complete co oxidation of 4 cp could be achieved in the o2 mbfr by adding more phenol as the primary substrate the production of sufficient primary substrate phenol in the h2 mcfr greatly reduces the cost of external electron donor for removal of 1 mole 4 cp through co oxidation in the o2 mbfr 9 mol of phenol 252 mol of e must be consumed as the primary substrate for the rosp only 1 mole h2 2 mol of e was used to convert the 4 cp to phenol since the low level residual 4 cp was consumed with phenol produced in the o2 mbfr thus electron donor h2 input in the rosp was less than 1 2 mol of e from h2 vs 252 mol of e from additional phenol of the required primary substrate needed for co oxidation in a single o2 mbfr which lowers the cost of electron donor addition furthermore h2 is an electron donor without carbon which means that its oxidation does not generate co2 table s3 compares the rosp to previous studies in terms of substrate input and co2 generation in previous studies of 4 cp co oxidation various primary substrates were used including phenol glucose and sucrose the mole ratio between primary substrate input and target substrate p t mole ratio ranging from 1 8 to 18 and a higher mole ratio was important for complete 4 cp removal kim and hao 1999 li et al 2011 saéz and rittmann 1993 tobajas et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although the unit price of h2 2 10 kg or 0 002 0 01 mole e eq depending on the source is higher than other substrates e g phenol 1 6 kg or 0 005 mole e eq glucose and sucrose 0 4 kg or 0 003 mole e eq the overall electron donor cost for 4 cp in the rosp is 10 compared to other substrates because 4 cp is converted to phenol internally the total co2 generated by the co oxidation also had a high mole ratio to 4 cp removed co2 t mole ratio ranging from 17 to over 200 compared to previous studies the rosp greatly reduced the p t mole ratio and the co2 t mole ratio to 1 and 6 respectively in continuous operation thus an advantage of the rosp is converting 4 cp to phenol with only a small input of h2 as the only reductant furthermore a number of studies suggested that structural analogous compounds are superior primary substrates for the co oxidation persistent organics awala et al 2021 pacholak et al 2018 tusher et al 2021 thus converting hops to their structural analogs by reductive dehalogenation in h2 mcfr is a generally useful strategy to support hops co oxidation 3 5 genetic characterization of the biofilm in the o2 mbfr 3 5 1 the biofilm community structure shifted with enrichment based on the results of shallow metagenomic sequencing fig 4 shows that the dominant genus relative abundance 67 in the activated sludge inoculum was delftia which is common in activated sludge and known to biodegrade aniline chlorobenzene phenolic compounds and a large variety of other organic compounds juarez jimenez et al 2012 ye et al 2019 in stage i 1 after the o2 mbfr was exposed to phenol the dominant bacteria shifted to the genera cupriavidus and variovorax with relative abundance of 61 and 25 respectively cupriavidus has been reported to degrade aromatic compounds including 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid halobenzoates chlorophenols and other organic pollutants chen et al 2008 pérez pantoja et al 2008 variovorax also is reported capable of biodegrading phenol and other aromatic compounds futamata et al 2005 vallaeys et al 1998 3 5 2 4 cp shaped biofilm community structure in stage i 3 when 4 cp was added to the influent the relative abundance of in the genus variovorax decreased to 22 while the relative abundances of genera afipia rhodococcus and an unclassified genus in sinobacteraceae increased from 5 to about 10 each bacterial species in the genera afipia and rhodococcus are well known to perform the biodegradation of chlorinated aromatic pollutants carvalho et al 2010 gröning et al 2014 itoh et al 2002 the family sinobacteraceae is rarely reported in wastewater treatment gröning et al 2014 itoh et al 2002 zaitsev et al 1995 zhang et al 2020 in stages ii 1 ii 2 and ii 4 the genera variovorax cupriavidus and afipia remained dominant variovorax increased from 25 to 34 and 36 in stages ii 1 and ii 2 respectively when residual 4 cp was removed by 99 5 in stage ii 4 when phenol and 4 cp biodegradations were inhibited by the high residual concentration of 4 cp the relative abundance of variovorax decreased to 24 suggesting that variovorax was sensitive to the high 4 cp concentration compared to variovorax the genera cupriavidus and afipia apparently were more resistant to the toxicity of 4 cp as their abundances showed no obvious decreases in stage ii 4 because the overall community structure did not change dramatically once 4 cp was introduced to the rosp the observed inhibitions of phenol and 4 cp removals probably were caused by the inhibition or loss of functional enzymes rather than a change of the community structure 3 5 3 functional genes for phenol and 4 cp co oxidation we mapped the results of the shallow metagenomic sequencing to the bacterial genome database to find evidence of genes related to the oxygenation of aromatic compounds and ring cleavage the outcome is summarized in fig 5 mono and di oxygenations convert phenol to catechol or 4 cp to chlorocatechol the top part of fig 5 shows that genes for many mono and di oxygenases were presented in the biofilms among them the relative abundances of phthalate 4 5 dioxygenase pht3 phenol 2 monooxygenase hydroxybenzoate 6 monooxygenase nagx and 2 4 dichloropheno 6 monooxygenase tfdb increased by at least a factor of two through the stages these trends suggest that these oxygenases were important for initiating biodegradation of phenol and 4 cp in the biofilms after oxygenation ring cleavage of catechol is required for the further biodegradation genes encoding aromatic dioxygenases can bring about ring cleavage genes for many ring cleavage enzymes were present bottom part of fig 5 among all these genes the relative abundances of protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase pcag h hydroxyquinol 1 2 dioxygenase chqb catechol 1 2 dioxygenase cata and 2 3 dioxygenase xyle had over 2 fold increases in the biofilm samples over the stages by cross checking the dominant genera genomic database we confirmed that the genomes of species of the most abundant genus variovorax contain most of the listed functional genes except for cate cupriavidus and afipia genomes also contain most of the potential functional genes for phenol and 4 cp biodegradation with the gathered information of functional genes we proposed a pathway of 4 cp and phenol co oxidation in o2 mbfr fig s4 in which mono and di oxygenation cleave the aromatic ring before entering the core metabolism of carbon the large change in relative abundances of bacteria genera and functional genes occurred when the inoculum culture was exposed only to phenol stage i 1 changes in subsequent stages were not statistically significant p 0 1 4 conclusion continuous removal of 99 of 0 5 mm 4 cp demonstrates that the rosp can be effective for treating hop contaminated water reductive dehalogenation in the h2 mcfr converted over 90 of 4 cp to phenol which was the primary substrates to support the co oxidation of 4 cp in the subsequent o2 mbfr key to success was ensuring that the phenol to 4 cp mole ratio in the o2 mbfr was at least 9 thus the good performance of the rosp s second stage requires a high degree of reductive dechlorination in its first stage the results of genomic dna sequencing confirmed that phenol supported biofilm bacteria e g variovorax cupriavidus and afipia having genes for functional enzymes for phenol biodegradation e g pht3 nagx tfdb pcag h et al as reductive dehalogenation converts hops to structural analogous compounds with lower toxicity and higher bioavailability the hrt for subsequent biodegradation can be greatly reduced therefore the rosp should be a versatile tool for hops co oxidation since h2 and o2 are the only chemical inputs the rosp enables hop co oxidation without any carbon addition or added co2 formation furthermore well controlled gas delivery allows the rosp to achieve h2 and o2 utilization efficiencies 90 which further improves process economics rittmann 2007

14941,while co oxidation is widely used to biodegrade halogenated organic pollutants hops a considerable amount of organic primary substrate is required adding organic primary substrates increases the operating cost and also leads to extra carbon dioxide release in this study we evaluated a two stage reduction and oxidation synergistic platform rosp which integrated catalytic reductive dehalogenation with biological co oxidation for hops removal the rosp was a combination of an h2 based membrane catalytic film reactor h2 mcfr and an o2 based membrane biofilm reactor o2 mbfr 4 chlorophenol 4 cp was used as a model hop to evaluate the performance of rosp in the mcfr stage zero valent palladium nanoparticles pd0nps catalyzed reductive hydrodechlorination that converted 4 cp to phenol with a conversion yield over 92 in the mbfr stage the phenol was oxidized and used as a primary substrate that supported the co oxidation of residual 4 cp genomic dna sequencing revealed that phenol produced from 4 cp reduction enriched bacteria having genes for functional enzymes for phenol biodegradation in the biofilm community in the rosp over 99 of 60 mg l 4 cp was removed and mineralized during continuous operation effluent 4 cp and chemical oxygen demand concentrations were below 0 1 and 3 mg l respectively h2 was the only added electron donor to the rosp which means no extra carbon dioxide was produced by primary substrate oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords synergistic platform catalytic dechlorination biofilm co oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the toxicity and inhibitory effects of halogenated organic pollutants hops hops biodegradation often has slow rates of substrate utilization and bacterial growth chan et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 introduction of primary substrates that allow co oxidation can increase the amount of biomass and biodegradation kinetics while minimizing the accumulation of inhibitory intermediates fan et al 2017 gaza et al 2015 hao et al 2002 jesus et al 2016 mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 when an hop cannot support the growth of bacteria a primary substrate must be utilized by the bacteria as their electron donor and carbon source the primary substrate often is a structurally analogous compound to the hop since its metabolism can selectively enrich the biomass in enzymes relevant to biodegradation of the hop which also reduces its the inhibition effects awala et al 2021 pacholak et al 2018 for example methane and propane are commonly used as primary substrates to enhance the oxidation of chlorinated aliphatics such as trichloroethylene tce dichloroethylene dce and tetrachloroethane teca chang and criddle 1997 frascari et al 2006 mcfarland et al 1992 phenol is used as a primary substrate for chlorinated aromatics such the chlorophenols tetrabromobisphenol a and 1 2 dibromoethane baek et al 2014 fan et al 2017 wang et al 2015 however addition of a primary substrate increases the operating costs and its mineralization leads to carbon dioxide co2 release an alternative source of the primary substrate could be the products of reductive dehalogenation of the hops biotic enzymes and abiotic catalysts can catalyze reductive dehalogenation converting hops to less or non halogenated organic pollutants ops for example tce is widely investigated for bacterial reductive dechlorination bacteria of the genera dehalococcoides dehalobacter dehalospirillum and desulfitobacterium can use h2 pyruvate or acetate as electron donors to reduce tce scheutz et al 2011 scholz muramatsu et al 1995 sung et al 2006 suyama et al 2002 accumulation of vinyl chloride vc or cis 1 2 dichloroethylen dce is commonly observed in bacteria dechlorination grostern et al 2009 yu et al 2005 and only dehalococcoides mccartyi can completely dechlorinate tce to ethene löffler et al 2013 in contrast zero valent palladium nanoparticles pd0np can abiotically and rapidly catalyze hydrodechlorination of tce to ethane and chlorophenol to phenol in the presence of h2 li et al 2015 luo et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 both reductive dehalogenation products of tce and chlorophenol can serve as the primary substrate for hops co oxidation removal semprini 1997 tobajas et al 2012 to avoid using additional organic primary substrates for co oxidation we propose a two stage reduction and oxidation synergistic platform rosp that integrates catalytic reductive dehalogenation with co oxidation for complete hops removal and mineralization rosp is a combination of an h2 based membrane catalytic film reactor h2 mcfr and an o2 based membrane biofilm reactor o2 mbfr both systems deliver a gaseous reactant e g h2 or o2 from the lumen of bubble free gas transfer membranes to a catalytic film on the outer surface of the membrane luo et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 the h2 mcfr has a catalytic film of pd0 nanoparticles pd0nps which achieved continuous conversion of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp to phenol or cyclohexanone in our pervious study cai et al 2021 luo et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 the o2 mbfr has a biofilm with bacteria active to perform aerobic biodegradation of products from the mcfr cui et al 2022 lai et al 2017 liu et al 2018 as the catalyst and the biofilm accumulate on their separate membrane surfaces the catalytic reduction and bio oxidations are completely separated furthermore the reactions take place almost exclusively in the films not is suspension martin and nerenberg 2012 nerenberg 2016 for example water co contaminated by tce 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and 1 4 dioxane was successfully treated by a rosp tce and tca were first reductively dechlorinated in the h2 mcfr and converted to ethane luo et al 2021a in the subsequent o2 mbfr the ethane produced was used as a primary substrate to support the removal of 1 4 dioxane through co oxidation this study evaluates the performance of the rosp for removal of hops 4 cp is selected as model pollutant for hop as it is a common chemical industrial raw material for various halogenated organics 4 cp is first reductively dechlorinated in the h2 mcfr and converted to phenol then phenol and a small fraction of residual 4 cp are transferred to the o2 mbfr to be biodegraded by the biofilm through co oxidation in the o2 mbfr phenol is used as the primary substrate for the co oxidation of 4 cp because h2 and o2 are the only chemical inputs the mineralization of 4 cp is accomplished without the addition of an organic electron donor 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and media preparation a schematic of the rosp is in fig s1 and it demonstrates the configurations of previous mcfr and mbfr studies cai et al 2021 luo et al

previous studies of the h2 mcfr cai et al 2022 2021 luo et al 2022 these studies showed no significant changes to the catalyst characteristics after experiments on 4 cp reductive dechlorination 3 2 reductive dechlorination of 4 cp in h2 mcfr in the batch test of the h2 mcfr over 99 of the initial 0 5 mm 4 cp was reductively dechlorinated and converted to phenol in 40 min fig s2 after dechlorination about 24 of the produced phenol was further hydrogenated to chn in 120 min fig 2 a and b show that 98 4 cp was removed in the 28 days of continuous operation when the influent 4 cp concentration was 0 5 mm the selectivity to phenol gradually increased from 80 to 95 when the hrt was decreased to 3 h and the h2 pressure was decreased to 3 psig or 1 2 atm absolute from 9 psig 1 6 atm reducing the hrt and h2 pressure narrowed the difference between the maximum h2 delivery capacity and the h2 demand for dechlorination when h2 was insufficient for further phenol hydrogenation in the last stage the product selectivity to phenol reached its highest level the results confirm that the h2 mcfr could convert most of the 4 cp to phenol continuously it also was possible to reduce phenol to chn if the h2 supply was sufficient more details about the selective production of phenol and chn were investigated in our pervious study luo et al 2022 3 3 co oxidation of phenol and 4 cp 3 3 1 4 cp co oxidation with different primary substrates to compare the efficiency of different primary substrates for 4 cp co oxidation we first conducted biodegradation batch tests in serum bottles the triplicate serum bottles were inoculated with activated sludge and the initial biomass concentrations were around 50 mg cod l or od600 0 05 fig s3 shows that four groups of bottles were fed with initial 4 cp concentration of 0 1 mm and the primary substrates were 2 mm phenol 2 mm benzene and 10 mm acetate in the absence of a primary substrate the concentration of 4 cp decreased gradually with about 33 removal achieved during the 180 h test the 4 cp concentration in the abiotic negative control was 3 during the batch test when phenol was used as primary substrate 2 mm phenol was consumed in 100 h and over 98 of the initial 4 cp was removed in the following 80 h the highest 4 cp removal rate with phenol as primary substrate was 0 026 mm day when benzene or acetate was used as primary substrate the 4 cp removal rate was about 0 004 and 0 005 mm day respectively overall using phenol as the primary substrate achieved the best 4 cp biodegradation probably because of its chemical structure similarity with 4 cp thus we chose phenol to enrich the biofilm in o2 mbfr and as the primary substrate for continuous 4 cp removal 3 3 2 4 cp co oxidation in o2 mbfr with different phenol 4 cp ratios in the beginning of stage i 1 the o2 mbfr was inoculated with activated sludge the reactor was fed continuously with an aqueous medium containing 1 mm phenol at a constant hrt of 3 h giving a phenol surface loading rate of 19 62 0 35 mmol m2 d fig 2c and d show that the biofilm reached steady state and achieved over 99 removal of phenol after 2 months of enrichment performance data for all stages are listed in table 1 in stage i 2 0 1 mm phenol was replaced with 4 cp in the influent so that the phenol 4 cp mole ratio was 9 after three weeks of continuous operation phenol and 4 cp were completely removed effluent concentration below their detection limits when the influent 4 cp concentration was increased to 0 2 mm the phenol 4 cp mole ratio decreased to 4 in stage i 3 and the removal of 4 cp gradually dropped eventually to less than 5 phenol removal also was inhibited by the increased concentration of 4 cp reaching its steady state removal of 58 2 in stage i 4 the phenol 4 cp mole ratio was set to 1 biodegradations of phenol and 4 cp were almost completely inhibited with removals dropping to 12 1 and 3 respectively the results from continuous 4 cp removal in o2 mbfr indicate that co oxidation of 4 cp required a sufficient supply of the primary substrate which was phenol when phenol addition was sufficient i e a mole ratio of 4 4 cp as well as phenol were completely removed 3 4 4 cp removal in the rosp 3 4 1 4 cp reductive dechlorination followed by co oxidation fig 3 presents the 4 cp and phenol concentrations in the h2 mcfr and o2 mbfr after the reactors were connected as the rosp in the first stage of continuous operation the rosp was continuously fed with the medium containing 0 5 mm 4 cp at a constant hrt of 3 h for the h2 mcfr and 6 h for o2 mbfr 9 h for the whole platform table 2 summarizes the performance data for both reactors in each stage at steady state including substrate surface loading flux effluent concentrations of 4 cp phenol and scod table s2 summarizes the h2 and o2 delivery fluxes and demands during continuous operation of the rosp the table documents the on demand supply of h2 in the h2 mcfr and over supplied o2 in the o2 mbfr in stage ii 1 over 99 of the 0 5 mm 4 cp was removed by reductive dechlorination and converted to phenol with selectivity of 95 in the effluent of the h2 mcfr i e the influent of o2 mbfr the phenol 4 cp mole ratio was over 100 produced phenol and residual 4 cp were completely removed effluent concentration below detection limits in the subsequent o2 mbfr in stage ii 2 when the 4 cp concentration was increased to 0 75 mm the effluent 4 cp concentration of h2 mcfr increased to 0 042 mm and the phenol 4 cp mole ratio decreased to 16 5 although the residual 4 cp concentration increased phenol and 4 cp were completely removed in the subsequent o2 mbfr in stages ii 1 and ii 2 the effluent scod was always less than 3 mg l which indicated nearly complete mineralization of 4 cp 3 4 2 biodegradation inhibited by high concentration residual 4 cp in stage ii 3 when the influent 4 cp concentration was further increased to 1 0 mm the effluent 4 cp concentration of h2 mcfr increased to 0 21 mm reducing the phenol 4 cp mole ratio to 3 7 with the high residual 4 cp fed into the o2 mbfr biodegradations of phenol and 4 cp were inhibited in the o2 mbfr the removal of 4 cp decreased to 80 for the whole platform and the effluent phenol concentration increased to 0 16 mm a further increase of the 4 cp influent concentration in stage ii 4 led to a large decrease in the removal of 4 cp and production of phenol thus complete removal and mineralization of 4 cp could be achieved in the rosp as long as enough 4 cp was reduced to phenol in the h2 mcfr 3 4 3 comparison between the rsop and co oxidation although complete co oxidation of 4 cp could be achieved in the o2 mbfr by adding more phenol as the primary substrate the production of sufficient primary substrate phenol in the h2 mcfr greatly reduces the cost of external electron donor for removal of 1 mole 4 cp through co oxidation in the o2 mbfr 9 mol of phenol 252 mol of e must be consumed as the primary substrate for the rosp only 1 mole h2 2 mol of e was used to convert the 4 cp to phenol since the low level residual 4 cp was consumed with phenol produced in the o2 mbfr thus electron donor h2 input in the rosp was less than 1 2 mol of e from h2 vs 252 mol of e from additional phenol of the required primary substrate needed for co oxidation in a single o2 mbfr which lowers the cost of electron donor addition furthermore h2 is an electron donor without carbon which means that its oxidation does not generate co2 table s3 compares the rosp to previous studies in terms of substrate input and co2 generation in previous studies of 4 cp co oxidation various primary substrates were used including phenol glucose and sucrose the mole ratio between primary substrate input and target substrate p t mole ratio ranging from 1 8 to 18 and a higher mole ratio was important for complete 4 cp removal kim and hao 1999 li et al 2011 saéz and rittmann 1993 tobajas et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although the unit price of h2 2 10 kg or 0 002 0 01 mole e eq depending on the source is higher than other substrates e g phenol 1 6 kg or 0 005 mole e eq glucose and sucrose 0 4 kg or 0 003 mole e eq the overall electron donor cost for 4 cp in the rosp is 10 compared to other substrates because 4 cp is converted to phenol internally the total co2 generated by the co oxidation also had a high mole ratio to 4 cp removed co2 t mole ratio ranging from 17 to over 200 compared to previous studies the rosp greatly reduced the p t mole ratio and the co2 t mole ratio to 1 and 6 respectively in continuous operation thus an advantage of the rosp is converting 4 cp to phenol with only a small input of h2 as the only reductant furthermore a number of studies suggested that structural analogous compounds are superior primary substrates for the co oxidation persistent organics awala et al 2021 pacholak et al 2018 tusher et al 2021 thus converting hops to their structural analogs by reductive dehalogenation in h2 mcfr is a generally useful strategy to support hops co oxidation 3 5 genetic characterization of the biofilm in the o2 mbfr 3 5 1 the biofilm community structure shifted with enrichment based on the results of shallow metagenomic sequencing fig 4 shows that the dominant genus relative abundance 67 in the activated sludge inoculum was delftia which is common in activated sludge and known to biodegrade aniline chlorobenzene phenolic compounds and a large variety of other organic compounds juarez jimenez et al 2012 ye et al 2019 in stage i 1 after the o2 mbfr was exposed to phenol the dominant bacteria shifted to the genera cupriavidus and variovorax with relative abundance of 61 and 25 respectively cupriavidus has been reported to degrade aromatic compounds including 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid halobenzoates chlorophenols and other organic pollutants chen et al 2008 pérez pantoja et al 2008 variovorax also is reported capable of biodegrading phenol and other aromatic compounds futamata et al 2005 vallaeys et al 1998 3 5 2 4 cp shaped biofilm community structure in stage i 3 when 4 cp was added to the influent the relative abundance of in the genus variovorax decreased to 22 while the relative abundances of genera afipia rhodococcus and an unclassified genus in sinobacteraceae increased from 5 to about 10 each bacterial species in the genera afipia and rhodococcus are well known to perform the biodegradation of chlorinated aromatic pollutants carvalho et al 2010 gröning et al 2014 itoh et al 2002 the family sinobacteraceae is rarely reported in wastewater treatment gröning et al 2014 itoh et al 2002 zaitsev et al 1995 zhang et al 2020 in stages ii 1 ii 2 and ii 4 the genera variovorax cupriavidus and afipia remained dominant variovorax increased from 25 to 34 and 36 in stages ii 1 and ii 2 respectively when residual 4 cp was removed by 99 5 in stage ii 4 when phenol and 4 cp biodegradations were inhibited by the high residual concentration of 4 cp the relative abundance of variovorax decreased to 24 suggesting that variovorax was sensitive to the high 4 cp concentration compared to variovorax the genera cupriavidus and afipia apparently were more resistant to the toxicity of 4 cp as their abundances showed no obvious decreases in stage ii 4 because the overall community structure did not change dramatically once 4 cp was introduced to the rosp the observed inhibitions of phenol and 4 cp removals probably were caused by the inhibition or loss of functional enzymes rather than a change of the community structure 3 5 3 functional genes for phenol and 4 cp co oxidation we mapped the results of the shallow metagenomic sequencing to the bacterial genome database to find evidence of genes related to the oxygenation of aromatic compounds and ring cleavage the outcome is summarized in fig 5 mono and di oxygenations convert phenol to catechol or 4 cp to chlorocatechol the top part of fig 5 shows that genes for many mono and di oxygenases were presented in the biofilms among them the relative abundances of phthalate 4 5 dioxygenase pht3 phenol 2 monooxygenase hydroxybenzoate 6 monooxygenase nagx and 2 4 dichloropheno 6 monooxygenase tfdb increased by at least a factor of two through the stages these trends suggest that these oxygenases were important for initiating biodegradation of phenol and 4 cp in the biofilms after oxygenation ring cleavage of catechol is required for the further biodegradation genes encoding aromatic dioxygenases can bring about ring cleavage genes for many ring cleavage enzymes were present bottom part of fig 5 among all these genes the relative abundances of protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase pcag h hydroxyquinol 1 2 dioxygenase chqb catechol 1 2 dioxygenase cata and 2 3 dioxygenase xyle had over 2 fold increases in the biofilm samples over the stages by cross checking the dominant genera genomic database we confirmed that the genomes of species of the most abundant genus variovorax contain most of the listed functional genes except for cate cupriavidus and afipia genomes also contain most of the potential functional genes for phenol and 4 cp biodegradation with the gathered information of functional genes we proposed a pathway of 4 cp and phenol co oxidation in o2 mbfr fig s4 in which mono and di oxygenation cleave the aromatic ring before entering the core metabolism of carbon the large change in relative abundances of bacteria genera and functional genes occurred when the inoculum culture was exposed only to phenol stage i 1 changes in subsequent stages were not statistically significant p 0 1 4 conclusion continuous removal of 99 of 0 5 mm 4 cp demonstrates that the rosp can be effective for treating hop contaminated water reductive dehalogenation in the h2 mcfr converted over 90 of 4 cp to phenol which was the primary substrates to support the co oxidation of 4 cp in the subsequent o2 mbfr key to success was ensuring that the phenol to 4 cp mole ratio in the o2 mbfr was at least 9 thus the good performance of the rosp s second stage requires a high degree of reductive dechlorination in its first stage the results of genomic dna sequencing confirmed that phenol supported biofilm bacteria e g variovorax cupriavidus and afipia having genes for functional enzymes for phenol biodegradation e g pht3 nagx tfdb pcag h et al as reductive dehalogenation converts hops to structural analogous compounds with lower toxicity and higher bioavailability the hrt for subsequent biodegradation can be greatly reduced therefore the rosp should be a versatile tool for hops co oxidation since h2 and o2 are the only chemical inputs the rosp enables hop co oxidation without any carbon addition or added co2 formation furthermore well controlled gas delivery allows the rosp to achieve h2 and o2 utilization efficiencies 90 which further improves process economics rittmann 2007

14942,sulfide and methane production are a major concern in sewer management many solutions with the use of chemicals have been proposed yet incurring huge costs here this study reports an alternative solution to reduce sulfide and methane production in sewer sediments this is achieved through integration of urine source separation rapid storage and intermittent in situ re dosing into a sewer based on a reasonable capacity of urine collection an intermittent dosing strategy i e 40 min per day was designed and then experimentally tested using two laboratory sewer sediment reactors the long term operation showed that the proposed urine dosing in the experimental reactor effectively reduced sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities by 54 and 83 compared to those in the control reactor in sediment chemical and microbial analyses revealed that the short term exposure to urine wastewater was effective in suppressing sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea particularly within a surface active zone of sediments 0 0 5 cm likely attributed to the biocidal effect of urine free ammonia economic and environmental assessments indicated that the proposed urine approach can save 91 in total costs 80 in energy consumption and 96 in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the conventional use of chemicals including ferric salt nitrate sodium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide these results collectively demonstrated a practical solution without chemical input to improve sewer management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer system sulfide and methane urine fa

residential households and industries to downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps sulfide and methane emissions pose longstanding challenges to sewer management guisasola et al 2008 milde et al 1983 sulfide is produced from the biological reduction of sulfate by sulfate reducing bacteria srb which not only results in noxious odor and health issues but also damages sewer pipes via associated corrosion thus reducing sewer service life hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 li et al 2020 selvakumar et al 2010 methane is generated by methanogenic archaea ma and has a high global warming potential 28 times global warming potential of carbon dioxide and explosion risk lower explosive level is approximately 5 foley et al 2009 ipcc 2014 both sulfide and methane productions lead to loss of organic carbon in wastewater imposing detrimental impacts on biological nutrient removal performance at downstream wwtps jin et al 2018 in order to reduce sulfide and methane productions dosing of chemicals such as oxygen iron salts nitrite nitrate salts and alkalis into sewers have been developed worldwide gutierrez et al 2008 2014 jiang et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 jin et al 2018 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2022 nevertheless these approaches require significant chemical input ganigue et al 2011 usually incurring high costs which are even on the same order of magnitude as the lost asset value caused by sulfide induced deterioration rauch and kleidorfer 2014 gravity sewers make up the majority in the entire sewer network over 95 xu et al 2018 if gravity slope and wastewater flow are low sediments tend to accumulate which is more common in some poorly designed small pipelines in upstream residential sewers lu et al 2020 zuo et al 2021a the sewer sediments have potential to produce sulfide and methane under anaerobic conditions liu et al 2015a schmitt et al 1992 a field investigation recently found that gaseous sulfide concentration reached up to hundreds of ppm in some residential gravity sewers zuo et al 2019 resulting in a significant ordor nuisance to nearby resident sewer sediments have a thicker bioactive layer with more abundant srb and ma than sewer biofilms liu et al 2015a 2016 with limited substrate diffusion recent studies have shown that dosing of chemicals such as ferric salts and nitrate for sulfide and methane control in sediments is more difficult than that in sewer biofilms cao et al 2019 liu et al 2015b zuo et al 2020b moreover residential gravity sewers serve as the starting point of the entire sewer network and have many small pipelines making practical dosing of chemicals more difficult than main sewer pipelines integrated urban water management is an increasingly popular concept which can bring significant economic and environmental benefits pikaar et al 2014 rauch and kleidorfer 2014 sun et al 2015 it has been proposed to use urine wastewater for sulfide and methane control in sewers jiang et al 2011 oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2020a for example zheng et al 2017 developed a nitritation process to convert ammonia to nitrite in urine wastewater and generate a nitrite rich solution the nitrite at acidic conditions can form free nitrous acid fna a strong biocidal effect on pressure sewer biofilms can be used for sulfide control as an alternative to a chemical fna agent our recent study found that a high concentration of ammonia in urine wastewater was biocidal to sewer biofilms leading to the inactivation of sulfide and methane producers with the urine wastewater dosed directly zuo et al 2020a these concepts based on source separation and reuse of urine are expected to improve sewer management which do not incur extra chemicals to sewer as urine is a component of the wastewater while these studies revealed the biocidal effects and applications of fna and ammonia on microbial inactivation zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2020a a practical solution of dosing urine wastewater is still missing this study aims to develop and demonstrate a practical urine based strategy for reducing sulfide and methane production in gravity sewer sediments a feasible methodology of urine reuse was first designed and then experimentally tested using two lab scale sewer sediment reactors one reactor was used as an experimental system with the other as a control sulfide and methane production in sediment sulfidogenic activity and microbial variation were systematically monitored economic and environmental impacts of the proposed strategy were also assessed in comparison to conventional chemical dosing outcomes from this study support the development of a sustainable and practical approach for improving sewer management 2 design of urine collection and reuse fig 1a presents the design of urine collection and re dosing i e volume and frequency in residential areas a sewer pipe is assumed to collect wastewater from a building with 100 people a typical daily wastewater quota of 150 l per person is applied and thus a daily average wastewater flow rate of this sewer line is 15 m3 d it is assumed that each person can contribute 1 4 l of raw urine per day with a 3 fold dilution factor via flushing krieg et al 1986 rossi et al 2009 thus a total urine wastewater of 0 42 m3 per day can be collected urine storage is needed for urea hydrolysis to ammonia the urine storage tank has a volume of 2 9 m3 with a hydraulic retention time of one week a dosing flow rate of urine into the sewer is designed to be 15 m3 d equal to the average flow of wastewater if the stored urine wastewater can be dosed into sewers every day a daily volume is 0 4 m3 it thus requires 40 min for dosing at a flow of 15 m3 d the short dosing time i e 40 min facilitates the implementation of dosing in the midnight when the wastewater flow rate is low thus minimizing the dilution of ammonia concentration in sewer 3 experimental setup 3 1 operation of sewer sediment reactors two sewer sediment reactors namely r1 and r2 were applied to test the impact of urine dosing on sediment performances fig 1b the total volume of each reactor was 1 8 l 12 cm height and 14 cm inner diameter sediment samples were collected from a mature gravity sanitary sewer and added to sewer reactors with an initial depth of approximately 5 cm a mechanical stirrer zt 3ik15rgn c with two paddles was positioned in the liquid phase to provide a stirring speed of 30 rpm all reactors were covered with black cloth to block light r1 served as a control reactor and r2 was used to investigate the suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogeic activities within sewer sediments by urine dosing for 40 min per day the average temperature of reactors was 15 2 c the overall experiment lasted for 260 days consisting of two phases 1 the baseline phase day 100 0 two reactors were fed with fresh real wastewater in parallel the feeding pattern consisted of 16 cycles per day and each feed pumping event lasted 15 min transferring 0 3 l of wastewater into each reactor leading to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h the two sediment reactors was operated for 100 days to obtain stable sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities 2 the experimental phase day 1 160 r1 as the control reactor was operated under the same conditions as that in the baseline phase and r2 started to receive the designed urine dosing the urine wastewater was injected into r2 after the residual wastewater was drained off at a fixed time 9 00 pm each day after 40 min of urine exposure the urine was discharged from the reactors and then the fresh wastewater was re injected during the entire operation sediment bioactivity tests were performed 1 2 times per week to determine variations in sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations in the influent and effluent were monitored once per week the sediment samples in the surface layer 0 0 5 cm in two reactors were collected in two phases on days 9 and 74 and stored at 20 c in the refrigerator for further microbial analysis the raw wastewater was collected daily from a wet well at tsinghua university beijing china and used as the influent the collected wastewater was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent change of water quality it contained 15 50 mg so4 2 s l 10 mg h2s s l 200 400 mg cod l 10 30 mg volatile fatty acid vfa l in terms of cod the human urine was collected from a male toilet urinal of the sino italian environment and energy efficient building at tsinghua university the urine wastewater was stored in a large container at temperature 20 c for 7 days to allow the urea hydrolysis to ammonia the mature urine wastewater contained 6 7 g n l of total ammonia nitrogen tan at ph of 9 3 0 1 it was diluted by three times using tap water to mimic water flush hence the diluted urine wastewater contained about 2 g n l of tan with a ph of 9 1 0 1 jointly leading to a free ammonia fa concentration of 0 5 g nh3 n l at 15 c according to eq 1 anthonisen et al 1976 1 fa g n h 3 n l tan 10 ph e 6344 273 t 10 ph 3 2 sediment bioactivity tests bioactivity tests were performed to determine sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sedments including 1 to empty the wastewater in reactors and immediately re inject fresh raw wastewater without any headspace to prevent sulfide and methane loss through liquid gas transfer 2 to collect five samples in 2 h with one per 30 min 3 to measure the dissolved sulfide and methane concentrations in the samples the linear regression of the measured concentrations versus time was applied to obtain slopes representing sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities 3 3 in sediment sulfidogenic activity and fa measurement on day 130 a diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was used to measure two dimensional high resolution sulfidogenic activity in sediments the principle of dgt for sulfide measurement in sewer sediment was introduced in previous publication zuo et al 2021a the dgt was prepared according to ding et al 2012 with the probe provided by the easysensor ltd www easysensor net in this study dgt probes were inserted into the sediment reactors r1 and r2 at about 10 00 pm in the end of urine exposure the wastewater in the reactors was completely emptied and fresh wastewater was then pumped in until it filled the reactor after 20 min the substrate in the wastewater was uniformly distributed in the reactor and the dgt probe was inserted vertically into the sediment the reactors were completely enclosed to prevent any sulfide loss the probes were signed at sediment water interface using a ceramic knife after 40 min the dgt was taken out for further analysis see details in text s1 of supplemental information si to reveal the relationship between suppression of sulfidogenic activity and the penetration of fa in sediments the vertical distribution of fa along sediments was synchronously determined the sediment was immediately taken out using a syringe based on the method described by hoehler et al 1994 the retrieved sediment was divided into four layers along the depth 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 4 cm each layer of sediment was centrifuged at 1000 rpm and the supernatant was used to determine ph and tan concentration the fa concentrations in different layers were calculated according to eq 1 3 4 microbial community and qpcr analysis microbial samples were collected from the two reactors on days 9 and 74 in the baseline and experimental phases respectively dna was extracted using fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals llc solon oh usa firstly high throughput sequencing was used to explore the changes of microbial community the variable regions v4 of the microbial 16s rrna gene was applied for pcr amplification with a pair of universal primes 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtw tctaat 3 walters et al 2016 qpcr targeting the functional genes dsra i e dissimilatory sulfite reductase and mcra i e methyl coenzyme m reductase in these samples were also performed on the dna extracted according to the method described in the literature auguet et al 2015 the efficiency of qpcr was estimated to be 95 detailed analysis procedures can be found in text s2 of si 3 5 chemical analysis concentrations of soluble cod sulfide and ammonium were determined according to the standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2006 sulfate concentration was measured by using the ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa vfa concentration was determined by using the gas chromatography gc 6890 n agilent usa to measure dissolved methane concentration 2 ml of wastewater was filtered through a 0 45 µm filter membrane through a syringe with a needle into a vacuum tube these tubes could reach the gas liquid equilibrium overnight then gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid was used to determine the methane content in the gas phase the methane concentration in the liquid phase was calculated by using mass balance and henry s law guisasola et al 2009 ph was monitored by using a ph probe meter wtw ph oxi340i germany 4 results and discussion 4 1 baseline operation of two sewer sediment reactors the 100 day baseline operation was conducted to obtain similar sulfidogenic and methanogenic performances and microbial characteristics between the two sewer sediment reactors in the 40 days before urine dosing events the average sulfidogenic and methanogenic rates of r1 were 11 4 1 1 g s m2 d and 3 4 1 9 g ch4 m2 d respectively close to those of r2 11 2 1 7 g s m2 d and 3 9 1 9 g ch4 m2 d fig 2 there was no significant difference in sulfidogenic and methanogenic performances and microbial characteristics between r1 and r2 p 0 05 t test the effluent cod of both reactors was around 210 mg l lower than the influent cod which was consistent with the biological sulfide and methane productions figure s1a of si microbial communities of two sediment samples collected from r1 and r2 on day 9 were also characterised and compared first the alpha diversity analysis revealed that the two reactors achieved similar community richness and diversity as indicated by sobs 1428 vs 1421 chao1 1971 vs 1836 and shannon 4 2 vs 5 0 fig 3a second the qpcr analysis showed similar srb and ma populations according to the dsra gene copies 1 2 0 3 108 r1 vs 0 96 0 2 108 r2 per g sludge responsible for sulfidogenesis and the mcra gene copies 3 2 0 08 108 r1 vs 1 8 0 04 108 r2 per g sludge responsible for methanogenesis fig 3b third the community composition analysis suggested that the srb in the two reactors mainly belonged to desulfobulbus desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium desulfomonile and desulforhabdus among which desulfobulbus had a high abundance of 55 in total srb fig 3c for the ma composition methanosaeta was the dominant genera 80 in total ma in addition the sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities and community compostion in the two laboratory sewer sediment reactors were similar to that commonly reported in previous studies liu et al 2016 2015a 2015b zuo et al 2021b 4 2 sulfide and methane control intermittent urine dosing 40 min per day commenced in r2 on day 0 the sulfidogenic activity of r2 sediment rapidly decreased with the sulfidogenic rate averaging 3 4 1 5 g s m2 d during the 160 day operation the rate was approximately half of 7 5 2 4 g s m2 d in r1 showing the effectiveness of sulfide control fig 2a the intermittent urine exposure led to a significant reduction in methane production as shown in fig 2b the average methanogenic rate of r2 sediment was 0 9 1 0 g ch4 m2 d compared to 5 2 3 1 g ch4 m2 d in r1 sediment this shows an average 83 reduction in methanogenic rate by urine dosing the cod concentration of r2 effluent was 358 33 mg l significantly higher than that of r1 effluent 254 18 mg l figure s1b of si the result comparing to the influent cod concentration of 444 20 mg l confirmed that the urine dosing reduced the rates of sulfidogenic and methanogenic organisms with the urine dosing microbial characteristics in r2 sediments appeared to have a significant difference from that in r1 sediments on day 74 the sobs chao1 and shannon index of r2 decreased to 783 1154 and 3 73 from 1350 1768 and 4 63 of r1 respectively fig 3a these results showed that intermittent urine exposure resulted in decreased community richness and diversity the urine exposure also resulted in a 1 log decrease in the abundance of dsra gene in r2 compared to that in r1 1 2 0 4 106 vs 1 9 0 8 107 copies g sludge fig 3b a more significant difference of 3 log decrease was obtained for the mcra gene abundance between r2 and r1 2 4 0 06 107 and 1 3 0 4 104 copies g sludge which was consistent with the substantial reduction in methane production the strong impact on ma agreed with previous reports that ma usually have lower tolerance than bacteria to chemicals such as oxygen sulfide fna ferrate and long chain fatty acids due to the special compositions of cell membrane dong et al 2019 jiang et al 2011 ipcc 2007 the urine exposure led to different impacts on the community composition of srb and ma respectively the relative proportion of desulfobulbus increased to 90 significantly higher than the other four srb genera this result together with the remaining sulfide productive rate in the experimental reactor suggests that desulfobulbus may have adapted to urine exposure in comprasion the ma composition remained almost unchanged after urine exposure in which methanosaeta was still the dominant genera fig 3c overall these results showed that the control efficiency of the proposed urine solution was close to the previous use of chemical biocides for srb and ma inactivation in sewer sedments for example gutierrez et al 2014 reported that a ph shock 11 5 for duration of 6 h with a dosing frequency of twice weekly could reduce an average sulfide production of 50 60 after exposure to fna and ferrate the sulfide production activity of srb took 7 10 days for a 50 recovery jiang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 to date all chemical biocides were reported to significantly reduce methane production 90 in sewer 4 3 in sediment activity in response to fa to shed light on the partial inhibition mechanism of urine exposure on sulfidogenic activity in sediment microscale sulfidogenic activity was measured on r1 and r2 sediments by using the dgt technique together with the measurement of in sediment ph and tan concentration which calculated fa concentration the results are presented in fig 4 the dgt technique allowed direct identification of the hotspot layer of sulfide generation along the depth of sediment in r1 without urine exposure the sulfide generation flux varied greatly inside the sediment specifically the sulfide generation flux of 1 87 0 12 g s m2 d was the highest level near the surface layer 0 0 5 cm then decreased rapidly and eventually stabilized below 1 cm fig 4a the vertical difference in the sulfide generation flux indicated that the upper layer 0 0 5 cm of sediments was the dominant active zone of sulfide generation in sewers in r2 the urine exposure significantly changed the sulfide generation flux in the upper layer i e the dominant active zone reducing it by 40 and thus approaching a similar reduction in the observed sulfide reduction performance fig 2a the decrease in the sulfide generation flux was hypothesised due to the exposure of fa in the dominant active zone as shown in fig 4a the average concentration of fa in the 0 1 cm layer containing dominant active zone 0 0 5 cm reached 136 28 mg nh3 n l this fa concentration was close to a ciritcal concentration about 150 mg nh3 n l that inactivates sewer microorganisms zuo et al 2020a fig 4b shows that ph and tan were 8 56 0 05 and 1025 210 mg n l in the 0 1 cm layer respectively this level of ph was not high enough 10 to inactivate sewer microorganisms evidenced by previous studies gutierrez et al 2014 tan is a sum of fa and ammonium nh4 among which nh4 usually has not toxic effect on microorganisms in contrast fa has long been identified as a biocide to a variety of microorganisms due to its strong disruption of extracellular polymeric substances eps zhang et al 2018 previous studies have confirmed the strong biocidal effects of fa on different biological wastewater treatment process liu et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to believe that fa exposure in the dominant active zone is the main cause of sulfide control in sewer sediments 4 4 economic and environmental impacts economic and environmental assessments are conducted to compare chemical dosing approaches scenario a with the proposed urine approach scenario b for sulfide control in sewers as illustrated in figs 5a and 5b four most commonly used chemicals i e ferric salt nitrate sodium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide ganigue et al 2011 are included in scenario a the detailed calculation and analysis methods are described in si texts s3 s4 and tables s1 s3 the estimations are based on the assumption of a gravity sewer pipe about 300 m long with a small diameter of 300 mm and an average sediment thickness of 50 mm which is similar to the results obtained from a previous field investigation in a real residential gravity sewer system zuo et al 2019 2021a the sewer pipe collects wastewater from a residential building with the same conditions illustrated in fig 1a the control sediments have a sulfidogenic activity of 11 g s m2 d and according to the experimental results the proposed urine approach can achieve sulfide control by about 50 to achieve a similar effectiveness for sulfide control a required amount of ferric salt nitrate sodium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide is calculated to be about 38 8 kg fe ml 14 8 kg no3 n ml 12 4 kg naoh ml and 30 kg mg oh 2 ml respectively these are equivalent to 2 12 kg fe pe year 0 81 kg no3 n pe year 0 85 kg naoh pe year and 1 6 kg mg oh 2 pe year respectively pe population equivalent based on the chemical consumptions it can be estimated that the nitrate dose has the highest cost 19 5 pe year followed by ferric salt 8 1 pe year and magnesium hydroxide 6 34 pe year fig 5c sodium hydroxide has the lowest cost 3 57 pe year because it does not require continuous dosing of the product i e intermittent dosing gutierrez et al 2014 the estimation and ranking is consistent with a previous field survey ganigue et al 2011 in this work the proposed urine approach results in the lowest cost of only 0 33 pe year with a total saving of more than 91 compared to the conventional chemical approaches the environmental impacts of chemical and urine approaches are also compared in terms of energy consumption and ghg emission fig 5c the nitrate and sodium hydroxide dosing lead to the maximum and minimum energy comsumption 194 and 24 mj pe year and ghg emissions 15 5 and 5 3 kg co2eq pe year respectively in comparison the energy consumption and ghg emissions of the urine approach are reduced by at least 80 and 96 respectively it should be pointed out that these estimations of chemical consumption are based mainly on the dosing experience with pressure sewers while the practical dosing cases in gravity sections are currently lacking however it can be expected that the use of chemicals in complex gravity sewers with dynamic flows will further increase consumption thus the advantages of the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed urine approach may be greater than estimated overall the significant reduction in cost energy consumption and ghg emission is because that the implementation of the urine approach only requires the construction of urine diversion pipe and storage tank 4 5 a practical solution for improving sewer management high sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sewer sediments result in sulfide and methane production and reduced organic carbon in current wastewater management fig 5a this study developed a new solution without chemical use to address the problem fig 5b this solution was demonstrated based on the experimental results that intermittent urine exposure effectively inactivated srb and ma in sewer sediments specifically the short exposure to urine for only 40 min per day resulted in 50 60 and 80 90 decrease in sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities respectively fig 2 these also led to 100 mg l higher cod remaining in domestic wastewater which will enhance nutrient removal and or recovery at downstream wwtps the solution developed in this study uses a simple urine separated discharge scheme instead of the traditional urine mixing discharge the urine is seperated from the rest of wastewater at source in residential buildings and then delivered to a storage tank through a urine deversion pipeline during one week storage the urea nitrogen component in the fresh urine is hydrolyzed into high strength ammonium with ph increased to above 9 0 which jointly led to a high fa level according to our experimental results the high strength fa of urine in the storage tank is partially discharged in situ daily into residential gravity branch pipes since the hrt of the urine storage tank is designed as one week 1 7 of urine stored in the storage tank is discharged into the sewers daily this daily discharge of urine is estimated to last for 40 min while maintaining its flow rate consistent with the average daily flow of wastewater based on urine volume and wastewater production as described in section 2 the urine discharge will unlikely be diluted during periods of low wastewater flow e g midnight in residential gravity sewers ensuring the effectiveness of fa inactivation on sewer sediments however the urine will be greatly diluted when entering gravity main pipes and downstream pumping stations thus this solution does not impose a shock load of ammonium and ph on gravity main pipes and downstream wwtps this solution mainly targets the control of some poorly designed small pipelines in upstream residential sewers which are prone to sediment accumulation in comparison gravity main pipes are usually not the hotspot of sulfide and methane production in sewers due to high wastewater flow and ventilation as proven in previous field studies zuo et al 2019 2021a therefore the new strategy in this work mainly addresses the pressing issue in upstream sediment sewers another advantage of this approach is that no additional nitrogen load is introduced to wwtps as the separated urine is part of municipal wastewater overall the proposed solution based on urine reuse is technically feasible in intergrated urban water management 4 6 challenges and future research this study provides a urine based solution without chemical inputs to achieve improved control of sulfide and methane in sewer sediments however the application of this strategy in real residential gravity sewers still faces challenges the primary challenge is the availability of urine source separation the experimental conditions used in this study were based on the premise that approximately 1 5 l of undiluted urine is collected from each person per day currently this may be difficult to achieve as urine diversion toilets need to be installed in each household however it should be pointed out that recent studies on urine source separation have shown that the total cost induced by urine source separation is not higher than conventional urine flushing facilities ishii and boyer 2015 this is because the installation of urine diverting toilets can greatly reduce the amount of tap water used for flushing thereby offsetting the facility cost of urine diverting toilets this is also demonstrated by our additional economic analysis text s5 the second challenge is the construction of urine storage tanks these tanks should be built in the basement of residential buildings and a volume is required to provide an hrt of 7 days for urea hydrolysis to ammonia as such we further propose an alternative design to the storage tank construction septic tanks are a preliminary removal of pollutants in many urban residential buildings there are ongoing discussions that septic tanks should be phased out as the reduced carbon source adversely affects nutrient removal at downstream wwtps bin et al 2017 huang et al 2018 this work has led us to reconsider whether septic tanks could be used locally as urine storage tanks because the volume of septic tanks meets the requirement of urine storage by calucation see text s6 and table s4 for details the third challenge is the volatilization of urine in sewers which may causes an odor issue as volatile ammonia has a pungent odor choosing a reasonable urine dosing time may be a solution completing urine dosing before the morning peak drainage time may minimize the odor impact as there is usually no wastewater discharge at this time while in the morning peak drainage time large flow wastewater can quickly wash away the odor once the urine enters the main sewers it will be heavily diluted to and wil not cause an odor finally technology optimization is still required this proof of concept study only examined one urine dilution ratio i e 3 and one urine discharge condition i e 40 min per day a number of operating parameters can be further optimized e g with the same amount of urine collected the urine can be discharged for a long duration of 5 h once a week the prolonged urine exposure may lead to a higher concentration of fa in the active zone of sediment thus expectedly enhancing the inactivation of sulfidogenic and methanogenic

14942,sulfide and methane production are a major concern in sewer management many solutions with the use of chemicals have been proposed yet incurring huge costs here this study reports an alternative solution to reduce sulfide and methane production in sewer sediments this is achieved through integration of urine source separation rapid storage and intermittent in situ re dosing into a sewer based on a reasonable capacity of urine collection an intermittent dosing strategy i e 40 min per day was designed and then experimentally tested using two laboratory sewer sediment reactors the long term operation showed that the proposed urine dosing in the experimental reactor effectively reduced sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities by 54 and 83 compared to those in the control reactor in sediment chemical and microbial analyses revealed that the short term exposure to urine wastewater was effective in suppressing sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea particularly within a surface active zone of sediments 0 0 5 cm likely attributed to the biocidal effect of urine free ammonia economic and environmental assessments indicated that the proposed urine approach can save 91 in total costs 80 in energy consumption and 96 in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the conventional use of chemicals including ferric salt nitrate sodium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide these

integrated wastewater management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewer is an improtant urban infrastructure responsible for wastewater collection from residential households and industries to downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps sulfide and methane emissions pose longstanding challenges to sewer management guisasola et al 2008 milde et al 1983 sulfide is produced from the biological reduction of sulfate by sulfate reducing bacteria srb which not only results in noxious odor and health issues but also damages sewer pipes via associated corrosion thus reducing sewer service life hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 li et al 2020 selvakumar et al 2010 methane is generated by methanogenic archaea ma and has a high global warming potential 28 times global warming potential of carbon dioxide and explosion risk lower explosive level is approximately 5 foley et al 2009 ipcc 2014 both sulfide and methane productions lead to loss of organic carbon in wastewater imposing detrimental impacts on biological nutrient removal performance at downstream wwtps jin et al 2018 in order to reduce sulfide and methane productions dosing of chemicals such as oxygen iron salts nitrite nitrate salts and alkalis into sewers have been developed worldwide gutierrez et al 2008 2014 jiang et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 jin et al 2018 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2022 nevertheless these approaches require significant chemical input ganigue et al 2011 usually incurring high costs which are even on the same order of magnitude as the lost asset value caused by sulfide induced deterioration rauch and kleidorfer 2014 gravity sewers make up the majority in the entire sewer network over 95 xu et al 2018 if gravity slope and wastewater flow are low sediments tend to accumulate which is more common in some poorly designed small pipelines in upstream residential sewers lu et al 2020 zuo et al 2021a the sewer sediments have potential to produce sulfide and methane under anaerobic conditions liu et al 2015a schmitt et al 1992 a field investigation recently found that gaseous sulfide concentration reached up to hundreds of ppm in some residential gravity sewers zuo et al 2019 resulting in a significant ordor nuisance to nearby resident sewer sediments have a thicker bioactive layer with more abundant srb and ma than sewer biofilms liu et al 2015a 2016 with limited substrate diffusion recent studies have shown that dosing of chemicals such as ferric salts and nitrate for sulfide and methane control in sediments is more difficult than that in sewer biofilms cao et al 2019 liu et al 2015b zuo et al 2020b moreover residential gravity sewers serve as the starting point of the entire sewer network and have many small pipelines making practical dosing of chemicals more difficult than main sewer pipelines integrated urban water management is an increasingly popular concept which can bring significant economic and environmental benefits pikaar et al 2014 rauch and kleidorfer 2014 sun et al 2015 it has been proposed to use urine wastewater for sulfide and methane control in sewers jiang et al 2011 oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2020a for example zheng et al 2017 developed a nitritation process to convert ammonia to nitrite in urine wastewater and generate a nitrite rich solution the nitrite at acidic conditions can form free nitrous acid fna a strong biocidal effect on pressure sewer biofilms can be used for sulfide control as an alternative to a chemical fna agent our recent study found that a high concentration of ammonia in urine wastewater was biocidal to sewer biofilms leading to the inactivation of sulfide and methane producers with the urine wastewater dosed directly zuo et al 2020a these concepts based on source separation and reuse of urine are expected to improve sewer management which do not incur extra chemicals to sewer as urine is a component of the wastewater while these studies revealed the biocidal effects and applications of fna and ammonia on microbial inactivation zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2020a a practical solution of dosing urine wastewater is still missing this study aims to develop and demonstrate a practical urine based strategy for reducing sulfide and methane production in gravity sewer sediments a feasible methodology of urine reuse was first designed and then experimentally tested using two lab scale sewer sediment reactors one reactor was used as an experimental system with the other as a control sulfide and methane production in sediment sulfidogenic activity and microbial variation were systematically monitored economic and environmental impacts of the proposed strategy were also assessed in comparison to conventional chemical dosing outcomes from this study support the development of a sustainable and practical approach for improving sewer management 2 design of urine collection and reuse fig 1a presents the design of urine collection and re dosing i e volume and frequency in residential areas a sewer pipe is assumed to collect wastewater from a building with 100 people a typical daily wastewater quota of 150 l per person is applied and thus a daily average wastewater flow rate of this sewer line is 15 m3 d it is assumed that each person can contribute 1 4 l of raw urine per day with a 3 fold dilution factor via flushing krieg et al 1986 rossi et al 2009 thus a total urine wastewater of 0 42 m3 per day can be collected urine storage is needed for urea hydrolysis to ammonia the urine storage tank has a volume of 2 9 m3 with a hydraulic retention time of one week a dosing flow rate of urine into the sewer is designed to be 15 m3 d equal to the average flow of wastewater if the stored urine wastewater can be dosed into sewers every day a daily volume is 0 4 m3 it thus requires 40 min for dosing at a flow of 15 m3 d the short dosing time i e 40 min facilitates the implementation of dosing in the midnight when the wastewater flow rate is low thus minimizing the dilution of ammonia concentration in sewer 3 experimental setup 3 1 operation of sewer sediment reactors two sewer sediment reactors namely r1 and r2 were applied to test the impact of urine dosing on sediment performances fig 1b the total volume of each reactor was 1 8 l 12 cm height and 14 cm inner diameter sediment samples were collected from a mature gravity sanitary sewer and added to sewer reactors with an initial depth of approximately 5 cm a mechanical stirrer zt 3ik15rgn c with two paddles was positioned in the liquid phase to provide a stirring speed of 30 rpm all reactors were covered with black cloth to block light r1 served as a control reactor and r2 was used to investigate the suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogeic activities within sewer sediments by urine dosing for 40 min per day the average temperature of reactors was 15 2 c the overall experiment lasted for 260 days consisting of two phases 1 the baseline phase day 100 0 two reactors were fed with fresh real wastewater in parallel the feeding pattern consisted of 16 cycles per day and each feed pumping event lasted 15 min transferring 0 3 l of wastewater into each reactor leading to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h the two sediment reactors was operated for 100 days to obtain stable sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities 2 the experimental phase day 1 160 r1 as the control reactor was operated under the same conditions as that in the baseline phase and r2 started to receive the designed urine dosing the urine wastewater was injected into r2 after the residual wastewater was drained off at a fixed time 9 00 pm each day after 40 min of urine exposure the urine was discharged from the reactors and then the fresh wastewater was re injected during the entire operation sediment bioactivity tests were performed 1 2 times per week to determine variations in sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations in the influent and effluent were monitored once per week the sediment samples in the surface layer 0 0 5 cm in two reactors were collected in two phases on days 9 and 74 and stored at 20 c in the refrigerator for further microbial analysis the raw wastewater was collected daily from a wet well at tsinghua university beijing china and used as the influent the collected wastewater was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent change of water quality it contained 15 50 mg so4 2 s l 10 mg h2s s l 200 400 mg cod l 10 30 mg volatile fatty acid vfa l in terms of cod the human urine was collected from a male toilet urinal of the sino italian environment and energy efficient building at tsinghua university the urine wastewater was stored in a large container at temperature 20 c for 7 days to allow the urea hydrolysis to ammonia the mature urine wastewater contained 6 7 g n l of total ammonia nitrogen tan at ph of 9 3 0 1 it was diluted by three times using tap water to mimic water flush hence the diluted urine wastewater contained about 2 g n l of tan with a ph of 9 1 0 1 jointly leading to a free ammonia fa concentration of 0 5 g nh3 n l at 15 c according to eq 1 anthonisen et al 1976 1 fa g n h 3 n l tan 10 ph e 6344 273 t 10 ph 3 2 sediment bioactivity tests bioactivity tests were performed to determine sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sedments including 1 to empty the wastewater in reactors and immediately re inject fresh raw wastewater without any headspace to prevent sulfide and methane loss through liquid gas transfer 2 to collect five samples in 2 h with one per 30 min 3 to measure the dissolved sulfide and methane concentrations in the samples the linear regression of the measured concentrations versus time was applied to obtain slopes representing sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities 3 3 in sediment sulfidogenic activity and fa measurement on day 130 a diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was used to measure two dimensional high resolution sulfidogenic activity in sediments the principle of dgt for sulfide measurement in sewer sediment was introduced in previous publication zuo et al 2021a the dgt was prepared according to ding et al 2012 with the probe provided by the easysensor ltd www easysensor net in this study dgt probes were inserted into the sediment reactors r1 and r2 at about 10 00 pm in the end of urine exposure the wastewater in the reactors was completely emptied and fresh wastewater was then pumped in until it filled the reactor after 20 min the substrate in the wastewater was uniformly distributed in the reactor and the dgt probe was inserted vertically into the sediment the reactors were completely enclosed to prevent any sulfide loss the probes were signed at sediment water interface using a ceramic knife after 40 min the dgt was taken out for further analysis see details in text s1 of supplemental information si to reveal the relationship between suppression of sulfidogenic activity and the penetration of fa in sediments the vertical distribution of fa along sediments was synchronously determined the sediment was immediately taken out using a syringe based on the method described by hoehler et al 1994 the retrieved sediment was divided into four layers along the depth 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 4 cm each layer of sediment was centrifuged at 1000 rpm and the supernatant was used to determine ph and tan concentration the fa concentrations in different layers were calculated according to eq 1 3 4 microbial community and qpcr analysis microbial samples were collected from the two reactors on days 9 and 74 in the baseline and experimental phases respectively dna was extracted using fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals llc solon oh usa firstly high throughput sequencing was used to explore the changes of microbial community the variable regions v4 of the microbial 16s rrna gene was applied for pcr amplification with a pair of universal primes 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtw tctaat 3 walters et al 2016 qpcr targeting the functional genes dsra i e dissimilatory sulfite reductase and mcra i e methyl coenzyme m reductase in these samples were also performed on the dna extracted according to the method described in the literature auguet et al 2015 the efficiency of qpcr was estimated to be 95 detailed analysis procedures can be found in text s2 of si 3 5 chemical analysis concentrations of soluble cod sulfide and ammonium were determined according to the standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2006 sulfate concentration was measured by using the ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa vfa concentration was determined by using the gas chromatography gc 6890 n agilent usa to measure dissolved methane concentration 2 ml of wastewater was filtered through a 0 45 µm filter membrane through a syringe with a needle into a vacuum tube these tubes could reach the gas liquid equilibrium overnight then gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid was used to determine the methane content in the gas phase the methane concentration in the liquid phase was calculated by using mass balance and henry s law guisasola et al 2009 ph was monitored by using a ph probe meter wtw ph oxi340i germany 4 results and discussion 4 1 baseline operation of two sewer sediment reactors the 100 day baseline operation was conducted to obtain similar sulfidogenic and methanogenic performances and microbial characteristics between the two sewer sediment reactors in the 40 days before urine dosing events the average sulfidogenic and methanogenic rates of r1 were 11 4 1 1 g s m2 d and 3 4 1 9 g ch4 m2 d respectively close to those of r2 11 2 1 7 g s m2 d and 3 9 1 9 g ch4 m2 d fig 2 there was no significant difference in sulfidogenic and methanogenic performances and microbial characteristics between r1 and r2 p 0 05 t test the effluent cod of both reactors was around 210 mg l lower than the influent cod which was consistent with the biological sulfide and methane productions figure s1a of si microbial communities of two sediment samples collected from r1 and r2 on day 9 were also characterised and compared first the alpha diversity analysis revealed that the two reactors achieved similar community richness and diversity as indicated by sobs 1428 vs 1421 chao1 1971 vs 1836 and shannon 4 2 vs 5 0 fig 3a second the qpcr analysis showed similar srb and ma populations according to the dsra gene copies 1 2 0 3 108 r1 vs 0 96 0 2 108 r2 per g sludge responsible for sulfidogenesis and the mcra gene copies 3 2 0 08 108 r1 vs 1 8 0 04 108 r2 per g sludge responsible for methanogenesis fig 3b third the community composition analysis suggested that the srb in the two reactors mainly belonged to desulfobulbus desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium desulfomonile and desulforhabdus among which desulfobulbus had a high abundance of 55 in total srb fig 3c for the ma composition methanosaeta was the dominant genera 80 in total ma in addition the sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities and community compostion in the two laboratory sewer sediment reactors were similar to that commonly reported in previous studies liu et al 2016 2015a 2015b zuo et al 2021b 4 2 sulfide and methane control intermittent urine dosing 40 min per day commenced in r2 on day 0 the sulfidogenic activity of r2 sediment rapidly decreased with the sulfidogenic rate averaging 3 4 1 5 g s m2 d during the 160 day operation the rate was approximately half of 7 5 2 4 g s m2 d in r1 showing the effectiveness of sulfide control fig 2a the intermittent urine exposure led to a significant reduction in methane production as shown in fig 2b the average methanogenic rate of r2 sediment was 0 9 1 0 g ch4 m2 d compared to 5 2 3 1 g ch4 m2 d in r1 sediment this shows an average 83 reduction in methanogenic rate by urine dosing the cod concentration of r2 effluent was 358 33 mg l significantly higher than that of r1 effluent 254 18 mg l figure s1b of si the result comparing to the influent cod concentration of 444 20 mg l confirmed that the urine dosing reduced the rates of sulfidogenic and methanogenic organisms with the urine dosing microbial characteristics in r2 sediments appeared to have a significant difference from that in r1 sediments on day 74 the sobs chao1 and shannon index of r2 decreased to 783 1154 and 3 73 from 1350 1768 and 4 63 of r1 respectively fig 3a these results showed that intermittent urine exposure resulted in decreased community richness and diversity the urine exposure also resulted in a 1 log decrease in the abundance of dsra gene in r2 compared to that in r1 1 2 0 4 106 vs 1 9 0 8 107 copies g sludge fig 3b a more significant difference of 3 log decrease was obtained for the mcra gene abundance between r2 and r1 2 4 0 06 107 and 1 3 0 4 104 copies g sludge which was consistent with the substantial reduction in methane production the strong impact on ma agreed with previous reports that ma usually have lower tolerance than bacteria to chemicals such as oxygen sulfide fna ferrate and long chain fatty acids due to the special compositions of cell membrane dong et al 2019 jiang et al 2011 ipcc 2007 the urine exposure led to different impacts on the community composition of srb and ma respectively the relative proportion of desulfobulbus increased to 90 significantly higher than the other four srb genera this result together with the remaining sulfide productive rate in the experimental reactor suggests that desulfobulbus may have adapted to urine exposure in comprasion the ma composition remained almost unchanged after urine exposure in which methanosaeta was still the dominant genera fig 3c overall these results showed that the control efficiency of the proposed urine solution was close to the previous use of chemical biocides for srb and ma inactivation in sewer sedments for example gutierrez et al 2014 reported that a ph shock 11 5 for duration of 6 h with a dosing frequency of twice weekly could reduce an average sulfide production of 50 60 after exposure to fna and ferrate the sulfide production activity of srb took 7 10 days for a 50 recovery jiang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 to date all chemical biocides were reported to significantly reduce methane production 90 in sewer 4 3 in sediment activity in response to fa to shed light on the partial inhibition mechanism of urine exposure on sulfidogenic activity in sediment microscale sulfidogenic activity was measured on r1 and r2 sediments by using the dgt technique together with the measurement of in sediment ph and tan concentration which calculated fa concentration the results are presented in fig 4 the dgt technique allowed direct identification of the hotspot layer of sulfide generation along the depth of sediment in r1 without urine exposure the sulfide generation flux varied greatly inside the sediment specifically the sulfide generation flux of 1 87 0 12 g s m2 d was the highest level near the surface layer 0 0 5 cm then decreased rapidly and eventually stabilized below 1 cm fig 4a the vertical difference in the sulfide generation flux indicated that the upper layer 0 0 5 cm of sediments was the dominant active zone of sulfide generation in sewers in r2 the urine exposure significantly changed the sulfide generation flux in the upper layer i e the dominant active zone reducing it by 40 and thus approaching a similar reduction in the observed sulfide reduction performance fig 2a the decrease in the sulfide generation flux was hypothesised due to the exposure of fa in the dominant active zone as shown in fig 4a the average concentration of fa in the 0 1 cm layer containing dominant active zone 0 0 5 cm reached 136 28 mg nh3 n l this fa concentration was close to a ciritcal concentration about 150 mg nh3 n l that inactivates sewer microorganisms zuo et al 2020a fig 4b shows that ph and tan were 8 56 0 05 and 1025 210 mg n l in the 0 1 cm layer respectively this level of ph was not high enough 10 to inactivate sewer microorganisms evidenced by previous studies gutierrez et al 2014 tan is a sum of fa and ammonium nh4 among which nh4 usually has not toxic effect on microorganisms in contrast fa has long been identified as a biocide to a variety of microorganisms due to its strong disruption of extracellular polymeric substances eps zhang et al 2018 previous studies have confirmed the strong biocidal effects of fa on different biological wastewater treatment process liu et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to believe that fa exposure in the dominant active zone is the main cause of sulfide control in sewer sediments 4 4 economic and environmental impacts economic and environmental assessments are conducted to compare chemical dosing approaches scenario a with the proposed urine approach scenario b for sulfide control in sewers as illustrated in figs 5a and 5b four most commonly used chemicals i e ferric salt nitrate sodium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide ganigue et al 2011 are included in scenario a the detailed calculation and analysis methods are described in si texts s3 s4 and tables s1 s3 the estimations are based on the assumption of a gravity sewer pipe about 300 m long with a small diameter of 300 mm and an average sediment thickness of 50 mm which is similar to the results obtained from a previous field investigation in a real residential gravity sewer system zuo et al 2019 2021a the sewer pipe collects wastewater from a residential building with the same conditions illustrated in fig 1a the control sediments have a sulfidogenic activity of 11 g s m2 d and according to the experimental results the proposed urine approach can achieve sulfide control by about 50 to achieve a similar effectiveness for sulfide control a required amount of ferric salt nitrate sodium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide is calculated to be about 38 8 kg fe ml 14 8 kg no3 n ml 12 4 kg naoh ml and 30 kg mg oh 2 ml respectively these are equivalent to 2 12 kg fe pe year 0 81 kg no3 n pe year 0 85 kg naoh pe year and 1 6 kg mg oh 2 pe year respectively pe population equivalent based on the chemical consumptions it can be estimated that the nitrate dose has the highest cost 19 5 pe year followed by ferric salt 8 1 pe year and magnesium hydroxide 6 34 pe year fig 5c sodium hydroxide has the lowest cost 3 57 pe year because it does not require continuous dosing of the product i e intermittent dosing gutierrez et al 2014 the estimation and ranking is consistent with a previous field survey ganigue et al 2011 in this work the proposed urine approach results in the lowest cost of only 0 33 pe year with a total saving of more than 91 compared to the conventional chemical approaches the environmental impacts of chemical and urine approaches are also compared in terms of energy consumption and ghg emission fig 5c the nitrate and sodium hydroxide dosing lead to the maximum and minimum energy comsumption 194 and 24 mj pe year and ghg emissions 15 5 and 5 3 kg co2eq pe year respectively in comparison the energy consumption and ghg emissions of the urine approach are reduced by at least 80 and 96 respectively it should be pointed out that these estimations of chemical consumption are based mainly on the dosing experience with pressure sewers while the practical dosing cases in gravity sections are currently lacking however it can be expected that the use of chemicals in complex gravity sewers with dynamic flows will further increase consumption thus the advantages of the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed urine approach may be greater than estimated overall the significant reduction in cost energy consumption and ghg emission is because that the implementation of the urine approach only requires the construction of urine diversion pipe and storage tank 4 5 a practical solution for improving sewer management high sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sewer sediments result in sulfide and methane production and reduced organic carbon in current wastewater management fig 5a this study developed a new solution without chemical use to address the problem fig 5b this solution was demonstrated based on the experimental results that intermittent urine exposure effectively inactivated srb and ma in sewer sediments specifically the short exposure to urine for only 40 min per day resulted in 50 60 and 80 90 decrease in sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities respectively fig 2 these also led to 100 mg l higher cod remaining in domestic wastewater which will enhance nutrient removal and or recovery at downstream wwtps the solution developed in this study uses a simple urine separated discharge scheme instead of the traditional urine mixing discharge the urine is seperated from the rest of wastewater at source in residential buildings and then delivered to a storage tank through a urine deversion pipeline during one week storage the urea nitrogen component in the fresh urine is hydrolyzed into high strength ammonium with ph increased to above 9 0 which jointly led to a high fa level according to our experimental results the high strength fa of urine in the storage tank is partially discharged in situ daily into residential gravity branch pipes since the hrt of the urine storage tank is designed as one week 1 7 of urine stored in the storage tank is discharged into the sewers daily this daily discharge of urine is estimated to last for 40 min while maintaining its flow rate consistent with the average daily flow of wastewater based on urine volume and wastewater production as described in section 2 the urine discharge will unlikely be diluted during periods of low wastewater flow e g midnight in residential gravity sewers ensuring the effectiveness of fa inactivation on sewer sediments however the urine will be greatly diluted when entering gravity main pipes and downstream pumping stations thus this solution does not impose a shock load of ammonium and ph on gravity main pipes and downstream wwtps this solution mainly targets the control of some poorly designed small pipelines in upstream residential sewers which are prone to sediment accumulation in comparison gravity main pipes are usually not the hotspot of sulfide and methane production in sewers due to high wastewater flow and ventilation as proven in previous field studies zuo et al 2019 2021a therefore the new strategy in this work mainly addresses the pressing issue in upstream sediment sewers another advantage of this approach is that no additional nitrogen load is introduced to wwtps as the separated urine is part of municipal wastewater overall the proposed solution based on urine reuse is technically feasible in intergrated urban water management 4 6 challenges and future research this study provides a urine based solution without chemical inputs to achieve improved control of sulfide and methane in sewer sediments however the application of this strategy in real residential gravity sewers still faces challenges the primary challenge is the availability of urine source separation the experimental conditions used in this study were based on the premise that approximately 1 5 l of undiluted urine is collected from each person per day currently this may be difficult to achieve as urine diversion toilets need to be installed in each household however it should be pointed out that recent studies on urine source separation have shown that the total cost induced by urine source separation is not higher than conventional urine flushing facilities ishii and boyer 2015 this is because the installation of urine diverting toilets can greatly reduce the amount of tap water used for flushing thereby offsetting the facility cost of urine diverting toilets this is also demonstrated by our additional economic analysis text s5 the second challenge is the construction of urine storage tanks these tanks should be built in the basement of residential buildings and a volume is required to provide an hrt of 7 days for urea hydrolysis to ammonia as such we further propose an alternative design to the storage tank construction septic tanks are a preliminary removal of pollutants in many urban residential buildings there are ongoing discussions that septic tanks should be phased out as the reduced carbon source adversely affects nutrient removal at downstream wwtps bin et al 2017 huang et al 2018 this work has led us to reconsider whether septic tanks could be used locally as urine storage tanks because the volume of septic tanks meets the requirement of urine storage by calucation see text s6 and table s4 for details the third challenge is the volatilization of urine in sewers which may causes an odor issue as volatile ammonia has a pungent odor choosing a reasonable urine dosing time may be a solution completing urine dosing before the morning peak drainage time may minimize the odor impact as there is usually no wastewater discharge at this time while in the morning peak drainage time large flow wastewater can quickly wash away the odor once the urine enters the main sewers it will be heavily diluted to and wil not cause an odor finally technology optimization is still required this proof of concept study only examined one urine dilution ratio i e 3 and one urine discharge condition i e 40 min per day a number of operating parameters can be further optimized e g with the same amount of urine collected the urine can be discharged for a long duration of 5 h once a week the prolonged urine exposure may lead to a higher concentration of fa in the active zone of sediment thus expectedly enhancing the inactivation of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities inside sewer sediments moreover the influence of sewer temperature change on technology optimization needs to be further investigated from the perspective of urine resource reuse future research is needed to compare the advantages and disadvantages of urine for sewer control and other urine reuse routes 5 conclusions this study developd a new solution based on urine source separation and reuse for sulfide and methane control in gravity sewers an intermittent dosing strategy i e 40 min per day was designed based on a reasonable capacity of urine collection and then experimentally investigated the economic and environmental analyses were also condicted the main conclusions are as follows urine dosing 40 min per day in the experimental reactor effectively reduced sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities by 54 and 83 compared to those in the control reactor a short term exposure to urine was effective in suppressing srb and ma particularly within a surface active zone of sediments 0 0 5 cm attributed to the biocidal effect of urine fa the proposed solution would save cost of 91 reduce ghg emissions by 96 and lower energy consumption by 80 at least compared to commonly

organics are recovered as eps and 25 30 as methane 260 ml methane g vs by integrating alkaline anaerobic digestion ad it was shown that 20 of excess sludge total phosphorus tp ends in the eps further

because of low ammonium concentration however ammonium concentration in the ad centrate was calculated to be 2600 mg nh4 n l and 20 of tn making it feasible for recovery the methodology used in this study consisted of three main steps the first step was to develop a laboratory protocol mimicking demonstration scale eps extraction conditions the second step was to establish mass balances over the eps extraction process on laboratory and demonstration scales within a full scale ags wwtp finally the feasibility of resource recovery was evaluated based on concentrations loads and integration of existing technologies for resource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eps extraction sewage mass balances phosphorus methane nitrogen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater is considered a valuable resource rather than a waste due to resource scarcity market demand and economic interests therefore the transition of conventional wastewater plants into resource recovery plants has become of interest recently van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 wastewater provides opportunities to recover energy biosolids reusable water and other valuable nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and other elements kehrein et al 2020 hao et al 2019b a dutch public private partnership led to the development of the full scale aerobic granular sludge technology also known as nereda technology for wastewater treatment aerobic granular sludge ags is a promising technology as it offers key advantages compared to conventional activated sludge technologies pronk et al 2015 de kreuk et al 2005 these advantages include a 75 reduction in footprint a 30 reduction in energy and less operating costs associated with phosphorus removal the study of ags not only opened a door for a more resource efficient wastewater treatment technology but also created new opportunities for resource recovery with the recovery of extracellular polymeric substances eps as a successful example lin et al 2018 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 seviour et al 2009 eps is a polymeric gel material produced by bacteria during cell metabolism that consists of proteins polysaccharides dna lipids glycoproteins and humic substances that form the matrix in which the cells are immobilized as granular particles seviour et al 2019 eps from aerobic granular sludge offers various applications in agriculture building textile and paper industries van der knaap 2019 henze et al 2020 it also showed unique properties as a composite material bio stimulant and flame retardant kim et al 2020 feng et al 2019 lin et al 2015 the netherlands has the world s first two demonstration scale installations to extract eps from nereda granules under the product name kaumera the eps extraction process involves elevated temperature and ph conditions to dissolve the biofilm matrix in granules and target structural eps as reported by felz 2019 eps recovery introduces an innovative concept to valorize the cod instead of converting cod into energy according to the bio based recovery value pyramid biomass should ideally be first delegated as a material higher value before it is delegated to final energetic use lower value stegmann et al 2020 cod has a relatively large exergy content that should be preserved and converted into carbonaceous materials moreover there has always been a perception that chemical energy is the only source of recoverable energy in wastewater however studies showed that the potential of thermal energy recovery is around ten times larger than chemical energy recovery as biogas x hao li et al 2019 for these reasons it is argued that cod recovery should be in the form of materials i e eps rather than energy the eps extraction process under elevated ph and temperature conditions might also offer recovery opportunities for other elements such as phosphorus nitrogen or methane which could create a new generation of ags wwtps with integrated resource recovery however eps yield should not be affected by resource recovery since it is likely the main driver for a recovery facility phosphorus is on the list of critical raw materials issued by the eu because its supply security is at risk and its economic importance is high phosphorus is considered a bottleneck due to its life essential nature and low abundance phosphorus recovery from wastewater is experiencing increased interest as sewage is one of the richest streams of phosphorus childers et al 2011 espp webinar 2020 eynard et al 2020 according to van dijk et al 2016 phosphorus in wastewater accounts for 15 of total imported phosphorus in europe in ags wwtps phosphorus removal relies on phosphorus accumulating organisms paos taking phosphate in wastewater as intracellular phosphorus during the alternation of anaerobic and aerobic phases in the nereda tank de kreuk et al 2005 high ph and temperature extraction conditions could potentially change phosphorus speciation or mineralogy in sludge enabling or exacerbating recovery nitrogen is another essential nutrient found in wastewater in ags wwtp ammonium nitrogen is removed in the form of nitrogen gas through simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and a small part of it ends in the sludge de kreuk et al 2005 henze et al 2020 during the eps extraction process the ags undergoes thermo alkaline conditions potentially releasing organic and inorganic nitrogen into the liquid streams siami et al 2020 toutian et al 2020 evaluating the nitrogen fate over the process is to be considered to assess its recovery potential anaerobic digestion could also be integrated into the eps extraction process as a secondary technology to recover further cod as methane from the alkaline sludge residuals by product stream from the eps extraction process this integration is interesting as alkaline pre treatment of sludge increases the anaerobic degradability of organics and biogas yields fang et al 2014 li et al 2012 evaluating the potential of phosphate and ammonium recovery from digestate liquid fraction is also to be considered as they are released during organics digestion uysal et al 2010 nitrogen and phosphorus recovery from the eps extraction process by product streams is also crucial to prevent operational issues due to their recirculation to the wwtp influent due to all these reasons investigating the status of organics phosphorus and nitrogen over the eps extraction process is of interest the fate of nutrients through the eps extraction process is unknown a careful analysis of the eps production process is vital to identify the best synergies to combine these elements recovery within the eps extraction process mass balances can provide insight into how and what to expect from integrated recovery technologies to evaluate these synergies they are a robust decision tool to estimate quantities of elements of interest in all relevant streams recovery potential make value chains and evaluate market potential kehrein et al 2020 solon et al 2019 however the existing laboratory scale eps extraction protocol by felz et al 2016 shows differences compared to large demonstration scale extractions which are relevant for resource recovery as summarized in table 1 the most significant difference is the dilution factor during the extraction as dilution affects concentrations and saturation conditions so it does not allow for accurate judging of the potential of combined nutrient recovery a representative translation of large scale conditions to laboratory scale is essential for a realistic evaluation of concentrations and quantities therefore this study involved the development of a modified laboratory protocol to simulate large demonstration scale conditions this was crucial for conducting future experiments to test resource recovery technologies on sludge from various sources and seasons and to make predictions about large scale impacts in later stages this study aims to set the foundation for a new generation of ags wwtps with integrated resource recovery by answering two main research questions the first question relates to the recovery potential of combined phosphorus nitrogen eps and methane from ags wwtp so mass balances were established on laboratory and demonstration scales eps extractions and extrapolated to a full scale nereda ags wwtp to address this question the second question is about the possible existing technologies that can be applied to recover these elements to reach a fully integrated ags wwtp to address this concentrations stream composition speciation of nutrients and loads were used to qualitatively evaluate the feasibility of existing technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory extractions laboratory extractions were performed using ags surplus sludge samples collected after belt thickening from epe ags wwtp the sludge samples are a mix of flocs and small granules so called selection spill which is the sludge removed after every cycle sludge samples had the following average composition 5 ts 4 3 vs 30 g p kg ts and 60 g n kg ts extractions were performed based on a newly developed modified protocol adapted from demonstration scale practices in epe and zutphen table 1 summarizes how the modified laboratory protocol mimics zutphen epe demonstration scale eps extractions the detailed laboratory protocol steps are listed in section 3 of the supplementary material 2 2 epe demonstration extractions the resemblances and differences between the modified laboratory and epe demonstration extractions were assessed in this study epe ags wwtp is the first full scale domestic wastewater treatment plant in the netherlands to install the innovative nereda sewage treatment technology operated by the water authority waterschap vallei en veluwe the wwtp treats wastewater produced by the town of epe with an average daily influent equal to 6200 m3 and 37 167 p e at the time of this sampling campaign the nereda reactors had a sludge concentration of 8 g mlss l and were operated with process cycles of approximately 6 h 3 h of aeration 1 h of settling and 2 h of anaerobic feeding simultaneous effluent withdrawal these data are site specific and vary between different wwtp s the excess sludge was stored in an aerated sludge buffer tank before being transported to the belt thickener in the eps extraction installation the eps extraction installation in epe is the second installation in the netherlands before our investigation many extraction runs had been performed at the site and in general extraction runs in the demonstration plant are for a few days only sampling for this study was performed on a continuous eps extraction process treating 0 5 m3 spill sludge hour koh and hcl dosing rates were 11 and 7 l hour respectively 20th june 2021 was the starting day of the campaign to run the system and ensure steady state conditions then samples were collected two days after the start of the operational run so two time samples were collected on the 22nd and 23rd of june 2021 fig 1 shows the process flow in the epe demonstration with sampling points stream b which is the initial thickened sludge stream d which is the alkaline liquid stream containing the hydrolyzed eps g which is the alkaline sludge residue stream that remains after eps hydrolysis and separation f which is the eps production stream and h is the acidic liquid stream after eps production and separation to confirm that our sampling days are representative we compared results from our study with earlier results from epe e van der knaap 2019 and other unpublished measurements performed by rhdhv as described in section 2 in the supplementary material in detail this comparison showed that the measurements of 23rd june 2021 were more typical for the normal operation of the plant than the results of 22nd on this first day especially the operation of the alkaline centrifuge was different than normal therefore we focus in the result section on the results of june 23rd the results of the 22nd can be found in the supplemental information the differences between the 22nd and 23rd are interesting and discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 correspondingly sludge samples from the 22nd and 23rd were collected to perform laboratory extractions as described in table 1 at a similar ph as epe for all laboratory and epe demonstration scale samples measurements were done in triplets and average values and their standard deviation were calculated 2 3 mass balance calculations regarding laboratory scale mass balances concentrations masses and volumes of different fractions were measured experimentally regarding demonstration scale mass balances concentrations were measured experimentally for collected samples d g f and h flow rates were calculated using measured concentrations instead of using flow meters data logger to ensure the accuracy of these flows using b sludge feed as the initial condition as shown in section 1 of the supplementary material epe demonstration installation does not treat the full sludge flow from epe nereda wwtp but the results were extrapolated to give the effect if it would be full scale the mass balances over nereda wwtp were evaluated based on the 2021 one year average measured flows and the composition of influent effluent and sludge data were collected from the plant database the plant has the following average wastewater influent composition 835 mg cod l 81 mg n l and 7 2 mg p l and a daily load of 4174 kg cod day 497 kg n day and 44 kg p day sankey diagrams depicted mass flows where flow sizes are proportional to the influent mass flow expressed in 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 total solids ts and volatile solids vs ts and vs were analyzed according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 1999 2 4 2 total chemical oxygen demand tcod and total nitrogen tn both tcod and tn were measured using hach lange test kits lck514 338 238 hach lange uk heated in a thermostat ht200s hach lange to 170 celsius and then analyzed using a spectrophotometer dr 3900 vis spectral photometer wavelength range 320 750 nm carbon and nitrogen fate through the eps extraction process was further confirmed by analyzing total carbon and total nitrogen using an elemental analyzer mettler toledo america 2 4 3 microwave digestion all solid samples were destructed by microwave digestion to convert them to liquid analyses samples were digested in an ethos easy from milestone with an sk 15 high pressure rotor around 50 mg of solids were put in a teflon vessel in which 10 ml of ultrapure hno3 64 5 70 5 from vwr chemicals was poured the digester is set to reach 200 celsius in 15 min run at this temperature for 15 min and cool down for 1 hour 2 4 4 icp oes the inorganic elemental composition was measured via inductively coupled plasma perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv with an optical emission spectroscopy as a detector the device was equipped with an autosampler perkin elmer type esi sc 4 dx fast and the data were processed with the software perkin elmer winlab32 the rinse and internal standard solutions were 2 hno3 and 10 mg l of yttrium 2 4 5 ic liquid samples were pre treated first by filtering the samples through 0 45 μm followed by 0 22 μm membrane filters before analysis anions and cations free dissolved ions were measured by metrohm compact ion chromatograph flex 930 to confirm these measurements and to avoid small colloidal particles squeezed through the filters ultrafiltration was used liquid samples were filtered using ultrafiltration centrifugal tubes with polyethersulfone pes members with a molecular weight cutoff mwco of 3 k thermofisher uk 2 4 6 x ray diffraction xrd room temperature dried samples were used for xrd analysis the sample was filled in a 0 7 mm glass capillary and tamped so the solid settled the capillaries were sealed with a burner and mounted in a sample holder the device used was a bruker d8 advance diffractometer with cu ka radiation coupled θ 2θ scan 10 110 step size 0 030 2θ counting time per step 2 s the data evaluation was performed using burker software diffracsuite eva vs 6 3 results 3 1 concentrations in laboratory and epe demonstration extractions table 2 shows the total solids tcod total nitrogen total phosphorus and dissolved species relevant for nutrient recovery as phosphate ammonium calcium and magnesium ions in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams table 3 shows the eps kaumera and alkaline sludge residue composition in laboratory and epe extractions unlike the original laboratory protocol the new modified laboratory protocol concentrations are comparable and have the same order of magnitude as the demonstration scale concentrations it was also observed that the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in the alkaline stream are 6 10 times lower than in the acidic liquid stream both in the modified laboratory protocol and epe demonstration scale which could be due to the eps nature as discussed in section 4 4 2 3 2 the appearance of an alkaline gel layer after the thermal alkaline hydrolysis step and centrifugation there was a stratification of the granular matrix into a residue part lower layer a gel layer middle layer and a soluble layer upper layer shown in fig 2 despite the appearance of the alkaline gel layer it was observed that the kaumera yield is 30 of tcod or volatile solids of sludge both in the original diluted and modified undiluted laboratory extraction protocol when this alkaline gel layer is not included in the eps soluble fraction understanding the fate of this alkaline gel layer in both laboratory and epe demonstration scales is discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 table 4 shows the average composition of this alkaline gel layer compared to the kaumera eps on the laboratory scale the gel layer has higher inorganic content than kaumera as it has a higher p ca and fe content xrd analysis also showed that the alkaline gel layer contains vivianite however no crystalline p mineral was detected in kaumera which shows that p speciation in both fractions is different the presence of vivianite can be explained by the fact that fe precipitates in neutral to alkaline conditions and there is always fe in the raw sewage wilfert et al 2015 there is also a slaughterhouse discharge to epe wwtp which contains most likely high levels of fe spectra are shown in section 5 of the supplementary material 3 3 the potential of carbon recovery laboratory scale extractions the tcod mass balance over the eps extraction using the modified laboratory protocol undiluted was established as shown in fig 3 a tcod balances were confirmed by the fate of volatile solids along the process data shown in table 4 of the supplementary material during the alkaline step the high ph enriches the negative charges of the eps causing its repulsion and solubilization lotti et al 2019 and around 40 of sludge tcod ended in the alkaline liquid stream then during the acidification step the low ph reduces the negative charge of the eps causing its precipitation as a hydrogel with a yield of 30 of excess granular sludge tcod it was estimated that 35 of the initial cod was present in the alkaline gel layer 25 in the alkaline sludge residue and only 10 ended in the acidic liquid stream possibly a fraction of organics that cannot precipitate at low ph conditions by comparing the tcod volatile solids fate in original diluted and modified undiluted laboratory protocols it was observed that the gel layer ended in the acidic liquid stream in diluted conditions increasing the tcod percentage to 45 instead of 10 as indicated by the shaded gray arrow in fig 3a instead the modified laboratory protocol shows this layer as an independent fraction on top of alkaline sludge residue the alkaline sludge residue by product stream could function as an input for an alkaline mesophilic anaerobic digester ad the alkaline sludge residue theoretical composition was calculated as described in kleerebezem 2014 based on its dry organic matter tcod and tn content from these measurements the elemental substrate composition cchhoonn and the stoichiometry of the anaerobic digestion are estimated as shown in table 5 the model predicts the maximum methane production to be 516 ml g vs assuming 100 degradation however in practice around 50 degradation of organics occurs at maximum as discussed in section 4 3 which makes the potential of methane production 260 ml g vs recovering 30 of sludge tcod as methane 3 4 the potential of phosphorus recovery laboratory scale extractions a phosphorus mass balance over laboratory scale using the modified protocol undiluted was established as shown in fig 3b including the bound and free dissolved ortho phosphate species 20 of excess sludge total phosphorus ends in the eps fraction bound phosphorus in liquid streams was calculated as the difference between the measured values of total phosphorus and free ortho phosphates total phosphorus in eps was estimated to be divided into a 3 1 ratio of bound phosphorus to free dissolved phosphorus assuming that the subtraction of p species in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams calculates the p fraction in eps however this should be measured directly to be confirmed in future research since most of the current phosphorus recovery systems recover ortho phosphates from liquid streams ortho phosphate fractions in alkaline and acidic liquid streams were measured the ortho phosphate in the spill sludge was initially measured as 10 of sludge tp 25 of sludge tp was released to the alkaline stream during the alkaline hydrolysis step as ortho phosphate and 20 in the acidic liquid stream the concentrations of ortho phosphates in alkaline and acidic liquid streams were 615 and 630 mg po4 p l respectively ortho phosphate in the anaerobic digestion centrate was also assessed it was calculated using the laboratory measurements of alkaline sludge residue as the influent and some basic assumptions from literature research as shown in section 7 in the supplementary material 15 of sludge tp would end in effluent with a concentration of 900 mg po4 p l 3 5 the potential of nitrogen recovery laboratory scale extractions the nitrogen mass balance for modified laboratory scale extractions of epe sludge was established as shown in fig 3c including the organic and inorganic dissolved species in spill sludge nitrate and nitrite concentrations were negligible ammonium was less than 2 of sludge tn and the rest was organic nitrogen so the nitrogen mass balance was dominated by organic nitrogen 30 of excess sludge tn ends in the eps fraction primarily as organic nitrogen the nitrate and nitrite species concentrations were negligible in the liquid streams and ammonium concentrations in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams were low the fraction of ammonium nitrogen was around 2 of sludge tn with 105 and 110 mg nh4 n l for alkaline and acidic streams respectively the ammonium fraction possibly ending in the digestate liquid effluent of the anaerobic digestion centrate was also calculated using the laboratory measurements of the alkaline sludge residue and some basic assumptions from literature research as shown in section 6 of the supplementary material it was estimated that around 25 of tn in sludge would end in the effluent with a concentration equal to 2600 mg nh4 n l 3 6 recovery potential in perspective to epe ags wwtp eps extraction plant fig 4 shows tcod total phosphorus and total nitrogen over epe nereda wwtp and its large scale eps extraction installation tcod balance showed that 40 of the plant tcod daily load ends in excess aerobic granular sludge the excess sludge goes into the eps extraction process in which the final eps yield is 30 of excess sludge tcod with the potential integration of biogas production into the process 25 of sludge tcod is calculated to be recovered by ad technology methane production was estimated as explained earlier kleerebezem 2014 as shown in table 6 assuming table 6 assuming 50 organic degradation occurs at max at practice potential methane production from epe is around 260 ml g vs and 64 m3 day total phosphorus balance revealed that 90 of the daily phosphorus load of epe nereda wwtp ends in the excess sludge and is removed from the system the phosphorus ends in the eps fraction represent 20 of the excess sludge tp ortho phosphate fractions in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams are 35 and 30 of excess sludge tp respectively with 600 mg po4 p l the ortho phosphate fraction potentially present in the ad centrate was calculated as 15 of sludge tp with 800 mg po4 p l total nitrogen balance showed that 67 of the wwtp daily nitrogen load is removed from the system as nitrogen gas through the simultaneous nitrification denitrification process and around 24 enters the eps extraction process 30 of excess sludge tn is recovered in the eps fraction as organic nitrogen the ammonium concentration in alkaline and acidic streams is 80 100 mg nh4 n l ammonium concentration in the ad centrate was also calculated to be 2600 mg nh4 n l and represents 17 of sludge tn sections 8 and 9 in the supplementary material provide detailed calculations over the ad 4 discussion the fate of the alkaline gel layer is first discussed to provide a basic understanding required for the following discussions on the observed differences between the mass balances in epe demonstration plant on the 22nd and 23rd of june and laboratory extractions in section 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 this gel layer has implications on the recovery reported and later sections discuss how the layer distributes over either the liquid or the solid phase depending on the decanter operation and design the focus of this study is to evaluate the potential of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen recovery from the eps extraction process as discussed in sections 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 4 1 alkaline gel layer formation the modified laboratory protocol revealed a new alkaline gel layer as a middle layer between the sludge residue and the hydrolyzed eps supernatant this layer was not observed with the earlier laboratory protocol as the gel layer probably ended in the acidic liquid stream after separation as indicated by gray arrows in fig 3 on the demonstration scale due to inefficient solid liquid separation it was only easy to observe it once the current work pointed it out there are several possible explanations for the appearance of this layer 1 dilution affects the supersaturation and solubility of organics and polymers similar to inorganic systems so eps might precipitate due to higher concentration in the new laboratory protocol on demo scale 2 polymers differentiate into different polymer fractions based on molecular weight higher molecular weight precipitates and lower molecular weight dissolves or 3 this fraction has less negative charge density compared to the rest of the dissolved eps so it is not readily soluble lotti et al 2019 the exact reason for this layer s appearance has yet to be explored and further characterization is needed fractionation of eps samples and using advanced analytical methods can help with more accurate eps characterization pre treatments can achieve this by enriching targeted compounds followed by purification steps the purification can be based on solubility using different solvents charge using chromatography or size exclusion chromatography felz 2019 seviour et al 2019 such advanced analytical methods can be applied to reveal the differences between kaumera and the alkaline gel layer in terms of quality and the reason for its appearance understanding the mechanism of this gel layer formation could also open a new direction to separate eps into different polymer fractions and each fraction is oriented to specific applications 4 2 epe demonstration scale extractions 4 2 1 fate of the alkaline gel layer in epe comparing the 22nd results to the 23rd showed that the 22nd had a much larger kaumera vs yield reaching around 50 that revealed two implications 1 that there is a potential to increase the yield of kaumera by recovering this alkaline gel layer as well or 2 insufficient solid liquid separation leads to higher yield but quality deterioration of kaumera i e a lower fraction of gel forming polymer this observation shows that optimizing the decanter separation is crucial in the eps extraction process and needs further attention further research is required to identify the quality difference between the 30 vs kaumera yield no alkaline gel layer and the 50 vs kaumera yield including alkaline gel layer undiluted conditions to assess if this gel layer can be combined with kaumera for higher recovery without deteriorating the quality the fate of this gel layer affects the elemental mass distribution over the process 4 2 2 epe demonstration versus laboratory extractions epe mass balances showed that the potential of tcod tp and tn recovery by the eps fraction is similar to the laboratory scale the concentrations have the same order of magnitude on both scales as shown in table 2 however there is a difference in the mass distribution of nutrients at the decanter separation step following the alkaline hydrolysis causing a larger fraction of elements to end in the alkaline liquid stream in epe demonstration and eventually the acidic liquid stream the tcod tp ortho phosphate and tn in the alkaline liquid stream in epe are 10 15 10 and 20 respectively higher than the laboratory scale these observations are explained by two main differences the decanter solid liquid separation efficiency and steam injection for heating up sludge to 80 celsius the solid liquid separation efficiency of the decanter would affect the fate of the alkaline gel layer and consequently make a difference in the mass distribution steam injection is used in epe to increase the temperature of the excess sludge before alkaline hydrolysis and it accounts for 20 of the inlet flow to the alkaline reactor dilution factor 1 2 since the concentrations of epe demonstration and laboratory extractions are in the same order of magnitude and the dilution effect of steam injection is not significant enough to change that magnitude it is concluded that a small fraction of the alkaline gel layer ends in the alkaline liquid stream however the solid liquid separation at the laboratory scale is fully controlled and efficient so the alkaline gel layer ends on top of the alkaline sludge residue fraction the steam injection is an epe specific case for instance in zutphen the first eps kaumera extraction demonstration scale installation heating is done through a heat exchanger also decanter centrifuge settings could differ from one extraction plant to another the comparison showed that the modified laboratory protocol gives results comparable to the demonstration scale installation in epe the laboratory protocol can be tailored to specific conditions to predict full scale mass balances reasonably well in later stages i e for other sludges from different installations or seasons without the need to realize a pilot installation it also showed that the operators should be aware that the gel layer fate at full scale will depend on the alkaline solid liquid separation efficiency 4 3 carbon recovery cod balances showed a 30 eps yield in the laboratory and epe demonstration scales it was reported that the amount of kaumera extracted is approx 25 35 of the organic matter in the waste sludge in e in an earlier study van der knaap et al 2019 calculations also showed that 25 30 of sludge tcod can be recovered as methane by anaerobically digesting the alkaline sludge residue the ad is proposed to be mesophilic 35 c and alkaline ph 9 11 similar to the characteristics of the alkaline sludge residue after solid liquid separation alkaline conditions are commonly used as an effective sludge pre treatment step for better degradability higher biogas production and methane content in neutral ph digestion systems 25 60 co2 and 40 75 ch4 ratios are usually obtained ryckebosch et al 2011 according to co2 hco3 speciation against ph the vapor pressure of co2 is minimal at ph 9 11 as most co2 stays in solution as bi carbonate in high ph digestion systems co2 remains in solution yielding biogas predominantly composed of methane 95 nolla ardevol et al 2015 the potential of methane production using the alkaline sludge residue is calculated to be 260 ml g vs according to kleerebezem 2014 and the degradation of around 50 of organics based on literature and industrial practice van nieuwenhuijzen et al 2011 roš and zupančič 2002 the first proof of principle batch experiments on digestion of this residue under mesophilic alkaline conditions ph 9 5 showed that the methane content was around 98 with 2 co2 as expected the same experiments also showed methane yield equal to 200 240 ml g vs the substrate recovered as methane was about 40 50 v sels msc tu delft 2019 unpublished results which is in line with the calculations in this study however some crucial points still need to be investigated in future anaerobic digestion research of this residue such as the need for ph adjustment during digestion because of co2 solubility and vfa production the evaluation of ammonia toxicity microbial community and media composition 4 4 phosphorus recovery according to the established mass balances phosphorus recovery is realized in two ways during the eps chemical extraction process the first one is phosphorus present in the eps fraction which is potentially considered recovered phosphorus after understanding the role of phosphorus in polymer properties and its industrial applications the second way is ortho phosphate recovery from alkaline or acidic and digestate liquid streams 4 4 1 phosphorus recovery in the eps fraction market competition is one of the problems facing phosphorus recovery implementation because phosphate rock is still cheap phosphorus recovery costs from wastewater on a large scale are estimated at 2 per kg p as a bare minimum and could be more than 10 per kg p egle et al 2016 molinos senante et al 2011 however the value of phosphorus in phosphate rock is less than 1 per kg p it is argued that upcycling p recovery products with higher value and quality than fertilizer phosphates is a way to accelerate the p recovery market the production of p4 derivatives from waste streams has gained interest recently espp webinar 2020 jupp et al 2021 p4 derivatives are p compounds that are cost intensive as they must be produced via the thermal route of phosphate rock and used in specific industrial applications eps kaumera from ags is a potential example of upcycling p recovery products as it can substitute some p4 derivatives i e as a flame retardant kim et al 2020 reported that eps kaumera acts as a high performance bio based flame retardant as it shows self extinguishing properties it also meets the flame retardancy requirements in us federal aviation regulation standards in addition eps from granules has the advantage that it can be produced at a large scale as flame retardants unlike other biomacromolecules such as dna whey proteins or caseins alongi et al 2014 as sufficient waste granular streams can be provided from nereda wwtps future research focused on understanding the phosphorus speciation in eps is needed to establish the role of phosphorus for kaumera properties which can be manipulated to enhance and change its properties to maximize the usage of recovered phosphorus in eps in more comprehensive industrial applications mass balances showed some assumptions about p speciation in kaumera which will be measured directly in future research for a properly confirmed speciation according to these assumptions in the results in sections 3 4 3 6 around 70 75 of phosphorus in eps is bound phosphorus and 30 25 is free ortho phosphates free ortho phosphate is not an integral part of the polymer and it is present since eps is precipitated in the acidic stream which contains high amounts of free ortho phosphates bound phosphorus in eps could be organic inorganic or ortho phosphate loosely bound by electrostatic interactions organically bound phosphorus and loosely bounded ortho phosphate are expected to be the most dominant fractions eps is expected to have phosphorylated proteins phospholipids and phosphosugars due to the extracellular and intracellular components released during alkaline hydrolysis garcía becerra et al 2010 also eps hydrogel is precipitated at around ph 2 4 which is very low to expect any mineral inorganic phosphorus present as they would dissolve 4 4 2 ortho phosphates recovery from alkaline acidic and ad centrate the potential of ortho phosphate recovery from alkaline or acidic liquid streams is attractive according to laboratory extractions 25 20 of sludge tp and 35 30 according to epe demonstration end in these two fractions as ortho phosphates the ortho phosphate increase from 10 of sludge tp initially in spill sludge to 25 35 of sludge tp in the alkaline liquid stream could be attributed to polyphosphate hydrolysis the phosphate concentration is 600 mg po4 p l comparable to concentrations reported for mature technologies of the full scale phosphate recovery processes for municipal and industrial wastewater desmidt et al 2015 there are possible technologies to consider for phosphorus recovery from these two streams for example 1 nanofiltration on the alkaline stream can bleed off the phosphate and other salts to the permeate and keep the eps in the retentate that would concentrate the eps and might reduce acid consumption in the later step however organic fouling of the membrane could be challenging wang et al 2009 2 the acidic stream has a low ph meaning that most phosphate is present as h3po4 h2po4 further lowering the ph to 1 would get all the phosphate to the unionized form as h3po4 and this could create a way to separate phosphoric acid from other salts via ion selective membranes however this would require an extra acid dosage and is cost intensive 3 chemical precipitation by metal addition as magnesium and calcium is the most common straightforward technology for ortho phosphate recovery from liquid streams alkaline and acidic liquid streams are expected to have pros and cons for chemical phosphorus precipitation for instance the alkaline liquid stream has an advantage as it has a high ph value making it suitable for calcium phosphate and struvite recovery struvite consists of equimolar amounts of magnesium ammonium and phosphate and forms at ph 8 9 desmidt et al 2015 doyle and parsons 2002 calcium phosphate forms at ph 9 when the concentrations of phosphorus and calcium are high jupp et al 2021 so there will be no need to adjust the ph of the alkaline stream to form these minerals however this stream also contains solubilized eps metal addition could interfere with its solubilization as it might get complexed or trapped by the polymer causing the soluble polymers to co precipitate affecting the final eps yield table 2 shows that soluble ca2 and mg2 in the alkaline stream are significantly lower than in the acidic stream this suggests that the highly negatively charged polymers trapped these ions at high ph conditions similar observations were reported in soil literature that eps contains metal binders such as phosphate amine carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that trap divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and inhibit the precipitation of calcium carbonate as it reduces the saturation of calcium dittrich and sibler 2010 kremer et al 2008 the second reason is that visual minteq modeling showed that the calcium phosphates and struvite are to be formed in the alkaline supernatant saturation indexes are shown in section 4 of the supplementary material so the alkaline liquid stream is already supersaturated however no precipitation is seen that reflects the possible complexity of phosphorus recovery from this stream on the other hand the acidic stream has a low ph 2 4 requiring intensive chemical addition for ph adjustment and extra costs to precipitate struvite or calcium phosphate cichy et al 2019 the acidic by product stream would not interfere with the eps production as it is already precipitated and removed and the organics interference would be minimal it seems that the acidic stream is more promising so current research is ongoing to validate the possibility of phosphorus recovery in the acidic stream through chemical precipitation ortho phosphate fraction in the ad centrate was calculated based on our measurements and assumptions from literature phosphorus remains in solution after digesting ebpr excess sludge as reported by jardin and popel 1994 is 38 of the total phosphorus brought to the digester no data is available for granular sludge the calculations showed that this centrate would contain 12 epe 15 laboratory of sludge tp with concentrations 700 900 mg po4 p l showing promising feasible recovery 4 5 nitrogen recovery figs 3 and 4 show the fate of nitrogen through the eps extraction process 30 of sludge tn is recovered in the eps mainly as organic nitrogen which fits with its composition of proteins and complex glycoconjugates as glycoprotein felz 2019 the concept of recovering ammonium from the alkaline liquid stream is attractive since it has high ph and high temperature which are required for commercial ammonium recovery technologies air stripping and membrane stripping are the most advanced applied technologies on a large scale for ammonium recovery both technologies require high ph of about 9 10 and high temperatures of 70 80 c van der hoek et al 2018 the energy efficiency of the recovery depends highly on the ammonium concentration ammonium recovery should not require more energy than ammonium production by the haber bosch process ammonium concentration in the alkaline supernatant is 105 mg nh4 n l which is too low to be efficiently recovered maurer et al 2006 ye et al 2020 as reported in the recent stowa report on mature ammonium recovery technologies elbersen et al 2021 so ammonium recovery from the alkaline liquid stream would be a no go however the ammonium fraction in the anaerobic digestion centrate was calculated to be 17 epe and 25 laboratory of sludge tn with a concentration of around 2600 mg nh4 n l which would make it feasible for ammonium recovery these numbers were calculated assuming digestion releases 55 of the sludge nitrogen content soerensen et al 1999 suschka and grübel 2014 4 6 practical implications resource recovery from wastewater is still in its infancy but the consensus is that it should be developed in the context of a more sustainable society kehrein et al 2020a 2020b this paper is taking the first steps towards this and setting a base for decision makers several aspects are relevant to consider for a smooth implementation in the future firstly the technologies used are quite different from operating a standard wwtp and the goals are different utilities will have to consider how they can manage resource recovery at the wwtp either by adaptation or by partly outsourcing the resource recovery operations secondly the eps extraction process is the primary process and other integrated recovery technologies are associated with its by product streams so there should be a substantial market demand for kaumera for such a treatment scheme to make sense the eps from ags forms an interesting new resource for gel forming biopolymers with much higher market potential and new applications than i e alginate or carrageenan kaumera could comprise 50 of the turnover energy raw materials factory ermf of the dutch water authorities van leeuwen et al 2018 it can be used in agricultural horticulture paper coatings and construction industries and can be applied as a gel foam or fiber in 2022 koppert biological systems chaincraft and rhdhv signed a long term contract for collaboration in applying kaumera as a bio stimulant another promising application is flame retardancy as described in section 4 4 1 so it can be used to produce materials and coatings kim et al 2020 eps can also be used in composite material production as it can hold up to 80 of inorganic filler material and clay kaumera composites were tested using kaumera in composite materials makes it an excellent option to replace many of the current applications of oil based plastics henze et al 2020 5 conclusion mass balances allowed the quantification of loads and concentrations of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen species relevant for recovery to set the foundation for a new generation of ags wwtp with integrated resource recovery it was shown that combined eps methane phosphorus and nitrogen recovery is promising 30 of sludge tcod is recovered as eps which has wide possible applications and 25 30 of sludge tcod could be recovered as biomethane by integrating alkaline anaerobic digestion ad 20 of sludge tp is recovered in the eps about 20 30 of tp ends in the acidic liquid waste stream and 15 in the ad centrate as ortho phosphates these ortho phosphate fractions are recoverable by integrating chemical precipitation 30 of sludge tn ends in the eps mainly as organic nitrogen and 20 in the ad centrate as ammonium which membrane or air stripping technologies can feasibly recover this study showed that the developed modified laboratory protocol is an excellent tool for predicting large scale eps extractions it can be used for futural experimental work focused on nutrient recovery or to test the effect of sludge from different installations or seasons and predict the consequences on a large scale with the new laboratory protocol a gel layer was discovered comparing the demonstration and laboratory extractions revealed that the fate of the alkaline gel layer depends on the solid liquid separation efficiency of the decanter centrifuge this layer could offer additional eps recovery however its formation

14943,the study evaluated the combined phosphorus nitrogen methane and extracellular polymeric substances eps recovery from aerobic granular sludge ags wastewater treatment plants about 30 of sludge organics are recovered as eps and 25 30 as methane 260 ml methane g vs by integrating alkaline anaerobic digestion ad it was shown that 20 of excess sludge total phosphorus tp ends in the eps further 20 30 ends in an acidic liquid waste stream 600 mg po4 p l and 15 in the ad centrate 800 mg po4 p l as ortho phosphates in both streams and is recoverable via chemical precipitation 30 of sludge total nitrogen tn is recovered as organic nitrogen in the eps ammonium recovery from the alkaline high temperature liquid stream is attractive but it is not feasible for existing large scale technologies because of low ammonium concentration however ammonium concentration in the ad centrate was calculated to be 2600 mg nh4 n l and 20 of tn making it feasible for recovery the methodology used in this study consisted of three main steps the first step was to develop a laboratory protocol mimicking demonstration scale eps extraction conditions the second step was to establish mass balances over the eps extraction process on laboratory and demonstration scales within a full scale ags wwtp finally the feasibility of resource recovery was evaluated based on concentrations loads and integration of existing technologies for resource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eps extraction sewage mass balances phosphorus methane nitrogen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater is considered a valuable resource rather than a waste due to resource scarcity market demand and economic interests therefore the transition of conventional wastewater plants into resource recovery plants has become of interest recently van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 wastewater provides opportunities to recover energy biosolids reusable water and other valuable nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and other elements kehrein et al 2020 hao et al 2019b a dutch public private partnership led to the development of the full scale aerobic granular sludge technology also known as nereda technology for wastewater treatment aerobic granular sludge ags is a promising technology as it offers key advantages compared to conventional activated sludge technologies pronk et al 2015 de kreuk et al 2005 these advantages include a 75 reduction in footprint a 30 reduction in energy and less operating costs associated with phosphorus removal the study of ags not only opened a door for a more resource efficient wastewater treatment technology but also created new opportunities for resource recovery with the recovery of extracellular polymeric substances eps as a successful example lin et al 2018 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 seviour et al 2009 eps is a polymeric gel material produced by bacteria during cell metabolism that consists of proteins polysaccharides dna lipids glycoproteins and humic substances that form the matrix in which the cells are immobilized as granular particles seviour et al 2019 eps from aerobic granular sludge offers various applications in agriculture building textile and paper industries van der knaap 2019 henze et al 2020 it also showed unique properties as a composite material bio stimulant and flame retardant kim et al 2020 feng et al 2019 lin et al 2015 the netherlands has the world s first two demonstration scale installations to extract eps from nereda granules under the product name kaumera the eps extraction process involves elevated temperature and ph conditions to dissolve the biofilm matrix in granules and target structural eps as reported by felz 2019 eps recovery introduces an innovative concept to valorize the cod instead of converting cod into energy according to the bio based recovery value pyramid biomass should ideally be first delegated as a material higher value before it is delegated to final energetic use lower value stegmann et al 2020 cod has a relatively large exergy content that should be preserved and converted into carbonaceous materials moreover there has always been a perception that chemical energy is the only source of recoverable energy in wastewater however studies showed that the potential of thermal energy recovery is around ten times larger than chemical energy recovery as biogas x hao li et al 2019 for these reasons it is argued that cod recovery should be in the form of materials i e eps rather than energy the eps extraction process under elevated ph and temperature conditions might also offer recovery opportunities for other elements such as phosphorus nitrogen or methane which could create a new generation of ags wwtps with integrated resource recovery however eps yield should not be affected by resource recovery since it is likely the main driver for a recovery facility phosphorus is on the list of critical raw materials issued by the eu because its supply security is at risk and its economic importance is high phosphorus is considered a bottleneck due to its life essential nature and low abundance phosphorus recovery from wastewater is experiencing increased interest as sewage is one of the richest streams of phosphorus childers et al 2011 espp webinar 2020 eynard et al 2020 according to van dijk et al 2016 phosphorus in wastewater accounts for 15 of total imported phosphorus in europe in ags wwtps phosphorus removal relies on phosphorus accumulating organisms paos taking phosphate in wastewater as intracellular phosphorus during the alternation of anaerobic and aerobic phases in the nereda tank de kreuk et al 2005 high ph and temperature extraction conditions could potentially change phosphorus speciation or mineralogy in sludge enabling or exacerbating recovery nitrogen is another essential nutrient found in wastewater in ags wwtp ammonium nitrogen is removed in the form of nitrogen gas through simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and a small part of it ends in the sludge de kreuk et al 2005 henze et al 2020 during the eps extraction process the ags undergoes thermo alkaline conditions potentially releasing organic and inorganic nitrogen into the liquid streams siami et al 2020 toutian et al 2020 evaluating the nitrogen fate over the process is to be considered to assess its recovery potential anaerobic digestion could also be integrated into the eps extraction process as a secondary technology to recover further cod as methane from the alkaline sludge residuals by product stream from the eps extraction process this integration is interesting as alkaline pre treatment of sludge increases the anaerobic degradability of organics and biogas yields fang et al 2014 li et al 2012 evaluating the potential of phosphate and ammonium recovery from digestate liquid fraction is also to be considered as they are released during organics digestion uysal et al 2010 nitrogen and phosphorus recovery from the eps extraction process by product streams is also crucial to prevent operational issues due to their recirculation to the wwtp influent due to all these reasons investigating the status of organics phosphorus and nitrogen over the eps extraction process is of interest the fate of nutrients through the eps extraction process is unknown a careful analysis of the eps production process is vital to identify the best synergies to combine these elements recovery within the eps extraction process mass balances can provide insight into how and what to expect from integrated recovery technologies to evaluate these synergies they are a robust decision tool to estimate quantities of elements of interest in all relevant streams recovery potential make value chains and evaluate market potential kehrein et al 2020 solon et al 2019 however the existing laboratory scale eps extraction protocol by felz et al 2016 shows differences compared to large demonstration scale extractions which are relevant for resource recovery as summarized in table 1 the most significant difference is the dilution factor during the extraction as dilution affects concentrations and saturation conditions so it does not allow for accurate judging of the potential of combined nutrient recovery a representative translation of large scale conditions to laboratory scale is essential for a realistic evaluation of concentrations and quantities therefore this study involved the development of a modified laboratory protocol to simulate large demonstration scale conditions this was crucial for conducting future experiments to test resource recovery technologies on sludge from various sources and seasons and to make predictions about large scale impacts in later stages this study aims to set the foundation for a new generation of ags wwtps with integrated resource recovery by answering two main research questions the first question relates to the recovery potential of combined phosphorus nitrogen eps and methane from ags wwtp so mass balances were established on laboratory and demonstration scales eps extractions and extrapolated to a full scale nereda ags wwtp to address this question the second question is about the possible existing technologies that can be applied to recover these elements to reach a fully integrated ags wwtp to address this concentrations stream composition speciation of nutrients and loads were used to qualitatively evaluate the feasibility of existing technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory extractions laboratory extractions were performed using ags surplus sludge samples collected after belt thickening from epe ags wwtp the sludge samples are a mix of flocs and small granules so called selection spill which is the sludge removed after every cycle sludge samples had the following average composition 5 ts 4 3 vs 30 g p kg ts and 60 g n kg ts extractions were performed based on a newly developed modified protocol adapted from demonstration scale practices in epe and zutphen table 1 summarizes how the modified laboratory protocol mimics zutphen epe demonstration scale eps extractions the detailed laboratory protocol steps are listed in section 3 of the supplementary material 2 2 epe demonstration extractions the resemblances and differences between the modified laboratory and epe demonstration extractions were assessed in this study epe ags wwtp is the first full scale domestic wastewater treatment plant in the netherlands to install the innovative nereda sewage treatment technology operated by the water authority waterschap vallei en veluwe the wwtp treats wastewater produced by the town of epe with an average daily influent equal to 6200 m3 and 37 167 p e at the time of this sampling campaign the nereda reactors had a sludge concentration of 8 g mlss l and were operated with process cycles of approximately 6 h 3 h of aeration 1 h of settling and 2 h of anaerobic feeding simultaneous effluent withdrawal these data are site specific and vary between different wwtp s the excess sludge was stored in an aerated sludge buffer tank before being transported to the belt thickener in the eps extraction installation the eps extraction installation in epe is the second installation in the netherlands before our investigation many extraction runs had been performed at the site and in general extraction runs in the demonstration plant are for a few days only sampling for this study was performed on a continuous eps extraction process treating 0 5 m3 spill sludge hour koh and hcl dosing rates were 11 and 7 l hour respectively 20th june 2021 was the starting day of the campaign to run the system and ensure steady state conditions then samples were collected two days after the start of the operational run so two time samples were collected on the 22nd and 23rd of june 2021 fig 1 shows the process flow in the epe demonstration with sampling points stream b which is the initial thickened sludge stream d which is the alkaline liquid stream containing the hydrolyzed eps g which is the alkaline sludge residue stream that remains after eps hydrolysis and separation f which is the eps production stream and h is the acidic liquid stream after eps production and separation to confirm that our sampling days are representative we compared results from our study with earlier results from epe e van der knaap 2019 and other unpublished measurements performed by rhdhv as described in section 2 in the supplementary material in detail this comparison showed that the measurements of 23rd june 2021 were more typical for the normal operation of the plant than the results of 22nd on this first day especially the operation of the alkaline centrifuge was different than normal therefore we focus in the result section on the results of june 23rd the results of the 22nd can be found in the supplemental information the differences between the 22nd and 23rd are interesting and discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 correspondingly sludge samples from the 22nd and 23rd were collected to perform laboratory extractions as described in table 1 at a similar ph as epe for all laboratory and epe demonstration scale samples measurements were done in triplets and average values and their standard deviation were calculated 2 3 mass balance calculations regarding laboratory scale mass balances concentrations masses and volumes of different fractions were measured experimentally regarding demonstration scale mass balances concentrations were measured experimentally for collected samples d g f and h flow rates were calculated using measured concentrations instead of using flow meters data logger to ensure the accuracy of these flows using b sludge feed as the initial condition as shown in section 1 of the supplementary material epe demonstration installation does not treat the full sludge flow from epe nereda wwtp but the results were extrapolated to give the effect if it would be full scale the mass balances over nereda wwtp were evaluated based on the 2021 one year average measured flows and the composition of influent effluent and sludge data were collected from the plant database the plant has the following average wastewater influent composition 835 mg cod l 81 mg n l and 7 2 mg p l and a daily load of 4174 kg cod day 497 kg n day and 44 kg p day sankey diagrams depicted mass flows where flow sizes are proportional to the influent mass flow expressed in 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 total solids ts and volatile solids vs ts and vs were analyzed according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 1999 2 4 2 total chemical oxygen demand tcod and total nitrogen tn both tcod and tn were measured using hach lange test kits lck514 338 238 hach lange uk heated in a thermostat ht200s hach lange to 170 celsius and then analyzed using a spectrophotometer dr 3900 vis spectral photometer wavelength range 320 750 nm carbon and nitrogen fate through the eps extraction process was further confirmed by analyzing total carbon and total nitrogen using an elemental analyzer mettler toledo america 2 4 3 microwave digestion all solid samples were destructed by microwave digestion to convert them to liquid analyses samples were digested in an ethos easy from milestone with an sk 15 high pressure rotor around 50 mg of solids were put in a teflon vessel in which 10 ml of ultrapure hno3 64 5 70 5 from vwr chemicals was poured the digester is set to reach 200 celsius in 15 min run at this temperature for 15 min and cool down for 1 hour 2 4 4 icp oes the inorganic elemental composition was measured via inductively coupled plasma perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv with an optical emission spectroscopy as a detector the device was equipped with an autosampler perkin elmer type esi sc 4 dx fast and the data were processed with the software perkin elmer winlab32 the rinse and internal standard solutions were 2 hno3 and 10 mg l of yttrium 2 4 5 ic liquid samples were pre treated first by filtering the samples through 0 45 μm followed by 0 22 μm membrane filters before analysis anions and cations free dissolved ions were measured by metrohm compact ion chromatograph flex 930 to confirm these measurements and to avoid small colloidal particles squeezed through the filters ultrafiltration was used liquid samples were filtered using ultrafiltration centrifugal tubes with polyethersulfone pes members with a molecular weight cutoff mwco of 3 k thermofisher uk 2 4 6 x ray diffraction xrd room temperature dried samples were used for xrd analysis the sample was filled in a 0 7 mm glass capillary and tamped so the solid settled the capillaries were sealed with a burner and mounted in a sample holder the device used was a bruker d8 advance diffractometer with cu ka radiation coupled θ 2θ scan 10 110 step size 0 030 2θ counting time per step 2 s the data evaluation was performed using burker software diffracsuite eva vs 6 3 results 3 1 concentrations in laboratory and epe demonstration extractions table 2 shows the total solids tcod total nitrogen total phosphorus and dissolved species relevant for nutrient recovery as phosphate ammonium calcium and magnesium ions in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams table 3 shows the eps kaumera and alkaline sludge residue composition in laboratory and epe extractions unlike the original laboratory protocol the new modified laboratory protocol concentrations are comparable and have the same order of magnitude as the demonstration scale concentrations it was also observed that the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in the alkaline stream are 6 10 times lower than in the acidic liquid stream both in the modified laboratory protocol and epe demonstration scale which could be due to the eps nature as discussed in section 4 4 2 3 2 the appearance of an alkaline gel layer after the thermal alkaline hydrolysis step and centrifugation there was a stratification of the granular matrix into a residue part lower layer a gel layer middle layer and a soluble layer upper layer shown in fig 2 despite the appearance of the alkaline gel layer it was observed that the kaumera yield is 30 of tcod or volatile solids of sludge both in the original diluted and modified undiluted laboratory extraction protocol when this alkaline gel layer is not included in the eps soluble fraction understanding the fate of this alkaline gel layer in both laboratory and epe demonstration scales is discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 table 4 shows the average composition of this alkaline gel layer compared to the kaumera eps on the laboratory scale the gel layer has higher inorganic content than kaumera as it has a higher p ca and fe content xrd analysis also showed that the alkaline gel layer contains vivianite however no crystalline p mineral was detected in kaumera which shows that p speciation in both fractions is different the presence of vivianite can be explained by the fact that fe precipitates in neutral to alkaline conditions and there is always fe in the raw sewage wilfert et al 2015 there is also a slaughterhouse discharge to epe wwtp which contains most likely high levels of fe spectra are shown in section 5 of the supplementary material 3 3 the potential of carbon recovery laboratory scale extractions the tcod mass balance over the eps extraction using the modified laboratory protocol undiluted was established as shown in fig 3 a tcod balances were confirmed by the fate of volatile solids along the process data shown in table 4 of the supplementary material during the alkaline step the high ph enriches the negative charges of the eps causing its repulsion and solubilization lotti et al 2019 and around 40 of sludge tcod ended in the alkaline liquid stream then during the acidification step the low ph reduces the negative charge of the eps causing its precipitation as a hydrogel with a yield of 30 of excess granular sludge tcod it was estimated that 35 of the initial cod was present in the alkaline gel layer 25 in the alkaline sludge residue and only 10 ended in the acidic liquid stream possibly a fraction of organics that cannot precipitate at low ph conditions by comparing the tcod volatile solids fate in original diluted and modified undiluted laboratory protocols it was observed that the gel layer ended in the acidic liquid stream in diluted conditions increasing the tcod percentage to 45 instead of 10 as indicated by the shaded gray arrow in fig 3a instead the modified laboratory protocol shows this layer as an independent fraction on top of alkaline sludge residue the alkaline sludge residue by product stream could function as an input for an alkaline mesophilic anaerobic digester ad the alkaline sludge residue theoretical composition was calculated as described in kleerebezem 2014 based on its dry organic matter tcod and tn content from these measurements the elemental substrate composition cchhoonn and the stoichiometry of the anaerobic digestion are estimated as shown in table 5 the model predicts the maximum methane production to be 516 ml g vs assuming 100 degradation however in practice around 50 degradation of organics occurs at maximum as discussed in section 4 3 which makes the potential of methane production 260 ml g vs recovering 30 of sludge tcod as methane 3 4 the potential of phosphorus recovery laboratory scale extractions a phosphorus mass balance over laboratory scale using the modified protocol undiluted was established as shown in fig 3b including the bound and free dissolved ortho phosphate species 20 of excess sludge total phosphorus ends in the eps fraction bound phosphorus in liquid streams was calculated as the difference between the measured values of total phosphorus and free ortho phosphates total phosphorus in eps was estimated to be divided into a 3 1 ratio of bound phosphorus to free dissolved phosphorus assuming that the subtraction of p species in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams calculates the p fraction in eps however this should be measured directly to be confirmed in future research since most of the current phosphorus recovery systems recover ortho phosphates from liquid streams ortho phosphate fractions in alkaline and acidic liquid streams were measured the ortho phosphate in the spill sludge was initially measured as 10 of sludge tp 25 of sludge tp was released to the alkaline stream during the alkaline hydrolysis step as ortho phosphate and 20 in the acidic liquid stream the concentrations of ortho phosphates in alkaline and acidic liquid streams were 615 and 630 mg po4 p l respectively ortho phosphate in the anaerobic digestion centrate was also assessed it was calculated using the laboratory measurements of alkaline sludge residue as the influent and some basic assumptions from literature research as shown in section 7 in the supplementary material 15 of sludge tp would end in effluent with a concentration of 900 mg po4 p l 3 5 the potential of nitrogen recovery laboratory scale extractions the nitrogen mass balance for modified laboratory scale extractions of epe sludge was established as shown in fig 3c including the organic and inorganic dissolved species in spill sludge nitrate and nitrite concentrations were negligible ammonium was less than 2 of sludge tn and the rest was organic nitrogen so the nitrogen mass balance was dominated by organic nitrogen 30 of excess sludge tn ends in the eps fraction primarily as organic nitrogen the nitrate and nitrite species concentrations were negligible in the liquid streams and ammonium concentrations in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams were low the fraction of ammonium nitrogen was around 2 of sludge tn with 105 and 110 mg nh4 n l for alkaline and acidic streams respectively the ammonium fraction possibly ending in the digestate liquid effluent of the anaerobic digestion centrate was also calculated using the laboratory measurements of the alkaline sludge residue and some basic assumptions from literature research as shown in section 6 of the supplementary material it was estimated that around 25 of tn in sludge would end in the effluent with a concentration equal to 2600 mg nh4 n l 3 6 recovery potential in perspective to epe ags wwtp eps extraction plant fig 4 shows tcod total phosphorus and total nitrogen over epe nereda wwtp and its large scale eps extraction installation tcod balance showed that 40 of the plant tcod daily load ends in excess aerobic granular sludge the excess sludge goes into the eps extraction process in which the final eps yield is 30 of excess sludge tcod with the potential integration of biogas production into the process 25 of sludge tcod is calculated to be recovered by ad technology methane production was estimated as explained earlier kleerebezem 2014 as shown in table 6 assuming table 6 assuming 50 organic degradation occurs at max at practice potential methane production from epe is around 260 ml g vs and 64 m3 day total phosphorus balance revealed that 90 of the daily phosphorus load of epe nereda wwtp ends in the excess sludge and is removed from the system the phosphorus ends in the eps fraction represent 20 of the excess sludge tp ortho phosphate fractions in the alkaline and acidic liquid streams are 35 and 30 of excess sludge tp respectively with 600 mg po4 p l the ortho phosphate fraction potentially present in the ad centrate was calculated as 15 of sludge tp with 800 mg po4 p l total nitrogen balance showed that 67 of the wwtp daily nitrogen load is removed from the system as nitrogen gas through the simultaneous nitrification denitrification process and around 24 enters the eps extraction process 30 of excess sludge tn is recovered in the eps fraction as organic nitrogen the ammonium concentration in alkaline and acidic streams is 80 100 mg nh4 n l ammonium concentration in the ad centrate was also calculated to be 2600 mg nh4 n l and represents 17 of sludge tn sections 8 and 9 in the supplementary material provide detailed calculations over the ad 4 discussion the fate of the alkaline gel layer is first discussed to provide a basic understanding required for the following discussions on the observed differences between the mass balances in epe demonstration plant on the 22nd and 23rd of june and laboratory extractions in section 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 this gel layer has implications on the recovery reported and later sections discuss how the layer distributes over either the liquid or the solid phase depending on the decanter operation and design the focus of this study is to evaluate the potential of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen recovery from the eps extraction process as discussed in sections 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 4 1 alkaline gel layer formation the modified laboratory protocol revealed a new alkaline gel layer as a middle layer between the sludge residue and the hydrolyzed eps supernatant this layer was not observed with the earlier laboratory protocol as the gel layer probably ended in the acidic liquid stream after separation as indicated by gray arrows in fig 3 on the demonstration scale due to inefficient solid liquid separation it was only easy to observe it once the current work pointed it out there are several possible explanations for the appearance of this layer 1 dilution affects the supersaturation and solubility of organics and polymers similar to inorganic systems so eps might precipitate due to higher concentration in the new laboratory protocol on demo scale 2 polymers differentiate into different polymer fractions based on molecular weight higher molecular weight precipitates and lower molecular weight dissolves or 3 this fraction has less negative charge density compared to the rest of the dissolved eps so it is not readily soluble lotti et al 2019 the exact reason for this layer s appearance has yet to be explored and further characterization is needed fractionation of eps samples and using advanced analytical methods can help with more accurate eps characterization pre treatments can achieve this by enriching targeted compounds followed by purification steps the purification can be based on solubility using different solvents charge using chromatography or size exclusion chromatography felz 2019 seviour et al 2019 such advanced analytical methods can be applied to reveal the differences between kaumera and the alkaline gel layer in terms of quality and the reason for its appearance understanding the mechanism of this gel layer formation could also open a new direction to separate eps into different polymer fractions and each fraction is oriented to specific applications 4 2 epe demonstration scale extractions 4 2 1 fate of the alkaline gel layer in epe comparing the 22nd results to the 23rd showed that the 22nd had a much larger kaumera vs yield reaching around 50 that revealed two implications 1 that there is a potential to increase the yield of kaumera by recovering this alkaline gel layer as well or 2 insufficient solid liquid separation leads to higher yield but quality deterioration of kaumera i e a lower fraction of gel forming polymer this observation shows that optimizing the decanter separation is crucial in the eps extraction process and needs further attention further research is required to identify the quality difference between the 30 vs kaumera yield no alkaline gel layer and the 50 vs kaumera yield including alkaline gel layer undiluted conditions to assess if this gel layer can be combined with kaumera for higher recovery without deteriorating the quality the fate of this gel layer affects the elemental mass distribution over the process 4 2 2 epe demonstration versus laboratory extractions epe mass balances showed that the potential of tcod tp and tn recovery by the eps fraction is similar to the laboratory scale the concentrations have the same order of magnitude on both scales as shown in table 2 however there is a difference in the mass distribution of nutrients at the decanter separation step following the alkaline hydrolysis causing a larger fraction of elements to end in the alkaline liquid stream in epe demonstration and eventually the acidic liquid stream the tcod tp ortho phosphate and tn in the alkaline liquid stream in epe are 10 15 10 and 20 respectively higher than the laboratory scale these observations are explained by two main differences the decanter solid liquid separation efficiency and steam injection for heating up sludge to 80 celsius the solid liquid separation efficiency of the decanter would affect the fate of the alkaline gel layer and consequently make a difference in the mass distribution steam injection is used in epe to increase the temperature of the excess sludge before alkaline hydrolysis and it accounts for 20 of the inlet flow to the alkaline reactor dilution factor 1 2 since the concentrations of epe demonstration and laboratory extractions are in the same order of magnitude and the dilution effect of steam injection is not significant enough to change that magnitude it is concluded that a small fraction of the alkaline gel layer ends in the alkaline liquid stream however the solid liquid separation at the laboratory scale is fully controlled and efficient so the alkaline gel layer ends on top of the alkaline sludge residue fraction the steam injection is an epe specific case for instance in zutphen the first eps kaumera extraction demonstration scale installation heating is done through a heat exchanger also decanter centrifuge settings could differ from one extraction plant to another the comparison showed that the modified laboratory protocol gives results comparable to the demonstration scale installation in epe the laboratory protocol can be tailored to specific conditions to predict full scale mass balances reasonably well in later stages i e for other sludges from different installations or seasons without the need to realize a pilot installation it also showed that the operators should be aware that the gel layer fate at full scale will depend on the alkaline solid liquid separation efficiency 4 3 carbon recovery cod balances showed a 30 eps yield in the laboratory and epe demonstration scales it was reported that the amount of kaumera extracted is approx 25 35 of the organic matter in the waste sludge in e in an earlier study van der knaap et al 2019 calculations also showed that 25 30 of sludge tcod can be recovered as methane by anaerobically digesting the alkaline sludge residue the ad is proposed to be mesophilic 35 c and alkaline ph 9 11 similar to the characteristics of the alkaline sludge residue after solid liquid separation alkaline conditions are commonly used as an effective sludge pre treatment step for better degradability higher biogas production and methane content in neutral ph digestion systems 25 60 co2 and 40 75 ch4 ratios are usually obtained ryckebosch et al 2011 according to co2 hco3 speciation against ph the vapor pressure of co2 is minimal at ph 9 11 as most co2 stays in solution as bi carbonate in high ph digestion systems co2 remains in solution yielding biogas predominantly composed of methane 95 nolla ardevol et al 2015 the potential of methane production using the alkaline sludge residue is calculated to be 260 ml g vs according to kleerebezem 2014 and the degradation of around 50 of organics based on literature and industrial practice van nieuwenhuijzen et al 2011 roš and zupančič 2002 the first proof of principle batch experiments on digestion of this residue under mesophilic alkaline conditions ph 9 5 showed that the methane content was around 98 with 2 co2 as expected the same experiments also showed methane yield equal to 200 240 ml g vs the substrate recovered as methane was about 40 50 v sels msc tu delft 2019 unpublished results which is in line with the calculations in this study however some crucial points still need to be investigated in future anaerobic digestion research of this residue such as the need for ph adjustment during digestion because of co2 solubility and vfa production the evaluation of ammonia toxicity microbial community and media composition 4 4 phosphorus recovery according to the established mass balances phosphorus recovery is realized in two ways during the eps chemical extraction process the first one is phosphorus present in the eps fraction which is potentially considered recovered phosphorus after understanding the role of phosphorus in polymer properties and its industrial applications the second way is ortho phosphate recovery from alkaline or acidic and digestate liquid streams 4 4 1 phosphorus recovery in the eps fraction market competition is one of the problems facing phosphorus recovery implementation because phosphate rock is still cheap phosphorus recovery costs from wastewater on a large scale are estimated at 2 per kg p as a bare minimum and could be more than 10 per kg p egle et al 2016 molinos senante et al 2011 however the value of phosphorus in phosphate rock is less than 1 per kg p it is argued that upcycling p recovery products with higher value and quality than fertilizer phosphates is a way to accelerate the p recovery market the production of p4 derivatives from waste streams has gained interest recently espp webinar 2020 jupp et al 2021 p4 derivatives are p compounds that are cost intensive as they must be produced via the thermal route of phosphate rock and used in specific industrial applications eps kaumera from ags is a potential example of upcycling p recovery products as it can substitute some p4 derivatives i e as a flame retardant kim et al 2020 reported that eps kaumera acts as a high performance bio based flame retardant as it shows self extinguishing properties it also meets the flame retardancy requirements in us federal aviation regulation standards in addition eps from granules has the advantage that it can be produced at a large scale as flame retardants unlike other biomacromolecules such as dna whey proteins or caseins alongi et al 2014 as sufficient waste granular streams can be provided from nereda wwtps future research focused on understanding the phosphorus speciation in eps is needed to establish the role of phosphorus for kaumera properties which can be manipulated to enhance and change its properties to maximize the usage of recovered phosphorus in eps in more comprehensive industrial applications mass balances showed some assumptions about p speciation in kaumera which will be measured directly in future research for a properly confirmed speciation according to these assumptions in the results in sections 3 4 3 6 around 70 75 of phosphorus in eps is bound phosphorus and 30 25 is free ortho phosphates free ortho phosphate is not an integral part of the polymer and it is present since eps is precipitated in the acidic stream which contains high amounts of free ortho phosphates bound phosphorus in eps could be organic inorganic or ortho phosphate loosely bound by electrostatic interactions organically bound phosphorus and loosely bounded ortho phosphate are expected to be the most dominant fractions eps is expected to have phosphorylated proteins phospholipids and phosphosugars due to the extracellular and intracellular components released during alkaline hydrolysis garcía becerra et al 2010 also eps hydrogel is precipitated at around ph 2 4 which is very low to expect any mineral inorganic phosphorus present as they would dissolve 4 4 2 ortho phosphates recovery from alkaline acidic and ad centrate the potential of ortho phosphate recovery from alkaline or acidic liquid streams is attractive according to laboratory extractions 25 20 of sludge tp and 35 30 according to epe demonstration end in these two fractions as ortho phosphates the ortho phosphate increase from 10 of sludge tp initially in spill sludge to 25 35 of sludge tp in the alkaline liquid stream could be attributed to polyphosphate hydrolysis the phosphate concentration is 600 mg po4 p l comparable to concentrations reported for mature technologies of the full scale phosphate recovery processes for municipal and industrial wastewater desmidt et al 2015 there are possible technologies to consider for phosphorus recovery from these two streams for example 1 nanofiltration on the alkaline stream can bleed off the phosphate and other salts to the permeate and keep the eps in the retentate that would concentrate the eps and might reduce acid consumption in the later step however organic fouling of the membrane could be challenging wang et al 2009 2 the acidic stream has a low ph meaning that most phosphate is present as h3po4 h2po4 further lowering the ph to 1 would get all the phosphate to the unionized form as h3po4 and this could create a way to separate phosphoric acid from other salts via ion selective membranes however this would require an extra acid dosage and is cost intensive 3 chemical precipitation by metal addition as magnesium and calcium is the most common straightforward technology for ortho phosphate recovery from liquid streams alkaline and acidic liquid streams are expected to have pros and cons for chemical phosphorus precipitation for instance the alkaline liquid stream has an advantage as it has a high ph value making it suitable for calcium phosphate and struvite recovery struvite consists of equimolar amounts of magnesium ammonium and phosphate and forms at ph 8 9 desmidt et al 2015 doyle and parsons 2002 calcium phosphate forms at ph 9 when the concentrations of phosphorus and calcium are high jupp et al 2021 so there will be no need to adjust the ph of the alkaline stream to form these minerals however this stream also contains solubilized eps metal addition could interfere with its solubilization as it might get complexed or trapped by the polymer causing the soluble polymers to co precipitate affecting the final eps yield table 2 shows that soluble ca2 and mg2 in the alkaline stream are significantly lower than in the acidic stream this suggests that the highly negatively charged polymers trapped these ions at high ph conditions similar observations were reported in soil literature that eps contains metal binders such as phosphate amine carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that trap divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and inhibit the precipitation of calcium carbonate as it reduces the saturation of calcium dittrich and sibler 2010 kremer et al 2008 the second reason is that visual minteq modeling showed that the calcium phosphates and struvite are to be formed in the alkaline supernatant saturation indexes are shown in section 4 of the supplementary material so the alkaline liquid stream is already supersaturated however no precipitation is seen that reflects the possible complexity of phosphorus recovery from this stream on the other hand the acidic stream has a low ph 2 4 requiring intensive chemical addition for ph adjustment and extra costs to precipitate struvite or calcium phosphate cichy et al 2019 the acidic by product stream would not interfere with the eps production as it is already precipitated and removed and the organics interference would be minimal it seems that the acidic stream is more promising so current research is ongoing to validate the possibility of phosphorus recovery in the acidic stream through chemical precipitation ortho phosphate fraction in the ad centrate was calculated based on our measurements and assumptions from literature phosphorus remains in solution after digesting ebpr excess sludge as reported by jardin and popel 1994 is 38 of the total phosphorus brought to the digester no data is available for granular sludge the calculations showed that this centrate would contain 12 epe 15 laboratory of sludge tp with concentrations 700 900 mg po4 p l showing promising feasible recovery 4 5 nitrogen recovery figs 3 and 4 show the fate of nitrogen through the eps extraction process 30 of sludge tn is recovered in the eps mainly as organic nitrogen which fits with its composition of proteins and complex glycoconjugates as glycoprotein felz 2019 the concept of recovering ammonium from the alkaline liquid stream is attractive since it has high ph and high temperature which are required for commercial ammonium recovery technologies air stripping and membrane stripping are the most advanced applied technologies on a large scale for ammonium recovery both technologies require high ph of about 9 10 and high temperatures of 70 80 c van der hoek et al 2018 the energy efficiency of the recovery depends highly on the ammonium concentration ammonium recovery should not require more energy than ammonium production by the haber bosch process ammonium concentration in the alkaline supernatant is 105 mg nh4 n l which is too low to be efficiently recovered maurer et al 2006 ye et al 2020 as reported in the recent stowa report on mature ammonium recovery technologies elbersen et al 2021 so ammonium recovery from the alkaline liquid stream would be a no go however the ammonium fraction in the anaerobic digestion centrate was calculated to be 17 epe and 25 laboratory of sludge tn with a concentration of around 2600 mg nh4 n l which would make it feasible for ammonium recovery these numbers were calculated assuming digestion releases 55 of the sludge nitrogen content soerensen et al 1999 suschka and grübel 2014 4 6 practical implications resource recovery from wastewater is still in its infancy but the consensus is that it should be developed in the context of a more sustainable society kehrein et al 2020a 2020b this paper is taking the first steps towards this and setting a base for decision makers several aspects are relevant to consider for a smooth implementation in the future firstly the technologies used are quite different from operating a standard wwtp and the goals are different utilities will have to consider how they can manage resource recovery at the wwtp either by adaptation or by partly outsourcing the resource recovery operations secondly the eps extraction process is the primary process and other integrated recovery technologies are associated with its by product streams so there should be a substantial market demand for kaumera for such a treatment scheme to make sense the eps from ags forms an interesting new resource for gel forming biopolymers with much higher market potential and new applications than i e alginate or carrageenan kaumera could comprise 50 of the turnover energy raw materials factory ermf of the dutch water authorities van leeuwen et al 2018 it can be used in agricultural horticulture paper coatings and construction industries and can be applied as a gel foam or fiber in 2022 koppert biological systems chaincraft and rhdhv signed a long term contract for collaboration in applying kaumera as a bio stimulant another promising application is flame retardancy as described in section 4 4 1 so it can be used to produce materials and coatings kim et al 2020 eps can also be used in composite material production as it can hold up to 80 of inorganic filler material and clay kaumera composites were tested using kaumera in composite materials makes it an excellent option to replace many of the current applications of oil based plastics henze et al 2020 5 conclusion mass balances allowed the quantification of loads and concentrations of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen species relevant for recovery to set the foundation for a new generation of ags wwtp with integrated resource recovery it was shown that combined eps methane phosphorus and nitrogen recovery is promising 30 of sludge tcod is recovered as eps which has wide possible applications and 25 30 of sludge tcod could be recovered as biomethane by integrating alkaline anaerobic digestion ad 20 of sludge tp is recovered in the eps about 20 30 of tp ends in the acidic liquid waste stream and 15 in the ad centrate as ortho phosphates these ortho phosphate fractions are recoverable by integrating chemical precipitation 30 of sludge tn ends in the eps mainly as organic nitrogen and 20 in the ad centrate as ammonium which membrane or air stripping technologies can feasibly recover this study showed that the developed modified laboratory protocol is an excellent tool for predicting large scale eps extractions it can be used for futural experimental work focused on nutrient recovery or to test the effect of sludge from different installations or seasons and predict the consequences on a large scale with the new laboratory protocol a gel layer was discovered comparing the demonstration and laboratory extractions revealed that the fate of the alkaline gel layer depends on the solid liquid separation efficiency of the decanter centrifuge this layer could offer additional eps recovery however its formation

14944,mercury contamination is a global environmental problem this pollutant is highly toxic and persistent which makes it extremely susceptible to biomagnify i e increase its concentrations as it moves up the food chain reaching levels that threaten wildlife and ultimately ecosystems function and structure mercury monitoring is thus crucial to determine its potential to damage the environment in this study we assessed the temporal trends of the concentrations of hg in two coastal animal species closely connected by a predator prey interaction and evaluated its potential transfer between trophic levels using the δ15n signatures of the two species for this we performed a multi year survey of the concentrations of total hg and the values of δ15n in the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis prey and the dogwhelk nucella lapillus predator sampled along 1500 km of the north atlantic coast of spain over a 30 year period five surveys between 1990 and 2021 concentrations of hg decreased significantly between the first and the last survey in the two species studied except for the 1990 survey the concentrations of hg in mussels were amongst the lowest registered in the literature for the north east atlantic ocean neao and the mediterranean sea ms between 1985 and 2020 nonetheless we detected hg biomagnification in almost all surveys worryingly trophic magnification factors obtained here for total hg were high and comparable to the found in the literature for methylmercury the most toxic and readily biomagnified form of this element the δ15n values were useful to detect hg biomagnification under normal circumstances however we found that nitrogen pollution of coastal waters differentially affected the δ15n signatures of mussels and dogwhelks limiting the use of this parameter for this purpose we conclude that hg biomagnification could constitute an important environmental hazard even when found at very low concentrations in the lower trophic levels also we warn that use of δ15n in biomagnification studies when there is some underlying nitrogen pollution problem might lead to misleading conclusions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dogwhelk food chains mussel nitrogen isotope ratio marine pollution data availability the data are available within the electronic supplementary materials 1 introduction mercury is one of the most toxic elements on earth having important effects at neural hormonal and reproductive levels within individuals boening 2000 fernandes azevedo et al 2012 tan et al 2009 with potential demographic consequences at the population level goutte et al 2014 this element occurs naturally and can be released to the environment through volcanic eruptions rock weathering and evaporation from the ocean boening 2000 human activities like coal combustion and mining however have mobilized mercury from the lithosphere deposits and increased its concentrations in the atmosphere by 450 above natural levels un environment programme 2019 mercury is foremost emitted to the atmosphere in elemental form that is highly volatile and has an atmospheric lifetime of about one year making it remarkably susceptible to long range atmospheric transport fitzgerald and lamborg 2003 eventually hg released into the atmosphere will be deposited directly into the oceans or onto land from where it can be washed into water bodies this hg can be re emitted to the atmosphere and deposited again selin et al 2008 deposited hg on oceans and land will take about 2000 years to return to more stable terrestrial and ocean reservoirs selin et al 2008 sunderland and mason 2007 thus anthropogenic hg emissions can negatively impact the environment for hundreds to thousands of years from their first release un environment programme 2019 it is undeniable that mercury contamination is a serious and global environmental problem inger andersen the united nations deputy secretary general and executive director of the united nations environment program has recently defined it as one of the greatest challenges to the environment and human health unep 2019 the magnitude of this problem is such that partly driven by the minamata convention on hg the first globally legally binding instrument establishing the measures to be undertaken to protect human health and the environment from hg and its compounds unep 2013 organizations like the united nations un the u s environmental protection agency epa and the european union eu have developed coordinated programs to specifically protect the environment from the negative impacts of hg released into the air water and soil un environment program global mercury partnership https www unep org globalmercurypartnership epa mercury https www epa gov mercury and eu global mercury observation system https www gmos eu these programs highlight the necessity to develop long term spatiotemporal observations of hg in the environment to better predict its impact as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the protective measures undertaken inorganic hg that reaches aquatic systems can be biomethylated by microorganisms to form methylmercury the main form in which this element is accumulated in both humans and wildlife d itri 1991 once incorporated into organisms tissues directly from the water or through food consumption this organic form binds strongly to sulfhydryl groups in proteins resulting in low rates of excretion bernhard and andreae 1984 thus hg biomagnification is one of the most concerning issues related to hg contamination biomagnification is defined as the progressive buildup of pollutants in organisms through the food web zweig 1973 accordingly the concentrations of pollutants in organisms of higher trophic levels will be higher than those in their diet biomagnification is thus a special case of pollutant bioaccumulation process in which the main exposure route is the organism s diet connell 1989 gray 2002 mercury biomagnification in marine food webs has been reported before kidd et al 2011 with the most classical and tragic example being the deaths of the minamata population as a result of hg poisoning from the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish d itri 1991 detecting and quantifying biomagnification processes in natural ecosystems is thus crucial to assess how the presence of hg in aquatic environments might translate into local to global exposure risk pollutant biomagnification processes can be identified through the estimation of the trophic magnification factor tmf as the slope of the regression between the concentrations of the pollutant on each member of the trophic chain web against its trophic level a significant and positive tmf would be indicative of biomagnification whereas a significant but negative tmf would point to biodilution the use of stable nitrogen isotope ratio δ15n 15n 14n to investigate pollutant biomagnification processes has been proposed as a more quantitative approach than traditional methods like food composition analyses broman et al 1992 chouvelon et al 2018 foster et al 2012 hong et al 2013 kehrig et al 2013 lavoie et al 2013 the reliability of this method however depends upon the quality of the δ15n signature as a good food web descriptor cabana and rasmussen 1994 it is well known that nitrogen contamination processes can alter the δ15n signatures of organisms heaton 1986 mcclelland and valiela 1998 under such circumstances the δ15n signature could not be a reliable tool for tmf estimation yet to the best of our knowledge no single study has addressed this issue so far considering all of the above we present here a dataset of the concentrations of total hg that includes both organic methylmercury and inorganic forms of this element and the δ15n values in two common dwellers of the intertidal rocky shore of the northeast atlantic ocean closely connected by a predator prey interaction the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis prey and the atlantic dogwhelk nucella lapillus predator these species were collected along 1500 km of the north atlantic coast of spain during five surveys spanning 30 years between 1990 and 2021 this study this aimed at i investigating the temporal trends of the concentrations of hg in these two animal species ii evaluating its potential transfer between trophic levels as well as potential changes in trophic transfer over time and iii assessing the utility of δ15n to identify and monitor hg biomagnification patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing we collected samples of two coastal animal species belonging to two different trophic levels and using different feeding strategies the bivalve mollusc mytilus galloprovincialis lamarck 1819 a filter feeder deudero et al 2009 and the gastropod mollusc nucella lapillus linnaeus 1758 a predator crothers 1985 that preferentially feeds on mussels hughes and drewett 1985 samples were collected in summer during four extensive 1990 2001 2003 and 2021 and one intensive 2017 sampling surveys at 89 different sampling sites ss spread across the galician coast nw spain fig 1 in 1990 the survey included a total of 58 ss with m galloprovincialis collected at 49 ss and n lapillus at 16 ss 7 ss in common in 2001 we sampled 24 ss with m galloprovincialis collected at 22 ss and n lapillus at 12 ss 10 ss in common in 2003 we sampled 37 ss with m galloprovincialis collected at 37 ss and n lapillus at 25 ss 25 ss in common in 2017 we intensified the sampling in two rias tidal inlets that were most seriously affected by hg contamination prego and cobelo garcía 2003 i the ría de ferrol zone e in fig 1 and ii the ría de pontevedra second southernmost ria in zone d fig 1 both rias are affected by different pollution sources such as highly populated urbanized zones industrial facilities i e shipyards and steel works in ferrol and a chlor alkali in pontevedra and busy commercial ports therefore in this survey we sampled a total of 8 ss with m galloprovincialis collected in all 8 ss and n lapillus in 6 ss 6 ss in common finally in 2021 we conducted the last extensive survey which included 32 ss with m galloprovincialis collected in all 32 ss and n lapillus in 23 ss 23 ss in common all sites sampled per survey and species are shown in table s1 all ss were located more than 300 m from waste pipes ports and industrial installations and more than 150 m from the mouths of primary or secondary effluents the sampling was always conducted at low tide in the intertidal zone following a zigzag path between points on the coastline separated by a linear distance of 50 m at each ss we collected at least 25 specimens of m galloprovincialis shell length 6 cm and 30 specimens of n lapillus shell length 2 cm all the specimens were washed in situ with seawater and combined to form a composite sample of each species per site before being transported in cool boxes ca 4 c to the laboratory in the laboratory all the specimens were purged for 48 to 72 h in continuously flowing aerated and filtered active carbon seawater the samples were then stored frozen at 30 c prior to sample preparation processing the material was thawed at room temperature then we separated each specimen s meat from its shell with the aid of high density polythene dissection tools these samples were homogenized waring blender 34bl99 dried in a forced air oven at 40 c and again homogenized in a mill retsch mm400 ultra centrifugal mill after processing all samples were stored at room temperature in darkness until they were analyzed 2 2 chemical analysis we determined the concentrations of hg in an elemental analyzer dma 80 milestone during the analysis we included samples of two certified reference material tort 1 lobster hepatopancreas and erm ce278k mussel and analytical blanks for quality control also all samples were analyzed in duplicate the recovery rate of the reference material was highly satisfactory 106 and 90 respectively while the overall error for the analysis of duplicate samples was very low 3 the limit of quantification calculated from the values obtained from the analytical blanks as meanblanks 10 stddevblanks was 0 4 ng g 1 to determine δ15n values we weighed aliquots of 3 00 0 1 mg of each sample in tin capsules elemental microanalysis the analytical determinations were conducted by the research support services at the university of a coruña spain using an element analyzer flashea1112 thermofinnigan coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer deltav advantage thermo scientific via an interface unit confloiv the accuracy of the procedure was determined by analysis of acetanilide as a calibration standard calibration of the reference gas n2 for atmospheric 15n was carried out with iaea n 1 nh4 2so4 iaea n 2 nh4 2so4 and iaea no 3 kno3 as standards the isotopic ratio 15n 14n in the samples was determined by comparison with a standard atmospheric n2 the relative abundance of 15n in the sample δ15n was calculated using the formula δ15n rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the 15n 14n ratio the overall error calculated for the replicate samples was very low 3 the concentrations of hg and values of δ15n of all the collected samples per survey and species are shown in table s1 2 3 statistical analysis in the first place we assessed the amount of intraspecific variation at the site level in the concentrations of hg and the δ15n values in mussels and dogwhelk for this we estimated the coefficient of variation ratio of the standard deviation to the mean in three biological replicates of each of the species consisting of 10 individuals per replicate in each of 18 ss for dogwhelks and 8 ss mussels from the 1990 and 2017 surveys all statistical analyses were conducted using r v4 2 1 r core team 2022 implemented under rstudio v1 2 5042 rstudio team 2020 all p values 0 05 were considered significant for all the models we evaluated the normality and homoscedasticity homogeneity of variances of the residuals using the shapiro and levene tests respectively as well as by visually inspecting the plots of the residuals when these assumptions were not met we applied transformations to the dependent variables or used alternative non parametric tests first using the full dataset n 89 ss in total 85 ss with 148 data points across surveys for mussels and 45 ss with 82 data points for dogwhelks we tested for significant differences among surveys in the mean concentrations of hg and δ15n values separately for each species for hg in both species and δ15n in dogwhelks we run a one way anova analysis of variance using the function aov from the base r package stats for δ15n in mussels we run the non parametric equivalent to one way anova i e kruskal wallis test with the function kruskal test from the package stats when the main anova and kruskal wallis tests resulted significant we performed all possible pairwise comparisons between surveys using the functions pairwise t test and dunn test package dunn test respectively with the hochberg s gt2 method designed to address unequal sample sizes using the common dataset that only included sites where both species were collected together each survey n 41 ss in total with 77 data points we implemented similar analyses to test if the ratio between the concentrations of hg in dogwhelks and in mussels one way anova and the difference between δ15n values in dogwhelks and in mussels kruskal wallis test differed significantly among surveys lastly in order to confirm that the differences observed between surveys reflected reliable temporal trends rather than spatial trends we performed paired t tests using only the subset of data points that were common to each pair of surveys second we looked for unusually high concentrations of hg and values of δ15n in the full dataset by estimating the values of the outliers as the sum between the third quartile q3 and 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr for each element and species similarly we also looked for unusually low values as the first quartile q1 minus 1 5 times the interquartile range q1 1 5 iqr third we used the common dataset to study the relationship between the concentrations of hg and the values of δ15n in n lapillus and in m galloprovincialis for this we run two separate ancovas with the concentrations of hg and the δ15n in n lapillus as response variables the concentrations of hg and the δ15n in m galloprovincialis as predictors and year treated as factor with 5 levels as a covariate in both models we tested for the significance of the interaction between the predictor and the covariate to evaluate whether the relationship between the concentration of hg and δ15n in mussels and in dogwhelks changed over time in order to check whether the addition of the interaction term improved the fit of the model we used the function anova package stats to compare the model with and without the interaction also using both the full and the common datasets we estimated the coefficients of dispersion the ratio between the median absolute deviation i e the median of the absolute difference between each value and the median to the median of the concentrations of hg and δ15n values in mussels and dogwhelk for each survey we used this approach because it is less sensitive to extremely high low values than the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation fourth we estimated the trophic magnification factor tmf as the slope b of the linear regression between the stable nitrogen isotope ratio δ15n and the log10 value of the concentration of hg in both species log10hg a b δ15n to assess hg biomagnification between trophic levels chouvelon et al 2018 hong et al 2013 kehrig et al 2013 lavoie et al 2010 additionally we used anova to evaluate whether the tmf varied among years by testing for the significance of the interaction between δ15n and year since the interaction was significant we run individual simple linear regression models to separately estimate the tmf for each survey finally following the arguments by isaacs 1973 who stated that more enclosed sites would be more likely to show pollutant biomagnification than open sea sites due to their differences in the variety of prey available to the predators we did the same analyses but separately on the sampling sites that were located in the inner parts of the rias inner sites and on the sites located in the outermost part of the rias outer sites 3 results the coefficients of variation calculated from three biological replicates collected per species in a number of ss to estimate the intraspecific and within site variability of our data were low both for hg mean values of 8 and 17 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively and especially for δ15n mean values of 2 and 3 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively this low within site variability supports that overall our data provide a good representation of the actual concentrations of hg and the δ15n values in each species within each site mean concentrations of hg differed significantly among surveys in both species f 33 4 and p 0 001 in mussels f 18 3 and p 0 001 in dogwhelks table 1 although these concentrations showed a 3 4 and a 7 8 fold decline in mussels and dogwhelks respectively between the first 1990 and the last 2021 survey this decrease was not gradual fig 2 a table s2 table s3 both species showed a strong decrease between 1990 and 2001 then mean hg concentrations in mussels remain rather constant between 2001 and 2017 and declined again significantly in 2021 compared to 2001 and 2017 mean concentrations in dogwhelks followed a similar pattern except for the fact that the lowest mean concentrations found in 2021 only differed significantly from those in 2017 mean δ15n values on the other hand remained constant throughout the study period in dogwhelks f 1 99 and p 0 105 table 1 and decreased significantly in mussels chi sq 58 7 and p 0 001 table 1 this decrease was essentially due to a decline in δ15n between the first and the second survey 1990 to 2001 after 2001 mean δ15n values in mussels remained unchanged fig 2c table s3 total hg concentrations ranged across all surveys between 28 2 and 854 ng g 1 in mussels and between 69 7 and 6254 ng g 1 in dogwhelks we did not find any unusually low q1 1 5 iqr concentrations of hg in any of the species the values of the upper outliers were 385 and 1124 ng g 1 of hg for mussels and dogwhelks respectively we identified a similar number of outliers for hg in both species eight for mussels seven in 1990 and one in 2003 and seven for dogwhelks six in 1990 and one in 2003 although none of them coincided in the same collection sites but they only were collected together in two out of these fifteen sites the δ15n values ranged between 4 99 and 23 7 across all surveys in mussels and between 7 64 and 11 5 in dogwhelks as with hg we did not find any unusually low δ15n values in any of the species the values of the upper outliers were 12 2 and 11 3 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively and contrary to what we found for hg we identified 24 outliers for δ15n in mussels all of them in 1990 and only one in dogwhelks in 2003 the concentrations of hg tended to be less variable in mussels than in dogwhelks coefficients of dispersion ranging between 14 and 38 and 12 42 respectively including both the full and common datasets whereas the δ15n values were more variable in mussels compared to dogwhelks coefficients of dispersion ranging between 3 and 28 and 2 7 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively including both the full and common datasets table s2 the ratio between the concentrations of hg in dogwhelks and in mussels corresponding to the ss in which both species were collected at the same time had a minimum value of 1 5 and a maximum of 16 4 across all surveys whereas the median ratio per survey ranged between 2 3 in 2001 and 4 5 in 2017 fig 2b the overall model testing for differences across surveys in the mean values of this ratio was marginally significant f 2 55 p 0 047 table 1 yet the multiple pairwise comparisons showed no significant differences between surveys table s3 finally the difference between the δ15n values in n lapillus and in m galloprovincialis ranged between 10 7 and 4 8 across all surveys whereas the median difference per survey ranged between 0 74 in 1990 and 1 89 n 2003 fig 2d the results of the model showed significant differences among surveys in the mean value of this difference chi sq 16 6 p 0 002 this effect was due to the low values reported in 1990 driven by the unusually high δ15n values in mussels in this survey as compared to all other surveys fig 2c and 2d table s3 all these results were supported by the paired t tests despite their lower number of data points per survey we found a significant relationship between the concentrations of hg in mussels and dogwhelks as well as between the δ15n values in these two organisms table 2 the interaction between year and the predictor was not significant in any of the models indicating that the effect of these two variables in mussels on the values of these variables in dogwhelk did not vary among years indeed adding the interaction term did not significantly improve the fit of the models f 0 494 p 0 741 for hg f 2 424 p 0 058 for δ15n in the model without the interaction the variation in the concentrations of hg in mussels significantly explained 60 of the variation in the concentrations of hg in dogwhelks whereas that of δ15n only explained 15 table 2 finally we found a significant interaction between year and δ15n values in the model used to estimate the tmfs for the dataset including all sampling sites the dataset including only the sites from the inner part of the rias and the dataset including sites from the outer part of the rias table s4 therefore we separately estimated the tmf for each survey in each dataset table s5 obtaining the following values i dataset including all sampling sites 1 4 1 7 2 7 and 1 4 respectively for the 2001 2003 2017 and 2021 surveys fig 2 ii dataset including only the sites in the inner part of the rias 3 1 1 6 2 5 1 3 respectively for the 1990 2003 2017 and 2021 surveys and iii dataset including only the sites in the outer part of the rias 1 5 1 8 1 5 respectively for the 2001 2003 and 2021 surveys fig s2 tmfs for the 1990 survey in the full and outer sites datasets are not presented because the models were not significant table s5 4 discussion in this study we performed a multi year survey of the concentrations of hg in two animal species from different trophic levels sampled along 1500 km of the northeast atlantic coastline over a 30 year time span we investigated the temporal trends of the concentrations of hg on the coast and evaluated its potential transfer between trophic levels additionally we assessed the utility of δ15n to identify and monitor hg biomagnification patterns first we showed that hg pollution decreased significantly within the study region between 1990 and 2021 with the most drastic decline happening between 1990 and 2001 this temporal pattern was observed regardless of the trophic level of the organism investigated and despite that one of the latest surveys 2017 only included samples from the two most contaminated rias in the region second we found evidence of hg biomagnification in this trophic system that was sustained over time despite the temporal decrease in hg contamination this was demonstrated by i the consistently higher concentrations of hg in the predator n lapillus compared to the prey m galloprovincialis along with the temporal and spatial stability of the ratio between the concentrations of hg in the predator and in the prey ii the high amount of variance in the concentrations of hg in the predator explained by its concentrations in the prey and iii the fact that the significant tmfs were all greater than one overall the concentrations of hg in m galloprovincialis found in this study were low following the mussel watch program criteria for bivalves including mussels of the genus mytilus kimbrough et al 2008 66 of our data points would be classified as having low levels of hg 0 170 ng g 1 25 as having medium levels 170 350 ng g 1 and only 9 as having high levels 350 1280 ng g 1 most of the data points within the medium or high levels belonged to the 1990 survey 37 out of 50 i e 74 which showed the highest concentrations of hg in both study species also our data lay in the lower end of the range of concentrations reported for m galloprovincialis in a literature review that included studies from nine regions spread across the north east atlantic ocean neao and the mediterranean sea ms between 1985 and 2020 fig s1a b together all these data points showed no overall increasing decreasing trend in the concentrations of hg over time t 1 941 p 0 05 in a generalized linear model testing for the change in concentrations over time fig s1a however when split into smaller and more detailed regional datasets there were significant temporal trends as the overall decline observed in our data this agrees with the findings of the mussel watch program which showed no significant country wise level trends but significant increases and decreases in the concentrations of hg in specific regions of the usa coast kimbrough et al 2008 melwani et al 2013 altogether these results suggest that to obtain a more reliable view of the problem of hg contamination in coastal systems the levels of this element need to be monitored from different spatiotemporal perspectives here we identified a significant transfer of total hg between trophic levels in all surveys except 1990 in the complete and outer sites datasets the tmfs estimated for 2001 2003 and 2021 were pretty similar to each other whereas those estimated for 1990 and 2017 were comparatively higher interestingly the first corresponded to surveys in which most data points were classified as having low hg in mussels whereas the latter corresponded to the survey with the highest historical hg levels 1990 and the one that only included sites from the two most polluted rias of the region 2017 reported tmfs for total hg in the literature are comparable to the obtained in this study for 2001 2003 and 2021 for example meng et al 2015 found values of 1 2 in mollusks including different species of bivalves and gastropods qu et al 2022 reported values of 1 4 and 1 7 for invertebrates and fish respectively and lavoie et al 2010 reported a value of 1 4 for a food web including particulate organic matter zooplankton gastropods and bivalves some of the above studies also reported tmfs for methylmercury the most toxic and efficiently biomagnified fraction of hg these were higher compared to those of total hg and comparable to the obtained here for 1990 and 2017 thus meng et al 2015 reported values of 1 9 whereas qu et al 2022 reported values of 2 6 and 2 2 for invertebrates and fish respectively and lavoie et al 2010 reported values of 1 6 works reporting the fraction of methylmercury to total hg in mussels of the genus mytilus showed that for total hg concentrations within the range of the found in our study 35 830 ng g 1 methylmercury could account for at least almost half of the total concentrations of hg in mussels 33 98 ipolyi et al 2004 jędruch et al 2019 for lower total concentrations 2 30 ng g 1 the percentage of methylmercury to total hg was much lower 12 55 knopf et al 2020 taken together these results suggest that total hg can biomagnify even when found at relatively low concentrations 2001 2003 and 2021 surveys and that the fraction of methylmercury to total hg might increase under higher hg contamination levels leading to higher tmfs the extent to which a pollutant is biomagnified does not only depend on its physicochemical characteristics but also on biological ecological and environmental factors according to reinfelder et al 1998 biological factors include ingestion rate determined by the weight of the consumer food availability growth rate etc pollutant assimilation efficiency determined by the composition of the food the concentration of the element in the food source the gut residence time etc pollutant efflux elimination through egestion removal of undigested matter or excretion removal of metabolic waste products and growth rate potential dilution effect ecological factors include the structure and complexity of the food web cabana et al 1994 and the feeding habit lavoie et al 2013 among others finally environmental factors e g ph salinity or temperature can influence both pollutant availability and the biological and ecological processes mentioned above in this work variability in the concentrations of total hg in each of the species studied and consequently in hg biomagnification patterns is likely driven by all these factors to some extent but especially by environmental factors the galician coast is a highly complex system consisting of a series of open sea areas interspersed with more closed estuaries i e rias the latter are even more complex as they are subject to both oceanic and continental influences determining water circulation patterns sedimentation processes organic matter and nutrient contents as well as physicochemical parameters like temperature ph and salinity figueiras et al 2002 lorenzo and taboada 2005 this environmental complexity predominates in our study with sampling sites located inside and outside of the rias leading to potentially site specific growth rates and metabolic activity of our study species hg dispersion patterns activity of microorganisms transforming inorganic hg into methylmercury and characteristics of the sediments and their capacity to remove hg from the water column and recirculate it again the different pollution levels and sources to which mussels and dogwhelks were exposed across these sites add yet another layer of complexity to this system as the normal functioning of these organisms could be significantly altered by pollutant exposure we argue on the other hand that the effect of the ecological factors on the variability of the concentrations of hg found in this study is minor because both the dietary inferences extracted from the results of the δ15n values in these species and the data extracted from the literature point towards a tight predator prey relationship between dogwhelks and mussels across space and time based on the assumption that high intraspecific variation in δ15n values among habitats is indicative of differences in the relative trophic position occupied by a species in those habitats cabana and rasmussen 1994 the low levels of intraspecific variation of δ15n in dogwhelk in this study suggest that dogwhelks dietary habits are consistent across space and time in the study region despite the wide range of habitats studied and the long time span analyzed also even though the low values of the differences in δ15n between dogwhelks and mussels found here compared to the theoretical 3 4 4 difference expected for consecutive trophic levels minagawa and wada 1984 would point towards a prevalent omnivorous diet in dogwhelks results from a previous study in two coastal sites located within the same region found that suspension feeders including m galloprovincialis could make up to 70 of the prey biomass of n lapillus bode et al 2006 other studies found that dogwhelks tend to preferentially feed on mussels over barnacles especially the larger shell length 1 4 cm individuals hughes and drewett 1985 morton 2010 thus even though both barnacles and mussels were present in many of our study sites we sampled large dogwhelks shell length 2 cm which according to this would mostly feed on mussels finally the difference in lifespan between mussels 15 25 years ceccherelli and rossi 1984 sukhotin et al 2007 and dogwhelks between 4 and 6 years crothers 1985 could also explain some of the variation in their hg concentrations and lead to the underestimation of the tmfs it is well known that in addition to being an indicator of the relative trophic position of species δ15n signatures of organisms can be utilized to trace anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into coastal areas mcclelland et al 1997 viana et al 2011 viana and bode 2013 nitrogen inputs derived from agriculture are often depleted in 15n compared to seawater leading to lower δ15n values while inputs from urban sewage terrestrial runoff or fish farm waste are enriched in 15n leading to increased δ15n values heaton 1986 mcclelland and valiela 1998 the δ15n values reported here for m galloprovincialis in the 1990 survey included 24 outliers with values ranging between 12 5 23 7 median 14 7 these values were the highest among the reported for this species in a literature review that included studies from five regions spread across the north east atlantic ocean neao and the mediterranean sea ms between 1998 and 2018 fig s1c d which suggests that the significant enrichment in δ15n observed in multiple sites during the 1990 survey was the result of anthropogenic sources in the study region this enrichment in 1990 was also observed in macroalgae of the same region viana et al 2011 but not in dogwhelk the abnormal peaks of δ15n in mussels thus led to the alteration of the relationship between δ15n and the log transformed hg concentrations in mussels and dogwhelks resulting in the lack of a significant relationship between these two variables consequently we did not find evidence of hg biomagnification in our system in 1990 except in the inner sites dataset which did not include outliers hence for the first time to the best of our knowledge we showed that anthropogenically derived nitrogen sources may differently alter the δ15n signatures of different marine species this has important implications for the use of δ15n to identify hg biomagnification processes under natural circumstances δ15n could be used as a reliable tracer of hg biomagnification when nitrogen contamination processes like the observed in the 1990 survey differentially alter the δ15n signature of different organisms however this parameter should not be used to infer nor quantify pollutant biomagnification unless additional data are gathered to account for the confounding effect of pollution on δ15n signatures finally the difference between mussels and dogwhelks in the sensitivity of their δ15n signature to nitrogen contamination could be due to differences in their feeding mode as filter feeding species mussels diet consists mainly of plankton as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter present in the water indeed bode et al 2006 estimated that phytoplankton accounted for 40 to 100 of the diet of suspension feeder species including m galloprovincialis in three coastal areas of galicia theoretically the capacity of species to reflect on their isotopic signature changes in the inputs of nitrogen to their environment increases in species with faster growth and nutrient uptake rates gartner et al 2002 small algae i e microalgae for example showed significantly faster nitrogen uptake rates than macroalgae hein et al 1995 even so some macroalgae can display altered δ15n values after only seven days of exposure to sewage derived dissolved inorganic nitrogen gartner et al 2002 according to this we would expect greater and faster changes in δ15n resulting from nitrogen contamination in primary producers phytoplankton and macroalgae followed by primary consumers e g mussels and finally by secondary consumers e g predators like the dogwhelks 5 conclusions in this study we found a significant decline in the concentrations of hg in two common dwellers of the intertidal rocky shore of the northeast atlantic ocean between 1990 and 2021 in addition using the δ15n signatures of the two species we provided robust evidence of hg biomagnification even when this element was found at relatively low concentrations in the prey biomagnification factors were highest comparable to the estimated in the literature for methylmercury for the survey with the highest historical hg levels and the one only including sites from the two most polluted rias of the region suggesting that the fraction of methylmercury to total hg increases under higher hg contamination levels leading to increased biomagnification finally we found that nitrogen contamination may have different effects on the δ15n signatures of the different species in this case anthropogenically derived nitrogen inputs to the coastal system caused significant shifts in the δ15n values of the prey mussels but not in its predator dogwhelks making this parameter useless to detect pollutant biomagnification in natural food chains under these circumstances in light of these results we conclude that despite the overall decrease in hg emissions to the environment hg contamination and biomagnification might still be an important environmental problem in some coastal regions and that the δ15n signature is a reliable tracer of hg biomagnification as long as there is no interfering

14944,mercury contamination is a global environmental problem this pollutant is highly toxic and persistent which makes it extremely susceptible to biomagnify i e increase its concentrations as it moves up the food chain reaching levels that threaten wildlife and ultimately ecosystems function and structure mercury monitoring is thus crucial to determine its potential to damage the environment in this study we assessed the temporal trends of the concentrations of hg in two coastal animal species closely connected by a predator prey interaction and evaluated its potential transfer between trophic levels using the δ15n signatures of the two species for this we performed a multi year survey of the concentrations of total hg and the values of δ15n in the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis prey and the dogwhelk nucella lapillus predator sampled along 1500 km of the north atlantic coast of spain over a 30 year period five surveys between 1990 and 2021 concentrations of hg decreased significantly between the first and the last survey in the two species studied except for the 1990 survey the concentrations of hg in mussels were amongst the lowest registered in the literature for the north east atlantic ocean neao and the mediterranean sea ms between 1985 and 2020 nonetheless we detected hg biomagnification in almost all surveys worryingly trophic magnification factors obtained here for total hg were high and comparable to the found in the literature for methylmercury the most toxic and readily biomagnified form of this element the δ15n values were useful to detect hg biomagnification under normal circumstances however we found that nitrogen pollution of coastal waters differentially affected the δ15n signatures of mussels and dogwhelks limiting the use of this parameter for this purpose we conclude that hg biomagnification could constitute an important environmental hazard even when found at very low concentrations in the lower trophic levels also we warn that use of δ15n in biomagnification studies when there is some underlying nitrogen pollution problem might lead to misleading conclusions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dogwhelk

elements on earth having important effects at neural hormonal and reproductive levels within individuals boening 2000 fernandes azevedo et al 2012 tan et al 2009 with potential demographic consequences at the population level goutte et al 2014 this element occurs naturally and can be released to the environment through volcanic eruptions rock weathering and evaporation from the ocean boening 2000 human activities like coal combustion and mining however have mobilized mercury from the lithosphere deposits and increased its concentrations in the atmosphere by 450 above natural levels un environment programme 2019 mercury is foremost emitted to the atmosphere in elemental form that is highly volatile and has an atmospheric lifetime of about one year making it remarkably susceptible to long range atmospheric transport fitzgerald and lamborg 2003 eventually hg released into the atmosphere will be deposited directly into the oceans or onto land from where it can be washed into water bodies this hg can be re emitted to the atmosphere and deposited again selin et al 2008 deposited hg on oceans and land will take about 2000 years to return to more stable terrestrial and ocean reservoirs selin et al 2008 sunderland and mason 2007 thus anthropogenic hg emissions can negatively impact the environment for hundreds to thousands of years from their first release un environment programme 2019 it is undeniable that mercury contamination is a serious and global environmental problem inger andersen the united nations deputy secretary general and executive director of the united nations environment program has recently defined it as one of the greatest challenges to the environment and human health unep 2019 the magnitude of this problem is such that partly driven by the minamata convention on hg the first globally legally binding instrument establishing the measures to be undertaken to protect human health and the environment from hg and its compounds unep 2013 organizations like the united nations un the u s environmental protection agency epa and the european union eu have developed coordinated programs to specifically protect the environment from the negative impacts of hg released into the air water and soil un environment program global mercury partnership https www unep org globalmercurypartnership epa mercury https www epa gov mercury and eu global mercury observation system https www gmos eu these programs highlight the necessity to develop long term spatiotemporal observations of hg in the environment to better predict its impact as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the protective measures undertaken inorganic hg that reaches aquatic systems can be biomethylated by microorganisms to form methylmercury the main form in which this element is accumulated in both humans and wildlife d itri 1991 once incorporated into organisms tissues directly from the water or through food consumption this organic form binds strongly to sulfhydryl groups in proteins resulting in low rates of excretion bernhard and andreae 1984 thus hg biomagnification is one of the most concerning issues related to hg contamination biomagnification is defined as the progressive buildup of pollutants in organisms through the food web zweig 1973 accordingly the concentrations of pollutants in organisms of higher trophic levels will be higher than those in their diet biomagnification is thus a special case of pollutant bioaccumulation process in which the main exposure route is the organism s diet connell 1989 gray 2002 mercury biomagnification in marine food webs has been reported before kidd et al 2011 with the most classical and tragic example being the deaths of the minamata population as a result of hg poisoning from the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish d itri 1991 detecting and quantifying biomagnification processes in natural ecosystems is thus crucial to assess how the presence of hg in aquatic environments might translate into local to global exposure risk pollutant biomagnification processes can be identified through the estimation of the trophic magnification factor tmf as the slope of the regression between the concentrations of the pollutant on each member of the trophic chain web against its trophic level a significant and positive tmf would be indicative of biomagnification whereas a significant but negative tmf would point to biodilution the use of stable nitrogen isotope ratio δ15n 15n 14n to investigate pollutant biomagnification processes has been proposed as a more quantitative approach than traditional methods like food composition analyses broman et al 1992 chouvelon et al 2018 foster et al 2012 hong et al 2013 kehrig et al 2013 lavoie et al 2013 the reliability of this method however depends upon the quality of the δ15n signature as a good food web descriptor cabana and rasmussen 1994 it is well known that nitrogen contamination processes can alter the δ15n signatures of organisms heaton 1986 mcclelland and valiela 1998 under such circumstances the δ15n signature could not be a reliable tool for tmf estimation yet to the best of our knowledge no single study has addressed this issue so far considering all of the above we present here a dataset of the concentrations of total hg that includes both organic methylmercury and inorganic forms of this element and the δ15n values in two common dwellers of the intertidal rocky shore of the northeast atlantic ocean closely connected by a predator prey interaction the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis prey and the atlantic dogwhelk nucella lapillus predator these species were collected along 1500 km of the north atlantic coast of spain during five surveys spanning 30 years between 1990 and 2021 this study this aimed at i investigating the temporal trends of the concentrations of hg in these two animal species ii evaluating its potential transfer between trophic levels as well as potential changes in trophic transfer over time and iii assessing the utility of δ15n to identify and monitor hg biomagnification patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing we collected samples of two coastal animal species belonging to two different trophic levels and using different feeding strategies the bivalve mollusc mytilus galloprovincialis lamarck 1819 a filter feeder deudero et al 2009 and the gastropod mollusc nucella lapillus linnaeus 1758 a predator crothers 1985 that preferentially feeds on mussels hughes and drewett 1985 samples were collected in summer during four extensive 1990 2001 2003 and 2021 and one intensive 2017 sampling surveys at 89 different sampling sites ss spread across the galician coast nw spain fig 1 in 1990 the survey included a total of 58 ss with m galloprovincialis collected at 49 ss and n lapillus at 16 ss 7 ss in common in 2001 we sampled 24 ss with m galloprovincialis collected at 22 ss and n lapillus at 12 ss 10 ss in common in 2003 we sampled 37 ss with m galloprovincialis collected at 37 ss and n lapillus at 25 ss 25 ss in common in 2017 we intensified the sampling in two rias tidal inlets that were most seriously affected by hg contamination prego and cobelo garcía 2003 i the ría de ferrol zone e in fig 1 and ii the ría de pontevedra second southernmost ria in zone d fig 1 both rias are affected by different pollution sources such as highly populated urbanized zones industrial facilities i e shipyards and steel works in ferrol and a chlor alkali in pontevedra and busy commercial ports therefore in this survey we sampled a total of 8 ss with m galloprovincialis collected in all 8 ss and n lapillus in 6 ss 6 ss in common finally in 2021 we conducted the last extensive survey which included 32 ss with m galloprovincialis collected in all 32 ss and n lapillus in 23 ss 23 ss in common all sites sampled per survey and species are shown in table s1 all ss were located more than 300 m from waste pipes ports and industrial installations and more than 150 m from the mouths of primary or secondary effluents the sampling was always conducted at low tide in the intertidal zone following a zigzag path between points on the coastline separated by a linear distance of 50 m at each ss we collected at least 25 specimens of m galloprovincialis shell length 6 cm and 30 specimens of n lapillus shell length 2 cm all the specimens were washed in situ with seawater and combined to form a composite sample of each species per site before being transported in cool boxes ca 4 c to the laboratory in the laboratory all the specimens were purged for 48 to 72 h in continuously flowing aerated and filtered active carbon seawater the samples were then stored frozen at 30 c prior to sample preparation processing the material was thawed at room temperature then we separated each specimen s meat from its shell with the aid of high density polythene dissection tools these samples were homogenized waring blender 34bl99 dried in a forced air oven at 40 c and again homogenized in a mill retsch mm400 ultra centrifugal mill after processing all samples were stored at room temperature in darkness until they were analyzed 2 2 chemical analysis we determined the concentrations of hg in an elemental analyzer dma 80 milestone during the analysis we included samples of two certified reference material tort 1 lobster hepatopancreas and erm ce278k mussel and analytical blanks for quality control also all samples were analyzed in duplicate the recovery rate of the reference material was highly satisfactory 106 and 90 respectively while the overall error for the analysis of duplicate samples was very low 3 the limit of quantification calculated from the values obtained from the analytical blanks as meanblanks 10 stddevblanks was 0 4 ng g 1 to determine δ15n values we weighed aliquots of 3 00 0 1 mg of each sample in tin capsules elemental microanalysis the analytical determinations were conducted by the research support services at the university of a coruña spain using an element analyzer flashea1112 thermofinnigan coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer deltav advantage thermo scientific via an interface unit confloiv the accuracy of the procedure was determined by analysis of acetanilide as a calibration standard calibration of the reference gas n2 for atmospheric 15n was carried out with iaea n 1 nh4 2so4 iaea n 2 nh4 2so4 and iaea no 3 kno3 as standards the isotopic ratio 15n 14n in the samples was determined by comparison with a standard atmospheric n2 the relative abundance of 15n in the sample δ15n was calculated using the formula δ15n rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the 15n 14n ratio the overall error calculated for the replicate samples was very low 3 the concentrations of hg and values of δ15n of all the collected samples per survey and species are shown in table s1 2 3 statistical analysis in the first place we assessed the amount of intraspecific variation at the site level in the concentrations of hg and the δ15n values in mussels and dogwhelk for this we estimated the coefficient of variation ratio of the standard deviation to the mean in three biological replicates of each of the species consisting of 10 individuals per replicate in each of 18 ss for dogwhelks and 8 ss mussels from the 1990 and 2017 surveys all statistical analyses were conducted using r v4 2 1 r core team 2022 implemented under rstudio v1 2 5042 rstudio team 2020 all p values 0 05 were considered significant for all the models we evaluated the normality and homoscedasticity homogeneity of variances of the residuals using the shapiro and levene tests respectively as well as by visually inspecting the plots of the residuals when these assumptions were not met we applied transformations to the dependent variables or used alternative non parametric tests first using the full dataset n 89 ss in total 85 ss with 148 data points across surveys for mussels and 45 ss with 82 data points for dogwhelks we tested for significant differences among surveys in the mean concentrations of hg and δ15n values separately for each species for hg in both species and δ15n in dogwhelks we run a one way anova analysis of variance using the function aov from the base r package stats for δ15n in mussels we run the non parametric equivalent to one way anova i e kruskal wallis test with the function kruskal test from the package stats when the main anova and kruskal wallis tests resulted significant we performed all possible pairwise comparisons between surveys using the functions pairwise t test and dunn test package dunn test respectively with the hochberg s gt2 method designed to address unequal sample sizes using the common dataset that only included sites where both species were collected together each survey n 41 ss in total with 77 data points we implemented similar analyses to test if the ratio between the concentrations of hg in dogwhelks and in mussels one way anova and the difference between δ15n values in dogwhelks and in mussels kruskal wallis test differed significantly among surveys lastly in order to confirm that the differences observed between surveys reflected reliable temporal trends rather than spatial trends we performed paired t tests using only the subset of data points that were common to each pair of surveys second we looked for unusually high concentrations of hg and values of δ15n in the full dataset by estimating the values of the outliers as the sum between the third quartile q3 and 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr for each element and species similarly we also looked for unusually low values as the first quartile q1 minus 1 5 times the interquartile range q1 1 5 iqr third we used the common dataset to study the relationship between the concentrations of hg and the values of δ15n in n lapillus and in m galloprovincialis for this we run two separate ancovas with the concentrations of hg and the δ15n in n lapillus as response variables the concentrations of hg and the δ15n in m galloprovincialis as predictors and year treated as factor with 5 levels as a covariate in both models we tested for the significance of the interaction between the predictor and the covariate to evaluate whether the relationship between the concentration of hg and δ15n in mussels and in dogwhelks changed over time in order to check whether the addition of the interaction term improved the fit of the model we used the function anova package stats to compare the model with and without the interaction also using both the full and the common datasets we estimated the coefficients of dispersion the ratio between the median absolute deviation i e the median of the absolute difference between each value and the median to the median of the concentrations of hg and δ15n values in mussels and dogwhelk for each survey we used this approach because it is less sensitive to extremely high low values than the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation fourth we estimated the trophic magnification factor tmf as the slope b of the linear regression between the stable nitrogen isotope ratio δ15n and the log10 value of the concentration of hg in both species log10hg a b δ15n to assess hg biomagnification between trophic levels chouvelon et al 2018 hong et al 2013 kehrig et al 2013 lavoie et al 2010 additionally we used anova to evaluate whether the tmf varied among years by testing for the significance of the interaction between δ15n and year since the interaction was significant we run individual simple linear regression models to separately estimate the tmf for each survey finally following the arguments by isaacs 1973 who stated that more enclosed sites would be more likely to show pollutant biomagnification than open sea sites due to their differences in the variety of prey available to the predators we did the same analyses but separately on the sampling sites that were located in the inner parts of the rias inner sites and on the sites located in the outermost part of the rias outer sites 3 results the coefficients of variation calculated from three biological replicates collected per species in a number of ss to estimate the intraspecific and within site variability of our data were low both for hg mean values of 8 and 17 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively and especially for δ15n mean values of 2 and 3 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively this low within site variability supports that overall our data provide a good representation of the actual concentrations of hg and the δ15n values in each species within each site mean concentrations of hg differed significantly among surveys in both species f 33 4 and p 0 001 in mussels f 18 3 and p 0 001 in dogwhelks table 1 although these concentrations showed a 3 4 and a 7 8 fold decline in mussels and dogwhelks respectively between the first 1990 and the last 2021 survey this decrease was not gradual fig 2 a table s2 table s3 both species showed a strong decrease between 1990 and 2001 then mean hg concentrations in mussels remain rather constant between 2001 and 2017 and declined again significantly in 2021 compared to 2001 and 2017 mean concentrations in dogwhelks followed a similar pattern except for the fact that the lowest mean concentrations found in 2021 only differed significantly from those in 2017 mean δ15n values on the other hand remained constant throughout the study period in dogwhelks f 1 99 and p 0 105 table 1 and decreased significantly in mussels chi sq 58 7 and p 0 001 table 1 this decrease was essentially due to a decline in δ15n between the first and the second survey 1990 to 2001 after 2001 mean δ15n values in mussels remained unchanged fig 2c table s3 total hg concentrations ranged across all surveys between 28 2 and 854 ng g 1 in mussels and between 69 7 and 6254 ng g 1 in dogwhelks we did not find any unusually low q1 1 5 iqr concentrations of hg in any of the species the values of the upper outliers were 385 and 1124 ng g 1 of hg for mussels and dogwhelks respectively we identified a similar number of outliers for hg in both species eight for mussels seven in 1990 and one in 2003 and seven for dogwhelks six in 1990 and one in 2003 although none of them coincided in the same collection sites but they only were collected together in two out of these fifteen sites the δ15n values ranged between 4 99 and 23 7 across all surveys in mussels and between 7 64 and 11 5 in dogwhelks as with hg we did not find any unusually low δ15n values in any of the species the values of the upper outliers were 12 2 and 11 3 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively and contrary to what we found for hg we identified 24 outliers for δ15n in mussels all of them in 1990 and only one in dogwhelks in 2003 the concentrations of hg tended to be less variable in mussels than in dogwhelks coefficients of dispersion ranging between 14 and 38 and 12 42 respectively including both the full and common datasets whereas the δ15n values were more variable in mussels compared to dogwhelks coefficients of dispersion ranging between 3 and 28 and 2 7 for mussels and dogwhelks respectively including both the full and common datasets table s2 the ratio between the concentrations of hg in dogwhelks and in mussels corresponding to the ss in which both species were collected at the same time had a minimum value of 1 5 and a maximum of 16 4 across all surveys whereas the median ratio per survey ranged between 2 3 in 2001 and 4 5 in 2017 fig 2b the overall model testing for differences across surveys in the mean values of this ratio was marginally significant f 2 55 p 0 047 table 1 yet the multiple pairwise comparisons showed no significant differences between surveys table s3 finally the difference between the δ15n values in n lapillus and in m galloprovincialis ranged between 10 7 and 4 8 across all surveys whereas the median difference per survey ranged between 0 74 in 1990 and 1 89 n 2003 fig 2d the results of the model showed significant differences among surveys in the mean value of this difference chi sq 16 6 p 0 002 this effect was due to the low values reported in 1990 driven by the unusually high δ15n values in mussels in this survey as compared to all other surveys fig 2c and 2d table s3 all these results were supported by the paired t tests despite their lower number of data points per survey we found a significant relationship between the concentrations of hg in mussels and dogwhelks as well as between the δ15n values in these two organisms table 2 the interaction between year and the predictor was not significant in any of the models indicating that the effect of these two variables in mussels on the values of these variables in dogwhelk did not vary among years indeed adding the interaction term did not significantly improve the fit of the models f 0 494 p 0 741 for hg f 2 424 p 0 058 for δ15n in the model without the interaction the variation in the concentrations of hg in mussels significantly explained 60 of the variation in the concentrations of hg in dogwhelks whereas that of δ15n only explained 15 table 2 finally we found a significant interaction between year and δ15n values in the model used to estimate the tmfs for the dataset including all sampling sites the dataset including only the sites from the inner part of the rias and the dataset including sites from the outer part of the rias table s4 therefore we separately estimated the tmf for each survey in each dataset table s5 obtaining the following values i dataset including all sampling sites 1 4 1 7 2 7 and 1 4 respectively for the 2001 2003 2017 and 2021 surveys fig 2 ii dataset including only the sites in the inner part of the rias 3 1 1 6 2 5 1 3 respectively for the 1990 2003 2017 and 2021 surveys and iii dataset including only the sites in the outer part of the rias 1 5 1 8 1 5 respectively for the 2001 2003 and 2021 surveys fig s2 tmfs for the 1990 survey in the full and outer sites datasets are not presented because the models were not significant table s5 4 discussion in this study we performed a multi year survey of the concentrations of hg in two animal species from different trophic levels sampled along 1500 km of the northeast atlantic coastline over a 30 year time span we investigated the temporal trends of the concentrations of hg on the coast and evaluated its potential transfer between trophic levels additionally we assessed the utility of δ15n to identify and monitor hg biomagnification patterns first we showed that hg pollution decreased significantly within the study region between 1990 and 2021 with the most drastic decline happening between 1990 and 2001 this temporal pattern was observed regardless of the trophic level of the organism investigated and despite that one of the latest surveys 2017 only included samples from the two most contaminated rias in the region second we found evidence of hg biomagnification in this trophic system that was sustained over time despite the temporal decrease in hg contamination this was demonstrated by i the consistently higher concentrations of hg in the predator n lapillus compared to the prey m galloprovincialis along with the temporal and spatial stability of the ratio between the concentrations of hg in the predator and in the prey ii the high amount of variance in the concentrations of hg in the predator explained by its concentrations in the prey and iii the fact that the significant tmfs were all greater than one overall the concentrations of hg in m galloprovincialis found in this study were low following the mussel watch program criteria for bivalves including mussels of the genus mytilus kimbrough et al 2008 66 of our data points would be classified as having low levels of hg 0 170 ng g 1 25 as having medium levels 170 350 ng g 1 and only 9 as having high levels 350 1280 ng g 1 most of the data points within the medium or high levels belonged to the 1990 survey 37 out of 50 i e 74 which showed the highest concentrations of hg in both study species also our data lay in the lower end of the range of concentrations reported for m galloprovincialis in a literature review that included studies from nine regions spread across the north east atlantic ocean neao and the mediterranean sea ms between 1985 and 2020 fig s1a b together all these data points showed no overall increasing decreasing trend in the concentrations of hg over time t 1 941 p 0 05 in a generalized linear model testing for the change in concentrations over time fig s1a however when split into smaller and more detailed regional datasets there were significant temporal trends as the overall decline observed in our data this agrees with the findings of the mussel watch program which showed no significant country wise level trends but significant increases and decreases in the concentrations of hg in specific regions of the usa coast kimbrough et al 2008 melwani et al 2013 altogether these results suggest that to obtain a more reliable view of the problem of hg contamination in coastal systems the levels of this element need to be monitored from different spatiotemporal perspectives here we identified a significant transfer of total hg between trophic levels in all surveys except 1990 in the complete and outer sites datasets the tmfs estimated for 2001 2003 and 2021 were pretty similar to each other whereas those estimated for 1990 and 2017 were comparatively higher interestingly the first corresponded to surveys in which most data points were classified as having low hg in mussels whereas the latter corresponded to the survey with the highest historical hg levels 1990 and the one that only included sites from the two most polluted rias of the region 2017 reported tmfs for total hg in the literature are comparable to the obtained in this study for 2001 2003 and 2021 for example meng et al 2015 found values of 1 2 in mollusks including different species of bivalves and gastropods qu et al 2022 reported values of 1 4 and 1 7 for invertebrates and fish respectively and lavoie et al 2010 reported a value of 1 4 for a food web including particulate organic matter zooplankton gastropods and bivalves some of the above studies also reported tmfs for methylmercury the most toxic and efficiently biomagnified fraction of hg these were higher compared to those of total hg and comparable to the obtained here for 1990 and 2017 thus meng et al 2015 reported values of 1 9 whereas qu et al 2022 reported values of 2 6 and 2 2 for invertebrates and fish respectively and lavoie et al 2010 reported values of 1 6 works reporting the fraction of methylmercury to total hg in mussels of the genus mytilus showed that for total hg concentrations within the range of the found in our study 35 830 ng g 1 methylmercury could account for at least almost half of the total concentrations of hg in mussels 33 98 ipolyi et al 2004 jędruch et al 2019 for lower total concentrations 2 30 ng g 1 the percentage of methylmercury to total hg was much lower 12 55 knopf et al 2020 taken together these results suggest that total hg can biomagnify even when found at relatively low concentrations 2001 2003 and 2021 surveys and that the fraction of methylmercury to total hg might increase under higher hg contamination levels leading to higher tmfs the extent to which a pollutant is biomagnified does not only depend on its physicochemical characteristics but also on biological ecological and environmental factors according to reinfelder et al 1998 biological factors include ingestion rate determined by the weight of the consumer food availability growth rate etc pollutant assimilation efficiency determined by the composition of the food the concentration of the element in the food source the gut residence time etc pollutant efflux elimination through egestion removal of undigested matter or excretion removal of metabolic waste products and growth rate potential dilution effect ecological factors include the structure and complexity of the food web cabana et al 1994 and the feeding habit lavoie et al 2013 among others finally environmental factors e g ph salinity or temperature can influence both pollutant availability and the biological and ecological processes mentioned above in this work variability in the concentrations of total hg in each of the species studied and consequently in hg biomagnification patterns is likely driven by all these factors to some extent but especially by environmental factors the galician coast is a highly complex system consisting of a series of open sea areas interspersed with more closed estuaries i e rias the latter are even more complex as they are subject to both oceanic and continental influences determining water circulation patterns sedimentation processes organic matter and nutrient contents as well as physicochemical parameters like temperature ph and salinity figueiras et al 2002 lorenzo and taboada 2005 this environmental complexity predominates in our study with sampling sites located inside and outside of the rias leading to potentially site specific growth rates and metabolic activity of our study species hg dispersion patterns activity of microorganisms transforming inorganic hg into methylmercury and characteristics of the sediments and their capacity to remove hg from the water column and recirculate it again the different pollution levels and sources to which mussels and dogwhelks were exposed across these sites add yet another layer of complexity to this system as the normal functioning of these organisms could be significantly altered by pollutant exposure we argue on the other hand that the effect of the ecological factors on the variability of the concentrations of hg found in this study is minor because both the dietary inferences extracted from the results of the δ15n values in these species and the data extracted from the literature point towards a tight predator prey relationship between dogwhelks and mussels across space and time based on the assumption that high intraspecific variation in δ15n values among habitats is indicative of differences in the relative trophic position occupied by a species in those habitats cabana and rasmussen 1994 the low levels of intraspecific variation of δ15n in dogwhelk in this study suggest that dogwhelks dietary habits are consistent across space and time in the study region despite the wide range of habitats studied and the long time span analyzed also even though the low values of the differences in δ15n between dogwhelks and mussels found here compared to the theoretical 3 4 4 difference expected for consecutive trophic levels minagawa and wada 1984 would point towards a prevalent omnivorous diet in dogwhelks results from a previous study in two coastal sites located within the same region found that suspension feeders including m galloprovincialis could make up to 70 of the prey biomass of n lapillus bode et al 2006 other studies found that dogwhelks tend to preferentially feed on mussels over barnacles especially the larger shell length 1 4 cm individuals hughes and drewett 1985 morton 2010 thus even though both barnacles and mussels were present in many of our study sites we sampled large dogwhelks shell length 2 cm which according to this would mostly feed on mussels finally the difference in lifespan between mussels 15 25 years ceccherelli and rossi 1984 sukhotin et al 2007 and dogwhelks between 4 and 6 years crothers 1985 could also explain some of the variation in their hg concentrations and lead to the underestimation of the tmfs it is well known that in addition to being an indicator of the relative trophic position of species δ15n signatures of organisms can be utilized to trace anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into coastal areas mcclelland et al 1997 viana et al 2011 viana and bode 2013 nitrogen inputs derived from agriculture are often depleted in 15n compared to seawater leading to lower δ15n values while inputs from urban sewage terrestrial runoff or fish farm waste are enriched in 15n leading to increased δ15n values heaton 1986 mcclelland and valiela 1998 the δ15n values reported here for m galloprovincialis in the 1990 survey included 24 outliers with values ranging between 12 5 23 7 median 14 7 these values were the highest among the reported for this species in a literature review that included studies from five regions spread across the north east atlantic ocean neao and the mediterranean sea ms between 1998 and 2018 fig s1c d which suggests that the significant enrichment in δ15n observed in multiple sites during the 1990 survey was the result of anthropogenic sources in the study region this enrichment in 1990 was also observed in macroalgae of the same region viana et al 2011 but not in dogwhelk the abnormal peaks of δ15n in mussels thus led to the alteration of the relationship between δ15n and the log transformed hg concentrations in mussels and dogwhelks resulting in the lack of a significant relationship between these two variables consequently we did not find evidence of hg biomagnification in our system in 1990 except in the inner sites dataset which did not include outliers hence for the first time to the best of our knowledge we showed that anthropogenically derived nitrogen sources may differently alter the δ15n signatures of different marine species this has important implications for the use of δ15n to identify hg biomagnification processes under natural circumstances δ15n could be used as a reliable tracer of hg biomagnification when nitrogen contamination processes like the observed in the 1990 survey differentially alter the δ15n signature of different organisms however this parameter should not be used to infer nor quantify pollutant biomagnification unless additional data are gathered to account for the confounding effect of pollution on δ15n signatures finally the difference between mussels and dogwhelks in the sensitivity of their δ15n signature to nitrogen contamination could be due to differences in their feeding mode as filter feeding species mussels diet consists mainly of plankton as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter present in the water indeed bode et al 2006 estimated that phytoplankton accounted for 40 to 100 of the diet of suspension feeder species including m galloprovincialis in three coastal areas of galicia theoretically the capacity of species to reflect on their isotopic signature changes in the inputs of nitrogen to their environment increases in species with faster growth and nutrient uptake rates gartner et al 2002 small algae i e microalgae for example showed significantly faster nitrogen uptake rates than macroalgae hein et al 1995 even so some macroalgae can display altered δ15n values after only seven days of exposure to sewage derived dissolved inorganic nitrogen gartner et al 2002 according to this we would expect greater and faster changes in δ15n resulting from nitrogen contamination in primary producers phytoplankton and macroalgae followed by primary consumers e g mussels and finally by secondary consumers e g predators like the dogwhelks 5 conclusions in this study we found a significant decline in the concentrations of hg in two common dwellers of the intertidal rocky shore of the northeast atlantic ocean between 1990 and 2021 in addition using the δ15n signatures of the two species we provided robust evidence of hg biomagnification even when this element was found at relatively low concentrations in the prey biomagnification factors were highest comparable to the estimated in the literature for methylmercury for the survey with the highest historical hg levels and the one only including sites from the two most polluted rias of the region suggesting that the fraction of methylmercury to total hg increases under higher hg contamination levels leading to increased biomagnification finally we found that nitrogen contamination may have different effects on the δ15n signatures of the different species in this case anthropogenically derived nitrogen inputs to the coastal system caused significant shifts in the δ15n values of the prey mussels but not in its predator dogwhelks making this parameter useless to detect pollutant biomagnification in natural food chains under these circumstances in light of these results we conclude that despite the overall decrease in hg emissions to the environment hg contamination and biomagnification might still be an important environmental problem in some coastal regions and that the δ15n signature is a reliable tracer of hg biomagnification as long as there is no interfering
