23405,the present paper suggests a modification of the turbulent viscosity model for predicting cavitating flows it is to improve the two equation turbulence model which failed to accurately predict unsteady cloud cavitation due to the turbulent viscosity overestimated the modification approach is that the cavitating flow depends on the turbulent viscosity in not only the mixture flow field but also the surrounding flow field in the vicinity of the vapor cavity the turbulent viscosity in the standard rng k ε turbulence model was modified by the correlation between the cavitation model and the barotropic equation of state the unsteady cavitating flow around a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil was simulated by using the modified model as well as the standard model the simulation result for the modified model agreed well with the experimental one from the numerical result the effect of the turbulent viscosity on the cavitation simulation and the cavitating flows was discussed the present work showed that the strong turbulence is mainly produced in the condensation process and it delays the cavitation inception in the next cycle keywords unsteady cloud cavitation naca0015 hydrofoil turbulence model turbulent viscosity barotropic state law 1 introduction cavitation is a physical phenomenon from the expansion of non condensable gas to the vapor cavity collapse the cavitating flow involves complex pressure variations for a hydraulic machinery it could influence the flow stability during operation in particular the periodic collapse of vapor cavities has a great impact on surrounding flow characteristics but also causes erosion noise vibration and so on cavitating flow is characterized by the multi phase flow including the mass transfer between phases compressibility and viscous effects li et al 2010 various numerical models were established for the cavitation modeling which could be classified into two major approaches in terms of phase change one is to use the interphase transport equation between liquid and vapor phases which was modelled by mass transfer rates under the phasic volume fraction conservation kubota et al 1992 kunz et al 2000 saito et al 2003 singhal et al 2002 zwart et al 2004 the other is the one fluid approach based on the barotropic state law barre et al 2009 goncalves and patella 2009 reboud et al 1998 saurel et al 2009 it was modelled by the barotropic state equation of which the characteristic curve is determined by the minimum sound speed as the adjustable constant the mixture density is defined by the function of the local pressure coutier delgosha et al 2003a investigated the effect of turbulence modeling on the unsteady cavitation simulation they showed that the standard two equation turbulence model failed to reproduce the vapor cloud shedding the cavitation simulations were conducted by using des and les recently kinzel et al 2007 okita et al 2009 song and qin 2001 wang and ostoja starzewski 2007 ji et al 2012 employed the pans method girimaji 2006 to simulate unsteady cavitating flow and showed good agreement between numerical and experimental results they all showed the importance of turbulence modeling for simulating unsteady cavitation 1 1 compressibility and turbulence modeling in cavitation fig 1 shows that the cavitating flow is characterized by three flow regimes for isothermal liquid vapor mixture incompressible flow in the pure liquid low mach compressible flow in the pure vapor and transonic or supersonic flow in the mixture venkateswaran et al 2002 the speed of sound depends on the pressure and the saturation curve kieffer and werner 1977 the speed of sound in the mixture is much lower than that in pure liquid or vapor the mach number often reaches larger than 5 0 during cavitation process coutier delgosha et al 2003a various researchers have presented the turbulence modeling for simulating compressible flow sarkar et al 1991 wilcox 1992 zeman 1990 they introduced a modification of the turbulence dissipation term in the k equation with the turbulence mach number m t 2k 0 5 c depends on the turbulence kinetic energy k and the local speed of sound c for the k ε turbulence model the dissipation term in the k equation was expressed as ρ ε ε d where ρ is the mixture density and ε ε d are the solenoidal and dilatational components respectively the ε d is defined by the function of m t and is larger as the turbulence mach number increases if k is constant the m t would have the maximum value at the minimum speed of sound for cavitating flows the m t could have the maximum value at the phasic volume fraction of 0 5 various researchers had an interest in the effect of the compressibility correction on the turbulent cavitating flow according to reboud et al 1998 the standard two equation turbulence model could not give an exact solution for unsteady cavitating flows because the turbulent viscosity is overestimated at the cavity wake region it always leads to the stable cavity formation they then suggested a modification of the turbulent viscosity to take into account the compressibility effect for the standard k ε model the turbulent viscosity μ t is defined as 1 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε where c μ is the turbulence model constant reboud et al 1998 modified eq 1 in the range of two phase mixture as follows f ρ c μ k 2 ε where f ρ ρ v α l n ρ l ρ v n is larger than 1 0 α is the phasic volume fraction and the subscript l and v represent the liquid phase and the vapor phase respectively coutier delgosha et al 2003a coutier delgosha et al 2003b simulated the unsteady cavitating flow with this modification and concluded that the modified model has an effectiveness comparable to the compressibility correction model proposed by wilcox 1992 this approach is being applied to various turbulence models for cavitation simulation li et al 2010 zhou and wang 2008 zwart et al 2004 however compressibility characteristics in the two phase mixture are distinguishable from the compressible flows at high reynolds number for cavitating flows the mass transfer is characterized by large density gradient in comparison to the pressure gradient in other words the mixture flow during cavitation could be sometimes characterized by high mach number nevertheless the turbulence kinetic energy k is not necessarily large at high mach number for cavitating flows from the definition of m t it can be supposed that the compressibility correction of turbulence models might have only a week or no effect on the unsteady cavitating flow at different reynolds numbers two equation turbulence models should be improved for accurately predicting the unsteady cavitating flow however it is noticeable that they would not only depend on the compressible turbulence modeling a new approach of turbulence modeling needs to be established for cavitating flow simulations 1 2 objective of this work the present paper suggests another modification approach of the turbulent viscosity which is modeled based on the standard rng k ε turbulence model this approach will be verified by unsteady cavitation simulation with a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil in addition comparing to the standard turbulence model the effect of the turbulent viscosity on the cavitation simulation as well as the cavitating flow is discussed 2 turbulent viscosity modification sec 1 1 introduced the standard two equation turbulence model overestimates the turbulent viscosity during cavitation for this reason unsteady cavitating flow simulations commonly have errors for the cavity length and the cavity shedding frequency a major concern was to take into account the compressibility effect due to low speed of sound in two phase mixture however the compressibility correction would have only a weak effectiveness in low k fields it means that the turbulent viscosity during cavitation process is not only overproduced in the mixture zone the cavitating flows usually involve vortices at the inside as well as outside of the vapor cavity the vortices are generated not only by the cavitating but also by some influence factors on the cavitation process such as the re entrant jet the circulating flow in the bubble and the cavity wake they all influence significantly developing vapor cavities for cloud cavitation the cloud cavity is mainly separated by the re entrant jet which influences the cavity shedding behaviors in this paper an approach is established for improving cloud cavitation simulation which is that the turbulent viscosity overproduced during cavitation would be not only in the mixture region but also in the flow field in the vicinity of the vapor cavity it is well known that rans models fail in predicting the turbulence level for flows with the strong curvature which would be a concern for improving the modeling of the unsteady flow behavior in cloud cavitation then it needs to be determined where the strong turbulence is mainly produced during cavitation in for the non cavitating flow the two equation turbulence model has shown good agreement with experimental data except for the case of stall angle of attack therefore the strong turbulence could be assumed to be produced during the cavitating the cavitating flow can be regarded to be a secondary flow and the turbulence intensity for the non cavitating condition is practically much low in contrast to the cavitating condition liquid and vapor densities are assumed to be constant if liquid gas mixture is assumed to be homogeneous and in thermo and mechanical equilibrium and each phase shares the same velocity pressure and temperature fields the saturation pressure is assumed to be isothermal from eq 1 the turbulent viscosity is proportional to the mixture density ρ and inversely to the turbulence dissipation rate ε which depends on the kinematic viscosity then it can be known that the μ t is characterized by an exponential function of the mixture density μ t ρ 2 the kinematic viscosity in the homogeneous mixture ν μ ρ where μ is the laminar viscosity could be obtained as shown in fig 2 since the homogeneous mixture shares a velocity field with the same length scale the local reynolds number can be supposed to be almost constant in the mixture excepting for the region adjacent to the pure vapor α l 1 therefore if the turbulence intensity has no a great difference over the mixture region the μ t in the region close to the pure liquid should be modeled to be much larger than the other regions consequently for cavitating flows the strong turbulence would be produced mainly in the pure water and in vapor condensation in which the local pressure is larger than the vapor pressure in other words the amount of turbulent viscosity overgenerated by the turbulence model is much larger in the pure water and the mixture close to the pure water than the others therefore in order to improve the cavitation simulation the modification of the turbulence model needs to mainly focus on turbulence characteristics in flow fields of pure water and adjacent to the pure water in vapor condensation it would improve prediction of re entrant jet flow cavity wake flow as well as the cavity shedding behavior in cloud cavitation in this paper the turbulent viscosity model is modified in the standard rng k ε turbulence model it is an arbitrary modification to avoid the strong turbulence influencing the cavitating flow the basic idea is that the turbulent viscosity overestimated by the two equation turbulence model during cavitation is in the surrounding flow field of the vapor cavity for the mixture region this modeling aims to reduce the turbulence level in the condensation 3 numerical method 3 1 governing equations for multi phase mixture the homogeneous continuity and the momentum equations for two phase mixture are as following 2 ρ t ρ u j 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j where u is the velocity and p is the pressure the density and viscosity in the mixture are defined as 4 ρ a 1 n p α a ρ a 5 μ a 1 n p α a μ a where α a is the phasic volume fraction and n p is the number of phases 3 2 cavitation model various cavitation models have been proposed of which the interphase mass transfer is governed by each transport equation under the volume fraction conservation kunz et al 2000 singhal et al 2002 zwart et al 2004 in this simulation the zwart cavitation model is adopted which is derived from the rayleigh plesset equation in this model the non condensable gas effect is taken into account on the assumption that cavitation bubbles have no interaction each other when initial cavitation bubble grows from the nucleation site zwart et al 2004 for this reason the mass transfer formulation for evaporation is not identical to that for condensation the transport equation for the vapor volume fraction is as follows 6 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m e m c for the zwart model mass transfer rates in evaporation and condensation are modelled as 7 m e c e 3 ρ v 1 α v α n c g r 2 3 p v p ρ l i f p p v 8 m c c c 3 ρ v α v r 2 3 p p v ρ l i f p p v where p v is the vapor pressure r represents the mean radius of bubbles which is assumed to be 1 0 10 6 m α ncg is the volume fraction of non condensable gas which is a model constant and set to 5 0 10 4 c e and c c are the empirical coefficients where the subscripts e and c represent the vaporization and the condensation respectively the empirical coefficients directly influence the vapor production and the cavity inertia frikha et al 2009 morgut et al 2011 suggested an optimizing method on two empirical coefficients for various cavitation models from their optimization result for the zwart model c e and c c were set to 300 and 0 03 3 3 turbulence modeling 3 3 1 standard rng k ε turbulence model in this paper the standard rng k ε turbulence model was adopted the standard rng k ε model is typically used in a wide area in which the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation equations are as follows 9 ρ k t ρ u j k x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j μ t u i x j u j x i u i x j ρ ε 10 ρ ε t ρ u j ε x j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε k μ

1986 3 3 2 a modified rng k ε turbulence model this section describes the modification of the turbulent viscosity from sec 2 the modified model should be characterized by a non linear curve depending on the mixture speed of sound it will be modeled with a function of local pressure in the pressure field of p p v which consists of vapor condensation region for the mixture and pure water region near the vapor cavity for the liquid phase so the modified μ t should be identical to the standard model at the vapor pressure consequently an equation of state in the mixture is employed to modify the turbulent viscosity model the barotropic state law is applied to the modification of the turbulent viscosity in which the local mixture density is characterized by a sine function the sine curve is determined by the minimum speed of sound c min in the mixture fig 3 shows the relation between the local pressure and the mixture density based on the barotropic state law since the vapor pressure is constant the homogeneous mixture density only depends on the local pressure as follows 13 ρ b a sin p p v c m i n 2 a a where a is ρ l ρ v 2 and a is ρ l ρ v 2 dellanoy and kueny 1990 leroux et al 2005 it should be noted that the barotropic state equation is just used for the turbulence modeling but not as the cavitation model in this paper the employed cavitation model is described in sec 3 2 fig 4 shows the basic concept of turbulent viscosity modification here the pressure distribution is assumed to be circumferentially uniform p v at the vapor cavity boundary and increase with the constant gradient from the boundary in the infinite space it should be noted that the mixture density curve ρ in fig 4 is just only expressed as an example to describe the basic concept but which is defined by the cavitation model and the cavitation model constant the modified model is only effective in the specific range of the pressure p v p p lim where p lim can be adjusted by a model constant but is not the pressure beginning the phase change in other words the reference density at α l 1 0 is 1 0 for ρ ρ l but not 1 0 for ρ b ρ l in the range of p p lim the standard turbulent viscosity model is modified by a function of the local pressure on the basis on the barotropic state law 14 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε p p v p p l i m ρ b c μ k 2 ε p v p p l i m 15 p l i m π 2 c m i n 2 a p v in this modified model the c min is used as the model constant for adjusting p lim the effective range is wider with the larger c min as shown in fig 4 therefore there has the difference of μ t at each local pressure between the standard and modified models ρ ρ b c μ k 2 ε in the applicable range however the limited pressure p lim must be lower than the freestream pressure defined in the cavitation number the c min was set to 3 0 and the turbulence model constant c μ c ε1 c ε2 σ k σ e and β were set to 0 085 1 42 1 68 0 7179 0 7179 and 0 012 respectively 3 4 calculation domain and boundary condition unsteady incompressible simulation is conducted for the cloud cavitation the flow instability at the low cavitation number is not only governed by 2 d mechanism coutier delgosha et al 2007 the cavitating flow around a 3 d hydrofoil has the spanwise velocity component and pressure gradient due to the side wall effect he et al 2014 yang et al 2011 the unsteady vapor cavity behavior and shedding frequency are clearly different between two and three dimensional models saito et al 2006 therefore three dimensional flow field should be simulated to accurately predict the cavitating flow in the present work a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil was used for predicting cloud cavitation which was modelled based on the experimental study by cervone et al 2006 it is vertically symmetric with the chord length c of 115 mm and the width of 80 mm in the test section 120 80 500 mm the tip clearance was not considered fig 6 shows the grid independency study on the pressure distribution at the suction side there the average pressure coefficients are 0 6178 for the coarse grid 0 4873 for the medium grid and 0 4871 for the fine grid this simulation uses the medium grid of 1 4 million 175 in the streamwise direction and 50 in the spanwise direction consists of all structured grid the grid density near the wall is finer with the non dimensional wall distance y of 30 as shown in fig 5 the scalable wall function was used for the near wall treatment grotjans and menter 1998 as fig 5 the recording points ptu pcu pbu ptd pcd and pbd were set based on the experiment data and the others were set to measure the pressure pulsation for the boundary condition the total pressure condition was set at the inlet boundary and the mass flow rate condition was set at the outlet boundary on the cavitation number defined as 16 σ p 0 p v 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where p 0 and u 0 are the inlet pressure and the inlet velocity respectively at the domain inlet the inflow direction is assumed to be normal to the boundary and the turbulence intensity i was set to 0 01 the turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation ε at the inlet boundary can be calculated as k in 3 2 i 2 u 0 2 and ε in k 3 2 0 3d h where d h is the hydraulic diameter the present simulation was conducted at the reynolds number re c c u 0 ν between 5 0 105 and 1 0 106 from experiment the vapor volume fraction at the inlet was zero as the boundary condition the no slip condition was set to all walls and the surface roughness in experiment was not considered the selected calculation conditions are as following angle of attack 8 temperature of 25 c and cavitation number of 1 4 2 1 the water liquid and vapor densities are 997 kg m3 and 0 023 kg m3 respectively the dynamic viscosities are 8 899 10 4 kg ms for the liquid and 9 863 10 6 kg ms for the vapor however this simulation uses a clipped density ratio as a relaxation factor to avoid the sudden change in mixture density for the numerical stability it was set to 1000 the minimum mixture density is limited to 10 3 of the liquid density for all terms except the source terms on the mass transfer rate the initial condition was obtained from the steady calculation without the cavitation model this paper mainly deals with the cavitation number of 1 8 the commercial cfd code cfx solver was used the high order resolution scheme barth and jespersen 1989 was used to calculate the advection terms in each finite volume equation the implicit scheme was adopted for the unsteady numerical solution the second order backward euler scheme was used for the transient term the time step is controlled by the cfl number according to the velocity change relative to the grid scale it was set the root mean square of 3 0 in all directions the corresponding time step is close to st 200f where st is the strouhal number st fc u 0 and f is the frequency of the cavity shedding which was suggested for unsteady cavitation simulation by their work coutier delgosha et al 2003a ji et al 2013 the convergence criterion on residual errors was set to 10 5 for the discretized finite volume equations the maximum iteration of each time step was set to 20 for the cfx software the next time step computation just begins after converged for each finite volume even if the number of iterations does not reach the maximum value 4 numerical results and discussion unsteady numerical simulations were performed with the modified rng k ε turbulence model as well as the standard turbulence model fig 6 shows the numerical results for the non cavitating condition with both turbulence models it shows the numerical result agrees well with experimental data for the pressure coefficient on the suction side of the hydrofoil which is defined as c p p p 0 0 5ρu 0 2 two simulation results have almost no difference because the minimum p is larger than p lim in this flow condition the calculation result for non cavitating flow should be validated before simulating the cavitating flow to reduce numerical errors not only for the generated grid effect but also for the installation angle the time averaged values of cavity length and pressure drop between upstream and downstream were compared from the experimental data fig 7 shows those for four cavitation numbers where the mean cavity length l cav is the horizontal length of iso surface the vapor volume fraction of 0 1 on the center plane for the simulation result the measurement points for the pressure drop are illustrated in fig 5 for the cavitation number of 1 8 the l cav c is about 0 78 for the experiment 0 79 for the modified turbulence model and 0 45 for the standard turbulence model fig 7 the normalized pressure drop is 0 156 for the experiment 0 158 for the modified model and 0 161 for the standard model between two points ptu and ptd the simulation result by using the modified turbulence model agrees well with the experiment one in the mean cavity length and the pressure drop of hydrofoil table 1 shows the comparison of numerical results predicted various turbulence models the standard rng k ε model the rng k ε model with the compressibility correction by sarkar et al 1991 and the modified model in the present work it is demonstrated that the compressibility correction sometimes has a weak effectiveness for predicting cloud cavitation furthermore the turbulence model needs to be improved in the turbulence level at the region in the vicinity of the vapor cavity 4 1 comparison of cloud cavitation between two turbulence models the numerical results were obtained after the periodic cavity shedding was stable the cavitating flow at the cavitation number of 1 8 for the angle attack of 8 is quite complex the cloud cavitation was observed in the experiment fig 8 and fig 9 show the vapor cavity behavior with the iso surface of vapor volume fraction 0 1 where t is the time corresponding to one cavity shedding cycle which was differently predicted by using each turbulence model at the same cavitation number fig 10 one cycle for the cloud cavitation can be classified into four stages as the cavitation inception and the sheet cavity evolution fig 8b and c and fig 9a the acceleration of the re entrant jet fig 8b and c and fig 9a the cavity separation and detachment figs 8g and 9f and the cavity destruction the cavitation inception in fig 9 appears earlier than in fig 8 and it means that the time interval from the cavity collapse to the next inception has a distinct difference between them the evolution of the re entrant jet in fig 9 is distinguished from fig 8 the detached cavity volume in fig 9 is clearly larger than fig 8 for the cloud cavitation the re entrant jet is a major influence factor on the initial separation of the cloud cavity fig 10 shows the time history of the pressure and the frequency analysis result by using fast fourier transform at the point pcu for two models the amplitude in the frequency diagram is to be normalized by the dynamic pressure the strouhal number st of the first dominant frequency is 0 135 for the standard model and 0 159 for the modified model it is about 0 2 for the experiment by cervone et al 2006 the modified turbulence model could give the better result for cavity shedding frequencies in terms of the pressure pulsation the results show that the pressure drop just before the cavity collapse influences the whole cavity volume here it can be supposed that the pressure variation is effected by the turbulence characteristic directly or indirectly for this reason at that moment the vapor cavity on the hydrofoil is rapidly reproduced as shown in fig 9h which is distinguishable from fig 8g for the modified turbulence model the time interval from the last cavity collapse to the next inception is relatively short fig 10b the attached cavity is then gradually developed from the cavitation inception fig 8b and c and fig 9a and it increases the upstream pressure due to the drag and then the upstream pressure begins decreasing with evolving the re entrant jet the re entrant jet at the middle part of the hydrofoil is commonly faster than near the side wall figs 8d and 9b for the modified turbulence model the second dominant frequency of the pressure fluctuation has higher amplitude obviously as shown in fig 10 which shows the similar characteristic to experimental data fig 11 shows the amplitude spectra of pressure fluctuations over the hydrofoil with the strouhal number in this figure the first and second dominant frequencies at the point pt3 pt4 and pt5 are close to ones at the hydrofoil upstream ptu pcu and pbu for both two models it means that the variation of pressure at those points is governed by the cavity shedding meanwhile for the standard model the pressure pulsation at the point pt2 has the similar pattern to those points above mentioned whereas for the modified model the largest amplitude appears at the same point with the strouhal number of about 0 32 which corresponds to the second dominant frequency at the other points it means that there exists another influence factor from the position of the point pt2 the second dominant frequency at the hydrofoil upstream is supposed to be caused by the second re entrant jet it has presented that the second dominant frequency at the hydrofoil upstream may be relevant to the second re entrant jet for the cavitation number of 1 8 with the attack angle of 8 which is faster than the first re entrant jet around the naca0015 hydrofoil cervone et al 2006 sakoda et al 2001 for the standard turbulence model the second re entrant jet effect was not captured in the pressure pulsation 4 2 influence of turbulent viscosity model on the cavity shedding this section investigates the influence of the modeled turbulent viscosity on the cavity shedding with the simulation results of both the standard and modified turbulent viscosity models fig 12 and fig 13 show 2 d velocity vector without the spanwise component the vapor volume fraction and the mixture turbulent viscosity in a cycle at the center of the hydrofoil in figs 12 and 13 the flow characteristic seems to have almost no different between two models for a while before the re entrant jet begins to be developed near the vapor cavity the turbulent viscosity gradually increases while evolving the re entrant jet and until the cloud cavity collapsed in this process the turbulent viscosity becomes much larger than the modified model for the standard turbulence model the process of separating the vapor cavity demonstrates the effectiveness of the modified turbulence model in particular the velocity field near the vapor cavity is noticeable to be characterized by the different velocity gradient between two models for the modified model the re entrant jet inducing vortices is distinguishable from the wake flow disturbed by the attached cavity which mainly flows in the opposite direction over the hydrofoil the cloud cavity is separated by the re entrant jet from the attached vapor cavity finally the turbulent viscosity is much larger when the collapse of the cloud cavities and it could influence the cavitation inception in the next cycle however the strong turbulent viscosity is not to be suddenly produced at that moment from the present results it can be known that the standard rng k ε turbulence model has the numerical error for the cavity length in unsteady cloud cavitation due to the strong turbulent viscosity which is much overproduced especially after the re entrant jet begins to be developed 4 3 turbulence and unsteady cloud cavitation fig 14 shows the time history of flow characteristics such as the non dimensionalized pressure at the hydrofoil downstream the volume averaged vapor volume fraction and turbulent kinetic energy in the calculation domain they were obtained to investigate the correlation between cavitating flow and turbulence characteristics for the pressure pulsation the obvious pressure drop or rise appears more than two times per cycle due to the cavity destruction two results show the different tendencies in pressure pulsation after each cavity collapse the collapse of the cloud cavity induces large pressure change and strong turbulence as shown in figs 12 14 in fig 14 the vapor volume almost disappears after the cloud bubble collapsed at the downstream the large pressure change even influences the pressure field at the hydrofoil upstream as shown in fig 10 the vapor volume fraction in fig 14 shows that the attached cavity on the foil surface disappears rapidly with the last collapse almost simultaneously for the turbulence kinetic energy k it should be noted that the k for the non cavitating condition is much low relative to the cavitating condition it means that the strong k is almost produced by the cavitating flow for the cavitation number of 1 8 with the attack angle of 8 it increases gradually from the evolution of the re entrant jet to the cloud cavity collapse and then it continuously rises for a moment after the k begins to decrease the cavitation inception can be observed on the hydrofoil from figs 10 and 14 the change in pressure becomes stable for a moment after the collapse of the cloud cavity nevertheless the vapor cavity is not developed for a while until the k begins to decrease from fig 14 the turbulence kinetic energy is higher when increase than decrease in vaper volume fractions consequently it is demonstrated that the k increases largely in vapor condensation process relative to in evaporation the vapor volume fraction is inversely proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy in the cavitating flow therefore for the standard turbulence model the time interval from the cavity collapse to the next inception is longer than the modified turbulence model due to turbulent viscosity overproduced the strong turbulence delays the cavitation inception figs 8 and 9 5 conclusion the present paper suggested a modification of the turbulent viscosity model for improving the simulation of unsteady turbulent cavitating flows with two equation turbulence model this modification approach is that the turbulent viscosity overestimated by the two equation turbulence model during cavitation is mainly in the surrounding flow field of the vapor cavity the turbulent viscosity in the standard rng k ε turbulence model was modified by the function of the local pressure based on the barotropic state law this model was verified by the unsteady cavitation simulation with a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil and the simulation result agreed well with experimental data from the characteristic of kinematic viscosity in the mixture it was figured out that the strong turbulence is mainly produced in vapor condensation than in evaporation and it was demonstrated by the simulation results for the standard turbulence model the numerical error for the cavity length was due to the strong turbulence which was much overestimated after the re entrant jet generated the strong turbulence influenced the process of separating vapor cavities it was described by the results of unsteady shedding behaviors the total vapor volume in the cavity shedding was adversely proportional to the turbulence kinetic energy for this reason the strong turbulence delayed the cavitation inception in the next cycle the

unsteady cloud cavitation due to the turbulent viscosity overestimated the modification approach is that the cavitating flow depends on the turbulent viscosity in not only the mixture flow field but also the surrounding flow field in the vicinity of the vapor cavity the turbulent viscosity in the standard rng k ε turbulence model was modified by the correlation between the cavitation model and

turbulence model turbulent viscosity barotropic state law 1 introduction cavitation is a physical phenomenon from the expansion of non condensable gas to the vapor cavity collapse the cavitating flow involves complex pressure variations for a hydraulic machinery it could influence the flow stability during operation in particular the periodic collapse of vapor cavities has a great impact on surrounding flow characteristics but also causes erosion noise vibration and so on cavitating flow is characterized by the multi phase flow including the mass transfer between phases compressibility and viscous effects li et al 2010 various numerical models were established for the cavitation modeling which could be classified into two major approaches in terms of phase change one is to use the interphase transport equation between liquid and vapor phases which was modelled by mass transfer rates under the phasic volume fraction conservation kubota et al 1992 kunz et al 2000 saito et al 2003

vapor mixture incompressible flow in the pure liquid low mach compressible flow in the pure vapor and transonic or supersonic flow in the mixture venkateswaran et al 2002 the speed of sound depends on the pressure and the saturation curve kieffer and werner 1977 the speed of sound in the mixture is much lower than that in pure liquid or vapor the mach number often reaches larger than 5 0 during cavitation process coutier delgosha et al 2003a various researchers have presented the turbulence modeling for simulating compressible flow sarkar et al 1991 wilcox 1992 zeman 1990 they introduced a modification of the turbulence dissipation term in the k equation with the turbulence mach number m t 2k 0 5 c depends on the turbulence kinetic energy k and the local speed of sound c for the k ε turbulence model the dissipation term in the k equation was expressed as ρ ε ε d where ρ is the mixture density and ε ε d are the solenoidal and dilatational components respectively the ε d is defined by the function of m t and is larger as the turbulence mach number increases if k is constant the m t would have the maximum value at the minimum speed of sound for cavitating flows the m t could have the maximum value at the phasic volume fraction of 0 5 various researchers had an interest in the effect of the compressibility correction on the turbulent cavitating flow according to reboud et al 1998 the standard two equation turbulence model could not give an exact solution for unsteady cavitating flows because the turbulent viscosity is overestimated at the cavity wake region it always leads to the stable cavity formation they then suggested a modification of the turbulent viscosity to take into account the compressibility effect for the standard k ε model the turbulent viscosity μ t is defined as 1 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε where c μ is the turbulence model constant reboud et al 1998 modified eq 1 in the range of two phase mixture as follows f ρ c μ k 2 ε where f ρ ρ v α l n ρ l ρ v n is larger than 1 0 α is the phasic volume fraction and the subscript l and v represent the liquid phase and the vapor phase respectively coutier delgosha et al 2003a coutier delgosha et al 2003b simulated the unsteady cavitating flow with this modification and concluded that the modified model has an effectiveness comparable to the compressibility correction model proposed by wilcox 1992 this approach is being applied to various turbulence models for cavitation simulation li et al 2010 zhou and wang 2008 zwart et al 2004 however compressibility characteristics in the two phase mixture are distinguishable from the compressible flows at high reynolds number for cavitating flows the mass transfer is characterized by large density gradient in comparison to the pressure gradient in other words the mixture flow during cavitation could be sometimes characterized by high mach number nevertheless the turbulence kinetic energy k is not necessarily large at high mach number for cavitating flows from the definition of m t it can be supposed that the compressibility correction of turbulence models might have only a week or no effect on the unsteady cavitating flow at different reynolds numbers two equation turbulence models should be improved for accurately predicting the unsteady cavitating flow however it is noticeable that they would not only depend on the compressible turbulence modeling a new approach of turbulence modeling needs to be established for cavitating flow simulations 1 2 objective of this work the present paper suggests another modification approach of the turbulent viscosity which is modeled based on the standard rng k ε turbulence model this approach will be verified by unsteady cavitation simulation with a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil in addition comparing to the standard turbulence model the effect of the turbulent viscosity on the cavitation simulation as well as the cavitating flow is discussed 2 turbulent viscosity modification sec 1 1 introduced the standard two equation turbulence model overestimates the turbulent viscosity during cavitation for this reason unsteady cavitating flow simulations commonly have errors for the cavity length and the cavity shedding frequency a major concern was to take into account the compressibility effect due to low speed of sound in two phase mixture however the compressibility correction would have only a weak effectiveness in low k fields it means that the turbulent viscosity during cavitation process is not only overproduced in the mixture zone the cavitating flows usually involve vortices at the inside as well as outside of the vapor cavity the vortices are generated not only by the cavitating but also by some influence factors on the cavitation process such as the re entrant jet the circulating flow in the bubble and the cavity wake they all influence significantly developing vapor cavities for cloud cavitation the cloud cavity is mainly separated by the re entrant jet which influences the cavity shedding behaviors in this paper an approach is established for improving cloud cavitation simulation which is that the turbulent viscosity overproduced during cavitation would be not only in the mixture region but also in the flow field in the vicinity of the vapor cavity it is well known that rans models fail in predicting the turbulence level for flows with the strong curvature which would be a concern for improving the modeling of the unsteady flow behavior in cloud cavitation then it needs to be determined where the strong turbulence is mainly produced during cavitation in for the non cavitating flow the two equation turbulence model has shown good agreement with experimental data except for the case of stall angle of attack therefore the strong turbulence could be assumed to be produced during the cavitating the cavitating flow can be regarded to be a secondary flow and the turbulence intensity for the non cavitating condition is practically much low in contrast to the cavitating condition liquid and vapor densities are assumed to be constant if liquid gas mixture is assumed to be homogeneous and in thermo and mechanical equilibrium and each phase shares the same velocity pressure and temperature fields the saturation pressure is assumed to be isothermal from eq 1 the turbulent viscosity is proportional to the mixture density ρ and inversely to the turbulence dissipation rate ε which depends on the kinematic viscosity then it can be known that the μ t is characterized by an exponential function of the mixture density μ t ρ 2 the kinematic viscosity in the homogeneous mixture ν μ ρ where μ is the laminar viscosity could be obtained as shown in fig 2 since the homogeneous mixture shares a velocity field with the same length scale the local reynolds number can be supposed to be almost constant in the mixture excepting for the region adjacent to the pure vapor α l 1 therefore if the turbulence intensity has no a great difference over the mixture region the μ t in the region close to the pure liquid should be modeled to be much larger than the other regions consequently for cavitating flows the strong turbulence would be produced mainly in the pure water and in vapor condensation in which the local pressure is larger than the vapor pressure in other words the amount of turbulent viscosity overgenerated by the turbulence model is much larger in the pure water and the mixture close to the pure water than the others therefore in order to improve the cavitation simulation the modification of the turbulence model needs to mainly focus on turbulence characteristics in flow fields of pure water and adjacent to the pure water in vapor condensation it would improve prediction of re entrant jet flow cavity wake flow as well as the cavity shedding behavior in cloud cavitation in this paper the turbulent viscosity model is modified in the standard rng k ε turbulence model it is an arbitrary modification to avoid the strong turbulence influencing the cavitating flow the basic idea is that the turbulent viscosity overestimated by the two equation turbulence model during cavitation is in the surrounding flow field of the vapor cavity for the mixture region this modeling aims to reduce the turbulence level in the condensation 3 numerical method 3 1 governing equations for multi phase mixture the homogeneous continuity and the momentum equations for two phase mixture are as following 2 ρ t ρ u j 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j where u is the velocity and p is the pressure the density and viscosity in the mixture are defined as 4 ρ a 1 n p α a ρ a 5 μ a 1 n p α a μ a where α a is the phasic volume fraction and n p is the number of phases 3 2 cavitation model various cavitation models have been proposed of which the interphase mass transfer is governed by each transport equation under the volume fraction conservation kunz et al 2000 singhal et al 2002 zwart et al 2004 in this simulation the zwart cavitation model is adopted which is derived from the rayleigh plesset equation in this model the non condensable gas effect is taken into account on the assumption that cavitation bubbles have no interaction each other when initial cavitation bubble grows from the nucleation site zwart et al 2004 for this reason the mass transfer formulation for evaporation is not identical to that for condensation the transport equation for the vapor volume fraction is as follows 6 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m e m c for the zwart model mass transfer rates in evaporation and condensation are modelled as 7 m e c e 3 ρ v 1 α v α n c g r 2 3 p v p ρ l i f p p v 8 m c c c 3 ρ v α v r 2 3 p p v ρ l i f p p v where p v is the vapor pressure r represents the mean radius of bubbles which is assumed to be 1 0 10 6 m α ncg is the volume fraction of non condensable gas which is a model constant and set to 5 0 10 4 c e and c c are the empirical coefficients where the subscripts e and c represent the vaporization and the condensation respectively the empirical coefficients directly influence the vapor production and the cavity inertia frikha et al 2009 morgut et al 2011 suggested an optimizing method on two empirical coefficients for various cavitation models from their optimization result for the zwart model c e and c c were set to 300 and 0 03 3 3 turbulence modeling 3 3 1 standard rng k ε turbulence model in this paper the standard rng k ε turbulence model was adopted the standard rng k ε model is typically used in a wide area in which the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation equations are as follows 9 ρ k t ρ u j k x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j μ t u i x j u j x i u i x j ρ ε 10 ρ ε t ρ u j ε x j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε k μ

1986 3 3 2 a modified rng k ε turbulence model this section describes the modification of the turbulent viscosity from sec 2 the modified model should be characterized by a non linear curve depending on the mixture speed of sound it will be modeled with a function of local pressure in the pressure field of p p v which consists of vapor condensation region for the mixture and pure water region near the vapor cavity for the liquid phase so the modified μ t should be identical to the standard model at the vapor pressure consequently an equation of state in the mixture is employed to modify the turbulent viscosity model the barotropic state law is applied to the modification of the turbulent viscosity in which the local mixture density is characterized by a sine function the sine curve is determined by the minimum speed of sound c min in the mixture fig 3 shows the relation between the local pressure and the mixture density based on the barotropic state law since the vapor pressure is constant the homogeneous mixture density only depends on the local pressure as follows 13 ρ b a sin p p v c m i n 2 a a where a is ρ l ρ v 2 and a is ρ l ρ v 2 dellanoy and kueny 1990 leroux et al 2005 it should be noted that the barotropic state equation is just used for the turbulence modeling but not as the cavitation model in this paper the employed cavitation model is described in sec 3 2 fig 4 shows the basic concept of turbulent viscosity modification here the pressure distribution is assumed to be circumferentially uniform p v at the vapor cavity boundary and increase with the constant gradient from the boundary in the infinite space it should be noted that the mixture density curve ρ in fig 4 is just only expressed as an example to describe the basic concept but which is defined by the cavitation model and the cavitation model constant the modified model is only effective in the specific range of the pressure p v p p lim where p lim can be adjusted by a model constant but is not the pressure beginning the phase change in other words the reference density at α l 1 0 is 1 0 for ρ ρ l but not 1 0 for ρ b ρ l in the range of p p lim the standard turbulent viscosity model is modified by a function of the local pressure on the basis on the barotropic state law 14 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε p p v p p l i m ρ b c μ k 2 ε p v p p l i m 15 p l i m π 2 c m i n 2 a p v in this modified model the c min is used as the model constant for adjusting p lim the effective range is wider with the larger c min as shown in fig 4 therefore there has the difference of μ t at each local pressure between the standard and modified models ρ ρ b c μ k 2 ε in the applicable range however the limited pressure p lim must be lower than the freestream pressure defined in the cavitation number the c min was set to 3 0 and the turbulence model constant c μ c ε1 c ε2 σ k σ e and β were set to 0 085 1 42 1 68 0 7179 0 7179 and 0 012 respectively 3 4 calculation domain and boundary condition unsteady incompressible simulation is conducted for the cloud cavitation the flow instability at the low cavitation number is not only governed by 2 d mechanism coutier delgosha et al 2007 the cavitating flow around a 3 d hydrofoil has the spanwise velocity component and pressure gradient due to the side wall effect he et al 2014 yang et al 2011 the unsteady vapor cavity behavior and shedding frequency are clearly different between two and three dimensional models saito et al 2006 therefore three dimensional flow field should be simulated to accurately predict the cavitating flow in the present work a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil was used for predicting cloud cavitation which was modelled based on the experimental study by cervone et al 2006 it is vertically symmetric with the chord length c of 115 mm and the width of 80 mm in the test section 120 80 500 mm the tip clearance was not considered fig 6 shows the grid independency study on the pressure distribution at the suction side there the average pressure coefficients are 0 6178 for the coarse grid 0 4873 for the medium grid and 0 4871 for the fine grid this simulation uses the medium grid of 1 4 million 175 in the streamwise direction and 50 in the spanwise direction consists of all structured grid the grid density near the wall is finer with the non dimensional wall distance y of 30 as shown in fig 5 the scalable wall function was used for the near wall treatment grotjans and menter 1998 as fig 5 the recording points ptu pcu pbu ptd pcd and pbd were set based on the experiment data and the others were set to measure the pressure pulsation for the boundary condition the total pressure condition was set at the inlet boundary and the mass flow rate condition was set at the outlet boundary on the cavitation number defined as 16 σ p 0 p v 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where p 0 and u 0 are the inlet pressure and the inlet velocity respectively at the domain inlet the inflow direction is assumed to be normal to the boundary and the turbulence intensity i was set to 0 01 the turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation ε at the inlet boundary can be calculated as k in 3 2 i 2 u 0 2 and ε in k 3 2 0 3d h where d h is the hydraulic diameter the present simulation was conducted at the reynolds number re c c u 0 ν between 5 0 105 and 1 0 106 from experiment the vapor volume fraction at the inlet was zero as the boundary condition the no slip condition was set to all walls and the surface roughness in experiment was not considered the selected calculation conditions are as following angle of attack 8 temperature of 25 c and cavitation number of 1 4 2 1 the water liquid and vapor densities are 997 kg m3 and 0 023 kg m3 respectively the dynamic viscosities are 8 899 10 4 kg ms for the liquid and 9 863 10 6 kg ms for the vapor however this simulation uses a clipped density ratio as a relaxation factor to avoid the sudden change in mixture density for the numerical stability it was set to 1000 the minimum mixture density is limited to 10 3 of the liquid density for all terms except the source terms on the mass transfer rate the initial condition was obtained from the steady calculation without the cavitation model this paper mainly deals with the cavitation number of 1 8 the commercial cfd code cfx solver was used the high order resolution scheme barth and jespersen 1989 was used to calculate the advection terms in each finite volume equation the implicit scheme was adopted for the unsteady numerical solution the second order backward euler scheme was used for the transient term the time step is controlled by the cfl number according to the velocity change relative to the grid scale it was set the root mean square of 3 0 in all directions the corresponding time step is close to st 200f where st is the strouhal number st fc u 0 and f is the frequency of the cavity shedding which was suggested for unsteady cavitation simulation by their work coutier delgosha et al 2003a ji et al 2013 the convergence criterion on residual errors was set to 10 5 for the discretized finite volume equations the maximum iteration of each time step was set to 20 for the cfx software the next time step computation just begins after converged for each finite volume even if the number of iterations does not reach the maximum value 4 numerical results and discussion unsteady numerical simulations were performed with the modified rng k ε turbulence model as well as the standard turbulence model fig 6 shows the numerical results for the non cavitating condition with both turbulence models it shows the numerical result agrees well with experimental data for the pressure coefficient on the suction side of the hydrofoil which is defined as c p p p 0 0 5ρu 0 2 two simulation results have almost no difference because the minimum p is larger than p lim in this flow condition the calculation result for non cavitating flow should be validated before simulating the cavitating flow to reduce numerical errors not only for the generated grid effect but also for the installation angle the time averaged values of cavity length and pressure drop between upstream and downstream were compared from the experimental data fig 7 shows those for four cavitation numbers where the mean cavity length l cav is the horizontal length of iso surface the vapor volume fraction of 0 1 on the center plane for the simulation result the measurement points for the pressure drop are illustrated in fig 5 for the cavitation number of 1 8 the l cav c is about 0 78 for the experiment 0 79 for the modified turbulence model and 0 45 for the standard turbulence model fig 7 the normalized pressure drop is 0 156 for the experiment 0 158 for the modified model and 0 161 for the standard model between two points ptu and ptd the simulation result by using the modified turbulence model agrees well with the experiment one in the mean cavity length and the pressure drop of hydrofoil table 1 shows the comparison of numerical results predicted various turbulence models the standard rng k ε model the rng k ε model with the compressibility correction by sarkar et al 1991 and the modified model in the present work it is demonstrated that the compressibility correction sometimes has a weak effectiveness for predicting cloud cavitation furthermore the turbulence model needs to be improved in the turbulence level at the region in the vicinity of the vapor cavity 4 1 comparison of cloud cavitation between two turbulence models the numerical results were obtained after the periodic cavity shedding was stable the cavitating flow at the cavitation number of 1 8 for the angle attack of 8 is quite complex the cloud cavitation was observed in the experiment fig 8 and fig 9 show the vapor cavity behavior with the iso surface of vapor volume fraction 0 1 where t is the time corresponding to one cavity shedding cycle which was differently predicted by using each turbulence model at the same cavitation number fig 10 one cycle for the cloud cavitation can be classified into four stages as the cavitation inception and the sheet cavity evolution fig 8b and c and fig 9a the acceleration of the re entrant jet fig 8b and c and fig 9a the cavity separation and detachment figs 8g and 9f and the cavity destruction the cavitation inception in fig 9 appears earlier than in fig 8 and it means that the time interval from the cavity collapse to the next inception has a distinct difference between them the evolution of the re entrant jet in fig 9 is distinguished from fig 8 the detached cavity volume in fig 9 is clearly larger than fig 8 for the cloud cavitation the re entrant jet is a major influence factor on the initial separation of the cloud cavity fig 10 shows the time history of the pressure and the frequency analysis result by using fast fourier transform at the point pcu for two models the amplitude in the frequency diagram is to be normalized by the dynamic pressure the strouhal number st of the first dominant frequency is 0 135 for the standard model and 0 159 for the modified model it is about 0 2 for the experiment by cervone et al 2006 the modified turbulence model could give the better result for cavity shedding frequencies in terms of the pressure pulsation the results show that the pressure drop just before the cavity collapse influences the whole cavity volume here it can be supposed that the pressure variation is effected by the turbulence characteristic directly or indirectly for this reason at that moment the vapor cavity on the hydrofoil is rapidly reproduced as shown in fig 9h which is distinguishable from fig 8g for the modified turbulence model the time interval from the last cavity collapse to the next inception is relatively short fig 10b the attached cavity is then gradually developed from the cavitation inception fig 8b and c and fig 9a and it increases the upstream pressure due to the drag and then the upstream pressure begins decreasing with evolving the re entrant jet the re entrant jet at the middle part of the hydrofoil is commonly faster than near the side wall figs 8d and 9b for the modified turbulence model the second dominant frequency of the pressure fluctuation has higher amplitude obviously as shown in fig 10 which shows the similar characteristic to experimental data fig 11 shows the amplitude spectra of pressure fluctuations over the hydrofoil with the strouhal number in this figure the first and second dominant frequencies at the point pt3 pt4 and pt5 are close to ones at the hydrofoil upstream ptu pcu and pbu for both two models it means that the variation of pressure at those points is governed by the cavity shedding meanwhile for the standard model the pressure pulsation at the point pt2 has the similar pattern to those points above mentioned whereas for the modified model the largest amplitude appears at the same point with the strouhal number of about 0 32 which corresponds to the second dominant frequency at the other points it means that there exists another influence factor from the position of the point pt2 the second dominant frequency at the hydrofoil upstream is supposed to be caused by the second re entrant jet it has presented that the second dominant frequency at the hydrofoil upstream may be relevant to the second re entrant jet for the cavitation number of 1 8 with the attack angle of 8 which is faster than the first re entrant jet around the naca0015 hydrofoil cervone et al 2006 sakoda et al 2001 for the standard turbulence model the second re entrant jet effect was not captured in the pressure pulsation 4 2 influence of turbulent viscosity model on the cavity shedding this section investigates the influence of the modeled turbulent viscosity on the cavity shedding with the simulation results of both the standard and modified turbulent viscosity models fig 12 and fig 13 show 2 d velocity vector without the spanwise component the vapor volume fraction and the mixture turbulent viscosity in a cycle at the center of the hydrofoil in figs 12 and 13 the flow characteristic seems to have almost no different between two models for a while before the re entrant jet begins to be developed near the vapor cavity the turbulent viscosity gradually increases while evolving the re entrant jet and until the cloud cavity collapsed in this process the turbulent viscosity becomes much larger than the modified model for the standard turbulence model the process of separating the vapor cavity demonstrates the effectiveness of the modified turbulence model in particular the velocity field near the vapor cavity is noticeable to be characterized by the different velocity gradient between two models for the modified model the re entrant jet inducing vortices is distinguishable from the wake flow disturbed by the attached cavity which mainly flows in the opposite direction over the hydrofoil the cloud cavity is separated by the re entrant jet from the attached vapor cavity finally the turbulent viscosity is much larger when the collapse of the cloud cavities and it could influence the cavitation inception in the next cycle however the strong turbulent viscosity is not to be suddenly produced at that moment from the present results it can be known that the standard rng k ε turbulence model has the numerical error for the cavity length in unsteady cloud cavitation due to the strong turbulent viscosity which is much overproduced especially after the re entrant jet begins to be developed 4 3 turbulence and unsteady cloud cavitation fig 14 shows the time history of flow characteristics such as the non dimensionalized pressure at the hydrofoil downstream the volume averaged vapor volume fraction and turbulent kinetic energy in the calculation domain they were obtained to investigate the correlation between cavitating flow and turbulence characteristics for the pressure pulsation the obvious pressure drop or rise appears more than two times per cycle due to the cavity destruction two results show the different tendencies in pressure pulsation after each cavity collapse the collapse of the cloud cavity induces large pressure change and strong turbulence as shown in figs 12 14 in fig 14 the vapor volume almost disappears after the cloud bubble collapsed at the downstream the large pressure change even influences the pressure field at the hydrofoil upstream as shown in fig 10 the vapor volume fraction in fig 14 shows that the attached cavity on the foil surface disappears rapidly with the last collapse almost simultaneously for the turbulence kinetic energy k it should be noted that the k for the non cavitating condition is much low relative to the cavitating condition it means that the strong k is almost produced by the cavitating flow for the cavitation number of 1 8 with the attack angle of 8 it increases gradually from the evolution of the re entrant jet to the cloud cavity collapse and then it continuously rises for a moment after the k begins to decrease the cavitation inception can be observed on the hydrofoil from figs 10 and 14 the change in pressure becomes stable for a moment after the collapse of the cloud cavity nevertheless the vapor cavity is not developed for a while until the k begins to decrease from fig 14 the turbulence kinetic energy is higher when increase than decrease in vaper volume fractions consequently it is demonstrated that the k increases largely in vapor condensation process relative to in evaporation the vapor volume fraction is inversely proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy in the cavitating flow therefore for the standard turbulence model the time interval from the cavity collapse to the next inception is longer than the modified turbulence model due to turbulent viscosity overproduced the strong turbulence delays the cavitation inception figs 8 and 9 5 conclusion the present paper suggested a modification of the turbulent viscosity model for improving the simulation of unsteady turbulent cavitating flows with two equation turbulence model this modification approach is that the turbulent viscosity overestimated by the two equation turbulence model during cavitation is mainly in the surrounding flow field of the vapor cavity the turbulent viscosity in the standard rng k ε turbulence model was modified by the function of the local pressure based on the barotropic state law this model was verified by the unsteady cavitation simulation with a 3 d naca0015 hydrofoil and the simulation result agreed well with experimental data from the characteristic of kinematic viscosity in the mixture it was figured out that the strong turbulence is mainly produced in vapor condensation than in evaporation and it was demonstrated by the simulation results for the standard turbulence model the numerical error for the cavity length was due to the strong turbulence which was much overestimated after the re entrant jet generated the strong turbulence influenced the process of separating vapor cavities it was described by the results of unsteady shedding behaviors the total vapor volume in the cavity shedding was adversely proportional to the turbulence kinetic energy for this reason the strong turbulence delayed the cavitation inception in the next cycle the

surge in the arabian sea could also be applied to simulate this type of events at other sites around the world keywords cyclone chapala arabian sea numerical modelling cyclones extreme waves storm surge natural hazards port development 1 introduction 1 1 formation of cyclones tropical cyclones are associated with warm and moist air and hence they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator the warm and moist air rises causing an area of lower pressure beneath cooler air moves into the lower pressure area and becomes warm and moist and also rises when the warm and moist air rises it cools down and forms clouds the whole system of clouds and winds spins and grows and is fed by the oceans heat and evaporated water cyclones require ocean temperatures of at least 26 5 c for their formation and growth through a relatively deep layer 50 m cyclones that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise whereas cyclones south of the equator spin clockwise due to the difference in earth s rotation on its axis cyclones are therefore associated with steep pressure gradients and consequently generate strong winds and storm surges the destruction from a tropical cyclone depends on its intensity size and location cyclones generate high winds waves water levels surge and are associated with intense rainfall 1 2 impact of cyclones the strong winds generated during a cyclone may damage installations dwellings transportation and communication systems and lead to fires resulting in considerable loss of life damage to properties and ecosystems destruction of transportation or communication infrastructure hampers clean up and rescue efforts heavy and prolonged rains associated with cyclones can cause floods of low lying areas and can lead to mudslides and landslides causing loss of life and property floods standing water and coastal inundation due to storm surges pollute drinking water sources and spread diseases leading to outbreak of epidemics cyclones also cause secondary damages such as damages by floating debris drifted timbers and vessels sediment erosion and deposition and spreading of fire the generation of large waves and high water levels can result in damage to coastal and offshore structures including ports oil terminals jetties offshore exploratory drilling rigs offshore oil extraction rigs and various other coastal and marine structures and facilities such as revetments seawalls quay walls dykes piers breakwaters ferry terminals and vessels these conditions can also result in significant erosion of the shoreline and sea bed during the last two centuries cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1 9 million people worldwide wikipedia 2017a it is estimated that 10 000 people per year perish due to tropical cyclones wikipedia 2017a for example bangladesh is especially vulnerable to tropical cyclones with around 718 000 deaths from them in the past 50 years haque et al 2012 the deadliest tropical cyclone in bangladesh was the 1970 bhola cyclone which had a death toll of somewhere from 300 000 to 500 000 lives wikipedia 2017a despite their devastating effects cyclones are essential features of the earth s atmosphere as they bring rain to dry areas and transfer heat and energy between the equator and the cooler regions nearer the poles 1 3 cyclones in the arabian sea rhdhv has carried out literature searches on cyclones in the arabian sea from which over 30 major cyclones have been identified since 1945 cyclone chapala 28 october 4 november 2015 was found to be the second strongest cyclone after

on record to strike the nation of yemen as less information is available on cyclone chapala this paper has concentrated on this event to illustrate the use of numerical modelling to simulate waves and surge generated by cyclones a large tidal hydrodynamic model is required to simulate cyclone surge on a region and a large wave model to simulate cyclone waves given the above risks rhdhv has set up regional tidal hydrodynamic and wave models covering the arabian sea to support their project work in the region the models have been used on a number of projects to assess cyclones within this region the mike21 model suite has been used for these studies sample results of waves and surge from the modelling studies are presented in this paper for illustration purposes only the model could be used to simulate the passage of a cyclone anywhere within the arabian sea the methodology described in this paper for modelling cyclone waves and surge in the arabian sea could also be applied to simulate this type of events at other sites around the world 2 major cyclones in the arabian sea cyclones occur relatively frequently in the arabian sea usually during the transition periods of the monsoons

based joint typhoon warning center jtwc cyclone chapala 2015 was the second strongest cyclone on record in the arabian sea after cyclone gonu in 2007 the cyclone developed on 28 october 2015 off western india from the monsoon trough and was the third named storm of the 2015 north indian ocean cyclone season the storm developed an eye in the center of a well defined circular area of deep convection by 30 october and on that day the imd estimated peak 3 min sustained winds of 215 km h 130 mph and the jtwc estimated 1 min winds of 240 km h 150 mph wikipedia 2017c after its peak intensity the cyclone skirted the yemeni island of socotra on 1 november becoming the first cyclone force storm there since 1922 chapala maintained much of its intensity upon entering the gulf of aden on 2 november becoming the strongest known cyclone in that water body the cyclone made landfall near al mukalla in central yemeni coast as a very severe cyclonic storm early on 3 november making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation all the above information on cyclone chapala was obtained from wikipedia 2017c 3 2 track and data of cyclone chapala the track route of cyclone chapala was obtained from the weather channel 2017 and is shown in fig 2 the cyclone data was obtained from the india meteorological department imd imd 2017 imd archived cyclone data contains 3 hourly information including date and time tracks cyclone path as latitude and longitude estimated central pressures maximum sustained surface wind speeds pressure drop and grade the 3 min mean wind speeds from imd were converted to 1 hourly wind speed using the method described in shore protection manual 1984 the imd dataset does not provide the radius of maximum wind speed for cyclone chapala therefore it was estimated from the relationship between maximum wind speed and radius of maximum wind derived for major cyclones in the arabian sea from the jtwc data the data used to model cyclone chapala is provided in table 2 it should be noted that the maximum wind speeds in table 2 are now 1 hourly mean 4 wind and pressure fields generation the mike21 cyclone wind generation tool of dhi dhi 2016a was used to generate the cyclonic wind and pressure fields of cyclone chapala the tool allows users to compute wind and pressure data due to tropical cyclone hurricane or typhoon several cyclone parametric models are included in the dhi tool including the young and sobey model 1981 holland single vortex model 1981 holland double vortex model 1980 and rankine vortex model dhi 2016a all the six input parameters required by the young and sobey model i e time track radius of maximum wind speed maximum wind speed central pressure and neutral pressure were available in the table above and this was therefore used to generate the cyclonic wind and pressure fields the other models require additional parameters such as holland parameter b and rankine parameter x which need to be calculated using empirical relationships this adds further uncertainty in the generated wind and pressure fields and these models were therefore not used fig 3 shows an example of wind and pressure fields of cyclone chapala on 30 10 2015 19 00 00 when it generated the maximum wave heights these wind and pressure fields were used to drive the cyclone wave and surge models described later 5 arabian sea regional models set up by rhdhv 5 1 the regional tidal model rhdhv has set up a two dimensional regional tidal hydrodynamic model for the arabian sea using the mike21 3 flow model fm software of dhi dhi 2016b the model is based on the numerical solution of the two three dimensional shallow water incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations invoking the assumptions of boussinesq and of hydrostatic pressure thus the model consists of continuity momentum temperature salinity and density equations the regional model covers the coastlines of eight countries i e india pakistan iran uae oman yemen somalia and djibouti see fig 4 the model has three open boundaries one to the south to indian ocean one to the north west to arabian gulf and the other to the south west to red sea unstructured flexible mesh was used in the study the model bathymetry is shown in fig 4 was obtained from the c map global database c map 2014 this regional tidal model was used to derive cyclone surge in the study 5 2 the regional wave model rhdhv has also set up a two dimensional regional wave model for the arabian sea using the mike21 spectral wave sw software of dhi dhi 2016c the model considers various physical phenomena for example wave growth by action of wind non linear wave wave interaction dissipation due to white capping dissipation due to bottom friction dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking wave diffraction wave refraction wave shoaling and wave current interaction the fully spectral formulation of the model is based on the wave action conservation equation where the directional frequency wave action spectrum is the dependent variable the model extent mesh system and bathymetry are the same as the regional tidal hydrodynamic model described above this regional wave model was used to derive cyclone wave conditions in the study 6 cyclone chapala wave modelling 6 1 the model the regional wave model set up by rhdhv based on the mike21 spectral wave sw model was used to simulate the generation and propagation of cyclone waves the fully spectral formulation was used with in stationary time formulation the higher order numerical scheme was used in the study to improve accuracy in model results wave diffraction wave breaking bottom friction and white capping were included in the model simulations quadruplet wave interaction was also included in the simulations jonswap fetch growth empirical spectral formulation was used unstructured flexible mesh was used in the model 6 2 methodology the cyclone wave model was driven by the wind and pressure fields as shown in fig 3 a constant water level of 2 6 m was used in the model the model simulations covered the entire passage of the cyclone across the arabian sea 6 3 model validation the regional model has been validated against data available on cyclone gonu 2007 and cyclone phet 2010 the model was run for these two events and wave heights periods and directions extracted at selected locations these were compared to those obtained from various sources to validate the model and thereby to improve confidence in model predictions for cyclone chapala the model validation was also described in sarker and sleigh 2015 by sarker and sleigh 2015 and in sarker 2016 by sarker 2016 6 3 1 comparison for cyclone gonu 2007 cyclone gonu 2007 is the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the arabian sea it is also the strongest named cyclone in the northern indian ocean gonu developed on 01 june 2007 and rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235 km h 145 mph on 04 june gonu made landfall early on 06 june on the easternmost tip of oman becoming the strongest cyclone to hit the arabian peninsula it then turned northward into the gulf of oman and dissipated on 07 june after making landfall in southern iran which was the first landfall in the country since 1898 the cyclone caused 50 deaths and about 4 2 billion in damage in oman where the cyclone was considered the nation s worst natural disaster the cyclone caused 28 deaths and 216 million in damage in iran the above information on cyclone gonu was obtained from wikipedia 2017d most of the available wave information was for cyclone gonu 2007 and therefore the model validation was focused primarily to this cyclone table 3 compares the model prediction with those from the oman meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 and the world meteorological organization wmo world meteorological organisation 2009 table 3 compares the model results with those from other sources the modelled wave heights at chabahar and in the gulf of oman compared well with those reported by wmo however the modelled wave heights in the arabian sea are higher than those reported by wmo similarly the modelled wave heights in the arabian sea are higher than those reported by the omani meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 however the range of significant wave heights is rather wide 6 12 m although there are some differences in wave heights reported by other organisations it is concluded that there is reasonable agreement in the pattern and magnitude of waves particularly in the coastal zone 6 3 2 comparison for cyclone phet 2010 cyclone phet 2010 was a powerful cyclone that made landfall on oman and pakistan phet developed in the arabian sea on 31 may 2010 to the west of india the cyclone intensified to reach peak sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph on 02 june there were 24 fatalities in oman and damage was estimated at us 780 million after exiting oman on 04 june phet turned to the northeast and later to the east while continuing to weaken on june 6 phet made landfall in pakistan near karachi the cyclone killed 16 people and left 81 million in damage across pakistan phet continued into western india where it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area it killed five people in india the above information on cyclone phet was obtained from wikipedia 2017e limited information was obtained on cyclone phet 2010 from literature search significant wave heights in the gulf of oman and the arabian sea were obtained from the oman meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 table 4 compares the model prediction with those from the above sources it was found that the modelled wave heights in the gulf of oman were similar to those reported by the omani meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 however in the arabian sea the modelled wave heights are significantly higher than those reported by the omani meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 although less useful as a validation exercise in large part because of the lack of data on cyclone phet the results indicate that there is reasonable agreement within the gulf of oman 6 4 model results and discussions the model results for cyclone chapala indicate that the maximum hindcast significant wave height hm0 of approximately 19 m with associated peak wave period of 14 0 s was found at a location of 60 6 e 14 1 n on 30 october 2015 19 00 00 the two dimensional distribution of wave height contours superimposed by wave directional vectors is shown in fig 5 for this time step the figure indicates that the maximum wave heights were generated far offshore in the middle of the arabian sea the temporal variation in significant wave height and peak wave period at this location is shown in fig 6 the figure indicates that significant wave heights higher than 10 m were sustained for approximately 1 7 days and wave heights higher than 15 m were sustained for approximately one day further statistical analyses of model results were carried out using the mike21 tool to derive mean and maximum wave conditions over the arabian sea during of cyclone chapala these results are shown in fig 7 fig 8 shows the locations and bed levels of selected points points 1 to 45 along the cyclone track where model results were extracted and shown in fig 9 model results shown in fig 9 were reproduced in fig 10 to provide clearer comparison of wave heights at various points along the cyclone track the modelling results for cyclone chapala indicate that it was a major event that generated waves up to 19 m at the height of the storm the storm took a westerly track and travelled into the gulf of aden resulting in high waves off the yemen coast the westerly passage of the cyclone meant that the impact on the oman coast was limited with conditions less severe than during cyclones gonu and phet the results indicate that the impact of the cyclone was greatest along the coast approximately 100 km north of the landfall site and that the zone of major impact extended over a distance of approximately 200 km north and south of the landfall location 7 cyclone chapala surge modelling in addition to larger waves cyclones also generate storm surges which are abnormal rises or falls of sea level near the coast storm surges can result in major inundation of low lying coastal areas 7 1 the model the regional tidal hydrodynamic model set up by rhdhv based on the mike21 3 flow model fm was used to simulate cyclone surges the higher order numerical scheme was used in the study to improve accuracy in model results standard flood and dry were included in the model to consider flooding and drying processes barotropic density type and smagorinsky eddy viscosity type were used coriolis forcing was included in the model as varying in domain a constant bed resistance as manning s number n 1 44 m1 3 s was used throughout the model domain unstructured flexible mesh was used in the model 7 2 methodology the cyclone surge model was driven by the cyclonic wind and pressure fields as shown in fig 3 a constant water level of 2 6 m was imposed at the three open boundaries at the south north west and south west an initial water level of 2 6 m was maintained over the entire model domain 7 3 model validation limited data on storm surge along the coastlines was available to carry out model validation the following quantitative data has been extracted on storm surges from literature search and previous project work carried out by rhdhv in the region a the 1 in 100 year storm surge as 0 2 m for a project site south of the duqm port in oman b the surge at fujairah in oman did not exceed 0 5 m during the cyclone gonu 2007 c qualitative information found from a literature search suggests that the storm surges particularly along the southern omani coastline are not large model runs for cyclone phet 2010 predicted maximum surges of 0 4 m this is of the same order as the data discussed above suggesting that the surge model would provide a reasonable prediction of storm surges in the arabian sea the model validation was also described in sarker and sleigh 2015 by sarker and sleigh 2015 and in sarker 2016 by sarker 2016 7 4 model results and discussions statistical analyses of model results were carried out using the mike21 tool to derive mean and maximum surge values over the arabian sea during cyclone chapala fig 11 zoomed in view shows the maximum positive surge values rise in water level during the cyclone the figure indicates that the highest positive surges occurred close to the cyclone track and in the confined waters of the gulf of aden the maximum positive surge was extracted from fig 11 at points along the cyclone track and these are presented in fig 12 the horizontal axis in this figure shows the selected locations along the track a total of 45 points as illustrated in fig 8 and the vertical axis shows the maximum positive surge value at these points the temporal variation of surge at the location of the highest surge point 23 during the cyclone is shown in fig 13 the maximum surge of approximately 0 74 m was found on 31 october 2015 06 00 00 therefore the highest surge and the maximum significant wave height occurred 11 h apart albeit at slightly different locations the figure indicates that surges higher than 0 3 m were sustained for duration of about 6 75 h and surges higher than 0 5 m were sustained for duration of about 4 0 h a time series plot of surge along the yemeni coast is shown in fig 14 the figure shows a maximum surge of 0 64 m attained on 30 10 2015 18 30 00 cyclones can also result in negative surges which can affect the operation of coastal facilities and ports a statistical analysis of model results was therefore carried out using the mike21 tool to derive the maximum negative surge values over the arabian sea during cyclone chapala the results are shown in fig 15 zoomed in view from which it can be seen that the largest negative surge of approximately 0 60 m negative surge occurred in the gulf of aden the maximum positive surge was found along the track of the cyclone in the deep water offshore from the coast where the intensity of the cyclone was the highest the cyclone thereafter weakened resulting to lower surge in the gulf of aden within the gulf of aden higher positive surge was found at the western end of the gulf near djibouti possibly due to funneling effects resulting from the narrow body of water the highest negative surge was also found in this end of the gulf 8 uncertainties in modelling results an unstructured flexible mesh was used in the modelling which fits better with a curved coastline and also allowed smaller grids in the areas of higher importance to obtain better accuracy in model results a variable mesh size distribution as required was maintained with smooth transition between two mesh sizes to obtain accuracy in model results bathymetry is a major input parameter to the model which was obtained from c map database the accuracy of this data is the same as if extracted directly from admiralty chart data at the various scales available admiralty chart data is based on surveys carried out in the past and some changes in the seabed particularly at shallow waters are expected over time therefore there are uncertainties in model results in shallow waters due to expected seabed changes over time however the model results were extracted at deep waters and hence no effect of discrepancy in bathymetry data is expected on the tidal modelling it is important that the regional circulations are understood so that these are captured within the model including the effect of the coriolis force into a tidal model is also important widely accepted and commonly used values of wave breaking parameter bed friction and white capping were used in the wave modelling there are always some uncertainties in the wind input although careful measures were taken to derive the wind conditions it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty resulting from these input parameters however rhdhv previous experience suggests that the error will not be significant a numerical model is developed based on various assumptions although the mike21 developer dhi carried out calibration and validation as part of the development process local site specific calibration and validation are required before applying the model good quality measured data are required for model calibration and validation which were not available for the modelling presented in the paper however some measured data were obtained from public domain which was used calibrate validate the models furthermore model results were extracted in deep water and hence no major errors are expected in the model results although there are various uncertainties numerical models are considered useful tools by researchers and practitioners 9 findings and conclusions this paper illustrates how tidal hydrodynamic and wave models can be used to simulate the impacts of cyclones on coastal developments facilities and communities for cyclone chapala maximum significant wave heights were found along the path of the cyclone in deep water east of gulf of aden where the intensity of the event was the highest maximum significant wave heights gradually reduced westward as the cyclone weakened and entered the mouth of gulf of aden maximum positive surge was also found along the cyclone path in the deep water offshore from the coast where the intensity of the cyclone was high the cyclone thereafter weakened resulting to lower surge in the gulf of aden within the gulf of aden higher positive surge was found at western end of the gulf near djibouti due to funneling effects in the narrow body of water resulting from narrowing down of the water body higher negative surge was also found at this location the findings from the modelling of cyclone chapala are summarised below 1 the maximum significant wave height of approximately 19 m with associated peak wave period of 14 0 s was generated offshore in the deep waters of the arabian sea 2 significant wave heights higher than 10 m were sustained for duration of about 1 7 days and wave heights higher than 15 m were sustained for duration of about one day 3 the higher positive surges occurred close to the cyclone track as well as in the gulf of aden 4 the highest positive surge value of approximately 0 74 m was generated offshore in the deep waters of the arabian sea 5 the highest positive surge and the maximum significant wave height occurred 11 h apart albeit at slightly different locations 6 surges higher than 0 3 m were sustained for duration of about 6 75 h and surges higher than 0 5 m were sustained for duration of about 4 0 h and 7 approximately 0 60 m negative surge occurred at the western end of the gulf of aden the methodology described in this paper for modelling cyclone waves

23406,cyclones cause significant loss of life and damage to properties ecosystems and marine structures and facilities cyclone modelling results are used for deriving robust design conditions for coastal and marine structures and facilities the results are also used for emergency planning and decision making to estimate potential loss of life damage to properties and marine facilities and to develop rescue and mitigation measures and plan clean up operations royal haskoningdhv hereafter rhdhv has set up regional tidal hydrodynamic and wave models covering the arabian sea to provide data to address the above issues over the course of a number of studies a total of 30 major cyclones have been identified in the arabian sea since 1945 cyclone chapala 28 october 4 november 2015 was found to be the second strongest cyclone event since 1945 the strongest being cyclone gonu in 2007 as less information is available on cyclone chapala this paper has concentrated on this event to illustrate the use of numerical modelling to simulate waves and surge generated by cyclones the mike21 model suite has been used to investigate this cyclone and sample results from the wave and surge modelling are presented in this paper for illustration purposes the models could be used to simulate any cyclone generated within the arabian sea the methodology described in this paper for modelling waves and surge in the arabian sea could also be applied to simulate this type of events at other sites around the world keywords cyclone chapala arabian sea numerical modelling cyclones extreme waves storm surge natural hazards port development 1 introduction 1 1 formation of cyclones tropical cyclones are associated with warm and moist air and hence they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator the warm and moist air rises causing an area of lower pressure beneath cooler air moves into the lower pressure area and becomes warm and moist and also rises when the warm and moist air rises it cools down and forms clouds the whole system of clouds and winds spins and grows and is fed by the oceans heat and evaporated water cyclones require ocean temperatures of at least 26 5 c for their formation and growth through a relatively deep layer 50 m cyclones that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise whereas cyclones south of the equator spin clockwise due to the difference in earth s rotation on its axis cyclones are therefore associated with steep pressure gradients and consequently generate strong winds and storm surges the destruction from a tropical cyclone depends on its intensity size and location cyclones generate high winds waves water levels surge and are associated with intense rainfall 1 2 impact of cyclones the strong winds generated during a cyclone may damage installations dwellings transportation and communication systems and lead to fires resulting in considerable loss of life damage to properties and ecosystems destruction of transportation or communication infrastructure hampers clean up and rescue efforts heavy and prolonged rains associated with cyclones can cause floods of low lying areas and can lead to mudslides and landslides causing loss of life and property floods standing water and coastal inundation due to storm surges pollute drinking water sources and spread diseases leading to outbreak of epidemics cyclones also cause secondary damages such as damages by floating debris drifted timbers and vessels sediment erosion and deposition and spreading of fire the generation of large waves and high water levels can result in damage to coastal and offshore structures including ports oil terminals jetties offshore exploratory drilling rigs offshore oil extraction rigs and various other coastal and marine structures and facilities such as revetments seawalls quay walls dykes piers breakwaters ferry terminals and vessels these conditions can also result in significant erosion of the shoreline and sea bed during the last two centuries cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1 9 million people worldwide wikipedia 2017a it is estimated that 10 000 people per year perish due to tropical cyclones wikipedia 2017a for example bangladesh is especially vulnerable to tropical cyclones with around 718 000 deaths from them in the past 50 years haque et al 2012 the deadliest tropical cyclone in bangladesh was the 1970 bhola cyclone which had a death toll of somewhere from 300 000 to 500 000 lives wikipedia 2017a despite their devastating effects cyclones are essential features of the earth s atmosphere as they bring rain to dry areas and transfer heat and energy between the equator and the cooler regions nearer the poles 1 3 cyclones in the arabian sea rhdhv has carried out literature searches on cyclones in the arabian sea from which over 30 major cyclones have been identified since 1945 cyclone chapala 28 october 4 november 2015 was found to be the second strongest cyclone after cyclone gonu in 2007 in the arabian sea since 1945 the first cyclone force storm to hit the yemeni island of socotra since 1922 the strongest known cyclone in the gulf of aden and the strongest storm on record to strike the nation of yemen as less information is available on cyclone chapala this paper has concentrated on this event to illustrate the use of numerical modelling to simulate waves and surge generated by cyclones a large tidal hydrodynamic model is required to simulate cyclone surge on a region and a large wave model to simulate cyclone waves given the above risks rhdhv has set up regional tidal hydrodynamic and wave models covering the arabian sea to support their project work in the region the models have been used on a number of projects to assess cyclones within this region the mike21 model suite has been used for these studies sample results of waves and surge from the modelling studies are presented in this paper for illustration purposes only the model could be used to simulate the passage of a cyclone anywhere within the arabian sea the methodology described in this paper for modelling cyclone waves and surge in the arabian sea could also be applied to simulate this type of events at other sites around the world 2 major cyclones in the arabian sea cyclones occur relatively frequently in the arabian sea usually during the transition periods of the monsoons which are between may and june and between october and november a cumulative track map of cyclones in the arabian sea from 1970 to 2005 is shown in fig 1 wikipedia 2017b a total of 20 major cyclones have crossed the arabian sea since 1977 and affected the arabian peninsula particularly the omani coastline tracks and pressure fields of these cyclones except cyclone chapala were obtained from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc usa jtwc 2017 the jtwc archived cyclone data also contains 6 hourly information including date and time tracks path maximum sustained wind speeds radius of maximum

convection by 30 october and on that day the imd estimated peak 3 min sustained winds of 215 km h 130 mph and the jtwc estimated 1 min winds of 240 km h 150 mph wikipedia 2017c after its peak intensity the cyclone skirted the yemeni island of socotra on 1 november becoming the first cyclone force storm there since 1922 chapala maintained much of its intensity upon entering the gulf of aden on 2 november becoming the strongest known cyclone in that water body the cyclone made landfall near al mukalla in central yemeni coast as a very severe cyclonic storm early on 3 november making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation all the above information on cyclone chapala was obtained from wikipedia 2017c 3 2 track and data of cyclone chapala the track route of cyclone

cyclone intensified to reach peak sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph on 02 june there were 24 fatalities in oman and damage was estimated at us 780 million after exiting oman on 04 june phet turned to the northeast and later to the east while continuing to weaken on june 6 phet made landfall in pakistan near karachi the cyclone killed 16 people and left 81 million in damage across pakistan phet continued into western india where it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area it killed five people in india the above information on cyclone phet was obtained from wikipedia 2017e limited information was obtained on cyclone phet 2010 from literature search significant wave heights in the gulf of oman and the arabian sea were obtained from the oman meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 table 4 compares the model prediction with those from the above sources it was found that the modelled wave heights in the gulf of oman were similar to those reported by the omani meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 however in the arabian sea the modelled wave heights are significantly higher than those reported by the omani meteorological office oman meteorological office 2010 although less useful as a validation exercise in large part because of the lack of data on cyclone phet the results indicate that there is reasonable agreement within the gulf of oman 6 4 model results and discussions the model results for cyclone chapala indicate that the maximum hindcast significant wave height hm0 of approximately 19 m with associated peak wave period of 14 0 s was found at a location of 60 6 e 14 1 n on 30 october 2015 19 00 00 the two dimensional distribution of wave height contours superimposed by wave directional vectors is shown in fig 5 for this time step the figure indicates that the maximum wave heights were generated far offshore in the middle of the arabian sea the temporal variation in significant wave height and peak wave period at this location is shown in fig 6 the figure indicates that significant wave heights higher than 10 m were sustained for approximately 1 7 days and wave heights higher than 15 m were sustained for approximately one day further statistical analyses of model results were carried out using the mike21 tool to derive mean and maximum wave conditions over the arabian sea during of cyclone chapala these results are shown in fig 7 fig 8 shows the locations and bed levels of selected points points 1 to 45 along the cyclone track where model results were extracted and shown in fig 9 model results shown in fig 9 were reproduced in fig 10 to provide clearer comparison of wave heights at various points along the cyclone track the modelling results for cyclone chapala indicate that it was a major event that generated waves up to 19 m at the height of the storm the storm took a westerly track and travelled into the gulf of aden resulting in high waves off the yemen coast the westerly passage of the cyclone meant that the impact on the oman coast was limited with conditions less severe than during cyclones gonu and phet the results indicate that the impact of the cyclone was greatest along the coast approximately 100 km north of the landfall site and that the zone of major impact extended over a distance of approximately 200 km north and south of the landfall location 7 cyclone chapala surge modelling in addition to larger waves cyclones also generate storm surges which are abnormal rises or falls of sea level near the coast storm surges can result in major inundation of low lying coastal areas 7 1 the model the regional tidal hydrodynamic model set up by rhdhv based on the mike21 3 flow model fm was used to simulate cyclone surges the higher order numerical scheme was used in the study to improve accuracy in model results standard flood and dry were included in the model to consider flooding and drying processes barotropic density type and smagorinsky eddy viscosity type were used coriolis forcing was included in the model as varying in domain a constant bed resistance as manning s number n 1 44 m1 3 s was used throughout the model domain unstructured flexible mesh was used in the model 7 2 methodology the cyclone surge model was driven by the cyclonic wind and pressure fields as shown in fig 3 a constant water level of 2 6 m was imposed at the three open boundaries at the south north west and south west an initial water level of 2 6 m was maintained over the entire model domain 7 3 model validation limited data on storm surge along the coastlines was available to carry out model validation the following quantitative data has been extracted on storm surges from literature search and previous project work carried out by rhdhv in the region a the 1 in 100 year storm surge as 0 2 m for a project site south of the duqm port in oman b the surge at fujairah in oman did not exceed 0 5 m during the cyclone gonu 2007 c qualitative information found from a literature search suggests that the storm surges particularly along the southern omani coastline are not large model runs for cyclone phet 2010 predicted maximum surges of 0 4 m this is of the same order as the data discussed above suggesting that the surge model would provide a reasonable prediction of storm surges in the arabian sea the model validation was also described in sarker and sleigh 2015 by sarker and sleigh 2015 and in sarker 2016 by sarker 2016 7 4 model results and discussions statistical analyses of model results were carried out using the mike21 tool to derive mean and maximum surge values over the arabian sea during cyclone chapala fig 11 zoomed in view shows the maximum positive surge values rise in water level during the cyclone the figure indicates that the highest positive surges occurred close to the cyclone track and in the confined waters of the gulf of aden the maximum positive surge was extracted from fig 11 at points along the cyclone track and these are presented in fig 12 the horizontal axis in this figure shows the selected locations along the track a total of 45 points as illustrated in fig 8 and the vertical axis shows the maximum positive surge value at these points the temporal variation of surge at the location of the highest surge point 23 during the cyclone is shown in fig 13 the maximum surge of approximately 0 74 m was found on 31 october 2015 06 00 00 therefore the highest surge and the maximum significant wave height occurred 11 h apart albeit at slightly different locations the figure indicates that surges higher than 0 3 m were sustained for duration of about 6 75 h and surges higher than 0 5 m were sustained for duration of about 4 0 h a time series plot of surge along the yemeni coast is shown in fig 14 the figure shows a maximum surge of 0 64 m attained on 30 10 2015 18 30 00 cyclones can also result in negative surges which can affect the operation of coastal facilities and ports a statistical analysis of model results was therefore carried out using the mike21 tool to derive the maximum negative surge values over the arabian sea during cyclone chapala the results are shown in fig 15 zoomed in view from which it can be seen that the largest negative surge of approximately 0 60 m negative surge occurred in the gulf of aden the maximum positive surge was found along the track of the cyclone in the deep water offshore from the coast where the intensity of the cyclone was the highest the cyclone thereafter weakened resulting to lower surge in the gulf of aden within the gulf of aden higher positive surge was found at the western end of the gulf near djibouti possibly due to funneling effects resulting from the narrow body of water the highest negative surge was also found in this end of the gulf 8 uncertainties in modelling results an unstructured flexible mesh was used in the modelling which fits better with a curved coastline and also allowed smaller grids in the areas of higher importance to obtain better accuracy in model results a variable mesh size distribution as required was maintained with smooth transition between two mesh sizes to obtain accuracy in model results bathymetry is a major input parameter to the model which was obtained from c map database the accuracy of this data is the same as if extracted directly from admiralty chart data at the various scales available admiralty chart data is based on surveys carried out in the past and some changes in the seabed particularly at shallow waters are expected over time therefore there are uncertainties in model results in shallow waters due to expected seabed changes over time however the model results were extracted at deep waters and hence no effect of discrepancy in bathymetry data is expected on the tidal modelling it is important that the regional circulations are understood so that these are captured within the model including the effect of the coriolis force into a tidal model is also important widely accepted and commonly used values of wave breaking parameter bed friction and white capping were used in the wave modelling there are always some uncertainties in the wind input although careful measures were taken to derive the wind conditions it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty resulting from these input parameters however rhdhv previous experience suggests that the error will not be significant a numerical model is developed based on various assumptions although the mike21 developer dhi carried out calibration and validation as part of the development process local site specific calibration and validation are required before applying the model good quality measured data are required for model calibration and validation which were not available for the modelling presented in the paper however some measured data were obtained from public domain which was used calibrate validate the models furthermore model results were extracted in deep water and hence no major errors are expected in the model results although there are various uncertainties numerical models are considered useful tools by researchers and practitioners 9 findings and conclusions this paper illustrates how tidal hydrodynamic and wave models can be used to simulate the impacts of cyclones on coastal developments facilities and communities for cyclone chapala maximum significant wave heights were found along the path of the cyclone in deep water east of gulf of aden where the intensity of the event was the highest maximum significant wave heights gradually reduced westward as the cyclone weakened and entered the mouth of gulf of aden maximum positive surge was also found along the cyclone path in the deep water offshore from the coast where the intensity of the cyclone was high the cyclone thereafter weakened resulting to lower surge in the gulf of aden within the gulf of aden higher positive surge was found at western end of the gulf near djibouti due to funneling effects in the narrow body of water resulting from narrowing down of the water body higher negative surge was also found at this location the findings from the modelling of cyclone chapala are summarised below 1 the maximum significant wave height of approximately 19 m with associated peak wave period of 14 0 s was generated offshore in the deep waters of the arabian sea 2 significant wave heights higher than 10 m were sustained for duration of about 1 7 days and wave heights higher than 15 m were sustained for duration of about one day 3 the higher positive surges occurred close to the cyclone track as well as in the gulf of aden 4 the highest positive surge value of approximately 0 74 m was generated offshore in the deep waters of the arabian sea 5 the highest positive surge and the maximum significant wave height occurred 11 h apart albeit at slightly different locations 6 surges higher than 0 3 m were sustained for duration of about 6 75 h and surges higher than 0 5 m were sustained for duration of about 4 0 h and 7 approximately 0 60 m negative surge occurred at the western end of the gulf of aden the methodology described in this paper for modelling cyclone waves

23407,asymmetric impacting phenomenon is quite common for the sailing ship when it encounters oblique waves the asymmetrical water entry problem of a full scale bow flared section from ultra large container ship ulcs was investigated using cfd method in commercial code fluent a two phase flow model was established based on n s equations which were discretized through the finite volume method and the free surface was captured by vof model the body motion was achieved in the dynamic mesh model with prescribed dynamic boundary condition the impacting forces were obtained through direct numerical integration on the body surface the validation and convergence were carried out through comparing experimental data and other numerical methods in already published literature two kinds of asymmetry heel angle as geometrical asymmetry and horizontal velocity as the kinematic asymmetry were comprehensively considered in numerical simulation and significant attention is given into the discussion of their effects on impacting hydrodynamics including pile up water pressure and slamming forces the results show the geometrical asymmetry is important on these hydrodynamics if the flow separation does not happen otherwise the kinematic asymmetry can significantly influence pile up water form and further determines the pressure and slamming forces keywords cfd asymmetric impacting bow flared section flow separation 1 introduction slamming phenomenon occurs frequently when the ship sails in rough seas with a high speed enormous slamming loads can cause structural damage and even threaten the mariners personal safety in some oblique wave cases asymmetric impacting phenomenon will occur due to the free motion of ship when the ship bow exits water and then re enters into water this impacting phenomenon may result in greater slamming loads than the case in the head sea due to the decrease of the effective impacting angle in fact such an asymmetric case is more common for the ship which sails in actual marine environment massive studies on the water entry problem of symmetric cases have been done an analytical solution was firstly put forward by von karman 1929 based on the momentum theory in his study the concept of added mass was introduced and the pile up water was ignored later wagner 1932 improved this solution by considering the effect of pile up water in his theory the rather panel assumption was used and the results are closer to the corresponding experimental data however there exists a singularity at the edge of the panel to avoid this dilemma watanabe 1986 adopted a matched asymptotic approach by introducing the inner domain most early theoretical researches focused on the pressure peaks and paid less attention on the characteristics of time such a situation causes some inconveniences for the analysis of structural dynamic response dobrovol skaya 1969 developed a similarity solution for the water entry problem of wedges through supposing the flow is self similarity in the water entry process where the time information can be considered wu et al 2004 extended it to the free drop case an auxiliary function was introduced to uncouple the acceleration and flow field the excellent agreement of acceleration is achieved between the numerical and experimental results although the self similar theory is further extended to an expanding paraboloid in wu and sun 2014 the similarity solution is hard to obtain for complex flow form such as flow separation and ventilation on the other hand some researchers begin to concern on the cases of ship like section to satisfy the requirements of marine engineering zhao and faltinsen 1993 solved the water entry problems of arbitrarily section using a fully nonlinear boundary element method the thin jet flow was dealt by using the numerical truncation to avoid the divergence in time stepping later the fully nonlinear numerical method is applied to the case with flow separation in zhao et al 1996 a joint point of body and free surface was introduced to approximate the jet flow and the effect of flow separation from knuckles or fixed separation points was incorporated by the kutta condition for the pressure distribution good agreement between theory and experiments is documented at an early stage of the water entry the differences are larger at a later stage but this is mainly due to three dimensional effects in the experiments the analysis shows that the three dimensional effect causes 8 reduction of the force relative to the two dimensional force when the spray roots of the jets reached the knuckles only some researchers focus on the asymmetric cases even if it is more common in the ocean engineering field according to the survey of howison et al 2004 garabedian 1953 firstly put forward the model of asymmetric wedge based on the potential flow theory later some scholars did some improved work such as korobkin 1988 and toyama 1993 iafrati 2000 used a boundary element method to predict the elevation of free surface and pressure distribution of an asymmetric wedge similar work can be found in semenov and iafrati 2006 in there this problem was solved by mapping the complex velocity potential the flow form is stilled supposed as self similar which limits the further development in aspect of the nom similar flow form wang et al 2008 adopted a boundary element method to solve the complex velocity potential this method is extended to other water entry cases such as free fall motion of asymmetrical wedge in xu et al 2010 and asymmetrical bow flare ship section in sun and faltinsen 2009 however some complex flow forms are not incarnated in these studies such as flow separation and ventilation which have been observed in the corresponding experiments for example judge et al 2004 carried out a series of experiments for oblique water entry a limit case of flow separation was realized with increased horizontal velocity the existing numerical results cannot completely accord with experimental data in this limit case the reason is that air effect is not modeled in these numerical methods despite the fact that above mentioned numerical methods have achieved considerable development it cannot perfectly solve the asymmetrical impacting problem if the air effect is considered in fact for asymmetric impacting problem flow separation and ventilation are unexceptional when the horizontal velocity is larger even though these phenomena are extremely important in asymmetric cases it is quite difficult to describe them through above mentioned numerical methods which are based on the potential flow theory to solve this dilemma computational fluid mechanics cfd method which is based on the two phase flow model and avoids the direct solution of free surface has been drawn more attention wang and guedes soares 2013 numerically investigated the water entry of a bow flared section with heel angle by an explicit finite element method the interface of fluid and structure adopted a multi material arbitrary lagrangian eulerian formulation where a penalty coupling method was utilized secondary impacting phenomenon caused by the flow separation was observed the experimental velocities become much larger than the values of other methods in the later stage due to the elastic rope that is used to stop the water entry in the tests such the otherness of velocity causes some other differences between experimental and numerical results including impacting pressure and slamming force this method is also applied to the study of water entry impacting of wedges with roll angles in wang and guedes soares 2014a and the water impact of 3d bodies in wang and guedes soares 2014b hu et al 2018 studied the water entry problem of asymmetric wedge by using a constrained interpolation profile cip method to solve the n s equations a cartesian grid was used and the free surface was captured by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing slope weighting thinc sw and the body motion was calculated by an immersed boundary method the results show the heel angle significantly influences the body velocity and pressure distribution there is some parallel work on this problem using cfd method which can be found in gu et al 2014 and wei et al 2015 although some work has been done for the asymmetric impacting problem there still need some extending studies for instance most researchers concentrate on the free surface form while ignoring the discussion of slamming forces in fact the functional relationship between the factors of asymmetrical impacting and thus causing the slamming force is quite important in the design of marine structure in addition the asymmetry for a two dimensional section should include two aspects heel angle and horizontal velocity the effects of these two kinds of asymmetry on the impacting hydrodynamics are studied individually in most of previous literature in fact they should be considered simultaneously because the horizontal velocity usually exists if the heel angle appears when the ship sails in actual marine environment remarkable contribution was made in krastev et al 2018 for the asymmetrical situation in there water entry problems of a wedge with different heel angles and horizontal velocities were simulated through a vof based algorithm and coupled with a laplacian mesh motion solver however asymmetrical impacting problem of the bow flared section is quite different from the wedge case take an example of the symmetric results of a ship bow section and wedge presented in sun 2007 the pressure of ship bow section is underestimated in the bottom region while it is overestimated in the upside area through comparing the results of wedge in same deadrise angle cases in addition complex flow phenomena i e flow separation and ventilation will occur more easily if the shape of a bulbous bow is considered once these phenomena are taken into account the numerical methods based on the potential flow theory may be not applicable on the other hand the effect of added mass is important due to the shell structural shape of ship which means the scale of a model can greatly influence the impacting hydrodynamics the best way to solve the hydrodynamic problem is to use a full scale model while the cpu time is huge the asymmetrical water entry of full scale section considering the geometrical and kinematic asymmetry simultaneously is not available yet this paper presents a detailed numerical study on this impacting problem in our work a full scale bow flared section is obtained from ultra large container ship and the process of entering into water with various heel angles and entry velocities is simulated using cfd method through the commercial code fluent where coupled vof based algorithm and dynamic mesh model is used the former solves the control equations and the latter achieves the body motion the rest parts are organized as follows in section 2 the details of mathematical model and numerical procedure of the asymmetrical impacting problem are presented in section 3 numerical method is verified by comparing other numerical and experimental results on a symmetrical ship bow section and asymmetry wedges and the convergence study is carried out by using three different mesh sizes in section 4 the impacting hydrodynamics including pile up water pressure and impacting forces are presented and discussed with various heel angles and horizontal velocities in section 5 some meaningful conclusions are summarized 2 mathematical model and numerical procedure in present work the cfd method obtained in the commercial code fluent is utilized to simulate the asymmetrical water entry problem a gas liquid two phase flow model is established and it is modeled through the vof method the body motion is achieved by using a dynamic mesh model the details of mathematical model and numerical procedure are presented as follows 2 1 mathematic model the two fluids water and air are supposed to immiscible and incompressible so the continuity and momentum equations can be written as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p μ 2 u f where p is the field pressure and u is the velocity vector ρ is the fluid density and μ is the dynamic viscosity f is the source term which denotes the gravity in this paper for two phase flow the pressure is discontinuous on the interface of air and water so a continuum surface force csf model in brackbill et al 1992 is adopted to correct it which expresses the interfacial pressure as a continuous function see fig 1 a the function can be written as 3 p t p b c 1 p a μ c n 0 c 1 p a c 0 where c α t α a is the location function of interface whose definition can be referring to fig 1 b n is the curvature of the interface then eq 2 can be rewritten as 4 u t u u 1 ρ p μ 2 u μ c n ρ ρ g for the water entry problem the free surface is always changing with time which causes the difficulty in solving control equations directly so the vof algorithm is adopted to model the two phase flow model by solving a single set of momentum equation and tracking the volume fraction of each fluid throughout the domain the tracking of free surface is accomplished by the solution of the continuity equation for the volume fraction of air the equation has the following form 5 α a t α a v r 0 where α a is the volume fraction of air α a 0 denotes the fluid in the grid is water whereas is air 0 α a 1 means this grid contains both water and air the v r is the transfer velocity the density and dynamic viscosity should be updated as 6 ρ α a ρ a 1 α a ρ w 7 μ α a ρ a μ a 1 α a ρ w μ w ρ where ρ a and μ a are the density and viscosity of air while ρ w and μ w are the density and viscosity of water eq 1 eq 4 and eq 5 are the basic equations of water entry problem using the vof algorithm 2 2 numerical procedure 2 2 1 n s solver eq 4 is solved by using the laminar flow solver in fluent which is based on the finite volume method if a two dimensional fluid problem is simulated the length in the neglectful dimensional direction is assumed as 1 m to satisfy the thought of finite volume in the discretization the pressure gradient and the source terms are firstly ignored which is corresponding to the predicted step so eq 4 is rewritten as 8 u t u u μ u the terms in eq 8 are discretized by using implicit eulerian format 9 u t d v d t u p r u p n v p 10 u u d v d t f f n u f r δ t 11 μ u d v d t μ f u r δ t where the superscript n and r represent the current time step the value is known and the predicted time step the value is unknown the subscript f represents the value on the grid surface vp is the grid volume δt is the time step f f is the flux the velocity u f r can be obtained by using a central difference according to volume centered velocities as u p r u n r 2 f u r is the gradient of face normal which can be written as 12 f u r s f u n n u p r d where the subscript p represents the velocity of the current grid and the subscript n denotes the velocity of adjacent grid s f is the module of face vector d is the distance of grids substitute eqs 9 12 into eq 8 and introduce the pressure gradient and source terms we have 13 a p u p r a n u n n e p n p n ρ g where 14 a p v p δ t f f n 2 μ s f d 15 a n f f n 2 μ s f d 16 e p v p δ t u p n in eq 13 the terms ap an and ep keep invariant and the only unknown term u p r can be solved in eq 13 in the numerical procedure the continuity equation eq 1 is not used and the predicted term u p r does not satisfy it so a piso algorithm introduced in issa 1986 is adopted to deal with the dilemma in fact the corrected term of pressure in eq 4 is not included but it can be realized in fluent through the pressure interpolation on the free surface uses presto pressure staggering option which is described in bender 1980 the gradient of pressure utilizes a green gauss node based method which can be found in rausch et al 1991 and this method has a second order precision 2 2 2 geometric reconstruction approach for free surface eq 5 is solved in explicit approach and the standard finite difference interpolation scheme is applied to calculate the volume fraction values which were obtained from the previous time step the discretization scheme is written as 17 α a n 1 ρ a n 1 α a n ρ a n δ t v f ρ a u f n α a f n 0 where the superscripts n and n 1 denote the index for the previous and current time step separately α a f is the face value of air volume fraction in this procedure the free surface can be described by the geometric reconstruction approach in there a standard interpolation scheme is implemented to obtain the face flux when this cell is completely filled with air or water αa 0 or 1 when the cell is near the interface of water and air 0 αa 1 a geometric reconstruction scheme is used by the piecewise linear approach described in youngs 1982 the first step in this reconstruction scheme is calculating the position of the linear interface relative to the center of each partially filled cell based on information about the volume fraction and its derivatives in the cell the second step is calculating the advecting amount of fluid through each face using the computed linear interface representation and information about the normal and tangential velocity distribution on the face the third step is calculating the volume fraction in each cell using the balance of fluxes calculated during the previous step 2 2 3 treatment of solid body the water entry problem of a body can be regarded as such a flow where the shape of the fluid domain is changing with time and the changing boundary is the outline of the body so a dynamic mesh model can be used to model this flow through defining the motion of moving zones the motion can be described by a prescribed motion such as specified velocities and angular velocities or an unpredictable motion where the subsequent motion is determined based on the solution at the current time such as free drop motion the update of the volume mesh is handled automatically by fluent at each time step based on the new positions of the moving boundaries two kinds of mesh morphing methods including spring based smoothing and local re meshing method are adopted in the present work to improve the mesh quality when the boundary of the fluid domain outline of the body is changed in each time step the force generated by the encompassing fluid reacting to the motion of body can be expressed as 18 f s w p i μ u u t n d s where i is the identity matrix s w is the body outline and n is the unit normal to the body the moment m of the force with respect to the body center of gravity can be calculated by the formula 19 m s w r p i μ u u t n d s where r is the position vector evaluated from the center of gravity once the forces and moment on the solid body are obtained the acceleration at the current time and velocities at next time can be computed by the newton s law more details can be found in iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 2 2 4 time stepping in the time stepping procedure the numerical simulation is achieved as follows step 1 give the initial pressure field velocity field and volume fraction step 2 the new positions of the body are predicted in the next time according to the given motion and the mesh is updated by using mesh morphing technique step 3 the volume fraction pressure and velocity fields are obtained by n s solver the flow field information is stored the iterative process continues by returning step 2 until the given time 2 3 boundary conditions fig 2 shows the illustration of the asymmetric water entry problem of an arbitrary two dimensional section the body drops with constant vertical velocity v horizontal velocity u and heel angle θ a cartesian coordinate system o y z is used where y axis is placed at the initial free surface s f and z axis is pointed upwards according to the study of facci et al 2016 the top of fluid domain is set as pressure outlet and the other three boundaries s c is set to no slip wall the outline of bow flared section is a moving zone in the fluid domain with the boundary condition of no slip wall the motion of the zone is specified through the function of velocities and time which can be realized in fluent by using a user defined function udf file the time t 0s means the bow flared section starts to touch the calm water surface and then it enters into water with constant velocities and heel angle the densities of water and air are 103 kg m3 and 1 25 kg m3 respectively the viscosity of water is 10 3kg m s and the air 10 5kg m s 3 validations and convergence study in this section the predicted results are firstly compared with experimental data to verify its applicability on an arbitrary two dimensional section through simulating the water entry process of a ship bow section meanwhile the convergence study of mesh is carried out then the numerical results of asymmetrical wedges are compared with experimental data and other available numerical ones in order to further verify the reliability on the asymmetric cases 3 1 verification and convergence study for the symmetrical ship bow section to verify the applicability of numerical simulation for an arbitrary section entering into water a ship bow section was chosen fig 3 a shows the geometrical shape of this section the total weight of the falling rig is 261 kg and the size of body is 0 32 m 0 24 m four pressure locations defined as p1 to p4 were measured in the experiment and the sketch of their detail locations is shown in fig 3 b in the simulation the drop height is 0 318 m with an initial velocity 2 44 m s touching the calm water surface the size of the computational domain is 4 m 3 m and the domain is discretized through a mesh pre processor icem cfd and tri quad unstructured mesh type is used although a free drop test is used to verify the numerical results the constant velocity during the water entry is adopted in the numerical simulation because the studied case in this paper is based on the assumption of constant velocity to show the convergence of mesh resolution three kinds of mesh sizes listed in table 1 are utilized the predicted results of local pressure at p4 and total slamming force are compared with ones of bem in sun 2007 and experimental method in aarsnes 1996 see fig 4 a and b the consequences of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are almost identical relative error 0 8 and they are closer to experimental values with the errors of 13 1 total force peak and 4 3 pressure peak it reflects the convergence can be guaranteed when the mesh size is enough small and the cell size of mesh 2 is enough to ensure the calculated accuracy for the comparison of numerical results in mesh 2 and experimental data the former is a little bigger than the latter with the errors of 7 8 total force peak and 4 3 pressure peak on the one hand the increment of velocity in experiment can cause a more impacting force than the numerical results where the velocity increases about 13 in the free fall motion on the other hand the 3d effect can reduce the maximum 8 for this section according to the analysis in zhao et al 1996 so these two effects on the agreement between numerical and experimental results are opposite where the former enlarge the experimental values while the latter reduce it that is why the differences are still small even though we do not consider the variation of velocity the predicted pressure is also compared in fig 4 c f reasonable agreement can be found actually there are phase differences in some measured locations i e p2 and p3 the reason is that it is difficult to fully determine the time when the body touches the water due to the oscillation of falling rig in addition the pressure of p1 p4 reaches maximum values almost simultaneously t 0 06s such a consequence is quite different from that appeared in the wedge case where the maximum pressure in different positions occurs successively for example aarsnes 1996 also performed the drop test of a wedge for the time history of pressure for a drop height 0 313 m pressure at p1 p4 reaches maximum values at the time instants 0 006s 0 009s 0 012s 0 017s and 0 022s respectively further pressure time history for ship bow section means the high pressure area covers almost the entire surface when the water impacts the flare region according to contrastive analysis the time history of pressure can be predicted preferably and impacting characters of ship bow section can also be observed clearly by the present cfd method 3 2 verifications for asymmetric wedges to further verify the availability of numerical method on the asymmetric cases water entry problems of asymmetric wedges were simulated and the results were compared with available experimental data and other numerical results the wedge model with adjustable deadrise angle was chosen according to the experiment of barjasteh et al 2016 the total mass is 44 kg and the side length is 0 205 m four pressure sensors were placed defined as p1 p2 p3 and p4 the sketch of their locations is illustrated in fig 5 in the computation two kinds of deadrise angles β 20 and 30 are used and the heel angles are set as θ 5 10 and 15 in each case so in the asymmetrical situation the actual deadrise angle on the left side is β θ and right side β θ the drop height is 0 5 m with the initial water entry velocity v 3 13 m s in fact only vertical free drop motion is guaranteed as the horizontal motion and inclination angle is restricted in the experiment and the experimental velocity and acceleration are unavailable if the freedom body motion is adopted in the simulation like section 3 1 there will appear the horizontal motion and rotational motion the difference of motion can greatly influence the impacting pressure to better compare other numerical results the assumption of constant velocities and heel angle is used during the water entry process which means the gravity effect is ignored in our simulations the predicted pressure distribution on the wetted surface at the time instant of p2 reaching maximum is compared with other numerical results which are from toyama 1993 and hu et al 2018 see fig 6 in these figures the non dimensional horizontal distance x cl and pressure coefficient c p 2 p ρ w v 2 are adopted where cl is the wetted width on the left side the analytical solution of toyama 1993 overestimated the pressure when the deadrise angle is less than 100 i e fig 6 b and c beyond that the present results agree well with other numerical solutions when the inclination angle increases in particular for the solutions obtained by hu et al 2018 considering the analytical solution is based on the potential flow theory while the cip method of hu et al 2018 and vof method of present study are based on the computational fluid dynamics technology it means the cfd method has a better prediction when the inclination angle is smaller less than 100 4 results and discussion of a bow flared section in this section a full scale two dimensional bow flared section with the size of 58 4 m 38 5 m from the ultra large container ship ulcs is chosen to analyze the pile up water the left and right wetted height of pile up water d 1 and d 2 and the reference distances r 1 and r 2 above calm water surface are defined as shown in fig 7 a four pressure points are monitored in each side and the sketch of their locations is illustrated in fig 7 b it can be seen that the shape of a bulbous bow is considered in our study which is different to the ship bow section showed in fig 3 a where the bulbous bow is replaced by a smoothed curve such the difference will lead to ventilation occur more easily in general the dimension of the fluid domain should be 4 or 5 times bigger than the dimension of the rigid body in the symmetrical case for the asymmetrical problem the body moves to the right side due to the horizontal velocity it means a larger size in the domain is required in order to minimize the boundary effect if the dimension of fluid domain is ten times larger than the body boundary effect on the calculated results can be ignored even though the body completely moves to the right side to discuss conveniently the size of fluid domain in all simulated cases is 700 m 620 m the cell size is determined according to the convergence study in section 3 1 and the mesh 2 is adopted the minimum cell size is 0 23 m 0 15 m and the maximum cell size is 4 m 2 m in the domain with a total number about 3 1e5 fig 8 shows the details of mesh including the whole fluid domain and part domain nearby the body the density of mesh is increased in three regions closed to the outline of body body motion region and nearby free surface we can see the mesh is quite sparse than that shown in krastev et al 2018 which can reduce the calculated time tremendously even so the precision is enough in terms of the validations in section 3 it should own to the application of dynamic mesh technology in time stepping process which allows a larger mesh size and provides enough accuracy the purpose of paper is to discuss the effect of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry on impacting hydrodynamics so the gravity effect is ignored to avoid the variation of velocities during the water entry process which means the assumption of constant velocities and heel angle is applied in the numerical simulation in each simulation the total time is 3 3s with a time step 0 005s and the cpu time is about 1 h in a pc with intel core i7 7700 k processor and 8 gigabytes of memory in the computation the initial vertical velocity is 11 m s and four heel angles 0 10 20 and 30 are included in there the ratio of vertical velocity v and horizontal velocity u is defined as ε u v which are chosen as 0 0 45 0 91 and 1 36 the heel angle is regarded as geometrical asymmetry and the horizontal velocity is kinematic asymmetry in our discussion to gain a better insight on how the asymmetry affects impacting hydrodynamics the non dimensional coefficients of pressure forces and moment are defined as follows 20 c p 2 p ρ w v 2 21 c f y 2 f y ρ w v 2 l 22 c f z 2 f z ρ w v 2 l 23 c m x 2 m x ρ w v 2 l 2 where ρ w is the density of water l is breadth of bow flared section and v is the magnitude of velocity vector as v u 2 v 2 the p f y f z and m x are the slamming pressure horizontal force vertical force and torque moment respectively the c p c fy c fz and c mx are the corresponding non dimensional coefficients 4 1 pile up water analysis a major character of asymmetrical impacting is that it has more complex free surface form than the symmetrical case four essential results of free surface evolution are presented in figs 9 12 they are symmetrical case symmetrical geometry and asymmetric kinematics case asymmetrical geometry and symmetric kinematics case asymmetrical geometry and kinematics case separately in fig 9 the symmetry of fluid flow can be guaranteed the other three figures show three kinds of typical pile up water forms defined as type a type b and type c type a is the flow separation does not occur until the water submerges body see fig 10 type b is the flow separation occurs at the bulbous bow location see fig 11 type c is the flow separation almost occurs at the beginning of impacting see fig 12 for type a it can be observed that the pile up water on the right side rises more quickly than the left side t 1 0s see fig 10 a b with the time increasing 1 0s t 1 8s the difference reduces see fig 10 c d it indicates the body impedes the fluid go up more severely at this stage due to the decrease of fluid velocity after the fluid separates from the body t 0 18s it rises without constraint and the difference of ascending fluid velocity on the two sides further enlarges see fig 10 e f in figs 11 and 12 the characters of pile up water on the right side are similar to the law showed in fig 10 except the more prominent jet flow however quite a difference can be observed on the left side in fig 11 the flow separation happens at the bulbous bow which makes the pile up water rise slower without hindrance of body see fig 11 a e in fact the separated fluid will hit the flared area with the increase of time and the cavitation is generated see fig 11 f such the phenomenon can lead to ventilation and thus cause some negative pressure area in fig 12 more obvious flow separation is occurred so that the left side is always dry during the impacting process now we discuss the effect of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry on the pile up water qualitatively pile up water forms showed in figs 10 and 12 have the same θ but different ε and the former is type a as the latter is type b correspondingly in figs 11 and 12 where they have the different θ and same ε but both of them are type b it shows the pile up water form can change easily through the different horizontal velocity but it is difficult to change by the variation of the heel angle from this point of view a conclusion can be drawn that the kinematic asymmetry horizontal velocity has a greater influence on the pile up water than the geometrical asymmetry heel angle to discuss the effect of pile up water on the pressure the pressure distribution at t 0 6s 1 0s 1 4s 1 8s 2 2s and 2 6s which are corresponding to the free surface evolution shown in figs 9 12 are presented in fig 13 where the negative value of z denotes the value of z direction on the left side shown in fig 7 b pressure distribution is basically symmetrical in fig 13 a because the simulated model is symmetrical there appears some negative pressure in fig 13 b when the fluid goes through the bulbous bow such as at t 0 6s 1s and 1 4s the negative pressure declines with the time and finally becomes positive value actually it is caused by the so called ventilation but the pressure doesn t always keep negative which implies the ventilation phenomenon vanishes with the water entry depth increasing the maximum of pressure on the right side is about 70 larger than that on the left side when the air effect exists t 1 4s while this otherness expands to 275 when the ventilation disappears t 1 8s after flow separation happens the right pressure decreases rapidly such as at t 2 2s and 2 6s in fig 13 c the asymmetry of pressure distribution on the two sides is more evident on the left side the pressure nearby the bulbous bow keeps negative all the time which means that the ventilation always exists during the water entry progress in fig 13 d there is hardly any pressure on the left side because the fluid does not encircle the body surface on the right side the pressure is enlarging with the increase of water entry depth until the flow separation occurs t 1 8s after that the pressure tends to stable in fact fig 13 b 13 d show the effects of three different pile up forms on the pressure the maximum difference value of cp on the two sides can be regarded as an evaluation index ψ to discuss the degree of asymmetry the values of ψ in these three kinds of pile up water forms are 3 3 7 35 and 8 4 respectively it can be seen that the values of ψ are almost same in type b and type c while they are much larger than that in type a on the other hand type b is basically similar to type c except that the separated flow can hit the body in type b however the main difference in type b and type a is the former appears the flow separation while the latter does not so the reason caused larger pressure difference on the two sides is the flow separation to discuss conveniently the pile up water forms are divided into two kinds again type 1 and type 2 because the otherness of ψ in type b and type c is tiny the former is with flow separation i e type b and type c and the latter is without it i e type a fig 14 shows the dividing line in all simulated cases the upside of dividing line is type 1 and the downside is type 2 two pile up water coefficients r1 d1 and r2 d2 are compared as a function of heel angle θ and velocity ratio ε to further analyze the characters of fluid see fig 15 firstly we focus on the changing law of these two coefficients with time in fig 15 a when the fluid does not separate from the body type 2 the coefficient r1 d1 firstly decreases and then increases referring to figs 9 12 the declining stage is corresponding to the time quantum before the water submerging body while the ascent stage is the time instant after that on the contrary when the fluid form is type 1 the coefficients are almost invariable this phenomenon is quite different from the situation of asymmetrical wedge which is presented in hu et al 2018 and the coefficients are nearly constant in all cases whether the flow separation occurs or not this difference means the pile up water of bow flared section is no longer self similar in fig 15 b the flow separation does not occur in all simulated cases and the law of r2 d2 shows it firstly decreases and then increases which is similar to that reflected in fig 15 a according to the above analysis the flow separation mainly affects the changing law of coefficients when it happens the pile up water coefficient tends to a constant value otherwise it firstly decreases and then increases with time then we concentrate on the values of coefficients and use a time mean value φ to inflect the asymmetry fig 16 shows the values of φ in different heel angles and horizontal velocities in fig 16 a when ε 0 type 1 flow occurs the φ can reach 0 3 and does not change with θ beyond that it increases with ε and θ which means the effects of ε and θ are both important in fig 16 b the φ increases gradually with ε while it remains almost unchanged with different θ it reflects the horizontal velocity has great influence on the pile up water while the effect of heel angle is not so important which is not clear in krastev et al 2018 in addition the values of φ on the right side are generally greater than the left side it means the pile up water is more obvious when the deadrise angle is smaller 4 2 pressure characters the impacting hydrodynamic pressure is significant in aspect of marine structure and they are illustrated in fig 17 fig 19 fig 17 illustrates the pressure time history of p4 in different heel angles and horizontal velocities which represents the pressure characters on the right side in fig 17 a it is clearly seen that the pressure peak increases dramatically with heel angle and the maximum relative increment can reach 366 from θ 00 to 300 such the phenomenon can be easily understood by noting that the effective impacting angle is lower when the heel angle is larger and thus the impacting pressure becomes bigger according to the results of wedges in zhao and faltinsen 1993 in addition the duration of impacting is less when the heel angle is larger the reason is not only the vertical distance above calm water surface becomes smaller but also the velocity of pile up water becomes larger with the increase of heel angle fig 17 also reflects the effect of horizontal velocity on the pressure when we treat these four pictures fig 17 a d as a whole it shows that the cp reduces with the increase of velocity ratio ε and the maximum reduction can reach 39 considering the mechanics essence of pressure on the body is the reaction of blocking the fluid and is proportional to the square of vertical penetration velocity so such a consequence can be explained from two aspects one is the vertical penetration velocity decreases when the horizontal velocity increases because the intersection angle of body surface and resultant velocity becomes smaller on the other hand horizontal velocity enhances the kinematic asymmetry while the defined pressure coefficient is not influenced by horizontal velocity in theoretically because it is normalized however the reduction of cp does not mean the actual value of pressure reduces because the velocity scale also aggrandizes in fact it only implies the effect of horizontal velocity on the pressure is not so important than the vertical velocity correspondingly fig 18 shows the time history of cp on the left side and the position of p8 is chosen in fig 18 a the pressure decreases about 87 from θ 00 to θ 300 the reason is that there has larger deadrise angle when the heel angle increases on the other hand the pressure slows down quickly until zero with the horizontal velocity increasing if the pressure is equivalent to zero it illustrates the water no longer touches body surface which is so called flow separation it means the flow separation has a significant influence on the pressure a boundary constituted by the combination of heel angle and velocity ratio defined as θ ε can be utilized to distinguish whether or not flow separation happens which can be seen in fig 14 fig 19 shows the pressure distribution on the body surface when the pressure of p4 reaches maximum value the pressure asymmetry on the two sides becomes quite clear with the increment of θ and ε when the horizontal velocity augments the shape of pressure distribution on the right side keeps invariant but it changes a lot on the left side e g the pressure value changes from positive to negative this phenomenon can be explained according to the different pile up water forms shown in figs 9 12 on the other hand for same ε the shape does not change with θ but for same θ the shape changes with ε it means the horizontal velocity affects the pressure distribution more greatly than the heel angle especially on the left side 4 3 impacting forces differing from the symmetrical impacting there are three kinds of forces on the asymmetrical cases horizontal force vertical force and torque moment the non dimensional coefficients of them are used in this section which can be found in eqs 21 23 the tendency of horizontal force with different heel angles and horizontal velocities is illustrated in fig 20 for ε 0 when θ 0 this force tends to zero such the consequence accords with the physics fact that the model is symmetric when θ 0 the cfy rises with the augment of θ and its negative value means the direction of force points to the left hand the increment of horizontal force is caused by the larger difference of pressure distribution on the two sides which can be clearly seen from fig 19 however the otherness of cfy in different θ is diminishing when ε is larger e g the difference value of maximum horizontal force between θ 300 and θ 00 is up to 2 44 in fig 20 a while it becomes 0 1 in fig 20 d even though the heel angle can increase the horizontal force its effect is limited when the ε becomes larger e g in fig 20 d the effect of θ can be ignored that means the horizontal velocity plays a decisive role on the cfy because it can weaken the effect of heel angles to explain this phenomenon detailedly we chose body as the reference system and then the impacting problem can be regarded as the problem of water hitting body when the body inclines to the incoming flow it prevents the incoming flow less it means the pressure on the right side will reduce and thus the horizontal force mainly depended on the different pressure distribution on the two sides will reduce the vertical force is reported in fig 21 when ε 0 the cfz increases 182 from θ 00 to θ 300 because the effective impacting angle becomes smaller noticeably this augment is nonlinear when θ 20 the cfz changes little about 4 while it grows quickly about 97 when θ 20 such an incremental tendency becomes closer to linear when ε is larger i e in fig 21 c it implies that the vertical force is mainly influenced by the heel angle however the actual vertical force really rises with the horizontal velocity increasing when we no longer use the non dimension coefficient it means the horizontal velocity can also enlarge the vertical force which is not like what we think that the horizontal velocity only influences the horizontal force fig 22 presents the torque moment coefficient differing to the appearance of cfy and cfz the cmx has a rising tendency in the time quantum after it reaches the maximum in some cases for example in fig 22 d when t 2s the cmx goes up again the reason is the effect of horizontal velocity because this situation does not appear when the ε 0 45 in addition when θ or ε becomes larger the cmx will increase it means that the effects of horizontal velocity and heel angle on the torque moment both are important the maximum values of impacting forces and torque moment coefficients are reported in fig 23 as a function of heel angle θ and velocity ration ε to discuss the geometrical and kinematic asymmetry in fig 23 a the cfy increases with heel angle when ε 0 in fact the features of cfy are corresponding to the fluid forms referring to the boundary using for distinguishing flow separation in fig 14 when the flow form is type 1 the cfy is no longer depended on θ and it has a linear growth with ε according to the analysis of section 4 1 the flow separation is sensitive to ε it means the horizontal force is mainly depended on the kinematic asymmetry in fig 23 b the effect of ε on the cfz can be ignored until θ 20 in view of the cfz is mainly determined on the high pressure side the effect of θ is similar to the symmetric cases where the deadrise angle is smaller the vertical force is larger it reflects the vertical force mainly comes from the geometrical asymmetry for torque coefficient in fig 23 c when θ 10 the effect of ε can be ignored further increasing θ the coefficient cmz grows linearly with ε for same ε the cmz increases with θ it can be observed that there is no obvious boundary in θ and ε which is not like cfy influenced by flow separation it means the torque moment not only results from geometrical asymmetry but also comes from kinematic asymmetry 5 conclusions the asymmetrical water impact of a full scale bow flared section from ultra large container ship was numerically investigated using cfd technology in commercial code fluent which couples a vof based algorithm and the dynamic mesh model in the numerical simulation a two phase flow model is established based on n s equations to consider the flow separation and air effect the control equations are discretized through the finite volume method and then solved through the vof based algorithm the free surface is tracked by the geometric reconstruction approach according to the volume fraction the body motion is achieved by defining a dynamic boundary condition in the dynamic mesh model in the simulated cases four heel angles 0 10 20 and 30 and four horizontal velocities 0 m s 5 m s 10 m s and 15 m s are utilized to discuss the geometrical and kinematic asymmetry in this paper impacting hydrodynamics including the pile up water pressure and forces are paid more attention the numerical validations for the water entry impacting of a symmetric ship bow section and asymmetric wedges were carried out for the ship bow section good agreement on the pressure time history is achieved it indicates the present method can predict the slamming loads preferably for arbitrary two dimensional sections meanwhile the mesh convergence was studied by using three different mesh sizes when the dimensional ratio of minimum cell and body is less 0 02 the convergence of results can be guaranteed for asymmetrical wedges the contrastive results of the present method and other numerical methods demonstrate the reliability of present method in predicting pressure distribution for asymmetrical cases in addition the numerical results based on the potential flow theory can overestimate the pressure peak when the deadrise angle is less than 10 while the predicted results based on the cfd method has a better adaptation for smaller deadrise angle less than 100 cases the characters of free surface dynamics on the different combinations of geometrical and kinetic asymmetry were analyzed detailedly three different fluid forms can be observed clearly and they are reclassified into two kinds according to the evaluation index ψ which represents the asymmetrical degree in the simulated cases type 1 is with flow separation and type 2 is without flow separation the pressure distribution on the body at different time instants shows that on the junction of bulbous bow and flared area the air effect is important which directly influences the negative pressure area especially at the time instant of flow separation happening two coefficients r1 d1 and r2 d2 were defined to quantify the pile up water characters when the flow separation occurs the fluid is no longer self similar on the contrary the fluid is nearly self similar such the situation is quite different from the cases of asymmetrical wedges where the pile up water is always self similar the general conclusion of pile up water as a function of θ and ε is that the kinematic asymmetry has greater influence on the pile up water when the ε 0 45 otherwise the geometrical asymmetry is important pressure characters including the time history and pressure distribution were discussed on geometrical and kinematic asymmetry if ε is less than 0 45 the pressure on the right side increases nonlinearly with θ due to the smaller effective impacting angle while the increment vanishes gradually when ε 0 45 for the pressure on the left side it reduces with the increase of θ when ε 0 45 as it keeps zero if ε 0 45 due to the influence of flow separation in addition the shape of pressure distribution keeps invariant on the right side as it varies from positive to negative on the left side when the ε increases in fact the pressure complexity can own to different pile up water forms if the flow separation does not occur type 2 the effect of geometrical asymmetry on pressure is important otherwise the kinematic asymmetry is significant the non dimensional body forces were analyzed as the combination of θ and ε the ε can affect the horizontal force immensely even counteracts the effect of heel angle when the ε 0 45 which means the horizontal force is greatly depended on the kinematic asymmetry for vertical force it basically keeps invariant with ε which reflects the vertical force mainly comes from geometrical asymmetry for the torque moment the effects of geometrical and kinetic asymmetry are both important because it will increase with θ or ε and there is no larger difference between these two kinds of asymmetry future studies should be focused on the experimental study on asymmetric bow flared section including the pressure on the

23407,asymmetric impacting phenomenon is quite common for the sailing ship when it encounters oblique waves the asymmetrical water entry problem of a full scale bow flared section from ultra large container ship ulcs was investigated using cfd method in commercial code fluent a two phase flow model was established based on n s equations which were discretized through the finite volume method and the free surface was captured by vof model the body motion was achieved in the dynamic mesh model with prescribed dynamic boundary condition the impacting forces were obtained through direct numerical integration on the body surface the validation and convergence were carried out through comparing experimental data and other numerical methods in already published literature two kinds of asymmetry heel angle as geometrical asymmetry and horizontal velocity as the kinematic asymmetry were comprehensively considered in numerical simulation and significant attention is given into the discussion of their effects on impacting hydrodynamics including pile up water pressure and slamming forces the results show the geometrical asymmetry is important on these hydrodynamics if the flow separation does not happen otherwise the kinematic asymmetry can significantly influence pile up water form and further determines the pressure and slamming forces keywords cfd asymmetric impacting bow flared section flow separation 1 introduction slamming phenomenon occurs frequently when the ship sails in rough seas with a high speed enormous slamming loads can cause structural damage and even threaten the mariners personal safety in some oblique wave cases asymmetric impacting phenomenon will occur due to the free motion of ship when the ship bow exits water and then re enters into water this impacting phenomenon may result in greater slamming loads than the case in the head sea due to the decrease of the effective impacting angle in fact such an asymmetric case is more common for the ship which sails in actual marine environment massive studies on the water entry problem of symmetric cases have been done an analytical solution was firstly put forward by von karman 1929 based on the momentum theory in his study the concept of added mass was introduced and the pile up water was ignored later wagner 1932 improved this solution by considering the effect of pile up water in his theory the rather panel assumption was used and the results are closer to the corresponding experimental data however there exists a singularity at the edge of the panel to avoid this dilemma watanabe 1986 adopted a matched asymptotic approach by introducing the inner domain most early theoretical researches focused on the pressure peaks and paid less attention on the characteristics of time such a situation causes some inconveniences for the analysis of structural dynamic response dobrovol skaya 1969 developed a similarity solution for the water entry problem of wedges through supposing the flow is self similarity in the water entry process where the time information can be considered wu et al 2004 extended it to the free drop case an auxiliary function was introduced to uncouple the acceleration and flow field the excellent agreement of acceleration is achieved between the numerical and experimental results although the self similar theory is further extended to an expanding paraboloid in wu and sun 2014 the similarity solution is hard to obtain for complex flow form such as flow separation and ventilation on the other hand some researchers begin to concern on the cases of ship like section to satisfy the requirements of marine engineering zhao and faltinsen 1993 solved the water entry problems of arbitrarily section using a fully nonlinear boundary element method the thin jet flow was dealt by using the numerical truncation to avoid the divergence in time stepping later the fully nonlinear numerical method is applied to the case with flow separation in zhao et al 1996 a joint point of body and free surface was introduced to approximate the jet flow and the effect of flow separation from knuckles or fixed separation points was incorporated by the kutta condition for the pressure distribution good agreement between theory and experiments is documented at an early stage of the water entry the differences are larger at a later stage but this is mainly due to three dimensional effects in the experiments the analysis shows that the three dimensional effect causes 8 reduction of the force relative to the two dimensional force when the spray roots of the jets reached the knuckles only some researchers focus on the asymmetric cases even if it is more common in the ocean engineering field according to the survey of howison et al 2004 garabedian 1953 firstly put forward the model of asymmetric wedge based on the potential flow theory later some scholars did some improved work such as korobkin 1988 and toyama 1993 iafrati 2000 used a boundary element method to predict the elevation of free surface and pressure distribution of an asymmetric wedge similar work can be found in semenov and iafrati 2006 in there this problem was solved by mapping the complex velocity potential the flow form is stilled supposed as self similar which limits the further development in aspect of the nom similar flow form wang et al 2008 adopted a boundary element method to solve the complex velocity potential this method is extended to other water entry cases such as free fall motion of asymmetrical wedge in xu et al 2010 and asymmetrical bow flare ship section in sun and faltinsen 2009 however some complex flow forms are not incarnated in these studies such as flow separation and ventilation which have been observed in the corresponding experiments for example judge et al 2004 carried out a series of experiments for oblique water entry a limit case of flow separation was realized with increased horizontal velocity the existing numerical results cannot completely accord with experimental data in this limit case the reason is that air effect is not modeled in these numerical methods despite the fact that above mentioned numerical methods have achieved considerable development it cannot perfectly solve the asymmetrical impacting problem if the air effect is considered in fact for asymmetric impacting problem flow separation and ventilation are unexceptional when the horizontal velocity is larger even though these phenomena are extremely important in asymmetric cases it is quite difficult to describe them through above mentioned numerical methods which are based on the potential flow theory to solve this dilemma computational fluid mechanics cfd method which is based on the two phase flow model and avoids the direct solution of free surface has been drawn more attention wang and guedes soares 2013 numerically investigated the water entry of a bow flared section with heel angle by an explicit finite element method the interface of fluid and structure adopted a multi material arbitrary lagrangian eulerian formulation where a penalty coupling method was utilized secondary impacting phenomenon caused by the flow separation was observed the experimental velocities become much larger than the values of other methods in the later stage due to the elastic rope that is used to stop the water entry in the tests such the otherness of velocity causes some other differences between experimental and numerical results including impacting pressure and slamming force this method is also applied to the study of water entry impacting of wedges with roll angles in wang and guedes soares 2014a and the water impact of 3d bodies in wang and guedes soares 2014b hu et al 2018 studied the water entry problem of asymmetric wedge by using a constrained interpolation profile cip method to solve the n s equations a cartesian grid was used and the free surface was captured by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing slope weighting thinc sw and the body motion was calculated by an immersed boundary method the results show the heel angle significantly influences the body velocity and pressure distribution there is some parallel work on this problem using cfd method which can be found in gu et al 2014 and wei et al 2015 although some work has been done for the asymmetric impacting problem there still need some extending studies for instance most researchers concentrate on the free surface form while ignoring the discussion of slamming forces in fact the functional relationship between the factors of asymmetrical impacting and thus causing the slamming force is quite important in the design of marine structure in addition the asymmetry for a two dimensional section should include two aspects heel angle and horizontal velocity the effects of these two kinds of asymmetry on the impacting hydrodynamics are studied individually in most of previous literature in fact they should be considered simultaneously because the horizontal velocity usually exists if the heel angle appears when the ship sails in actual marine environment remarkable contribution was made in krastev et al 2018 for the asymmetrical situation in there water entry problems of a wedge with different heel angles and horizontal velocities were simulated through a vof based algorithm and coupled with a laplacian mesh motion solver however asymmetrical impacting problem of the bow flared section is quite different from the wedge case take an example of the symmetric results of a ship bow section and wedge presented in sun 2007 the pressure of ship bow section is underestimated in the bottom region while it is overestimated in the upside area through comparing the results of wedge in same deadrise angle cases in addition complex flow phenomena i e flow separation and ventilation will occur more easily if the shape of a bulbous bow is considered once these phenomena are taken into account the numerical methods based on the potential flow theory may be not applicable on the other hand the effect of added mass is important due to the shell structural shape of ship which means the scale of a model can greatly influence the impacting hydrodynamics the best way to solve the hydrodynamic problem is to use a full scale model while the cpu time is huge the asymmetrical water entry of full scale section considering the geometrical and kinematic asymmetry simultaneously is not available yet this paper presents a detailed numerical study on this impacting problem in our work a full scale bow flared section is obtained from ultra large container ship and the process of entering into water with various heel angles and entry velocities is simulated using cfd method through the commercial code fluent where coupled vof based algorithm and dynamic mesh model is used the former solves the control equations and the latter achieves the body motion the rest parts are organized as follows in section 2 the details of mathematical model and numerical procedure of the asymmetrical impacting problem are presented in section 3 numerical method is verified by comparing other numerical and experimental results on a symmetrical ship bow section and asymmetry wedges and the convergence study is carried out by using three different mesh sizes in section 4 the impacting hydrodynamics including pile up water pressure and impacting forces are presented and discussed with various heel angles and horizontal velocities in section 5 some meaningful conclusions are summarized 2 mathematical model and numerical procedure in present work the cfd method obtained in the commercial code fluent is utilized to simulate the asymmetrical water entry problem a gas liquid two phase flow model is established and it is modeled through the vof method the body motion is achieved by using a dynamic mesh model the details of mathematical model and numerical procedure are presented as follows 2 1 mathematic model the two fluids water and air are supposed to immiscible and incompressible so the continuity and momentum equations can be written as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p μ 2 u f where p is the field pressure and u is the velocity vector ρ is the fluid density and μ is the dynamic viscosity f is the source term which denotes the gravity in this paper for two phase flow the pressure is discontinuous on the interface of air and water so a continuum surface force csf model in brackbill et al 1992 is adopted to correct it which expresses the interfacial pressure as a continuous function see fig 1 a the function can be written as 3 p t p b c 1 p a μ c n 0 c 1 p a c 0 where c α t α a is the location function of interface whose definition can be referring to fig 1 b n is the curvature of the interface then eq 2 can be rewritten as 4 u t u u 1 ρ p μ 2 u μ c n ρ ρ g for the water entry problem the free surface is always changing with time which causes the difficulty in solving control equations directly so the vof algorithm is adopted to model the two phase flow model by solving a single set of momentum equation and tracking the volume fraction of each fluid throughout the domain the tracking of free surface is accomplished by the solution of the continuity equation for the volume fraction of air the equation has the following form 5 α a t α a v r 0 where α a is the volume fraction of air α a 0 denotes the fluid in the grid is water whereas is air 0 α a 1 means this grid contains both water and air the v r is the transfer velocity the density and dynamic viscosity should be updated as 6 ρ α a ρ a 1 α a ρ w 7 μ α a ρ a μ a 1 α a ρ w μ w ρ where ρ a and μ a are the density and viscosity of air while ρ w and μ w are the density and viscosity of water eq 1 eq 4 and eq 5 are the basic equations of water entry problem using the vof algorithm 2 2 numerical procedure 2 2 1 n s solver eq 4 is solved by using the laminar flow solver in fluent which is based on the finite volume method if a two dimensional fluid problem is simulated the length in the neglectful dimensional direction is assumed as 1 m to satisfy the thought of finite volume in the discretization the pressure gradient and the source terms are firstly ignored which is corresponding to the predicted step so eq 4 is rewritten as 8 u t u u μ u the terms in eq 8 are discretized by using implicit eulerian format 9 u t d v d t u p r u p n v p 10 u u d v d t f f n u f r δ t 11 μ u d v d t μ f u r δ t where the superscript n and r represent the current time step the value is known and the predicted time step the value is unknown the subscript f represents the value on the grid surface vp is the grid volume δt is the time step f f is the flux the velocity u f r can be obtained by using a central difference according to volume centered velocities as u p r u n r 2 f u r is the gradient of face normal which can be written as 12 f u r s f u n n u p r d where the subscript p represents the velocity of the current grid and the subscript n denotes the velocity of adjacent grid s f is the module of face vector d is the distance of grids substitute eqs 9 12 into eq 8 and introduce the pressure gradient and source terms we have 13 a p u p r a n u n n e p n p n ρ g where 14 a p v p δ t f f n 2 μ s f d 15 a n f f n 2 μ s f d 16 e p v p δ t u p n in eq 13 the terms ap an and ep keep invariant and the only unknown term u p r can be solved in eq 13 in the numerical procedure the continuity equation eq 1 is not used and the predicted term u p r does not satisfy it so a piso algorithm introduced in issa 1986 is adopted to deal with the dilemma in fact the corrected term of pressure in eq 4 is not included but it can be realized in fluent through the pressure interpolation on the free surface uses presto pressure staggering option which is described in bender 1980 the gradient of pressure utilizes a green gauss node based method which can be found in rausch et al 1991 and this method has a second order precision 2 2 2 geometric reconstruction approach for free surface eq 5 is solved in explicit approach and the standard finite difference interpolation scheme is applied to calculate the volume fraction values which were obtained from the previous time step the discretization scheme is written as 17 α a n 1 ρ a n 1 α a n ρ a n δ t v f ρ a u f n α a f n 0 where the superscripts n and n 1 denote the index for the previous and current time step separately α a f is the face value of air volume fraction in this procedure the free surface can be described by the geometric reconstruction approach in there a standard interpolation scheme is implemented to obtain the face flux when this cell is completely filled with air or water αa 0 or 1 when the cell is near the interface of water and air 0 αa 1 a geometric reconstruction scheme is used by the piecewise linear approach described in youngs 1982 the first step in this reconstruction scheme is calculating the position of the linear interface relative to the center of each partially filled cell based on information about the volume fraction and its derivatives in the cell the second step is calculating the advecting amount of fluid through each face using the computed linear interface representation and information about the normal and tangential velocity distribution on the face the third step is calculating the volume fraction in each cell using the balance of fluxes calculated during the previous step 2 2 3 treatment of solid body the water entry problem of a body can be regarded as such a flow where the shape of the fluid domain is changing with time and the changing boundary is the outline of the body so a dynamic mesh model can be used to model this flow through defining the motion of moving zones the motion can be described by a prescribed motion such as specified velocities and angular velocities or an unpredictable motion where the subsequent motion is determined based on the solution at the current time such as free drop motion the update of the volume mesh is handled automatically by fluent at each time step based on the new positions of the moving boundaries two kinds of mesh morphing methods including spring based smoothing and local re meshing method are adopted in the present work to improve the mesh quality when the boundary of the fluid domain outline of the body is changed in each time step the force generated by the encompassing fluid reacting to the motion of body can be expressed as 18 f s w p i μ u u t n d s where i is the identity matrix s w is the body outline and n is the unit normal to the body the moment m of the force with respect to the body center of gravity can be calculated by the formula 19 m s w r p i μ u u t n d s where r is the position vector evaluated from the center of gravity once the forces and moment on the solid body are obtained the acceleration at the current time and velocities at next time can be computed by the newton s law more details can be found in iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 2 2 4 time stepping in the time stepping procedure the numerical simulation is achieved as follows step 1 give the initial pressure field velocity field and volume fraction step 2 the new positions of the body are predicted in the next time according to the given motion and the mesh is updated by using mesh morphing technique step 3 the volume fraction pressure and velocity fields are obtained by n s solver the flow field information is stored the iterative process continues by returning step 2 until the given time 2 3 boundary conditions fig 2 shows the illustration of the asymmetric water entry problem of an arbitrary two dimensional section the body drops with constant vertical velocity v horizontal velocity u and heel angle θ a cartesian coordinate system o y z is used where y axis is placed at the initial free surface s f and z axis is pointed upwards according to the study of facci et al 2016 the top of fluid domain is set as pressure outlet and the other three boundaries s c is set to no slip wall the outline of bow flared section is a moving zone in the fluid domain with the boundary condition of no slip wall the motion of the zone is specified through the function of velocities and time which can be realized in fluent by using a user defined function udf file the time t 0s means the bow flared section starts to touch the calm water surface and then it enters into water with constant velocities and heel angle the densities of water and air are 103 kg m3 and 1 25 kg m3 respectively the viscosity of water is 10 3kg m s and the air 10 5kg m s 3 validations and convergence study in this section the predicted results are firstly compared with experimental data to verify its applicability on an arbitrary two dimensional section through simulating the water entry process of a ship bow section meanwhile the convergence study of mesh is carried out then the numerical results of asymmetrical wedges are compared with experimental data and other available numerical ones in order to further verify the reliability on the asymmetric cases 3 1 verification and convergence study for the symmetrical ship bow section to verify the applicability of numerical simulation for an arbitrary section entering into water a ship bow section was chosen fig 3 a shows the geometrical shape of this section the total weight of the falling rig is 261 kg and the size of body is 0 32 m 0 24 m four pressure locations defined as p1 to p4 were measured in the experiment and the sketch of their detail locations is shown in fig 3 b in the simulation the drop height is 0 318 m with an initial velocity 2 44 m s touching the calm water surface the size of the computational domain is 4 m 3 m and the domain is discretized through a mesh pre processor icem cfd and tri quad unstructured mesh type is used although a free drop test is used to verify the numerical results the constant velocity during the water entry is adopted in the numerical simulation because the studied case in this paper is based on the assumption of constant velocity to show the convergence of mesh resolution three kinds of mesh sizes listed in table 1 are utilized the predicted results of local pressure at p4 and total slamming force are compared with ones of bem in sun 2007 and experimental method in aarsnes 1996 see fig 4 a and b the consequences of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are almost identical relative error 0 8 and they are closer to experimental values with the errors of 13 1 total force peak and 4 3 pressure peak it reflects the convergence can be guaranteed when the mesh size is enough small and the cell size of mesh 2 is enough to ensure the calculated accuracy for the comparison of numerical results in mesh 2 and experimental data the former is a little bigger than the latter with the errors of 7 8 total force peak and 4 3 pressure peak on the one hand the increment of velocity in experiment can cause a more impacting force than the numerical results where the velocity increases about 13 in the free fall motion on the other hand the 3d effect can reduce the maximum 8 for this section according to the analysis in zhao et al 1996 so these two effects on the agreement between numerical and experimental results are opposite where the former enlarge the experimental values while the latter reduce it that is why the differences are still small even though we do not consider the variation of velocity the predicted pressure is also compared in fig 4 c f reasonable agreement can be found actually there are phase differences in some measured locations i e p2 and p3 the reason is that it is difficult to fully determine the time when the body touches the water due to the oscillation of falling rig in addition the pressure of p1 p4 reaches maximum values almost simultaneously t 0 06s such a consequence is quite different from that appeared in the wedge case where the maximum pressure in different positions occurs successively for example aarsnes 1996 also performed the drop test of a wedge for the time history of pressure for a drop height 0 313 m pressure at p1 p4 reaches maximum values at the time instants 0 006s 0 009s 0 012s 0 017s and 0 022s respectively further pressure time history for ship bow section means the high pressure area covers almost the entire surface when the water impacts the flare region according to contrastive analysis the time history of pressure can be predicted preferably and impacting characters of ship bow section can also be observed clearly by the present cfd method 3 2 verifications for asymmetric wedges to further verify the availability of numerical method on the asymmetric cases water entry problems of asymmetric wedges were simulated and the results were compared with available experimental data and other numerical results the wedge model with adjustable deadrise angle was chosen according to the experiment of barjasteh et al 2016 the total mass is 44 kg and the side length is 0 205 m four pressure sensors were placed defined as p1 p2 p3 and p4 the sketch of their locations is illustrated in fig 5 in the computation two kinds of deadrise angles β 20 and 30 are used and the heel angles are set as θ 5 10 and 15 in each case so in the asymmetrical situation the actual deadrise angle on the left side is β θ and right side β θ the drop height is 0 5 m with the initial water entry velocity v 3 13 m s in fact only vertical free drop motion is guaranteed as the horizontal motion and inclination angle is restricted in the experiment and the experimental velocity and acceleration are unavailable if the freedom body motion is adopted in the simulation like section 3 1 there will appear the horizontal motion and rotational motion the difference of motion can greatly influence the impacting pressure to better compare other numerical results the assumption of constant velocities and heel angle is used during the water entry process which means the gravity effect is ignored in our simulations the predicted pressure distribution on the wetted surface at the time instant of p2 reaching maximum is compared with other numerical results which are from toyama 1993 and hu et al 2018 see fig 6 in these figures the non dimensional horizontal distance x cl and pressure coefficient c p 2 p ρ w v 2 are adopted where cl is the wetted width on the left side the analytical solution of toyama 1993 overestimated the pressure when the deadrise angle is less than 100 i e fig 6 b and c beyond that the present results agree well with other numerical solutions when the inclination angle increases in particular for the solutions obtained by hu et al 2018 considering the analytical solution is based on the potential flow theory while the cip method of hu et al 2018 and vof method of present study are based on the computational fluid dynamics technology it means the cfd method has a better prediction when the inclination angle is smaller less than 100 4 results and discussion of a bow flared section in this section a full scale two dimensional bow flared section with the size of 58 4 m 38 5 m from the ultra large container ship ulcs is chosen to analyze the pile up water the left and right wetted height of pile up water d 1 and d 2 and the reference distances r 1 and r 2 above calm water surface are defined as shown in fig 7 a four pressure points are monitored in each side and the sketch of their locations is illustrated in fig 7 b it can be seen that the shape of a bulbous bow is considered in our study which is different to the ship bow section showed in fig 3 a where the bulbous bow is replaced by a smoothed curve such the difference will lead to ventilation occur more easily in general the dimension of the fluid domain should be 4 or 5 times bigger than the dimension of the rigid body in the symmetrical case for the asymmetrical problem the body moves to the right side due to the horizontal velocity it means a larger size in the domain is required in order to minimize the boundary effect if the dimension of fluid domain is ten times larger than the body boundary effect on the calculated results can be ignored even though the body completely moves to the right side to discuss conveniently the size of fluid domain in all simulated cases is 700 m 620 m the cell size is determined according to the convergence study in section 3 1 and the mesh 2 is adopted the minimum cell size is 0 23 m 0 15 m and the maximum cell size is 4 m 2 m in the domain with a total number about 3 1e5 fig 8 shows the details of mesh including the whole fluid domain and part domain nearby the body the density of mesh is increased in three regions closed to the outline of body body motion region and nearby free surface we can see the mesh is quite sparse than that shown in krastev et al 2018 which can reduce the calculated time tremendously even so the precision is enough in terms of the validations in section 3 it should own to the application of dynamic mesh technology in time stepping process which allows a larger mesh size and provides enough accuracy the purpose of paper is to discuss the effect of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry on impacting hydrodynamics so the gravity effect is ignored to avoid the variation of velocities during the water entry process which means the assumption of constant velocities and heel angle is applied in the numerical simulation in each simulation the total time is 3 3s with a time step 0 005s and the cpu time is about 1 h in a pc with intel core i7 7700 k processor and 8 gigabytes of memory in the computation the initial vertical velocity is 11 m s and four heel angles 0 10 20 and 30 are included in there the ratio of vertical velocity v and horizontal velocity u is defined as ε u v which are chosen as 0 0 45 0 91 and 1 36 the heel angle is regarded as geometrical asymmetry and the horizontal velocity is kinematic asymmetry in our discussion to gain a better insight on how the asymmetry affects impacting hydrodynamics the non dimensional coefficients of pressure forces and moment are defined as follows 20 c p 2 p ρ w v 2 21 c f y 2 f y ρ w v 2 l 22 c f z 2 f z ρ w v 2 l 23 c m x 2 m x ρ w v 2 l 2 where ρ w is the density of water l is breadth of bow flared section and v is the magnitude of velocity vector as v u 2 v 2 the p f y f z and m x are the slamming pressure horizontal force vertical force and torque moment respectively the c p c fy c fz and c mx are the corresponding non dimensional coefficients 4 1 pile up water analysis a major character of asymmetrical impacting is that it has more complex free surface form than the symmetrical case four essential results of free surface evolution are presented in figs 9 12 they are symmetrical case symmetrical geometry and asymmetric kinematics case asymmetrical geometry and symmetric kinematics case asymmetrical geometry and kinematics case separately in fig 9 the symmetry of fluid flow can be guaranteed the other three figures show three kinds of typical pile up water forms defined as type a type b and type c type a is the flow separation does not occur until the water submerges body see fig 10 type b is the flow separation occurs at the bulbous bow location see fig 11 type c is the flow separation almost occurs at the beginning of impacting see fig 12 for type a it can be observed that the pile up water on the right side rises more quickly than the left side t 1 0s see fig 10 a b with the time increasing 1 0s t 1 8s the difference reduces see fig 10 c d it indicates the body impedes the fluid go up more severely at this stage due to the decrease of fluid velocity after the fluid separates from the body t 0 18s it rises without constraint and the difference of ascending fluid velocity on the two sides further enlarges see fig 10 e f in figs 11 and 12 the characters of pile up water on the right side are similar to the law showed in fig 10 except the more prominent jet flow however quite a difference can be observed on the left side in fig 11 the flow separation happens at the bulbous bow which makes the pile up water rise slower without hindrance of body see fig 11 a e in fact the separated fluid will hit the flared area with the increase of time and the cavitation is generated see fig 11 f such the phenomenon can lead to ventilation and thus cause some negative pressure area in fig 12 more obvious flow separation is occurred so that the left side is always dry during the impacting process now we discuss the effect of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry on the pile up water qualitatively pile up water forms showed in figs 10 and 12 have the same θ but different ε and the former is type a as the latter is type b correspondingly in figs 11 and 12 where they have the different θ and same ε but both of them are type b it shows the pile up water form can change easily through the different horizontal velocity but it is difficult to change by the variation of the heel angle from this point of view a conclusion can be drawn that the kinematic asymmetry horizontal velocity has a greater influence on the pile up water than the geometrical asymmetry heel angle to discuss the effect of pile up water on the pressure the pressure distribution at t 0 6s 1 0s 1 4s 1 8s 2 2s and 2 6s which are corresponding to the free surface evolution shown in figs 9 12 are presented in fig 13 where the negative value of z denotes the value of z direction on the left side shown in fig 7 b pressure distribution is basically symmetrical in fig 13 a because the simulated model is symmetrical there appears some negative pressure in fig 13 b when the fluid goes through the bulbous bow such as at t 0 6s 1s and 1 4s the negative pressure declines with the time and finally becomes positive value actually it is caused by the so called ventilation but the pressure doesn t always keep negative which implies the ventilation phenomenon vanishes with the water entry depth increasing the maximum of pressure on the right side is about 70 larger than that on the left side when the air effect exists t 1 4s while this otherness expands to 275 when the ventilation disappears t 1 8s after flow separation happens the right pressure decreases rapidly such as at t 2 2s and 2 6s in fig 13 c the asymmetry of pressure distribution on the two sides is more evident on the left side the pressure nearby the bulbous bow keeps negative all the time which means that the ventilation always exists during the water entry progress in fig 13 d there is hardly any pressure on the left side because the fluid does not encircle the body surface on the right side the pressure is enlarging with the increase of water entry depth until the flow separation occurs t 1 8s after that the pressure tends to stable in fact fig 13 b 13 d show the effects of three different pile up forms on the pressure the maximum difference value of cp on the two sides can be regarded as an evaluation index ψ to discuss the degree of asymmetry the values of ψ in these three kinds of pile up water forms are 3 3 7 35 and 8 4 respectively it can be seen that the values of ψ are almost same in type b and type c while they are much larger than that in type a on the other hand type b is basically similar to type c except that the separated flow can hit the body in type b however the main difference in type b and type a is the former appears the flow separation while the latter does not so the reason caused larger pressure difference on the two sides is the flow separation to discuss conveniently the pile up water forms are divided into two kinds again type 1 and type 2 because the otherness of ψ in type b and type c is tiny the former is with flow separation i e type b and type c and the latter is without it i e type a fig 14 shows the dividing line in all simulated cases the upside of dividing line is type 1 and the downside is type 2 two pile up water coefficients r1 d1 and r2 d2 are compared as a function of heel angle θ and velocity ratio ε to further analyze the characters of fluid see fig 15 firstly we focus on the changing law of these two coefficients with time in fig 15 a when the fluid does not separate from the body type 2 the coefficient r1 d1 firstly decreases and then increases referring to figs 9 12 the declining stage is corresponding to the time quantum before the water submerging body while the ascent stage is the time instant after that on the contrary when the fluid form is type 1 the coefficients are almost invariable this phenomenon is quite different from the situation of asymmetrical wedge which is presented in hu et al 2018 and the coefficients are nearly constant in all cases whether the flow separation occurs or not this difference means the pile up water of bow flared section is no longer self similar in fig 15 b the flow separation does not occur in all simulated cases and the law of r2 d2 shows it firstly decreases and then increases which is similar to that reflected in fig 15 a according to the above analysis the flow separation mainly affects the changing law of coefficients when it happens the pile up water coefficient tends to a constant value otherwise it firstly decreases and then increases with time then we concentrate on the values of coefficients and use a time mean value φ to inflect the asymmetry fig 16 shows the values of φ in different heel angles and horizontal velocities in fig 16 a when ε 0 type 1 flow occurs the φ can reach 0 3 and does not change with θ beyond that it increases with ε and θ which means the effects of ε and θ are both important in fig 16 b the φ increases gradually with ε while it remains almost unchanged with different θ it reflects the horizontal velocity has great influence on the pile up water while the effect of heel angle is not so important which is not clear in krastev et al 2018 in addition the values of φ on the right side are generally greater than the left side it means the pile up water is more obvious when the deadrise angle is smaller 4 2 pressure characters the impacting hydrodynamic pressure is significant in aspect of marine structure and they are illustrated in fig 17 fig 19 fig 17 illustrates the pressure time history of p4 in different heel angles and horizontal velocities which represents the pressure characters on the right side in fig 17 a it is clearly seen that the pressure peak increases dramatically with heel angle and the maximum relative increment can reach 366 from θ 00 to 300 such the phenomenon can be easily understood by noting that the effective impacting angle is lower when the heel angle is larger and thus the impacting pressure becomes bigger according to the results of wedges in zhao and faltinsen 1993 in addition the duration of impacting is less when the heel angle is larger the reason is not only the vertical distance above calm water surface becomes smaller but also the velocity of pile up water becomes larger with the increase of heel angle fig 17 also reflects the effect of horizontal velocity on the pressure when we treat these four pictures fig 17 a d as a whole it shows that the cp reduces with the increase of velocity ratio ε and the maximum reduction can reach 39 considering the mechanics essence of pressure on the body is the reaction of blocking the fluid and is proportional to the square of vertical penetration velocity so such a consequence can be explained from two aspects one is the vertical penetration velocity decreases when the horizontal velocity increases because the intersection angle of body surface and resultant velocity becomes smaller on the other hand horizontal velocity enhances the kinematic asymmetry while the defined pressure coefficient is not influenced by horizontal velocity in theoretically because it is normalized however the reduction of cp does not mean the actual value of pressure reduces because the velocity scale also aggrandizes in fact it only implies the effect of horizontal velocity on the pressure is not so important than the vertical velocity correspondingly fig 18 shows the time history of cp on the left side and the position of p8 is chosen in fig 18 a the pressure decreases about 87 from θ 00 to θ 300 the reason is that there has larger deadrise angle when the heel angle increases on the other hand the pressure slows down quickly until zero with the horizontal velocity increasing if the pressure is equivalent to zero it illustrates the water no longer touches body surface which is so called flow separation it means the flow separation has a significant influence on the pressure a boundary constituted by the combination of heel angle and velocity ratio defined as θ ε can be utilized to distinguish whether or not flow separation happens which can be seen in fig 14 fig 19 shows the pressure distribution on the body surface when the pressure of p4 reaches maximum value the pressure asymmetry on the two sides becomes quite clear with the increment of θ and ε when the horizontal velocity augments the shape of pressure distribution on the right side keeps invariant but it changes a lot on the left side e g the pressure value changes from positive to negative this phenomenon can be explained according to the different pile up water forms shown in figs 9 12 on the other hand for same ε the shape does not change with θ but for same θ the shape changes with ε it means the horizontal velocity affects the pressure distribution more greatly than the heel angle especially on the left side 4 3 impacting forces differing from the symmetrical impacting there are three kinds of forces on the asymmetrical cases horizontal force vertical force and torque moment the non dimensional coefficients of them are used in this section which can be found in eqs 21 23 the tendency of horizontal force with different heel angles and horizontal velocities is illustrated in fig 20 for ε 0 when θ 0 this force tends to zero such the consequence accords with the physics fact that the model is symmetric when θ 0 the cfy rises with the augment of θ and its negative value means the direction of force points to the left hand the increment of horizontal force is caused by the larger difference of pressure distribution on the two sides which can be clearly seen from fig 19 however the otherness of cfy in different θ is diminishing when ε is larger e g the difference value of maximum horizontal force between θ 300 and θ 00 is up to 2 44 in fig 20 a while it becomes 0 1 in fig 20 d even though the heel angle can increase the horizontal force its effect is limited when the ε becomes larger e g in fig 20 d the effect of θ can be ignored that means the horizontal velocity plays a decisive role on the cfy because it can weaken the effect of heel angles to explain this phenomenon detailedly we chose body as the reference system and then the impacting problem can be regarded as the problem of water hitting body when the body inclines to the incoming flow it prevents the incoming flow less it means the pressure on the right side will reduce and thus the horizontal force mainly depended on the different pressure distribution on the two sides will reduce the vertical force is reported in fig 21 when ε 0 the cfz increases 182 from θ 00 to θ 300 because the effective impacting angle becomes smaller noticeably this augment is nonlinear when θ 20 the cfz changes little about 4 while it grows quickly about 97 when θ 20 such an incremental tendency becomes closer to linear when ε is larger i e in fig 21 c it implies that the vertical force is mainly influenced by the heel angle however the actual vertical force really rises with the horizontal velocity increasing when we no longer use the non dimension coefficient it means the horizontal velocity can also enlarge the vertical force which is not like what we think that the horizontal velocity only influences the horizontal force fig 22 presents the torque moment coefficient differing to the appearance of cfy and cfz the cmx has a rising tendency in the time quantum after it reaches the maximum in some cases for example in fig 22 d when t 2s the cmx goes up again the reason is the effect of horizontal velocity because this situation does not appear when the ε 0 45 in addition when θ or ε becomes larger the cmx will increase it means that the effects of horizontal velocity and heel angle on the torque moment both are important the maximum values of impacting forces and torque moment coefficients are reported in fig 23 as a function of heel angle θ and velocity ration ε to discuss the geometrical and kinematic asymmetry in fig 23 a the cfy increases with heel angle when ε 0 in fact the features of cfy are corresponding to the fluid forms referring to the boundary using for distinguishing flow separation in fig 14 when the flow form is type 1 the cfy is no longer depended on θ and it has a linear growth with ε according to the analysis of section 4 1 the flow separation is sensitive to ε it means the horizontal force is mainly depended on the kinematic asymmetry in fig 23 b the effect of ε on the cfz can be ignored until θ 20 in view of the cfz is mainly determined on the high pressure side the effect of θ is similar to the symmetric cases where the deadrise angle is smaller the vertical force is larger it reflects the vertical force mainly comes from the geometrical asymmetry for torque coefficient in fig 23 c when θ 10 the effect of ε can be ignored further increasing θ the coefficient cmz grows linearly with ε for same ε the cmz increases with θ it can be observed that there is no obvious boundary in θ and ε which is not like cfy influenced by flow separation it means the torque moment not only results from geometrical asymmetry but also comes from kinematic asymmetry 5 conclusions the asymmetrical water impact of a full scale bow flared section from ultra large container ship was numerically investigated using cfd technology in commercial code fluent which couples a vof based algorithm and the dynamic mesh model in the numerical simulation a two phase flow model is established based on n s equations to consider the flow separation and air effect the control equations are discretized through the finite volume method and then solved through the vof based algorithm the free surface is tracked by the geometric reconstruction approach according to the volume fraction the body motion is achieved by defining a dynamic boundary condition in the dynamic mesh model in the simulated cases four heel angles 0 10 20 and 30 and four horizontal velocities 0 m s 5 m s 10 m s and 15 m s are utilized to discuss the geometrical and kinematic asymmetry in this paper impacting hydrodynamics including the pile up water pressure and forces are paid more attention the numerical validations for the water entry impacting of a symmetric ship bow section and asymmetric wedges were carried out for the ship bow section good agreement on the pressure time history is achieved it indicates the present method can predict the slamming loads preferably for arbitrary two dimensional sections meanwhile the mesh convergence was studied by using three different mesh sizes when the dimensional ratio of minimum cell and body is less 0 02 the convergence of results can be guaranteed for asymmetrical wedges the contrastive results of the present method and other numerical methods demonstrate the reliability of present method in predicting pressure distribution for asymmetrical cases in addition the numerical results based on the potential flow theory can overestimate the pressure peak when the deadrise angle is less than 10 while the predicted results based on the cfd method has a better adaptation for smaller deadrise angle less than 100 cases the characters of free surface dynamics on the different combinations of geometrical and kinetic asymmetry were analyzed detailedly three different fluid forms can be observed clearly and they are reclassified into two kinds according to the evaluation index ψ which represents the asymmetrical degree in the simulated cases type 1 is with flow separation and type 2 is without flow separation the pressure distribution on the body at different time instants shows that on the junction of bulbous bow and flared area the air effect is important which directly influences the negative pressure area especially at the time instant of flow separation happening two coefficients r1 d1 and r2 d2 were defined to quantify the pile up water characters when the flow separation occurs the fluid is no longer self similar on the contrary the fluid is nearly self similar such the situation is quite different from the cases of asymmetrical wedges where the pile up water is always self similar the general conclusion of pile up water as a function of θ and ε is that the kinematic asymmetry has greater influence on the pile up water when the ε 0 45 otherwise the geometrical asymmetry is important pressure characters including the time history and pressure distribution were discussed on geometrical and kinematic asymmetry if ε is less than 0 45 the pressure on the right side increases nonlinearly with θ due to the smaller effective impacting angle while the increment vanishes gradually when ε 0 45 for the pressure on the left side it reduces with the increase of θ when ε 0 45 as it keeps zero if ε 0 45 due to the influence of flow separation in addition the shape of pressure distribution keeps invariant on the right side as it varies from positive to negative on the left side when the ε increases in fact the pressure complexity can own to different pile up water forms if the flow separation does not occur type 2 the effect of geometrical asymmetry on pressure is important otherwise the kinematic asymmetry is significant the non dimensional body forces were analyzed as the combination of θ and ε the ε can affect the horizontal force immensely even counteracts the effect of heel angle when the ε 0 45 which means the horizontal force is greatly depended on the kinematic asymmetry for vertical force it basically keeps invariant with ε which reflects the vertical force mainly comes from geometrical asymmetry for the torque moment the effects of geometrical and kinetic asymmetry are both important because it will increase with θ or ε and there is no larger difference between these two kinds of asymmetry future studies should be focused on the experimental study on asymmetric bow flared section including the pressure on the

23408,the problem of a floating ice sheet failure caused by stresses induced in ice by temperature changes at its top surface is investigated the ice cover is modelled as a plate of uniform thickness which is laterally constrained at its edges by rigid walls and is assumed to deform and ultimately fail by the mechanism of creep buckling the floating plate is subjected to in plane compressive stresses developing in ice to prevent its lateral expansion due to heating and is transversely vertically bent by the forces acting at its base and caused by the reaction of underlying water the sea ice is treated as a material whose elastic and viscous properties depend on its porosity and current temperature and therefore vary with the depth of ice the results of simulations carried out for a variety of ice plate spans thicknesses and temperature change scenarios illustrate the evolution of creep buckles in the plate prior to its failure and show the time variation of the magnitudes of forces exerted by ice on the constraining walls keywords floating ice thermal expansion plate creep buckling ice structure interaction 1 introduction floating sea lake or river ice like any material expands when subjected to heating surprisingly little attention has been paid yet to this phenomenon and its consequences for civil engineering despite the fact that thermally induced forces developing in ice due to its in plane expansion especially in cases when ice is constrained in lateral directions can reach magnitudes which are dangerous for the safety of engineering structures this work addresses one of the problems that can be of interest to civil engineers namely the forces which a floating ice sheet exerts on a structure due to ice heating at its top surface are determined and their time variation during the heating process is investigated the analysis is carried out on the assumption that the forces developing in ice and then transferred to a structure originate from the elastic reaction of the medium to its thermally induced expansion being prevented by constraints imposed on the ice deformation by the structure walls once in plane elastic compressive forces have occurred in the ice cover the ice starts to deform by viscous creep giving rise to its off plane buckling which ultimately leads to the ice failure when the ice flexural strength is exceeded the topic of a floating ice sheet behaviour under the action of in plane axial forces and off plane transverse loads due to the underlying water reaction has been analysed by a number of investigators the problem of elastic buckling of a floating plate was solved in the papers by kerr 1978 nevel 1980 and sanderson 1988 in which approximate estimates for the magnitudes of the buckling forces derived analytically are given the approximate formulae proposed in these papers were subsequently refined and corrected by staroszczyk 2002 on the basis of results obtained from finite element calculations some relevant analytical results can be also found in the work by kerr and palmer 1972 and experimental data on the elastic buckling of ice have been reported by sodhi et al 1983 a more realistic problem of creep buckling of floating ice was treated by sjölind 1985 sanderson 1988 staroszczyk 2003 and staroszczyk and hedzielski 2004 in none of the above papers the thermally induced loads and their effects on the ice plate behaviour were investigated in the present paper an attempt is made to examine how the mechanical response of ice is affected by the changes in the temperature field on the ice surface hence thermally induced axial stresses are accounted for in the balance of all the forces acting on a floating plate and the effects of these thermal stresses on the mechanism of the ice creep buckling and the subsequent ice failure are studied of prime interest are the magnitudes of the forces exerted by ice on the walls constraining the plate in the horizontal direction and the evolution of these forces as the ice creep deformation proceeds until the instant of the ice flexural fracture the evolution of the thermally induced forces within the ice plate is not only due to the rise in temperature at the ice top surface but also due to the progressive vertical heat transfer through the ice from its top to the bottom the latter process results in the variation of the elastic and viscous properties of the material which are assumed to be temperature dependent therefore the plate cannot be treated as a homogeneous since its mechanical properties vary with depth further the evolution of the plate deflection surface with increasing thermally induced axial loads is investigated with the analysis of the characteristics of buckles which grow in time as the ice deformation progresses the analysis of the floating ice sheet behaviour is carried out by applying the classical theory of thin plates resting on an elastic foundation timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 the equations formulating the problem considered are given in section 2 together with the relations describing the temperature dependence of the elastic and viscous properties of ice in section 3 the method of solution of the equation governing the creep deformation of the plate is presented and the analysis of fundamental properties of this solution is carried out section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the results of numerical simulations carried out for assumed temperature variation scenarios the results illustrate the effects of the plate thickness and length on the creep behaviour of the ice and the magnitudes of the forces acting on the walls constraining the ice finally some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation the problem under consideration is depicted in fig 1 an ice sheet is modelled as a plate of uniform thickness h and length l and is assumed to be constrained by vertical rigid walls at the plate ends at x 0 and x l the vertical coordinate axis z is directed downwards with z 0 at the upper surface of the plate and z h at the base of the plate the plate deflection surface is denoted by the function w x t with t denoting time and w 0 for the downward deflection the plate of ice is floating on the surface of underlying water which exerts an elastic reaction on the ice proportional to the plate deflection the ice top surface is subjected to the action of varying in time temperature t t with the ice at the base z h being at the melting point temperature t m all the time and t t m throughout the ice plate it is assumed that at the initial time t 0 the plate is stress free that is it is in equilibrium under an initial distribution of temperature in the plate for simplicity a plane strain problem is analysed here so that the ice plate can be treated as a beam of uniform width with its elastic flexural rigidity adjusted accordingly to account for the zero deformations in the lateral direction normal to the plane o x z in accordance with the standard theory of thin plates timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 it is assumed that the plate deflections are small that is they are of the order of the plate thickness and the plate cross sections which are normal to the middle plane in the undeformed state remain plane and normal to the middle surface of the deformed plate the plate is bent in the transverse vertical directions by loads coming from the reaction of the underlying water base these loads are denoted by q in fig 1 b and their result is either the lifting of the plate or its depression from the floating equilibrium state besides the bending the plate is also subjected to the action of in plane axial forces which in our case are generated by the changes in the ice temperature let denote the internal forces acting per unit width of the plate as m q and n see fig 1 b where m is the bending moment q is the vertical shear force and n is the normal tensile force then neglecting the own weight of the plate and the inertia forces due to negligibly small velocities of ice the equilibrium balances of forces in the z axis direction and the bending moments acting on an infinitesimal plate element give the relations 1 q x n 2 w x 2 q m x q the transverse distributed load q is equal to the underlying water reaction the latter is assumed to be elastic and linearly proportional to the local plate deflection w the winkler zimmerman type foundation hence the load q is expressed by 2 q ϱ w g w where ϱ w is the water density and g is the acceleration due to gravity by eliminating now the shear force q from equation 1 and using 2 one obtains the differential equation 3 2 m x 2 n 2 w x 2 ϱ w g w where m and n are the functions of x and t the above internal forces are defined in terms of the normal stresses σ x x by the relations 4 n 0 h σ x x d z m 0 h σ x x z d z the stresses σ x x in equation 4 are related to the plate deformations and their rates by constitutive relations describing the physical properties of the material and its response to loading it is well known mellor 1980 sanderson 1988 that at typical stress levels occurring in sea ice equal to about 1 mpa the creep strains in ice exceed the elastic ones in a matter of about 1 min from the start of loading thus the dominant mode of deformation in floating ice is viscous creep and hence this type of the material response is considered in the analysis of the problem under investigation however the elastic behaviour of ice is also important since the axial force causing the buckling of the plate arises due to the elastic reaction of the body to heating in order to describe the viscous response of ice a constitutive law of the reiner rivlin type schulkes et al 1998 morland and staroszczyk 1998 is employed 5 σ i j ζ μ d k k δ i j 2 μ d i j i j k 1 2 3 where the summation convention for repeated indices applies in 5 δ i j is the kronecker symbol ζ and μ denote the bulk and shear viscosities of ice respectively and d i j are the components of the strain rate tensor the latter components are defined by 6 d i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i i j 1 2 3 where v i denote the ice velocity vector components here of interest is only the strain rate component d x x due to the plate bending and this is given in terms of the curvature rate of the plate deflection surface by the relation 7 d x x κ z z 0 2 w x 2 z z 0 in the latter equation κ is the plate deflection curvature along the x axis the superposed dot denotes the time derivative and z 0 defines the position of the neutral plane in the undeformed state in equation 7 the plate curvature is defined in terms of w by κ 2 w x 2 which is a good approximation as long as w and w x 2 are small quantities with the axial strain rate given by 7 the axial stress σ x x determined by the constitutive law 5 and the bending moment m defined by 4 the equilibrium equation 3 becomes 8 r 4 w x 4 p 2 w x 2 ϱ w g w 0 where p n is the in plane compressive force which arises due to the heating of the plate the parameter r is the viscous flexural rigidity of the plate an analogue of the elastic plate rigidity and is defined by 9 r 0 h ζ a z z z 0 d z where ζ a is the axial viscosity of ice given by 10 ζ a μ ζ note that r is a temperature dependent quantity since the ice viscosity is very sensitive to temperature the position of the neutral plane z 0 is determined from the condition that the resultant normal force n due to the plate bending in the absence of in plane axial loading is zero hence by inserting into the first equation in 4 the axial stress σ x x calculated from the law 5 for d x x given by 7 one obtains the relation 11 0 h ζ a z z z 0 d z 0 the above equation determines the neutral plane position as 12 z 0 i 1 i 2 i 1 0 h ζ a z z d z i 2 0 h ζ a z d z the parameter z 0 is temperature dependent as well since it varies with the changing distribution of temperature along the plate depth as the ice heating progresses and the ice viscosity evolves obviously for the viscosity ζ a being uniform across the plate equations 12 yield z 0 h 2 the differential equation 8 for the ice plate deflection evolution is solved with the boundary conditions at x 0 and x l representing the case of a simply supported plate since other types of boundary conditions such as clamping at the plate edges are much less realistic sanderson 1988 formally these conditions are expressed by 13 x 0 w 0 2 w x 2 0 x l w 0 2 w x 2 0 the formation of creep buckles requires an initial imperfection in the plate deflection surface w x otherwise if w x 0 the plate would buckle only in an elastic manner that is under much larger loads than those generated by the ice heating therefore it is assumed that at t 0 the plate deflection w x consists of a number of harmonic components with randomly selected small amplitudes see section 4 besides the plate deflection evolution equation 8 also a heat conduction equation governing the evolution of temperature t z t in ice must be solved this equation has the form 14 t t a 2 t x 2 where a 1 15 10 6 m 2 s 1 is the thermal diffusivity of ice the solution of 14 provides current vertical distributions of ice temperature which affect the magnitudes of the elastic and viscous parameters and their vertical distributions along the depth of ice given the current temperature t z t and its difference δ t z t relative to the temperature t 0 z in the initial stable state of the ice plate the axial force p t due to the elastic response of the material is defined by 15 p t α 0 h δ t z t e z t 1 ν 2 z t d z where α 5 2 10 5 k 1 is the thermal expansion coefficient for ice and e is the young elastic modulus the force p determined by 15 cannot exceed the force causing the elastic buckling of the plate which is given by kerr 1978 16 p e 2 ϱ w g d p where d p is the elastic flexural rigidity of the plate defined by 17 d p 0 h z z 0 2 e z t 1 ν 2 z t d z the temperature dependence of the young modulus is adopted in the form proposed by sinha 1989 for the isotropic granular ice known as t1 ice 18 e t 8 93 1 2 10 2 t m t gpa where t m is the ice melting temperature the same author expressed the temperature dependence of poisson s ratio as 19 ν t 0 308 7 10 5 t m t it is seen from the latter relation that ν is practically insensitive to t and therefore can be treated as a constant at small variations of t in contrast to the elastic properties of ice its creep properties are known to be very sensitive to temperature especially in the range of temperatures close to the ice melting point t m that is in the range of our interest here in order to describe the temperature dependence of viscosity a representation derived by smith and morland 1981 is adopted 20 μ t μ t m 0 68 exp 12 t 0 32 exp 3 t 1 with the same scaling applying to the bulk viscosity ζ t is a dimensionless temperature defined by t t t m 20 c as it follows from 20 a temperature decrease say from 1 c to 5 c results in a viscosity increase by a factor of about 3 5 another important factor that affects the mechanical strength of sea ice is its porosity which usually increases with the depth of ice weeks 2010 the reduction of the young elastic modulus e with increasing porosity n can be described by approximate formulae obtained by hutter 1983 as a fit to experimental results 21 e e 0 1 5 n for 0 n 0 15 47 0 15 n 3 46 0 15 n 2 0 5 0 15 n 0 25 for 0 15 n 0 4 0 06 1 n for 0 4 n 1 where e 0 is the value of e for pure pore free ice at a given temperature it is seen from 21 that the elastic modulus decreases quite considerably with n for instance its value is reduced by 25 for the porosity as small as 0 05 which is a typical value for young ice because of the lack of relevant data it is assumed that the ice viscosity magnitudes ζ and μ are reduced for porous ice in the same manner as the elastic modulus e that is by applying formulae 21 finally of importance is also the weakening effect of ice porosity on the ice flexural strength σ f the maximum tensile stress which ice can bear during its bending a formula proposed by timco and o brien 1994 is adopted to describe the ice strength reduction with increasing n 22 σ f 1 76 exp 5 88 n mpa the latter relation predicts for the ice porosity n 0 05 the value of σ f 0 47 mpa which means a significant 73 reduction of the strength compared to that of pure non porous ice 3 creep buckling problem solution the first order in time and fourth order in space partial differential equation 8 describes the creep behaviour of an ice plate in response to the compressive force p arising due to the plate heating recall that r and p in the equation are both the functions of time the solution of 8 is constructed by the method of separation of variables on account of the boundary conditions 13 we adopt a general solution of 8 in the form 23 w x t k 1 m a k t sin k π x l being a superposition of m harmonic in space components with the respective amplitudes a k varying in time by substituting 23 into 8 one obtains the equation 24 k 1 m r k π l 4 a k p k π l 2 a k ϱ w g a k sin k π x l 0 since the system of functions sin k π x l k 1 m is orthogonal on the interval 0 x l the ice plate span equation 24 can be transformed into a system of m equations each of which describing separately the evolution of the amplitude a k t k 1 m accordingly one has to solve the following set of m equations 25 r k π l 4 a k p k π l 2 ϱ w g a k 0 k 1 m which can be rewritten in an equivalent form as 26 a k t 1 r t l k π 2 p t ϱ w g l k π 2 a k t k 1 m this system of first order differential equations was solved numerically by applying the crank nicolson scheme to calculate the amplitudes a k t of harmonic components for t 0 starting from an initial slightly perturbed deflection curve at t 0 see equation 30 in the next section these amplitudes are used to determine from 23 the current plate deflection curve w x t and then its curvature rate κ necessary for the evaluation of the stresses σ x x z by applying relations 7 and 5 these stresses in turn are then checked against the parameters σ f the flexural strength of ice and σ c the compressive strength of ice to determine the instant of the plate failure before proceeding further it is of interest to investigate the behaviour of buckles depending on their current length and the current magnitude of the compressive axial force p t for this purpose let analyse the evolution of a buckle of a half wavelength λ which by analogy to 26 is described by equation 27 a t 1 r λ π 2 p ϱ w g λ π 2 a t where a t is the current amplitude of a given buckle it follows from the above equation that the buckle length λ will grow with time only when the expression in the square brackets is positive and reversely it will decay with time when this expression is negative a stationary state with w x t not changing at a given time t takes place when the term in the brackets is zero this determines a critical length of the stationary buckle λ c which is defined by 28 λ c π p ϱ w g any existing creep buckles λ k for which λ k λ c will grow whereas those for which λ k λ c will decrease at the current magnitude of the force p which evolves with time relation 27 can be also used to determine the length λ of a buckle which grows at the greatest rate this can be done by differentiating 27 with respect to λ and setting the resulting expression to zero to find the value of λ which maximizes the buckle growth rate it turns out that the fastest growing buckle has the half wavelength λ 0 given by 29 λ 0 π p 2 ϱ w g it is seen from relations 28 and 29 that the critical and the fastest growing dominant buckle half wavelengths are at the ratio λ c λ 0 2 4 numerical simulations the theoretical model described in the two previous sections has been used to simulate the behaviour of a floating ice plate subjected at its upper surface to the action of increasing temperature in the simulations the following material parameters were adopted young s modulus e t 0 c 8 93 gpa poisson s ratio ν 0 308 treated as being independent of t ice porosity n 0 05 ice viscosities μ 1 10 11 pa s and ζ 2 10 11 pa s the ice flexural strength σ f 0 47 mpa at n 0 05 and the ice compressive strength σ c 5 mpa the sea water density was assumed to be ϱ w 1020 kg m 3 and its freezing temperature was t m 1 c a compromise value between t m 0 c for freshwater and t m 1 9 c for ocean water of salinity 35 ppt the ice plate thickness h and span l were adopted of magnitudes typical of civil engineering applications ignoring thus large scale phenomena occurring on geophysical scales the simulations were run for a series of idealized sinusoidal ice surface temperature time variations sketched in fig 2 hence it was assumed that the ice temperature t at the start of calculations when the plate was supposed to be in a stress free state was equal to t 0 the maximum temperature reached during the daytime heating was t m a x assumed to be below the ice melting temperature t m and the minimum temperature at night was t m i n the results presented below were obtained for t 0 5 c and δ t m a x t m a x t 0 4 c for such moderate maximum temperature increases the thermally induced axial elastic force p calculated from 15 was in the range of about 1 3 of the magnitude of the elastic buckling force p e determined from 16 the temperature field in the ice plate was calculated by solving the heat conduction equation 14 by a finite difference method with the time integration carried out by applying a crank nicolson scheme an example time variation of temperature depth profiles calculated by solving 14 for a plate of thickness h 0 3 m is illustrated in fig 3 these profiles were obtained by adopting the temperature scenario shown in fig 2 with t 0 5 c and δ t m a x 4 c and the day heating period lasting for 9 hr hours the solid lines in the figure illustrate the ice warming phase increasing temperature period and the dashed lines the cooling phase decreasing temperature period with the same colours corresponding to the same ice temperature at the top surface the initial ice plate deflection curve w x with small amplitude perturbations was adopted as a sum of m harmonic in x components given by 30 w 0 x k 1 m a k 0 sin k π x l where the component amplitudes a k 0 and the signs were selected at random and w 0 was normalized in such a way that the maximum initial deflection for 0 x l was equal to 1 100 of the plate thickness h the number of components m was such that the shortest buckle half wavelength was equal to 1 m that is m 20 for l 20 m and m 50 for l 50 m examples of the initial deflection curves with the random distribution of small perturbations are displayed in fig 4 for l 20 m a and l 50 m b fig 5 illustrates the time variation of the deflection w x t for the plate of thickness h 0 2 m and length l 20 m with the ice starting temperature t 0 5 c and the maximum daily temperature t m a x 2 c so that δ t m a x 3 c the plots show how the plate displacements displayed at 1 hour intervals evolve from the initially random distribution of small perturbations with short half wavelengths into an increasingly regular pattern of longer buckles the curve for the time t f 4 54 hr displays the plate deflection curve at the onset of its flexural failure it is seen that the maximum plate deflection at the failure time is equal to about h 3 one can note a significant growth in the buckle amplitudes within a relatively short period immediately preceding the ice plate failure the analogous results illustrating the behaviour of the plate of thickness h 0 5 m and span l 50 m are shown in fig 6 the results were obtained by assuming the maximum temperature increase by δ t m a x 5 c a similar pattern of irregular perturbations progressively growing into smooth buckles is observed until the ice fails at time t f 7 89 hr under the axial force p 347 kn m reaching the maximum deflection of 0 246 m nearly equal to h 2 comparing the plots in figs 5 and 6 one can see that the buckles are now longer with their half wavelengths equal to about 12 m which agrees well with the length λ 0 12 34 m for the fastest growing buckles determined from equation 29 the plots in fig 7 show the effect of the maximum temperature amplitudes δ t m a x on the plate deflection at the ice failure time t f the results illustrate the creep response of the plate of length l 20 m and thickness h 0 2 m see the corresponding plots in figs 5 and 9 for δ t m a x 3 4 and 5 c smaller values of δ t m a x do not generate sufficiently large stresses needed to fail the ice sheet it can be noted that the creep behaviour of the plate and in particular the length and the shape of the buckles is similar for all the cases plotted in the figure with the maximum plate deflections increasing monotonically with increasing temperature amplitudes the following figs 8 and 9 illustrate the time variation of the horizontal reaction force exerted by ice on the vertical walls constraining the ice plate deformation at its ends the plots in fig 8 demonstrate the effect of the ice plate thickness h on the reaction forces exerted by the ice subjected to the temperature scenario depicted in fig 2 with the amplitude δ t m a x 4 c the lines illustrating the evolution of p t break at the corresponding failure time instants t f except the case of h 0 5 m when the ice does not fracture during the heating period 0 t 9 hr it is seen that the reaction force p increases with time in a smooth manner similar in all the plate thickness cases up to the time of ice failure the plots also show that the maximum axial forces arising in thick ice h 0 4 and 0 5 m occur about 2 hr after the peak temperature t m a x occurrence at t 4 5 hr illustrating a delay of the thermally induced response of the system the plots in fig 9 show the dependence of the reaction force p t on the temperature amplitude δ t m a x for the ice of thickness h 0 2 m corresponding to the previous figure we can note see the curves for δ t m a x 1 and 2 c that for thin ice the delay in the thermal response of ice does not exceed 1 h that is the maximum axial force p due to ice heating arises within 1 hr after the occurrence of the peak temperature t m a x as can be expected an increase in the ice temperature rate results in the ice failure occurring at earlier time though the magnitudes of the maximum reaction forces those at the time of ice failure do not change with the temperature amplitude δ t m a x as considerably as with the ice thickness h see the previous fig 8 finally fig 10 illustrates the dependence of the maximum compressive forces p on the plate thickness h and the temperature increase amplitude δ t m a x calculated on the assumption that no plate flexural failure occurs the plots in fig 10 represent the maximum magnitudes of the forces which at given h and δ t m a x can theoretically develop in an ice sheet due to its heating these forces for the cases considered are smaller than the forces causing the elastic buckling of the plate for safety reasons the plotted maximum forces should be adopted by an engineer as design loads on a structure that can be subjected to the action of floating ice it is seen that the forces displayed in the figure are approximately proportional to the maximum temperature increase δ t m a x their increase with the plate thickness is most pronounced for h 0 5 m while for thicker ice the thermally induced axial forces caused by daily temperature variations see fig 2 do not significantly exceed those for h 0 5 m 5 conclusions the response of a floating ice plate subjected to heating at its upper surface and constrained in the lateral directions by rigid vertical walls was analysed on the assumption that the ice deforms and ultimately fails by viscous creep an analytic solution for the evolution of the plate deflection curve constructed in the form of a fourier series with coefficients describing the growth rates of buckles of different lengths was used to calculate the maximum deflections of the ice plate at the time of its flexural failure to determine the dominant buckle half wavelengths developing in the floating ice during its creep deformation and more importantly to evaluate the reaction forces exerted by the ice plate on the constraining walls it was found out that a moderate temperature increase by a few degrees celsius during a period of several hours can lead to the fracture of ice of thickness up to about 0 5 m the forces exerted by a floating ice plate on the walls constraining the ice thermal expansion can be of the magnitudes of several hundred kn per unit width of the plate for instance for the ice of thickness 0 5 m and a daily peak temperature increase by 5 c the maximum reaction force predicted in the numerical simulations was equal to about 350 kn m further it was shown that the magnitudes of the ice structure reaction forces in cases in which the ice plate fails are much more sensitive to the thickness of ice rather than to a maximum temperature change during a single day long period of ice heating the problem in which the floating ice is subjected to prolonged periods of heating as in high arctic conditions during a polar spring was not considered in this work 
23408,the problem of a floating ice sheet failure caused by stresses induced in ice by temperature changes at its top surface is investigated the ice cover is modelled as a plate of uniform thickness which is laterally constrained at its edges by rigid walls and is assumed to deform and ultimately fail by the mechanism of creep buckling the floating plate is subjected to in plane compressive stresses developing in ice to prevent its lateral expansion due to heating and is transversely vertically bent by the forces acting at its base and caused by the reaction of underlying water the sea ice is treated as a material whose elastic and viscous properties depend on its porosity and current temperature and therefore vary with the depth of ice the results of simulations carried out for a variety of ice plate spans thicknesses and temperature change scenarios illustrate the evolution of creep buckles in the plate prior to its failure and show the time variation of the magnitudes of forces exerted by ice on the constraining walls keywords floating ice thermal expansion plate creep buckling ice structure interaction 1 introduction floating sea lake or river ice like any material expands when subjected to heating surprisingly little attention has been paid yet to this phenomenon and its consequences for civil engineering despite the fact that thermally induced forces developing in ice due to its in plane expansion especially in cases when ice is constrained in lateral directions can reach magnitudes which are dangerous for the safety of engineering structures this work addresses one of the problems that can be of interest to civil engineers namely the forces which a floating ice sheet exerts on a structure due to ice heating at its top surface are determined and their time variation during the heating process is investigated the analysis is carried out on the assumption that the forces developing in ice and then transferred to a structure originate from the elastic reaction of the medium to its thermally induced expansion being prevented by constraints imposed on the ice deformation by the structure walls once in plane elastic compressive forces have occurred in the ice cover the ice starts to deform by viscous creep giving rise to its off plane buckling which ultimately leads to the ice failure when the ice flexural strength is exceeded the topic of a floating ice sheet behaviour under the action of in plane axial forces and off plane transverse loads due to the underlying water reaction has been analysed by a number of investigators the problem of elastic buckling of a floating plate was solved in the papers by kerr 1978 nevel 1980 and sanderson 1988 in which approximate estimates for the magnitudes of the buckling forces derived analytically are given the approximate formulae proposed in these papers were subsequently refined and corrected by staroszczyk 2002 on the basis of results obtained from finite element calculations some relevant analytical results can be also found in the work by kerr and palmer 1972 and experimental data on the elastic buckling of ice have been reported by sodhi et al 1983 a more realistic problem of creep buckling of floating ice was treated by sjölind 1985 sanderson 1988 staroszczyk 2003 and staroszczyk and hedzielski 2004 in none of the above papers the thermally induced loads and their effects on the ice plate behaviour were investigated in the present paper an attempt is made to examine how the mechanical response of ice is affected by the changes in the temperature field on the ice surface hence thermally induced axial stresses are accounted for in the balance of all the forces acting on a floating plate and the effects of these thermal stresses on the mechanism of the ice creep buckling and the subsequent ice failure are studied of prime interest are the magnitudes of the forces exerted by ice on the walls constraining the plate in the horizontal direction and the evolution of these forces as the ice creep deformation proceeds until the instant of the ice flexural fracture the evolution of the thermally induced forces within the ice plate is not only due to the rise in temperature at the ice top surface but also due to the progressive vertical heat transfer through the ice from its top to the bottom the latter process results in the variation of the elastic and viscous properties of the material which are assumed to be temperature dependent therefore the plate cannot be treated as a homogeneous since its mechanical properties vary with depth further the evolution of the plate deflection surface with increasing thermally induced axial loads is investigated with the analysis of the characteristics of buckles which grow in time as the ice deformation progresses the analysis of the floating ice sheet behaviour is carried out by applying the classical theory of thin plates resting on an elastic foundation timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 the equations formulating the problem considered are given in section 2 together with the relations describing the temperature dependence of the elastic and viscous properties of ice in section 3 the method of solution of the equation governing the creep deformation of the plate is presented and the analysis of fundamental properties of this solution is carried out section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the results of numerical simulations carried out for assumed temperature variation scenarios the results illustrate the effects of the plate thickness and length on the creep behaviour of the ice and the magnitudes of the forces acting on the walls constraining the ice finally some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation the problem under consideration is depicted in fig 1 an ice sheet is modelled as a plate of uniform thickness h and length l and is assumed to be constrained by vertical rigid walls at the plate ends at x 0 and x l the vertical coordinate axis z is directed downwards with z 0 at the upper surface of the plate and z h at the base of the plate the plate deflection surface is denoted by the function w x t with t denoting time and w 0 for the downward deflection the plate of ice is floating on the surface of underlying water which exerts an elastic reaction on the ice proportional to the plate deflection the ice top surface is subjected to the action of varying in time temperature t t with the ice at the base z h being at the melting point temperature t m all the time and t t m throughout the ice plate it is assumed that at the initial time t 0 the plate is stress free that is it is in equilibrium under an initial distribution of temperature in the plate for simplicity a plane strain problem is analysed here so that the ice plate can be treated as a beam of uniform width with its elastic flexural rigidity adjusted accordingly to account for the zero deformations in the lateral direction normal to the plane o x z in accordance with the standard theory of thin plates timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 it is assumed that the plate deflections are small that is they are of the order of the plate thickness and the plate cross sections which are normal to the middle plane in the undeformed state remain plane and normal to the middle surface of the deformed plate the plate is bent in the transverse vertical directions by loads coming from the reaction of the underlying water base these loads are denoted by q in fig 1 b and their result is either the lifting of the plate or its depression from the floating equilibrium state besides the bending the plate is also subjected to the action of in plane axial forces which in our case are generated by the changes in the ice temperature let denote the internal forces acting per unit width of the plate as m q and n see fig 1 b where m is the bending moment q is the vertical shear force and n is the normal tensile force then neglecting the own weight of the plate and the inertia forces due to negligibly small velocities of ice the equilibrium balances of forces in the z axis direction and the bending moments acting on an infinitesimal plate element give the relations 1 q x n 2 w x 2 q m x q the transverse distributed load q is equal to the underlying water reaction the latter is assumed to be elastic and linearly proportional to the local plate deflection w the winkler zimmerman type foundation hence the load q is expressed by 2 q ϱ w g w where ϱ w is the water density and g is the acceleration due to gravity by eliminating now the shear force q from equation 1 and using 2 one obtains the differential equation 3 2 m x 2 n 2 w x 2 ϱ w g w where m and n are the functions of x and t the above internal forces are defined in terms of the normal stresses σ x x by the relations 4 n 0 h σ x x d z m 0 h σ x x z d z the stresses σ x x in equation 4 are related to the plate deformations and their rates by constitutive relations describing the physical properties of the material and its response to loading it is well known mellor 1980 sanderson 1988 that at typical stress levels occurring in sea ice equal to about 1 mpa the creep strains in ice exceed the elastic ones in a matter of about 1 min from the start of loading thus the dominant mode of deformation in floating ice is viscous creep and hence this type of the material response is considered in the analysis of the problem under investigation however the elastic behaviour of ice is also important since the axial force causing the buckling of the plate arises due to the elastic reaction of the body to heating in order to describe the viscous response of ice a constitutive law of the reiner rivlin type schulkes et al 1998 morland and staroszczyk 1998 is employed 5 σ i j ζ μ d k k δ i j 2 μ d i j i j k 1 2 3 where the summation convention for repeated indices applies in 5 δ i j is the kronecker symbol ζ and μ denote the bulk and shear viscosities of ice respectively and d i j are the components of the strain rate tensor the latter components are defined by 6 d i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i i j 1 2 3 where v i denote the ice velocity vector components here of interest is only the strain rate component d x x due to the plate bending and this is given in terms of the curvature rate of the plate deflection surface by the relation 7 d x x κ z z 0 2 w x 2 z z 0 in the latter equation κ is the plate deflection curvature along the x axis the superposed dot denotes the time derivative and z 0 defines the position of the neutral plane in the undeformed state in equation 7 the plate curvature is defined in terms of w by κ 2 w x 2 which is a good approximation as long as w and w x 2 are small quantities with the axial strain rate given by 7 the axial stress σ x x determined by the constitutive law 5 and the bending moment m defined by 4 the equilibrium equation 3 becomes 8 r 4 w x 4 p 2 w x 2 ϱ w g w 0 where p n is the in plane compressive force which arises due to the heating of the plate the parameter r is the viscous flexural rigidity of the plate an analogue of the elastic plate rigidity and is defined by 9 r 0 h ζ a z z z 0 d z where ζ a is the axial viscosity of ice given by 10 ζ a μ ζ note that r is a temperature dependent quantity since the ice viscosity is very sensitive to temperature the position of the neutral plane z 0 is determined from the condition that the resultant normal force n due to the plate bending in the absence of in plane axial loading is zero hence by inserting into the first equation in 4 the axial stress σ x x calculated from the law 5 for d x x given by 7 one obtains the relation 11 0 h ζ a z z z 0 d z 0 the above equation determines the neutral plane position as 12 z 0 i 1 i 2 i 1 0 h ζ a z z d z i 2 0 h ζ a z d z the parameter z 0 is temperature dependent as well since it varies with the changing distribution of temperature along the plate depth as the ice heating progresses and the ice viscosity evolves obviously for the viscosity ζ a being uniform across the plate equations 12 yield z 0 h 2 the differential equation 8 for the ice plate deflection evolution is solved with the boundary conditions at x 0 and x l representing the case of a simply supported plate since other types of boundary conditions such as clamping at the plate edges are much less realistic sanderson 1988 formally these conditions are expressed by 13 x 0 w 0 2 w x 2 0 x l w 0 2 w x 2 0 the formation of creep buckles requires an initial imperfection in the plate deflection surface w x otherwise if w x 0 the plate would buckle only in an elastic manner that is under much larger loads than those generated by the ice heating therefore it is assumed that at t 0 the plate deflection w x consists of a number of harmonic components with randomly selected small amplitudes see section 4 besides the plate deflection evolution equation 8 also a heat conduction equation governing the evolution of temperature t z t in ice must be solved this equation has the form 14 t t a 2 t x 2 where a 1 15 10 6 m 2 s 1 is the thermal diffusivity of ice the solution of 14 provides current vertical distributions of ice temperature which affect the magnitudes of the elastic and viscous parameters and their vertical distributions along the depth of ice given the current temperature t z t and its difference δ t z t relative to the temperature t 0 z in the initial stable state of the ice plate the axial force p t due to the elastic response of the material is defined by 15 p t α 0 h δ t z t e z t 1 ν 2 z t d z where α 5 2 10 5 k 1 is the thermal expansion coefficient for ice and e is the young elastic modulus the force p determined by 15 cannot exceed the force causing the elastic buckling of the plate which is given by kerr 1978 16 p e 2 ϱ w g d p where d p is the elastic flexural rigidity of the plate defined by 17 d p 0 h z z 0 2 e z t 1 ν 2 z t d z the temperature dependence of the young modulus is adopted in the form proposed by sinha 1989 for the isotropic granular ice known as t1 ice 18 e t 8 93 1 2 10 2 t m t gpa where t m is the ice melting temperature the same author expressed the temperature dependence of poisson s ratio as 19 ν t 0 308 7 10 5 t m t it is seen from the latter relation that ν is practically insensitive to t and therefore can be treated as a constant at small variations of t in contrast to the elastic properties of ice its creep properties are known to be very sensitive to temperature especially in the range of temperatures close to the ice melting point t m that is in the range of our interest here in order to describe the temperature dependence of viscosity a representation derived by smith and morland 1981 is adopted 20 μ t μ t m 0 68 exp 12 t 0 32 exp 3 t 1 with the same scaling applying to the bulk viscosity ζ t is a dimensionless temperature defined by t t t m 20 c as it follows from 20 a temperature decrease say from 1 c to 5 c results in a viscosity increase by a factor of about 3 5 another important factor that affects the mechanical strength of sea ice is its porosity which usually increases with the depth of ice weeks 2010 the reduction of the young elastic modulus e with increasing porosity n can be described by approximate formulae obtained by hutter 1983 as a fit to experimental results 21 e e 0 1 5 n for 0 n 0 15 47 0 15 n 3 46 0 15 n 2 0 5 0 15 n 0 25 for 0 15 n 0 4 0 06 1 n for 0 4 n 1 where e 0 is the value of e for pure pore free ice at a given temperature it is seen from 21 that the elastic modulus decreases quite considerably with n for instance its value is reduced by 25 for the porosity as small as 0 05 which is a typical value for young ice because of the lack of relevant data it is assumed that the ice viscosity magnitudes ζ and μ are reduced for porous ice in the same manner as the elastic modulus e that is by applying formulae 21 finally of importance is also the weakening effect of ice porosity on the ice flexural strength σ f the maximum tensile stress which ice can bear during its bending a formula proposed by timco and o brien 1994 is adopted to describe the ice strength reduction with increasing n 22 σ f 1 76 exp 5 88 n mpa the latter relation predicts for the ice porosity n 0 05 the value of σ f 0 47 mpa which means a significant 73 reduction of the strength compared to that of pure non porous ice 3 creep buckling problem solution the first order in time and fourth order in space partial differential equation 8 describes the creep behaviour of an ice plate in response to the compressive force p arising due to the plate heating recall that r and p in the equation are both the functions of time the solution of 8 is constructed by the method of separation of variables on account of the boundary conditions 13 we adopt a general solution of 8 in the form 23 w x t k 1 m a k t sin k π x l being a superposition of m harmonic in space components with the respective amplitudes a k varying in time by substituting 23 into 8 one obtains the equation 24 k 1 m r k π l 4 a k p k π l 2 a k ϱ w g a k sin k π x l 0 since the system of functions sin k π x l k 1 m is orthogonal on the interval 0 x l the ice plate span equation 24 can be transformed into a system of m equations each of which describing separately the evolution of the amplitude a k t k 1 m accordingly one has to solve the following set of m equations 25 r k π l 4 a k p k π l 2 ϱ w g a k 0 k 1 m which can be rewritten in an equivalent form as 26 a k t 1 r t l k π 2 p t ϱ w g l k π 2 a k t k 1 m this system of first order differential equations was solved numerically by applying the crank nicolson scheme to calculate the amplitudes a k t of harmonic components for t 0 starting from an initial slightly perturbed deflection curve at t 0 see equation 30 in the next section these amplitudes are used to determine from 23 the current plate deflection curve w x t and then its curvature rate κ necessary for the evaluation of the stresses σ x x z by applying relations 7 and 5 these stresses in turn are then checked against the parameters σ f the flexural strength of ice and σ c the compressive strength of ice to determine the instant of the plate failure before proceeding further it is of interest to investigate the behaviour of buckles depending on their current length and the current magnitude of the compressive axial force p t for this purpose let analyse the evolution of a buckle of a half wavelength λ which by analogy to 26 is described by equation 27 a t 1 r λ π 2 p ϱ w g λ π 2 a t where a t is the current amplitude of a given buckle it follows from the above equation that the buckle length λ will grow with time only when the expression in the square brackets is positive and reversely it will decay with time when this expression is negative a stationary state with w x t not changing at a given time t takes place when the term in the brackets is zero this determines a critical length of the stationary buckle λ c which is defined by 28 λ c π p ϱ w g any existing creep buckles λ k for which λ k λ c will grow whereas those for which λ k λ c will decrease at the current magnitude of the force p which evolves with time relation 27 can be also used to determine the length λ of a buckle which grows at the greatest rate this can be done by differentiating 27 with respect to λ and setting the resulting expression to zero to find the value of λ which maximizes the buckle growth rate it turns out that the fastest growing buckle has the half wavelength λ 0 given by 29 λ 0 π p 2 ϱ w g it is seen from relations 28 and 29 that the critical and the fastest growing dominant buckle half wavelengths are at the ratio λ c λ 0 2 4 numerical simulations the theoretical model described in the two previous sections has been used to simulate the behaviour of a floating ice plate subjected at its upper surface to the action of increasing temperature in the simulations the following material parameters were adopted young s modulus e t 0 c 8 93 gpa poisson s ratio ν 0 308 treated as being independent of t ice porosity n 0 05 ice viscosities μ 1 10 11 pa s and ζ 2 10 11 pa s the ice flexural strength σ f 0 47 mpa at n 0 05 and the ice compressive strength σ c 5 mpa the sea water density was assumed to be ϱ w 1020 kg m 3 and its freezing temperature was t m 1 c a compromise value between t m 0 c for freshwater and t m 1 9 c for ocean water of salinity 35 ppt the ice plate thickness h and span l were adopted of magnitudes typical of civil engineering applications ignoring thus large scale phenomena occurring on geophysical scales the simulations were run for a series of idealized sinusoidal ice surface temperature time variations sketched in fig 2 hence it was assumed that the ice temperature t at the start of calculations when the plate was supposed to be in a stress free state was equal to t 0 the maximum temperature reached during the daytime heating was t m a x assumed to be below the ice melting temperature t m and the minimum temperature at night was t m i n the results presented below were obtained for t 0 5 c and δ t m a x t m a x t 0 4 c for such moderate maximum temperature increases the thermally induced axial elastic force p calculated from 15 was in the range of about 1 3 of the magnitude of the elastic buckling force p e determined from 16 the temperature field in the ice plate was calculated by solving the heat conduction equation 14 by a finite difference method with the time integration carried out by applying a crank nicolson scheme an example time variation of temperature depth profiles calculated by solving 14 for a plate of thickness h 0 3 m is illustrated in fig 3 these profiles were obtained by adopting the temperature scenario shown in fig 2 with t 0 5 c and δ t m a x 4 c and the day heating period lasting for 9 hr hours the solid lines in the figure illustrate the ice warming phase increasing temperature period and the dashed lines the cooling phase decreasing temperature period with the same colours corresponding to the same ice temperature at the top surface the initial ice plate deflection curve w x with small amplitude perturbations was adopted as a sum of m harmonic in x components given by 30 w 0 x k 1 m a k 0 sin k π x l where the component amplitudes a k 0 and the signs were selected at random and w 0 was normalized in such a way that the maximum initial deflection for 0 x l was equal to 1 100 of the plate thickness h the number of components m was such that the shortest buckle half wavelength was equal to 1 m that is m 20 for l 20 m and m 50 for l 50 m examples of the initial deflection curves with the random distribution of small perturbations are displayed in fig 4 for l 20 m a and l 50 m b fig 5 illustrates the time variation of the deflection w x t for the plate of thickness h 0 2 m and length l 20 m with the ice starting temperature t 0 5 c and the maximum daily temperature t m a x 2 c so that δ t m a x 3 c the plots show how the plate displacements displayed at 1 hour intervals evolve from the initially random distribution of small perturbations with short half wavelengths into an increasingly regular pattern of longer buckles the curve for the time t f 4 54 hr displays the plate deflection curve at the onset of its flexural failure it is seen that the maximum plate deflection at the failure time is equal to about h 3 one can note a significant growth in the buckle amplitudes within a relatively short period immediately preceding the ice plate failure the analogous results illustrating the behaviour of the plate of thickness h 0 5 m and span l 50 m are shown in fig 6 the results were obtained by assuming the maximum temperature increase by δ t m a x 5 c a similar pattern of irregular perturbations progressively growing into smooth buckles is observed until the ice fails at time t f 7 89 hr under the axial force p 347 kn m reaching the maximum deflection of 0 246 m nearly equal to h 2 comparing the plots in figs 5 and 6 one can see that the buckles are now longer with their half wavelengths equal to about 12 m which agrees well with the length λ 0 12 34 m for the fastest growing buckles determined from equation 29 the plots in fig 7 show the effect of the maximum temperature amplitudes δ t m a x on the plate deflection at the ice failure time t f the results illustrate the creep response of the plate of length l 20 m and thickness h 0 2 m see the corresponding plots in figs 5 and 9 for δ t m a x 3 4 and 5 c smaller values of δ t m a x do not generate sufficiently large stresses needed to fail the ice sheet it can be noted that the creep behaviour of the plate and in particular the length and the shape of the buckles is similar for all the cases plotted in the figure with the maximum plate deflections increasing monotonically with increasing temperature amplitudes the following figs 8 and 9 illustrate the time variation of the horizontal reaction force exerted by ice on the vertical walls constraining the ice plate deformation at its ends the plots in fig 8 demonstrate the effect of the ice plate thickness h on the reaction forces exerted by the ice subjected to the temperature scenario depicted in fig 2 with the amplitude δ t m a x 4 c the lines illustrating the evolution of p t break at the corresponding failure time instants t f except the case of h 0 5 m when the ice does not fracture during the heating period 0 t 9 hr it is seen that the reaction force p increases with time in a smooth manner similar in all the plate thickness cases up to the time of ice failure the plots also show that the maximum axial forces arising in thick ice h 0 4 and 0 5 m occur about 2 hr after the peak temperature t m a x occurrence at t 4 5 hr illustrating a delay of the thermally induced response of the system the plots in fig 9 show the dependence of the reaction force p t on the temperature amplitude δ t m a x for the ice of thickness h 0 2 m corresponding to the previous figure we can note see the curves for δ t m a x 1 and 2 c that for thin ice the delay in the thermal response of ice does not exceed 1 h that is the maximum axial force p due to ice heating arises within 1 hr after the occurrence of the peak temperature t m a x as can be expected an increase in the ice temperature rate results in the ice failure occurring at earlier time though the magnitudes of the maximum reaction forces those at the time of ice failure do not change with the temperature amplitude δ t m a x as considerably as with the ice thickness h see the previous fig 8 finally fig 10 illustrates the dependence of the maximum compressive forces p on the plate thickness h and the temperature increase amplitude δ t m a x calculated on the assumption that no plate flexural failure occurs the plots in fig 10 represent the maximum magnitudes of the forces which at given h and δ t m a x can theoretically develop in an ice sheet due to its heating these forces for the cases considered are smaller than the forces causing the elastic buckling of the plate for safety reasons the plotted maximum forces should be adopted by an engineer as design loads on a structure that can be subjected to the action of floating ice it is seen that the forces displayed in the figure are approximately proportional to the maximum temperature increase δ t m a x their increase with the plate thickness is most pronounced for h 0 5 m while for thicker ice the thermally induced axial forces caused by daily temperature variations see fig 2 do not significantly exceed those for h 0 5 m 5 conclusions the response of a floating ice plate subjected to heating at its upper surface and constrained in the lateral directions by rigid vertical walls was analysed on the assumption that the ice deforms and ultimately fails by viscous creep an analytic solution for the evolution of the plate deflection curve constructed in the form of a fourier series with coefficients describing the growth rates of buckles of different lengths was used to calculate the maximum deflections of the ice plate at the time of its flexural failure to determine the dominant buckle half wavelengths developing in the floating ice during its creep deformation and more importantly to evaluate the reaction forces exerted by the ice plate on the constraining walls it was found out that a moderate temperature increase by a few degrees celsius during a period of several hours can lead to the fracture of ice of thickness up to about 0 5 m the forces exerted by a floating ice plate on the walls constraining the ice thermal expansion can be of the magnitudes of several hundred kn per unit width of the plate for instance for the ice of thickness 0 5 m and a daily peak temperature increase by 5 c the maximum reaction force predicted in the numerical simulations was equal to about 350 kn m further it was shown that the magnitudes of the ice structure reaction forces in cases in which the ice plate fails are much more sensitive to the thickness of ice rather than to a maximum temperature change during a single day long period of ice heating the problem in which the floating ice is subjected to prolonged periods of heating as in high arctic conditions during a polar spring was not considered in this work

clean energy resources have recently attracted extensive attention owing to the growing problems of energy availability and environmental pollution tidal current energy is regarded as one of the most promising energy resources because of its predictability reliability and high energy density liu et al 2011 horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion systems which can effectively convert the kinetic energy of tidal currents into electricity have broad application prospects and a significant research value ng et al 2013 the tidal current turbine has evolved from the wind turbine and thus they have much in common energy from wind turbines already accounts for a significant share in many countries the wind turbine technology has only recently become sufficiently mature balat 2009 hernández et al 2017 although a lot can be learnt from the wind turbine field some aspects are different in tidal turbines such as the underwater operating conditions difficult and costly ocean installations and high requirements posed on materials and components by the tidal current s energy density because of these factors tidal energy systems remain at a certain distance from technical maturity and large scale commercial use in recent years various global studies have focused on marine tidal current energy systems goundar and ahmed 2013 designed tidal current turbine hydrofoils

systemic design were simply described and analyzed the first approach consisted of synchronous permanent magnet generators with direct connection and the second one included asynchronous generators with double alimentation and indirect connection sousounis et al 2015a b and kuschke and kai 2013 studied a tidal current conversion system in which the power electronics were moved from the nacelle to the shore and the offshore generator was connected via long subsea cables a long distance control and an overvoltage reduction method were proposed to solve the problems of electromagnetic travelling waves power electronic pulses and overvoltages through an appropriate filter design these methods were validated by developing a full resource to grid model in matlab simulink these above mentioned studies which include hydrodynamic design modeling control strategy numerical simulation and laboratory test were conducted in a laboratory under ideal and controllable conditions moreover each investigation focused on a small part of the marine tidal current energy system hence the satisfactory results provided by these laboratory analyses and small scale experiments are limited in

overall detailed design of a full scale system is provided comprising the system design control concept and sea trial moreover an in situ experiment was conducted in a real tidal flow the system design includes the turbine pitch system mechanical drive train and electrical system the control concept consists of the grid connected maximum power point tracking mppt and pitch controls unlike the commercial literature of those multi hundred kilowatt or megawatt turbines the design parameters and representative experimental results are provided and analyzed in detail to verify the feasibility of the system design and control concept hence the integrated design and implementation of the present 120 kw tidal energy system offer a valuable experience toward the development of tidal energy systems 2 system design 2 1 turbine design 2 1 1 a review of the blade element momentum bem theory according to the blade element theory the blade is divided into a number of transversal elements placed along the blade as shown in fig 1 a blade element is sectioned by two parallels situated at r and r dr from the hub consider that the turbine is situated in a tidal flow of v velocity the notations in fig 1 have the following meaning v is the tidal current velocity ω is the rotor rotating speed ω is the relative velocity of tidal current α is the angle of attack β t is the twist angle r is the radius of the local blade element df is the resultant force of the local blade element df l and df d are the elementary lift and drag forces respectively df t is the elementary tangential force and df a is the elementary axial thrust burton et al 2001 manwell et al 2006 munteanu et al 2008 according to the rotor disc theory the transfer of rotational motion to the flow takes place entirely across the rotor disc the flow angle and the relative velocity of a tidal current are given by 1 φ α β t tan 1 1 a 1 b 1 λ r 2 ω v 1 a 2 λ r 2 1 b 2 3 ω v 1 a sin φ ω r 1 b cos φ where λ r is the local tip speed ratio and λ r r ω v φ is the flow angle and a and b denote the axial and tangential flow induction factors respectively the elementary lift and drag forces on the local blade element become 4 d f l 1 2 ρ c c l ω 2 d r 5 d f d 1 2 ρ c c d ω 2 d r where ρ is the density of sea water c is the local chord length and c l and c d denote the lift and drag coefficients respectively hence the thrust and torque on a span wise length dr of the rotor each blade can be calculated by 6 d t n d f a n d f l cos φ d f d sin φ 1 2 n ρ c ω 2 c l cos φ c d sin φ d r 7 d m n r d f t n r d f l sin φ d f d cos φ 1 2 n ρ c ω 2 c l sin φ c d cos φ r d r where t and m denote the thrust and torque of the rotor respectively and n is the number of blades of the rotor according to the momentum theory the thrust and angular momentum change rate are given by 8 d t 4 ρ π v 2 a 1 a r d r 9 d l d t 4 ρ π v ω 1 a b r 3 d r where l is the angular momentum on the span wise length dr of the rotor and d l d t represents the angular momentum change rate therefore the axial flow induction factor can be calculated by combining eqs 3 6 and 8 as 10 a n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 8 π r sin 2 φ n c c l cos φ c d sin φ and according to the angular momentum theory d m d l d t the tangential flow induction factor can be calculated by combining eqs 3 7 and 9 as 11 b n c c l sin φ c d cos φ 8 π r sin φ cos φ n c c l sin φ c d cos φ the chord length and twist angle can be obtained from eqs 1 3 and 11 with a slight simplification 12 c μ 8 π r λ r b μ 2 n c l 1 a 2 λ r 1 b 2 μ 2 13 β t μ tan 1 1 a 1 b 1 λ r μ α μ where μ is the relative blade radius and μ r r and r is the radius of the rotor 2 1 2 parameter correction to the bem theory 2 1 2 1 prandtl correction factor for tip and root losses because the blade tip follows a circular path it leaves a trailing vortex of helical structure where the circulation decreases significantly which also occurs at the blade root this makes the rotor torque decrease according to prandtl s approximation method burton et al 2001 the prandtl correction factor for tip and root losses is given by 14 f f t f r 2 π cos 1 exp n 2 r r r sin φ 2 π cos 1 exp n 2 r r h r h sin φ 4 π 2 cos 1 exp n 2 r r r sin φ cos 1 exp n 2 r r h r h sin φ where f is the prandtl correction factor f t is the tip loss factor f r is the root loss factor and r h is the radius of the hub then eqs 10 and 11 can be modified as 15 a n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 8 π r f sin 2 φ n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 16 b n c c l sin φ c d cos φ 8 π r f sin φ cos φ n c c l sin φ c d cos φ 2 1 2 2 axial flow induction factor correction in the turbulent state under a turbulent state the boundary of flow tube is broken therefore the bem theory is no longer suitable according to wilson empirical expression hansen 2015 the thrust coefficient under a big induction velocity can be approximated as 17 c t 0 587 0 96 a f a 0 38 where c t is the thrust coefficient then under this condition the axial flow induction factor a is replaced by 18 a 1 0 48 k 0 23 k 2 1 55 k a 0 38 where k 2 π r f sin 2 φ n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 2 1 2 3 lift and drag coefficient correction to 2d static coefficients the basic assumption of the bem theory is that the force of a blade element is solely responsible for the change of flow momentum it is therefore assumed that there is no radial interaction between the elements however when stall occurs the flow at the blade surface experiences a centrifugal force that causes it to flow radially outwards this reduces the displacement thickness of the boundary layer which invalidates the assumption of the bem theory sant 2007 owing to the complex 3d nature of the flow over rotating turbine blades the hydrofoil characteristics vary considerably from the 2d static hydrofoil characteristics according to du and selig 2013 a rigorous analysis of the integral boundary layer equations is applied which originates from the 3d incompressible boundary layer equations for a rotating system the lift and drag coefficients are modified as 19 c l c l f l 2 π α α 0 c l 20 c d c d f d c d c d0 where c l and c d denote the modified lift and drag coefficients respectively α 0 is the angle of attack at the blade root c d0 is the drag coefficient when α 0 and f l and f d are the correction factors relative to the local solidity c r and the local tip speed ratio which are given by 21 f l 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 γ a c r γ d λ r r γ b c r γ d λ r r 1 22 f d 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 γ a c r γ d 2 λ r r γ b c r γ d 2 λ r r 1 where λ r ω v 2 r ω 2 and the terms γ a γ b and γ d denote empirical correction factors 2 1 3 turbine design structure based on the aforementioned derivation a step by step sequence of the turbine design is presented in fig 2 2 1 4 hydrofoil data of 120 kw turbine a three bladed rotor is designed for the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system following the above design method the fundamental parameters are listed in table 1 table 2 presents the blade geometrical parameter distributions along the blade fig 3 shows the blade profile fig 4 provides the hydrodynamic characteristics of the power coefficient when the pitch angle is set to be 2 0 and 2 respectively 2 1 5 blade fabrication the structure design including material shear web and coating is important to the tidal turbine because of the large sea flow loading on the blade in this 120 kw turbine blade a fiberglass layer with epoxy curing is used the fiberglass is known for its high strength and stiffness fig 5 presents a visualized impression of the blade fabrication process the green rib plate in fig 5 b made of a composite material is the shear web after the fabrication of the blade a load test including the fatigue and extreme loads should be carried out finally specific anticorrosive paints are sprayed over the blade to resist corrosion caused by the sea flow 2 2 pitch system the pitch system in a tidal current energy system provides three functions first to pitch the blades from 0 to 180 to make full use of the bi directional current second to confine the captured power at its rated value when the rated current velocity is exceeded third to stop the turbine by pitching the blades downstream to protect it during strong flows wu et al 2012 a novel blade pitch system using a rack and pinion gear set and hydraulic drive is designed in consideration of the high energy density of tidal flows and the high sealing requirement as shown in fig 6 a sizable hydraulic cylinder is installed in front of the hub whose output piston rod is fixedly connected with three parallel racks each rack engages a gear which is rigidly connected by bolts to the blade root the racks drive gears to make the blades pitch between 0 and 180 when the hydraulic power drives the piston rod and the racks move synchronously the red dashed lines in fig 6 refer to the oil ways inside the hub which are formed by punching holes in the hub s walls and main shaft besides the outer hydraulic oil is deposited into the rotary hub when the turbine is working by a mechanism of oil slip rings the sealing structures at the blade root and the main shaft are used to prevent sand and water from entering this configuration is essentially different from a wind turbine because the size of the hydraulic cylinder is relatively large it can supply a considerable torque to adapt to the high density tidal flow and increase the natural frequency of the hydraulic system which improves dynamic performance the three blades are uniformly driven by one hydraulic cylinder this makes the pitch system able to be installed in a narrow hub collectively which can significantly reduce current blocking moreover as a hydraulic actuator is applied the water insensitivity and system safety are improved 2 3 mechanical drive train the mechanical drive train is one of the most important parts of the tidal current energy conversion system therefore its key issues should be thoughtfully taken into account by the designers firstly the turbine should have a good streamline such as a long narrow shape that reduces current blocking and have a strong capability of energy transmission in view of the high energy density of the tidal flow secondly the structure of dynamic seals is crucial to the underwater condition differently from a wind energy system thirdly the underwater turbine should have anti pressure and corrosion resistance characteristics as shown in fig 7 the mechanical drive train of the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system consists of a main shaft fixedly connected to the rotor hub a parallel axis power diffluence and confluence gear train and a permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg an integrated design is adopted in the connection between the rotor hub and the main shaft which makes it able to bear heavier torque the gear train converts the low rotating speed and high torque to a high rotating speed and low torque from the main shaft to the pmsg aiming at a long narrow streamline of the turbine a pattern of two stage parallel axes planetary gears is employed in which the first stage is the power diffluence gear train and the second stage is the power confluence gear train in addition a structure of three ply dynamic seals is designed for the rotating main shaft and applied at the main shaft to prevent sand and water from entering in the three ply dynamic seals the first ply is a scraper seal the second ply consists of three seal sleeves and the third ply consists of three u ring seals a rigid duct enclosing the cables is attached at the end of the turbine to the onshore electrical system which transmits the pmsg output and the measured signals such as pitch angle water leakage and temperature 2 4 electrical system the electrical system schematic of the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system is shown in fig 8 the electrical system mainly consists of a three phase diode rectifier bridge a dc side filter a regulating load a grid side converter a lc filter a transformer and a plc controller a three phase uncontrollable rectifier is employed at the pmsg output side to simplify the control complexity and reduce costs compared with a controllable one however ripples or pulsations exist in its output dc voltage a dc side filter is therefore used to smooth the fluctuations suppress the harmonics and absorb the reactive power additionally the regulating load aims to reduce the inrush current and protect the dc bus under an over rated flow which makes the system transform smoothly in different operating states a grid side controllable converter is utilized to feed the electricity into the grid control the dc bus voltage and regulate the active and reactive power the lc filter reduces the current harmonics and improves the power quality fed into the grid an industrial programmable logic controller plc is employed as the control module for the grid connected control mppt control below the rated tidal current velocity and power limiting control that refers to the pitch control in the full load region some other auxiliary functions such as operating condition and parameter monitoring data storage and analysis and fundamental protection can also be realized 3 control concept the tidal energy system operates with different dynamics under different tidal current velocities as seen in fig 9 there are four key points on the curve i e starting cut in rated and cut out velocities starting velocity is the tidal current velocity when the turbine begins to rotate cut in velocity is the minimum tidal current velocity at which the turbine delivers power to grid rated velocity is the tidal current velocity when the output power just reaches its designed rated value cut out velocity is the maximum tidal current velocity that the turbine can tolerate when the tidal current velocity exceeds this value the blades should be pitched downstream for protection the operation curve in fig 9 can be divided into two regions partial load and full load regions in the partial load region the tidal current velocity ranges from the cut in velocity to the rated velocity munteanu et al 2008 the tidal energy system operates at variable rotor speeds to capture the maximum available energy in the flow meanwhile the blade pitch angle is kept constant in the full load region the tidal current velocity ranges from the rated velocity to the cut out velocity the output power should be confined at its rated value through pitch control additionally in both regions the grid connected control must be taken into consideration 3 1 grid connected control the grid side parameters such as voltage current frequency and phase are measured as references by the grid connected system to ensure the quality of the grid side converter s output voltage and current in accordance with the standards the grid connected control schematic is shown in fig 10 the grid side converter controller operates in an ac voltage dq reference system the active and reactive components of the grid side converter currents are regulated by a fast inner control loop p mq and p md are the width pulse modulation factors which refer to the q axis current setpoint and d axis current setpoint respectively the dc bus voltage is controlled to be steadily maintained at the pre defined desired value in the dq reference the grid side voltage vector is fixed on the q axis hence i gq and i gd denote the active and reactive currents respectively then the relation between the grid side three phase current and the q d axis currents can be obtained by the means of the park transform as described by eq 23 because active power is needed to be exported to the grid the desired d axis current is generally set to zero 23 i gq i gd 2 3 cos θ cos θ 2 3 π cos θ 2 3 π sin θ sin θ 2 3 π sin θ 2 3 π i ga i gb i gc where i gq and i gd are the q axis and d axis currents in the dq reference respectively i ga i gb and i gc are the grid side three phase currents and θ is the phase angle 3 2 maximum power point tracking mppt control a diode rectifier converter configuration is applied for the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system as it is not a fully controlled rectifier converter pair the mppt control cannot be realized by the torque control of the generator directly as stated above the dc bus voltage can be regulated by the converter hence an indirect method is proposed to realize the mppt control below the rated tidal current velocity through setting an appropriate dc bus voltage the relation between the generator rotating speed and the dc bus voltage should be found in the partial load region consequently whereas it is improper to regard the three phase rectifier s voltage or current as a simple sinusoid owing to the existing distortions it is also difficult to give a precise mathematical description however there is a certain relation among the generator rotating speed tidal current velocity and dc bus voltage when the system runs stably as shown in eq 24 24 u dc f u ω g v where ω g is the generator rotating speed and u dc is the dc bus voltage this relation curve can be obtained by a workshop test in which the mechanical drive train is towed by a drive motor and the electrical system is connected to the grid to simulate a real operation the approach to gain the relation curve is presented as the following three steps i in the partial region the blade pitch angle is controlled to be a constant value to make the rotor keep an optimal maximum power capturing state to a certain blade and a certain pitch angle the power coefficient c p λ β optimal tip speed ratio λ opt and maximum power coefficient c pmax can all be obtained in fig 4 ii simulating an operating state in which the system operates with an optimal maximum power capturing in the partial region with a certain tidal current velocity then 25 ω g n λ opt r v 26 p p max 1 2 c pmax ρ s v 3 where λ opt is the optimal tip speed ratio c pmax is the maximum power coefficient p is the captured power here refers to the generator power p max is the maximum power in this operating state n is the gearbox transmission ratio and s is the rotor area iii giving the drive motor a torque 27 t wanted p max ω g 1 2 r n λ opt c pmax ρ s v 2 where t wanted is the given torque of the drive motor then the desired dc bus voltage under this tidal current velocity and generator rotating speed can be obtained by measuring the current dc bus voltage thus the relation curve in eq 24 can be gained through testing the tidal current velocities varying from the cut in velocity to the rated velocity iteratively by steps ii and iii however the precise tidal current velocity at the rotary impeller is hard to measure in the sea trial the measured tidal current velocity data by a traditional single point velocimeter could not be used as the input signals for power control owing to the imprecise measurements hence the generator rotating speed is regarded as the input signal for this mppt control in the sea trial the desired value of the control variable dc bus voltage is picked from the work shop test result u dc f u ω g like the empirical curve shown in fig 11 consequently the proposed indirect mppt control method can be realized to catch the relative maximum power by predefining the matched dc bus voltages according to the generator rotating speeds as shown in fig 12 3 3 power limiting control pitch control considering the high power density of the tidal current and the cubic relationship between power and current velocity which make both the mechanical and electrical components fragile when the rated velocity is exceeded effective means should be taken to protect the system for the variable pitch tidal turbine in this paper the energy harvesting efficiency is limited by pitch action in the high current velocity region the pitch angle is raised to shed some of the hydrodynamic power as the c p λ curve cluster of different pitch angles of a certain blade profile can be calculated according to the bem theory the desired pitch angle can be derived through the c p λ curve cluster and the signals of the generator rotating speed and tidal current velocity however aside from the imprecise measurement of tidal current velocity there are significant amounts of nonlinearity and data massiveness that make the pitch control program very complicated in this direct derivation of the desired pitch angle hence in this paper a method of direct power feedback control is adopted to achieve the power limiting control in the full load region the block diagram is shown in fig 13 the generator power is measured and used as the feedback power 4 experiment and discussion 4 1 workshop test the tidal current energy conversion system will face complex conditions in a real flow field to evaluate the whole performance of the 120 kw system such aspects were tested in the workshop before the sea trial including the variation of vibration noise and temperature of the mechanical drive train the efficiency and stability of the electrical system and the effectiveness of the control system the layout of the workshop test configuration is shown in fig 14 as mentioned above the relation curve u dc f u ω g is necessary to the mppt control below the rated current velocity according to the approach presented in subsection 3 2 the desired dc bus voltage curve of the mppt control from the workshop test is displayed in fig 15 which is the mppt control basis in the next underwater test this mppt control is a look up table method based on the pre test according to the test result shown in fig 15 a relation equation between the generator rotating speed and the dc bus voltage is summarized as a logarithmic function in eq 28 by curve fitting in order to conveniently figure out the desired dc bus voltage under different generator rotating speeds 28 u dc f 1 ln ω g f 2 u dc u 0 where f 1 423 21 f 2 1176 9 and u 0 is the lower limit considering the operation requirement of the grid side converter 4 2 sea trial the sea trial of the designed 120 kw horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion system was carried out at zhairuoshan island in zhejiang china the overall configuration is shown in fig 16 mainly including the tidal current turbine hydraulic driving system electrical system and control system the entire system is settled on a specific offshore experimental platform the tidal current turbine is installed on a rigid support structure this support structure lowers the turbine into the water during a slack tide and lift up the turbine when malfunction occurs which avoids underwater works and simplifies maintenance in comparison to the underwater installation type the hydraulic driving electrical and control systems are all installed inside the cabin of the platform to resist the variable weather on the sea pipelines are used to connect the hydraulic driving system and the turbine s internal oil ways in order to transmit the pitch force a three phase electrical cable enclosed in the duct delivers electricity from the pmsg to the electrical system sensor wires are also enclosed in the duct to transmit the measured feedback signals to the control system which helps the control system to realize the control functions shown in the above studies a tablet personal computer with a specific designed labview program is used as the human machine interaction for the system operating condition and parameter monitoring fault warning and data backup 4 3 results and discussion data of a tidal period in the sea trial on april 24 2017 are typically selected to analyze in which the tidal flow varies from slack to maximum and back to slack fig 17 shows the tidal current velocity in this tidal period in which the values range from 0 255 m s to 2 23 m s the current velocity is above 1 5 m s during approximately 75 of the total operating period fig 18 shows the generator output power curve in this period as can be seen from figs 16 and 17 the generator power keeps a cube relation with the tidal current velocity the turbine s startup current velocity is about 0 85 m s when the current velocity is above the rated value of 2 m s the output power can be confined nearby the rated power of 120 kw by the pitch system which avoids an overload operation fig 19 presents the average power coefficient at different tidal current velocities in the generation period which is drawn by averaging the power coefficients at the same current velocity in each case as the figure shows the power efficiency is low in the current velocity range from 1 m s to 1 5 m s and rises with the increase in current velocity the power coefficients run around 0 37 in the current velocity range from 1 5 m s to 2 m s combining this with fig 17 most of the current velocities in the selected generation period are above 1 5 m s therefore it validates the rationality of the system design that a relatively high efficiency can be maintained for most of the operating time however compared with the design value the experimental result of the power efficiency is down about 18 the causes include the following four points ① power loses in the mechanical drive train ② errors when manufacturing the blade mold ③ an acoustic doppler velocimeter was placed at a distance ahead of the tidal current turbine for a single point measurement in the sea trial while its accuracy cannot be guaranteed ④ because an indirect mppt control method by setting matched dc bus voltages is used below the rated current velocity it is difficult to achieve a precise dynamic control in consideration of the system s stability requirement for example the predefined dc bus voltage value has a certain lower limit otherwise the steadiness of the grid connected voltage and the reliability of the grid connected system will be affected this makes the rotating state of the rotor to deviate from the optimal tip speed ratio hence these existing weaknesses make the control ability slightly stagnant and inaccurate fig 20 shows the generator rotating speed variations when the current velocity achieves the starting velocity the rotating speed increases rapidly the generator speed varies between 20 rad s to 60 rad s based on the proposed mppt control strategy fig 21 shows the sea trial data of the dc bus voltage generator torque generator rotating speed combining with fig 15 the data variation tendency in fig 21 matches the proposed mppt control strategy this indicates that the proposed indirect mppt control strategy obtains a good application effect here the lower limit of the dc bus voltage is set at 400 v in consideration of the grid side converter s operation requirement fig 22 shows the partial detail of the grid side phase voltage and fig 23 shows the partial detail of the grid side phase current during the operating period as illustrated in fig 22 the grid side phase voltage runs as a regular sinusoid of 50 hz frequency with few distortions as illustrated in fig 23 the curves also run at 50 hz sinusoidally the amplitude varies with the power and there are a few distortions as shown in fig 24 the grid side q axis current varies with the generator power and the d axis current is effectively controlled at zero fig 25 shows the active and reactive power variations of the grid connected system during the operating period the active power has a same variation tendency with the q axis current the reactive power is correspondingly controlled at zero combining fig 25 with fig 18 almost all the electricity is fed into the grid therefore the active and reactive power in the dq reference are well regulated by the grid connected control system 5 conclusion a sequence of the integrated design and implementation of a 120 kw horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion system is thoroughly presented in this paper based on the bem theory a turbine design method is proposed in detail in addition parameter corrections are made to the bem theory considering its defects then hydrofoil data of the 120 kw turbine are obtained by this turbine design method additionally a collective blade pitch system applicable to the underwater turbine is specifically designed which can supply a large pitch torque and has the ability to capture bi directional tidal current energy because the available blade angles range from 0 to 180 a mechanical drive train with long and narrow shape is designed which provides strong energy transmission capability and reduces current blocking an electrical system for grid connection is adequately described according to the analysis of output power characteristics for the tidal energy system operation a concept of control comprising the grid connected mppt and pitch controls is proposed the grid connected control regulates the active and reactive power and ensure electric power quality the pitch control confines the captured power at its rated value for protection in particular an indirect mppt control method is proposed for the 120 kw electrical system to capture the maximum power in the partial load region experimental results of a complete operating period have demonstrated that the system has a satisfactory operation performance and can run stably with a relatively high energy efficiency for most of the tidal current period the pitch control can effectively confine the output power nearby the rated power of 120 kw when the rated current velocity is exceeded the proposed indirect mppt control method obtains good results although some difference remains between the theory and practice further the electricity fed into the grid has high quality and the active and reactive power are well regulated and thus almost all electricity is fed into the grid therefore the effectiveness and feasibility of the entire system design control concept and experimental method are validated which is clearly meaningful for the progress of tidal energy systems acknowledgements this work was supported by the science fund

clean energy resources have recently attracted extensive attention owing to the growing problems of energy availability and environmental pollution tidal current energy is regarded as one of the most promising energy resources because of its predictability reliability and high energy density liu et al 2011 horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion systems which can effectively convert the kinetic energy of tidal currents into electricity have broad application prospects and a significant research value ng et al 2013 the tidal current turbine has evolved from the wind turbine and thus they have much in common energy from wind turbines already accounts for a significant share in many countries the wind turbine technology has only recently become sufficiently mature balat 2009 hernández et al 2017 although a lot can be learnt from the wind turbine field some aspects are different in tidal turbines such as the underwater operating conditions difficult and costly ocean installations and high requirements posed on materials and components by the tidal current s energy density because of these factors tidal energy systems remain at a certain distance from technical maturity and large scale commercial use in recent years various global studies have focused on marine tidal current energy systems goundar and ahmed 2013 designed tidal current turbine hydrofoils named as hf10xx with a different blade location results from a numerical analysis and ansys simulation validated that the designed rotor has satisfactory efficiency at current speeds of 1 3 m s and better performance than some other blade profiles batten et al 2004 presented a method for the hydrodynamic design of marine current turbines in which a numerical model of a typical 3d rotor was used to demonstrate the variations of the design parameters and the use of alternative blade sections gaurier et al 2013 designed and implemented a 3 blade horizontal axis turbine with 400 mm long blades a series of flume tank tests on stains under influence of both current and wave current interactions was presented to improve the long term reliability of tidal turbines batten et al 2007 designed and implemented a 1 20th scale model of a 16 m diameter horizontal axis tidal turbine tests were carried out in both a cavitation tunnel and towing tank at southampton university the results showed a balance between loads and optimization of energy yields and the linkage between device and site parameters xiros et al 2015 presented a detailed modeling of a tidal current turbine system including its operating environment mechanical and electrical parts and simulations of its power control algorithm aimed at energy generation efficiency and output power safety zhou et al 2013a b studied the power smoothing control and power limitation control above the rated current velocity for a 1 5 mw pmsg based marine current turbine through an improvement in the control policy of the electrical system the simulations showed an ideal result gaamouche et al 2017 attempted to provide a systematic design methodology of a tidal turbine connected to the electrical grid two methodologies of systemic design were simply described and analyzed the first approach consisted of synchronous permanent magnet generators with direct connection and the second one included asynchronous generators with double alimentation and indirect connection sousounis et al 2015a b and kuschke and kai 2013 studied a tidal current conversion system in which the power electronics were moved from the nacelle to the shore and the offshore generator was connected via long subsea cables a long distance control and an overvoltage reduction method were proposed to solve the problems of electromagnetic travelling waves power electronic pulses and overvoltages through an appropriate filter design these methods were validated by developing a full resource to grid model in matlab simulink these above mentioned studies which include hydrodynamic design modeling control strategy numerical simulation and laboratory test were conducted in a laboratory under ideal and controllable conditions moreover each investigation focused on a small part of the marine tidal current energy system hence the satisfactory results provided by these laboratory analyses and small scale experiments are limited in scope serving as a general guide for the entire design and sea trial in a real flow field some sea trials of full scale horizontal axis marine tidal current turbines have been implemented over the last few years seagen a commercial scale horizontal axis tidal current turbine of 1 2 mw 2 600 kw was developed by marine current turbines mct ltd and tested in strangford lough northern ireland in 2008 douglas et al 2008 it was intended to produce a full size tidal turbine as a system to test the real problems of developing viable underwater energy technology in the elapsed time some operational and economic issues have been presented fraenkel 2010a b andritz hydro hammerfest ahh installed a 1 mw pre commercial tidal turbine hs1000 on december 2011 it was connected to the grid on

assembling stage in the first phase andritz hydro hammerfest 2017 1 5mw ar1500 and 1 5 mw seagen u are two up to date turbine systems from atlantis resources ltd the tidal turbines are fixed to the seabed by either a gravity base or fixed pylons they are connected to the grid via an armored power export cable and are typically controlled via a standard scada system atlantis resources limited 2017a the meygen project a commercial multi turbine array is currently the largest planned tidal stream project in the world by atlantis resources ltd presently meygen has grid capacity of up to 252 mw atlantis resources limited 2017b however owing to the company nature and commercial secrecy literature about the detailed designs applicable parameters and evaluation of the experimental result of these full scale marine tidal energy systems are rarely seen this paper presents the integrated design and implementation procedure of a 120 kw horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion system this tidal energy system is of variable speed variable pitch and grid connection type different from the partial research and small scale prototypes in the aforementioned laboratory investigations the overall detailed design of a full scale system is provided comprising the system design control concept and sea trial moreover an in situ experiment was conducted in a real tidal flow the system design includes the turbine pitch system mechanical drive train and electrical system the control concept consists of the grid connected maximum power point tracking mppt and pitch controls unlike the commercial literature of those multi hundred kilowatt or megawatt turbines the design parameters and representative experimental results are provided and analyzed in detail to verify the feasibility of the system design and control concept hence the integrated design and implementation of the present 120 kw tidal energy system offer a valuable experience toward the development of tidal energy systems 2 system design 2 1 turbine design 2 1 1 a review of the blade element momentum bem theory according to the blade element theory the blade is divided into a number of transversal elements placed along the blade as shown in fig 1 a blade element is sectioned by two parallels situated at r and r dr from the hub consider that the turbine is situated in a tidal flow of v velocity the notations in fig 1 have the following meaning v is the tidal current velocity ω is the rotor rotating speed ω is the relative velocity of tidal current α is the angle of attack β t is the twist angle r is the radius of the local blade element df is the resultant force of the local blade element df l and df d are the elementary lift and drag forces respectively df t is the elementary tangential force and df a is the elementary axial thrust burton et al 2001 manwell et al 2006 munteanu et al 2008 according to the rotor disc theory the transfer of rotational motion to the flow takes place entirely across the rotor disc the flow angle and the relative velocity of a tidal current are given by 1 φ α β t tan 1 1 a 1 b 1 λ r 2 ω v 1 a 2 λ r 2 1 b 2 3 ω v 1 a sin φ ω r 1 b cos φ where λ r is the local tip speed ratio and λ r r ω v φ is the flow angle and a and b denote the axial and tangential flow induction factors respectively the elementary lift and drag forces on the local blade element become 4 d f l 1 2 ρ c c l ω 2 d r 5 d f d 1 2 ρ c c d ω 2 d r where ρ is the density of sea water c is the local chord length and c l and c d denote the lift and drag coefficients respectively hence the thrust and torque on a span wise length dr of the rotor each blade can be calculated by 6 d t n d f a n d f l cos φ d f d sin φ 1 2 n ρ c ω 2 c l cos φ c d sin φ d r 7 d m n r d f t n r d f l sin φ d f d cos φ 1 2 n ρ c ω 2 c l sin φ c d cos φ r d r where t and m denote the thrust and torque of the rotor respectively and n is the number of blades of the rotor according to the momentum theory the thrust and angular momentum change rate are given by 8 d t 4 ρ π v 2 a 1 a r d r 9 d l d t 4 ρ π v ω 1 a b r 3 d r where l is the angular momentum on the span wise length dr of the rotor and d l d t represents the angular momentum change rate therefore the axial flow induction factor can be calculated by combining eqs 3 6 and 8 as 10 a n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 8 π r sin 2 φ n c c l cos φ c d sin φ and according to the angular momentum theory d m d l d t the tangential flow induction factor can be calculated by combining eqs 3 7 and 9 as 11 b n c c l sin φ c d cos φ 8 π r sin φ cos φ n c c l sin φ c d cos φ the chord length and twist angle can be obtained from eqs 1 3 and 11 with a slight simplification 12 c μ 8 π r λ r b μ 2 n c l 1 a 2 λ r 1 b 2 μ 2 13 β t μ tan 1 1 a 1 b 1 λ r μ α μ where μ is the relative blade radius and μ r r and r is the radius of the rotor 2 1 2 parameter correction to the bem theory 2 1 2 1 prandtl correction factor for tip and root losses because the blade tip follows a circular path it leaves a trailing vortex of helical structure where the circulation decreases significantly which also occurs at the blade root this makes the rotor torque decrease according to prandtl s approximation method burton et al 2001 the prandtl correction factor for tip and root losses is given by 14 f f t f r 2 π cos 1 exp n 2 r r r sin φ 2 π cos 1 exp n 2 r r h r h sin φ 4 π 2 cos 1 exp n 2 r r r sin φ cos 1 exp n 2 r r h r h sin φ where f is the prandtl correction factor f t is the tip loss factor f r is the root loss factor and r h is the radius of the hub then eqs 10 and 11 can be modified as 15 a n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 8 π r f sin 2 φ n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 16 b n c c l sin φ c d cos φ 8 π r f sin φ cos φ n c c l sin φ c d cos φ 2 1 2 2 axial flow induction factor correction in the turbulent state under a turbulent state the boundary of flow tube is broken therefore the bem theory is no longer suitable according to wilson empirical expression hansen 2015 the thrust coefficient under a big induction velocity can be approximated as 17 c t 0 587 0 96 a f a 0 38 where c t is the thrust coefficient then under this condition the axial flow induction factor a is replaced by 18 a 1 0 48 k 0 23 k 2 1 55 k a 0 38 where k 2 π r f sin 2 φ n c c l cos φ c d sin φ 2 1 2 3 lift and drag coefficient correction to 2d static coefficients the basic assumption of the bem theory is that the force of a blade element is solely responsible for the change of flow momentum it is therefore assumed that there is no radial interaction between the elements however when stall occurs the flow at the blade surface experiences a centrifugal force that causes it to flow radially outwards this reduces the displacement thickness of the boundary layer which invalidates the assumption of the bem theory sant 2007 owing to the complex 3d nature of the flow over rotating turbine blades the hydrofoil characteristics vary considerably from the 2d static hydrofoil characteristics according to du and selig 2013 a rigorous analysis of the integral boundary layer equations is applied which originates from the 3d incompressible boundary layer equations for a rotating system the lift and drag coefficients are modified as 19 c l c l f l 2 π α α 0 c l 20 c d c d f d c d c d0 where c l and c d denote the modified lift and drag coefficients respectively α 0 is the angle of attack at the blade root c d0 is the drag coefficient when α 0 and f l and f d are the correction factors relative to the local solidity c r and the local tip speed ratio which are given by 21 f l 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 γ a c r γ d λ r r γ b c r γ d λ r r 1 22 f d 1 2 π 1 6 c r 0 1267 γ a c r γ d 2 λ r r γ b c r γ d 2 λ r r 1 where λ r ω v 2 r ω 2 and the terms γ a γ b and γ d denote empirical correction factors 2 1 3 turbine design structure based on the aforementioned derivation a step by step sequence of the turbine design is presented in fig 2 2 1 4 hydrofoil data of 120 kw turbine a three bladed rotor is designed for the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system following the above design method the fundamental parameters are listed in table 1 table 2 presents the blade geometrical parameter distributions along the blade fig 3 shows the blade profile fig 4 provides the hydrodynamic characteristics of the power coefficient when the pitch angle is set to be 2 0 and 2 respectively 2 1 5 blade fabrication the structure design including material shear web and coating is important to the tidal turbine because of the large sea flow loading on the blade in this 120 kw turbine blade a fiberglass layer with epoxy curing is used the fiberglass is known for its high strength and stiffness fig 5 presents a visualized impression of the blade fabrication process the green rib plate in fig 5 b made of a composite material is the shear web after the fabrication of the blade a load test including the fatigue and extreme loads should be carried out finally specific anticorrosive paints are sprayed over the blade to resist corrosion caused by the sea flow 2 2 pitch system the pitch system in a tidal current energy system provides three functions first to pitch the blades from 0 to 180 to make full use of the bi directional current second to confine the captured power at its rated value when the rated current velocity is exceeded third to stop the turbine by pitching the blades downstream to protect it during strong flows wu et al 2012 a novel blade pitch system using a rack and pinion gear set and hydraulic drive is designed in consideration of the high energy density of tidal flows and the high sealing requirement as shown in fig 6 a sizable hydraulic cylinder is installed in front of the hub whose output piston rod is fixedly connected with three parallel racks each rack engages a gear which is rigidly connected by bolts to the blade root the racks drive gears to make the blades pitch between 0 and 180 when the hydraulic power drives the piston rod and the racks move synchronously the red dashed lines in fig 6 refer to the oil ways inside the hub which are formed by punching holes in the hub s walls and main shaft besides the outer hydraulic oil is deposited into the rotary hub when the turbine is working by a mechanism of oil slip rings the sealing structures at the blade root and the main shaft are used to prevent sand and water from entering this configuration is essentially different from a wind turbine because the size of the hydraulic cylinder is relatively large it can supply a considerable torque to adapt to the high density tidal flow and increase the natural frequency of the hydraulic system which improves dynamic performance the three blades are uniformly driven by one hydraulic cylinder this makes the pitch system able to be installed in a narrow hub collectively which can significantly reduce current blocking moreover as a hydraulic actuator is applied the water insensitivity and system safety are improved 2 3 mechanical drive train the mechanical drive train is one of the most important parts of the tidal current energy conversion system therefore its key issues should be thoughtfully taken into account by the designers firstly the turbine should have a good streamline such as a long narrow shape that reduces current blocking and have a strong capability of energy transmission in view of the high energy density of the tidal flow secondly the structure of dynamic seals is crucial to the underwater condition differently from a wind energy system thirdly the underwater turbine should have anti pressure and corrosion resistance characteristics as shown in fig 7 the mechanical drive train of the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system consists of a main shaft fixedly connected to the rotor hub a parallel axis power diffluence and confluence gear train and a permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg an integrated design is adopted in the connection between the rotor hub and the main shaft which makes it able to bear heavier torque the gear train converts the low rotating speed and high torque to a high rotating speed and low torque from the main shaft to the pmsg aiming at a long narrow streamline of the turbine a pattern of two stage parallel axes planetary gears is employed in which the first stage is the power diffluence gear train and the second stage is the power confluence gear train in addition a structure of three ply dynamic seals is designed for the rotating main shaft and applied at the main shaft to prevent sand and water from entering in the three ply dynamic seals the first ply is a scraper seal the second ply consists of three seal sleeves and the third ply consists of three u ring seals a rigid duct enclosing the cables is attached at the end of the turbine to the onshore electrical system which transmits the pmsg output and the measured signals such as pitch angle water leakage and temperature 2 4 electrical system the electrical system schematic of the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system is shown in fig 8 the electrical system mainly consists of a three phase diode rectifier bridge a dc side filter a regulating load a grid side converter a lc filter a transformer and a plc controller a three phase uncontrollable rectifier is employed at the pmsg output side to simplify the control complexity and reduce costs compared with a controllable one however ripples or pulsations exist in its output dc voltage a dc side filter is therefore used to smooth the fluctuations suppress the harmonics and absorb the reactive power additionally the regulating load aims to reduce the inrush current and protect the dc bus under an over rated flow which makes the system transform smoothly in different operating states a grid side controllable converter is utilized to feed the electricity into the grid control the dc bus voltage and regulate the active and reactive power the lc filter reduces the current harmonics and improves the power quality fed into the grid an industrial programmable logic controller plc is employed as the control module for the grid connected control mppt control below the rated tidal current velocity and power limiting control that refers to the pitch control in the full load region some other auxiliary functions such as operating condition and parameter monitoring data storage and analysis and fundamental protection can also be realized 3 control concept the tidal energy system operates with different dynamics under different tidal current velocities as seen in fig 9 there are four key points on the curve i e starting cut in rated and cut out velocities starting velocity is the tidal current velocity when the turbine begins to rotate cut in velocity is the minimum tidal current velocity at which the turbine delivers power to grid rated velocity is the tidal current velocity when the output power just reaches its designed rated value cut out velocity is the maximum tidal current velocity that the turbine can tolerate when the tidal current velocity exceeds this value the blades should be pitched downstream for protection the operation curve in fig 9 can be divided into two regions partial load and full load regions in the partial load region the tidal current velocity ranges from the cut in velocity to the rated velocity munteanu et al 2008 the tidal energy system operates at variable rotor speeds to capture the maximum available energy in the flow meanwhile the blade pitch angle is kept constant in the full load region the tidal current velocity ranges from the rated velocity to the cut out velocity the output power should be confined at its rated value through pitch control additionally in both regions the grid connected control must be taken into consideration 3 1 grid connected control the grid side parameters such as voltage current frequency and phase are measured as references by the grid connected system to ensure the quality of the grid side converter s output voltage and current in accordance with the standards the grid connected control schematic is shown in fig 10 the grid side converter controller operates in an ac voltage dq reference system the active and reactive components of the grid side converter currents are regulated by a fast inner control loop p mq and p md are the width pulse modulation factors which refer to the q axis current setpoint and d axis current setpoint respectively the dc bus voltage is controlled to be steadily maintained at the pre defined desired value in the dq reference the grid side voltage vector is fixed on the q axis hence i gq and i gd denote the active and reactive currents respectively then the relation between the grid side three phase current and the q d axis currents can be obtained by the means of the park transform as described by eq 23 because active power is needed to be exported to the grid the desired d axis current is generally set to zero 23 i gq i gd 2 3 cos θ cos θ 2 3 π cos θ 2 3 π sin θ sin θ 2 3 π sin θ 2 3 π i ga i gb i gc where i gq and i gd are the q axis and d axis currents in the dq reference respectively i ga i gb and i gc are the grid side three phase currents and θ is the phase angle 3 2 maximum power point tracking mppt control a diode rectifier converter configuration is applied for the 120 kw tidal current energy conversion system as it is not a fully controlled rectifier converter pair the mppt control cannot be realized by the torque control of the generator directly as stated above the dc bus voltage can be regulated by the converter hence an indirect method is proposed to realize the mppt control below the rated tidal current velocity through setting an appropriate dc bus voltage the relation between the generator rotating speed and the dc bus voltage should be found in the partial load region consequently whereas it is improper to regard the three phase rectifier s voltage or current as a simple sinusoid owing to the existing distortions it is also difficult to give a precise mathematical description however there is a certain relation among the generator rotating speed tidal current velocity and dc bus voltage when the system runs stably as shown in eq 24 24 u dc f u ω g v where ω g is the generator rotating speed and u dc is the dc bus voltage this relation curve can be obtained by a workshop test in which the mechanical drive train is towed by a drive motor and the electrical system is connected to the grid to simulate a real operation the approach to gain the relation curve is presented as the following three steps i in the partial region the blade pitch angle is controlled to be a constant value to make the rotor keep an optimal maximum power capturing state to a certain blade and a certain pitch angle the power coefficient c p λ β optimal tip speed ratio λ opt and maximum power coefficient c pmax can all be obtained in fig 4 ii simulating an operating state in which the system operates with an optimal maximum power capturing in the partial region with a certain tidal current velocity then 25 ω g n λ opt r v 26 p p max 1 2 c pmax ρ s v 3 where λ opt is the optimal tip speed ratio c pmax is the maximum power coefficient p is the captured power here refers to the generator power p max is the maximum power in this operating state n is the gearbox transmission ratio and s is the rotor area iii giving the drive motor a torque 27 t wanted p max ω g 1 2 r n λ opt c pmax ρ s v 2 where t wanted is the given torque of the drive motor then the desired dc bus voltage under this tidal current velocity and generator rotating speed can be obtained by measuring the current dc bus voltage thus the relation curve in eq 24 can be gained through testing the tidal current velocities varying from the cut in velocity to the rated velocity iteratively by steps ii and iii however the precise tidal current velocity at the rotary impeller is hard to measure in the sea trial the measured tidal current velocity data by a traditional single point velocimeter could not be used as the input signals for power control owing to the imprecise measurements hence the generator rotating speed is regarded as the input signal for this mppt control in the sea trial the desired value of the control variable dc bus voltage is picked from the work shop test result u dc f u ω g like the empirical curve shown in fig 11 consequently the proposed indirect mppt control method can be realized to catch the relative maximum power by predefining the matched dc bus voltages according to the generator rotating speeds as shown in fig 12 3 3 power limiting control pitch control considering the high power density of the tidal current and the cubic relationship between power and current velocity which make both the mechanical and electrical components fragile when the rated velocity is exceeded effective means should be taken to protect the system for the variable pitch tidal turbine in this paper the energy harvesting efficiency is limited by pitch action in the high current velocity region the pitch angle is raised to shed some of the hydrodynamic power as the c p λ curve cluster of different pitch angles of a certain blade profile can be calculated according to the bem theory the desired pitch angle can be derived through the c p λ curve cluster and the signals of the generator rotating speed and tidal current velocity however aside from the imprecise measurement of tidal current velocity there are significant amounts of nonlinearity and data massiveness that make the pitch control program very complicated in this direct derivation of the desired pitch angle hence in this paper a method of direct power feedback control is adopted to achieve the power limiting control in the full load region the block diagram is shown in fig 13 the generator power is measured and used as the feedback power 4 experiment and discussion 4 1 workshop test the tidal current energy conversion system will face complex conditions in a real flow field to evaluate the whole performance of the 120 kw system such aspects were tested in the workshop before the sea trial including the variation of vibration noise and temperature of the mechanical drive train the efficiency and stability of the electrical system and the effectiveness of the control system the layout of the workshop test configuration is shown in fig 14 as mentioned above the relation curve u dc f u ω g is necessary to the mppt control below the rated current velocity according to the approach presented in subsection 3 2 the desired dc bus voltage curve of the mppt control from the workshop test is displayed in fig 15 which is the mppt control basis in the next underwater test this mppt control is a look up table method based on the pre test according to the test result shown in fig 15 a relation equation between the generator rotating speed and the dc bus voltage is summarized as a logarithmic function in eq 28 by curve fitting in order to conveniently figure out the desired dc bus voltage under different generator rotating speeds 28 u dc f 1 ln ω g f 2 u dc u 0 where f 1 423 21 f 2 1176 9 and u 0 is the lower limit considering the operation requirement of the grid side converter 4 2 sea trial the sea trial of the designed 120 kw horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion system was carried out at zhairuoshan island in zhejiang china the overall configuration is shown in fig 16 mainly including the tidal current turbine hydraulic driving system electrical system and control system the entire system is settled on a specific offshore experimental platform the tidal current turbine is installed on a rigid support structure this support structure lowers the turbine into the water during a slack tide and lift up the turbine when malfunction occurs which avoids underwater works and simplifies maintenance in comparison to the underwater installation type the hydraulic driving electrical and control systems are all installed inside the cabin of the platform to resist the variable weather on the sea pipelines are used to connect the hydraulic driving system and the turbine s internal oil ways in order to transmit the pitch force a three phase electrical cable enclosed in the duct delivers electricity from the pmsg to the electrical system sensor wires are also enclosed in the duct to transmit the measured feedback signals to the control system which helps the control system to realize the control functions shown in the above studies a tablet personal computer with a specific designed labview program is used as the human machine interaction for the system operating condition and parameter monitoring fault warning and data backup 4 3 results and discussion data of a tidal period in the sea trial on april 24 2017 are typically selected to analyze in which the tidal flow varies from slack to maximum and back to slack fig 17 shows the tidal current velocity in this tidal period in which the values range from 0 255 m s to 2 23 m s the current velocity is above 1 5 m s during approximately 75 of the total operating period fig 18 shows the generator output power curve in this period as can be seen from figs 16 and 17 the generator power keeps a cube relation with the tidal current velocity the turbine s startup current velocity is about 0 85 m s when the current velocity is above the rated value of 2 m s the output power can be confined nearby the rated power of 120 kw by the pitch system which avoids an overload operation fig 19 presents the average power coefficient at different tidal current velocities in the generation period which is drawn by averaging the power coefficients at the same current velocity in each case as the figure shows the power efficiency is low in the current velocity range from 1 m s to 1 5 m s and rises with the increase in current velocity the power coefficients run around 0 37 in the current velocity range from 1 5 m s to 2 m s combining this with fig 17 most of the current velocities in the selected generation period are above 1 5 m s therefore it validates the rationality of the system design that a relatively high efficiency can be maintained for most of the operating time however compared with the design value the experimental result of the power efficiency is down about 18 the causes include the following four points ① power loses in the mechanical drive train ② errors when manufacturing the blade mold ③ an acoustic doppler velocimeter was placed at a distance ahead of the tidal current turbine for a single point measurement in the sea trial while its accuracy cannot be guaranteed ④ because an indirect mppt control method by setting matched dc bus voltages is used below the rated current velocity it is difficult to achieve a precise dynamic control in consideration of the system s stability requirement for example the predefined dc bus voltage value has a certain lower limit otherwise the steadiness of the grid connected voltage and the reliability of the grid connected system will be affected this makes the rotating state of the rotor to deviate from the optimal tip speed ratio hence these existing weaknesses make the control ability slightly stagnant and inaccurate fig 20 shows the generator rotating speed variations when the current velocity achieves the starting velocity the rotating speed increases rapidly the generator speed varies between 20 rad s to 60 rad s based on the proposed mppt control strategy fig 21 shows the sea trial data of the dc bus voltage generator torque generator rotating speed combining with fig 15 the data variation tendency in fig 21 matches the proposed mppt control strategy this indicates that the proposed indirect mppt control strategy obtains a good application effect here the lower limit of the dc bus voltage is set at 400 v in consideration of the grid side converter s operation requirement fig 22 shows the partial detail of the grid side phase voltage and fig 23 shows the partial detail of the grid side phase current during the operating period as illustrated in fig 22 the grid side phase voltage runs as a regular sinusoid of 50 hz frequency with few distortions as illustrated in fig 23 the curves also run at 50 hz sinusoidally the amplitude varies with the power and there are a few distortions as shown in fig 24 the grid side q axis current varies with the generator power and the d axis current is effectively controlled at zero fig 25 shows the active and reactive power variations of the grid connected system during the operating period the active power has a same variation tendency with the q axis current the reactive power is correspondingly controlled at zero combining fig 25 with fig 18 almost all the electricity is fed into the grid therefore the active and reactive power in the dq reference are well regulated by the grid connected control system 5 conclusion a sequence of the integrated design and implementation of a 120 kw horizontal axis tidal current energy conversion system is thoroughly presented in this paper based on the bem theory a turbine design method is proposed in detail in addition parameter corrections are made to the bem theory considering its defects then hydrofoil data of the 120 kw turbine are obtained by this turbine design method additionally a collective blade pitch system applicable to the underwater turbine is specifically designed which can supply a large pitch torque and has the ability to capture bi directional tidal current energy because the available blade angles range from 0 to 180 a mechanical drive train with long and narrow shape is designed which provides strong energy transmission capability and reduces current blocking an electrical system for grid connection is adequately described according to the analysis of output power characteristics for the tidal energy system operation a concept of control comprising the grid connected mppt and pitch controls is proposed the grid connected control regulates the active and reactive power and ensure electric power quality the pitch control confines the captured power at its rated value for protection in particular an indirect mppt control method is proposed for the 120 kw electrical system to capture the maximum power in the partial load region experimental results of a complete operating period have demonstrated that the system has a satisfactory operation performance and can run stably with a relatively high energy efficiency for most of the tidal current period the pitch control can effectively confine the output power nearby the rated power of 120 kw when the rated current velocity is exceeded the proposed indirect mppt control method obtains good results although some difference remains between the theory and practice further the electricity fed into the grid has high quality and the active and reactive power are well regulated and thus almost all electricity is fed into the grid therefore the effectiveness and feasibility of the entire system design control concept and experimental method are validated which is clearly meaningful for the progress of tidal energy systems acknowledgements this work was supported by the science fund
