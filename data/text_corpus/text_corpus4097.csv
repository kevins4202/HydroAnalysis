20485,the damping characteristic has an important influence on reliably predicting the dynamic response and fatigue life of the support structure of an offshore wind turbine owt generally the damping sources of an owt in parked conditions always include hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping ignoring aerodynamic damping however the difficulties in identifying the total damping of the owt have created uncertainty and variation in the value of damping recommended in the design in this research an estimation approach for total damping was proposed for an owt supported by a wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf which is considered a novel bucket foundation and its damping characteristics are still unclear the hydrodynamic damping calculated based on morison s equation of 0 0128 for the owt supported by wsbf is smaller than the value of the monopile foundation the soil damping is approximately 0 120 obtained using the proposed theoretical method finally the computational damping of the owt in parked conditions was verified by the measured total damping of two parked owts at two different offshore wind farms owfs of china the results show that the damping obtained by these two methods was in good agreement with the average deviation of 11 20 keywords offshore wind turbine owt wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf computational damping hydrodynamic damping soil damping field measurement 1 introduction in 2019 the 6 15 gw new installations of offshore wind turbine owt led the global offshore wind power market to grow by 41 38 compared to that in 2018 reaching a global cumulative installed capacity of 29 14 gw the united kingdom remains the world s biggest offshore wind market with 9 72 gw of total installed capacity while china is rapidly catching up with a cumulative installed capacity of 6 84 gw gwec 2020 however with the rapid development of offshore wind power in recent years the owt has become structurally more flexible to increase power generation and limit weight devriendt et al 2014 therefore structural fatigue is considered a governing factor and dynamic analysis is often mandatory for an accurate fatigue assessment in the design process of the support structures for owts salzmann and tempel 2005 moreover damping is an important influencing factor for the dynamic analysis and plays an active role in mitigating the fatigue accumulation of owts which directly affects the cost of the entire owt structure versteijlen et al 2011 because of the large size numerous components complex structure and diverse site conditions the damping mechanism of an owt is complicated in the dynamic analysis the damping ratio is a critical parameter for measuring the damping magnitude therefore increasing the accuracy of the damping ratio estimation is considered an important task to improve the reliability of the structural dynamic response analysis however when estimating the damping ratio even small discrepancies could cause large differences in the dynamic response during the operational conditions the damping sources for the owt include aerodynamic damping hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping which are affected by several different factors as shown in fig 1 a recommended practice published jointly by the american wind energy association awea and the american society of civil engineers asce suggests that seismic design spectra for parked owt structures should be based on a total damping of 1 whereas design spectra for operational owt structures should choose a total damping of 5 asce awea 2011 however the variations in published values for most damping sources remain large and these create uncertainty of the total damping in the design therefore most current designs of owts may be unsafe or overly conservative during the power production process aerodynamic damping is a dominant source of damping in the fore aft direction however it is far less significant in the fore aft direction for parked rotors or the side to side direction for design situations including wind wave misalignment shirzadeh et al 2013 tarpjohansen et al 2009 valamanesh and myers 2014 without considering the influence of aerodynamic damping this research focuses on the total damping of owts in parked conditions including hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping hydrodynamic damping is composed of radiation damping and viscous damping soil damping can be conveniently expressed by equivalent viscous damping and rayleigh damping is usually adopted for structural damping recently the actual damping calculation is an important issue in the coupled dynamic analysis of owt structures and there are several prior studies on damping estimation especially soil damping gl 2005 cook and vandiver 1982 tarpjohansen et al 2009 carswell et al 2015 which is the most uncertain contributor to the total damping of the owt an analysis of the total damping for a single pile platform was presented in 1982 cook and vandiver 1982 and in this predictive analysis the components of the total modal damping were separately computed from this cook et al suggested a value of 0 26 for hydrodynamic damping and 0 6 for soil damping johansen et al estimated the individual contributions of damping sources of cross wind motion for owts tarpjohansen et al 2009 they suggested that a value of 0 80 for soil damping should be used to account for the nonlinear behaviour of the soil while 0 22 was used for hydrodynamic damping versteijlen et al found that the effect of soil on the damping of a particular owt was large with soil damping of 1 5 versteijlen et al 2011 shirzadeh et al observed an effect of the wave direction on the hydrodynamic damping of owts shirzadeh et al 2013 moreover carswell et al investigated the significance of soil damping on monopile supported owts subjected to extreme storm loading using a linear elastic two dimensional finite element model carswell et al 2015 gres et al quantified the damping of an offshore meteorological mast supported by a mono bucket foundation based on a long term experimental campaign with a mean value of 1 11 of total damping gres et al 2016 chen et al proposed methods to quantify the contributions from different sources of damping for owts on a monopile chen and duffour 2018 damping ratio contributions of the owts supported by the jacket on suction caissons is recommended by saleh et al in his research the hydrodynamic damping was in the range of 0 07 0 23 the soil damping ranged from 0 44 to 1 and the structural damping was 0 15 1 5 saleh and subhamoy 2020 the total damping estimations from previous research for parked owts are listed in table 1 for comparison versteijlen et al 2011 devriendt et al 2013a shirzadeh et al 2013 carswell et al 2015 gres et al 2016 chen and duffour 2018 saleh and subhamoy 2020 these values reflect the range and uncertainties in damping from different sources for different types of foundations a large deviation was observed in the damping estimation in these studies as a novel foundation type the wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf has the advantages of high load capacity lian et al 2014 self floating ability le et al 2013 and low cost compared with other foundation types of owts because the seven rooms inside the foundation are divided by steel bulkheads the wsbf has reasonable motion characteristics and towing reliability during the wet tow construction process zhang 2019 additionally integrated transportation and installation techniques have been implemented in two different owfs based on this novel foundation and good economic benefits were obtained ding et al 2013 lian et al 2019 the foundation type of the owts affects the hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping however there is minimal effect on aerodynamic damping thus there are some differences between the damping of the monopod bucket and wsbf owing to their different material compositions and construction methods however few researches on the damping of the owt supported by this novel foundation were completed thus a cautious calculation method and theoretical reconstruction should be conducted to estimate the individual damping contributions in this research an estimation approach for the total damping of the parked owt supported by the wsbf including hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping has been proposed further a simplified modelling method to quantify the damping contributions from the hydrodynamic effect was introduced the measured damping of the owt was used to verify the calculation method of total damping based on two typical owts supported by the wsbf the remainder of this paper is organised into five sections section 2 briefly introduces the wsbf and its engineering example in section 3 the calculation method and model of total damping are presented with the given structural damping based on the equations and numerical method used to estimate hydrodynamic damping and soil damping respectively then two prototype observations of the owt supported by the wsbf for different owfs of china are introduced in section 4 the measured mean damping of these two parked owts under different wind speeds was used to verify the total damping model and equations proposed in section 3 good agreement between the calculated damping and measured mean damping of the owts in parked conditions was observed section 5 compares the total damping of a parked owt supported by the wsbf with the result of an owt supported by a monopile finally the key conclusions of this research are presented in section 6 2 wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf the wsbf with a special load bearing mode and better bearing capacity was first proposed by lian et al based on the conventional bucket foundation lian et al 2011 as shown in fig 2 compared with traditional suction caissons the wsbf has an excellent performance such as better bearing capacity low engineering investment and convenient transportation and installation lian et al 2011 2012 this new type of foundation can effectively convert the extremely large bending moment of the tower to the ground via a variable diameter concrete transition section zhang 2019 in addition the integrated transportation and installation techniques can be utilized for the owt supported by the wsbf based on the dedicated transportation vessel the cost is approximately 30 lower than that of existing relevant techniques ding et al 2011 this type of foundation has been applied to two different owfs in china one 1 owf is 10 km off the coast of the yellow sea with a water depth of 8 m 12 m and the other 2 owf is approximately 45 km off the coast of the yellow sea with a water depth of 8 m 15 m the basic properties of wsbfs wsbf for 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf and wsbf for 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf considered in this research are listed in table 2 the diameter of the concrete transition section of the 3 0 mw owt changes from 5 1 m to 20 m while that of the 3 3 mw owt is 6 3 m 21 m in contrast to driven piles just like tree planting the integrated transportation and installation techniques for the owt supported by the wsbf reduce the need for large scale installation equipment which is costly there are seven rooms inside the wsbf divided by steel bulkheads which are arranged in a honeycomb structure as shown in fig 2 b the wsbf is installed using a combination of self weight and applied suction during the installation process the installation of the owt only requires approximately one to two days in the sea area within a 35 m water depth ding et al 2013 moreover this novel foundation is considered an attractive alternative for owt installation because the noise disturbance of marine life and environmental influence during the installation process can also be reduced and diminished 3 damping of the owt supported by the wsbf under parked conditions the total damping of the owt consists of aerodynamic damping hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping the aerodynamic damping is mainly affected by the operational state of the owt and the geometry of the blades the shape and material of different types of foundations directly affect the hydrodynamic damping and soil damping caused by its interaction with water and soil in addition different types of foundations affect the structural damping which is closely related to the structural material and type of connections in the structure thus the aerodynamic damping of the owt is minimally affected by the type of foundation while hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping are greatly affected by this factor therefore further research should be conducted on damping sources other than aerodynamic damping for this novel bucket foundation in parked conditions the pitch angle of the owt is approximately 90 thus it can be assumed that the aerodynamic damping in the fore aft direction can be neglected in addition assuming that source damping can be modelled separately and superimposed damgaard et al 2012 gl 2005 shirzadeh et al 2013 tarpjohansen et al 2009 the total measured damping in parked conditions can be approximated as the sum of the following damping sources 1 ξ t o t a l ξ s t r u c ξ s o i l ξ h y d r o where ξ t o t a l ξ s t r u c ξ s o i l and ξ h y d r o are the total damping ratio structural damping ratio soil damping ratio and hydrodynamic damping ratio of the owt respectively 3 1 hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf hydrodynamic damping which is almost unaffected by the operational state of the owt may result from the interaction between the foundation and seawater therefore a simplified calculation method for the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf under irregular waves was derived based on morison s equation 3 1 1 hydrodynamic damping the equation of motion of the owt system under the wave load can be generally expressed as follows 2 m m a x c x k x ρ v c m u 1 2 ρ c d a u x u x where m is the mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix ρ is the density of water c m and c d are the mass and drag coefficients respectively a is the projection area matrix v is the projection volume matrix x is the displacement of the motion response and u is the velocity of the water particles the hydrodynamic damping mainly affects the second term on the right side of eq 2 hydrodynamic damping usually comes from two sources wave radiation damping and viscous damping these two damping sources are implicitly considered in morison s equation for an oscillating cylinder excited by waves the wave force per unit length can be expressed as follows 3 d f d z π 4 d z 2 c m ρ u ρ 2 c d d z u x u x here f is the wave force d z is the diameter of the cylinder considering the foundation element of the owt as a one degree of freedom mass spring system eq 3 can be substituted into the equation of motion m x k x d f d z and the subsequent equation can be rewritten as follows 4 m x k x π 4 d z 2 c m ρ u ρ 2 c d d z u x u x in the process of deriving the hydrodynamic damping the hydrodynamic damping always hinders the movement of the structure and the direction of movement has no effect on the value of the hydrodynamic damping coefficient so the absolute value in eq 4 may not be used 5 m x ρ c d d z u x k x π 4 d z 2 c m ρ u ρ 2 c d d z u 2 x 2 the damping force term equals the term related to the structural velocity x the hydrodynamic damping per unit length is 6 d c a d z ρ c d d z u c a 0 η ρ c d d z u d z here c a is the hydrodynamic damping and η is the wave elevation consequently the hydrodynamic damping ratio ξ n for the nth mode can be expressed as follows 7 ξ n c a 2 m n ω n 1 2 m n ω n 0 η ρ c d d z u d z where m n is the nth modal mass of the owt and ω n is the nth natural frequency of the owt however the diameter of foundation d f varies along the vertical direction for the wsbf as shown in fig 3 therefore eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 8 ξ n 1 2 m n ω n 0 η ρ c d d f z u d z where d f z is the diameter of the concrete transition section of the wsbf which varies as a function of height z 3 1 2 calculation example of hydrodynamic damping to calculate the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by wsbf the jonswap spectrum was used to generate the time histories of irregular waves subsequently the hydrodynamic damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile and wsbf were calculated using the equations proposed in section 3 1 1 the main parameters of the monopile are listed in table 3 while the properties of the wsbf are listed in table 2 the external environmental parameters including water depth significant wave height and wave period are listed in table 4 this single combination of average values of the wave period and wave height was selected for simplicity however this is representative of the most common sea states in the yellow sea area of china gao et al 2019 in addition the schematic diagrams of the hydrodynamic damping effect of these two different types of foundations are shown in fig 4 the detailed calculation for the hydrodynamic damping was provided in appendix 1 the calculation results of the hydrodynamic damping on these two different types of foundations are shown in fig 5 the hydrodynamic damping of the wsbf and monopile both show fluctuations over time and are stable at approximately 0 0128 and 0 0193 respectively the calculation result of the hydrodynamic damping for the monopile 0 0193 in this paper is consistent with the calculation result 0 0174 of the owt supported by monopile with the same rotor diameter in the research of chen et al chen and duffour 2018 in addition the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf is less than that of the owt on the monopile 3 1 3 factors influence on hydrodynamic damping based on the calculation process in section 3 1 1 the hydrodynamic damping of the whole system is mainly affected by the water depth and significant wave height considering the average significant wave height listed in table 4 assumed for the 3 0 mw owt the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf under different water depths was analysed and the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a deeper water depth leads to a higher hydrodynamic damping of the owt on the monopile which shows a clear linear increasing trend while the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf decreases first and then increases with increasing water depth in addition when the water depth increases to 12 m the hydrodynamic damping of the owt on the wsbf reaches a minimum at approximately 0 012 the consequence of two concomitant mechanisms was used to explain this change phenomenon in the owt supported by the wsbf one is the variation in the diameter of the foundation vertically and the other is the increase in the area in contact with seawater with increasing water depth specifically the diameter of the foundation decreases with an increase in water depth leading to a decrease in hydrodynamic damping however when the water depth increases beyond a critical value there is minimal variation in the diameter of the foundation section thus as the water depth increases the increased area in contact with seawater will increase hydrodynamic damping subsequently the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf under different significant wave heights was also analysed with the results shown in fig 7 when the water depth was assumed to be 10 m from fig 7 the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf shows an increasing trend with the increase in the significant wave height 3 2 soil damping of the owt supported by the wsbf the soil damping of an owt can generally be divided into radiation damping and hysteretic material damping carswell et al 2015 tarpjohansen et al 2009 the radiation damping is caused by the geometric dissipation of waves from spreading which depends on the frequencies of the external excitation however radiation damping can be negligible when the excitation frequencies are less than the natural frequency of the soil stratum gazetas and dobry 1984 the hysteretic material damping of soils is considered a result of friction between soil particles strain rate effects and nonlinearity of the stress strain relationship darendeli 2001 considering the complexity of soil behaviour soil damping is the least studied gl 2005 furthermore soil damping varies greatly owing to the differences in soil properties foundation type wind turbines etc 3 2 1 dynamic soil properties the performance of soil which is considered a natural material and exhibits nonlinear behaviour tends to change significantly in different sea areas in addition the dynamic properties of the soil can be expressed by shear modulus g and damping factor d ishibashi and zhang 1993 for all types of soils including sands and clays that do not have large volume changes under dynamic loading the relationship between the soil dynamics parameters and shearing strain amplitude is typically characterized by normalized curves as shown in fig 8 darendeli 2001 as shown in fig 8 the shear modulus g decreases with increasing strain amplitude while the damping factor d increases with the same change in strain amplitude the dynamic parameters of soil can be estimated using the following empirical equations ishibashi and zhang 1993 9 g g max k γ p i σ 0 m γ p i m 0 where 10 m γ p i m 0 0 272 1 tanh ln 0 000556 γ 0 4 e 0 0145 p i 1 3 11 k γ p i 0 5 1 tanh ln 0 000102 n p i γ 0 492 12 n p i 0 0 f o r p i 0 3 37 10 6 p i 1 404 f o r 0 p i 15 7 0 10 7 p i 1 976 f o r 15 p i 70 2 7 10 5 p i 1 115 f o r p i 70 here g max is the maximum value of the shear modulus σ 0 is the mean effective confining pressure pi is the soil plasticity index and γ is the shearing strain amplitude the damping curve can be associated with the normalized modulus reduction curve as follows 13 d 0 333 1 e 0 0145 p i 1 3 2 0 586 g g max 2 1 547 g g max 1 moreover the material damping ratio of soil β is related to the damping factor d through the expression carswell et al 2015 14 β ω n ω d where ω n is the undamped natural frequency and ω is the given angular frequency of load 3 2 2 viscous dashpot of the wsbf the corresponding soil damping of the wsbf can be computed based on analytical or empirical equations that account for energy dissipation through soil hysteretic behaviour a viscous rotational dashpot c φ and horizontal translation dashpot c h can be introduced to represent the hysteretic damping from the foundation soil interaction a schematic of these dashpots between the soil and foundation is shown in fig 9 the dashpot coefficient c of soil can be obtained as follows gazetas and dobry 1984 15 c 2 k β ω 16 k δ e s where β represents the material damping ratio of the soil k is the secant modulus defined as the ratio of the static local soil reaction per unit length to the corresponding local deflection ω is the circular frequency of the excitation δ is the empirical coefficient δ 1 0 1 2 gazetas and dobry 1984 and e s is young s modulus then the dashpot viscous damping constant c h and c φ of the wsbf can be computed as 17 c h 0 h c ε s 1 2 z d z 18 c φ 0 l c ε s 2 2 r r d r where h is the height of the wsbf c is the dashpot coefficient l is the diameter of the wsbf ε s 1 z ε s 2 r represent the horizontal and rotational normalization static deflection profile respectively this deflection profile is mainly determined based on the characteristics of the rigid mass body which is simplified from the wsbf 3 2 3 soil damping of the wsbf one 3 0 mw owt with the parameters listed in table 5 in 1 owf of china was selected to quantify the soil damping of the owt supported by the wsbf and the considered soil profile is from a specific yellow sea offshore site for this 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf as listed in table 6 the soil types analysed in this study included silt and clay to estimate the strain level of the soil profile a coupled finite infinite element abaqus model was employed for the analysis and an infinite element boundary was implemented to absorb the radiated wave energy as shown in fig 10 in this model the soil is modelled as an elastic plastic model with a total depth of 47 9 m and obeys the mohr coulomb yield criterion kumar and chakraborty 2015 liu et al 2014 for the element types eight node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r are used for the 3d solid elements infinite elements cin3d8 are used for the infinite element boundary and four node doubly curved thin elements s4r are used for the shell elements surface to surface contact is used to simulate the interaction between the steel bucket and soil and detachment is allowed a free vibration time history analysis of the finite element model was used to obtain the strain level in the soil the free vibration analysis was performed by gradually applying the load at the top of tower and then releasing the applied load to allow it to vibrate freely an example of the finite element result which shows the distribution of the strain is shown in fig 11 and the shear strain level in the soil is approximately 10 4 near the bucket toe at this strain level the material damping ratio β of each layer of soil can be obtained according to eq 9 eq 14 moreover the value of the fundamental natural frequency of the soil stratum f s can be obtained from published solutions dobry et al 1976 with a result of 0 8446 hz thus the radiation damping of the foundation is negligible in the analysis gazetas and dobry 1984 because most excitations such as wind and wave loads have frequencies below 0 8446 hz lombardi et al 2013 petersen 2010 for the owt supported by the wsbf based on the distribution of the compression modulus and the material damping ratio of this soil profile the damping coefficient of dashpots c h c φ for the wsbf can be calculated based on eq 15 eq 18 it is then applied to the theoretical model of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf as shown in fig 12 the entire theoretical model is considered to be linear thus the effect of the initial displacement amplitude on the damping calculation result can be ignored global soil damping is quantified from the free vibration time history shown in fig 13 at the hub of this model using the logarithmic decrement method junni et al 2021 the calculated result of the soil damping was 0 120 moreover the finite element method can also be used to estimate the soil damping of this 3 0 mw owt in this method the material damping ratio of the soil was applied to the finite element model by the rayleigh damping junni et al 2021 the soil damping also can be quantified from the free vibration time history at the hub of the finite element model using the logarithmic decrement method with a value of 0 125 it shows a good agreement with the result of 0 120 estimated by the theoretical method 3 3 structural damping structural damping is an inherent property of the owt structure and also an energy dissipation that can convert vibration energy into heat through internal friction of the material the structural damping of the owts could be larger than that in onshore wind turbines because of their complex foundation and possible grouting connections the structural damping of the owts is found to be between 0 2 and 1 5 chen and duffour 2018 in recent years structural damping of the owts has received minimal attention the structural damping of the owts is assumed to follow standard steel structures for which damping values are available chen and duffour 2018 in this research the wsbf consists of a steel bucket and concrete transition piece the concrete material is damped more than that of steel therefore the structural damping of the owt supported by the wsbf is considered to be larger than that of the monopile the structural damping is usually 0 48 for the blades and 0 8 for the tower veritas 2009 therefore an average value of 0 85 for the structural damping of the owt supported by the wsbf was adopted chopra 1995 which is larger than the value of 0 60 adopted for the monopile shirzadeh et al 2013 4 verification of damping model with measured data 4 1 prototype observation the measurement campaign was performed for a 3 0 mw owt and a 3 3 mw owt supported by the wsbf in two different owfs 1 owf and 2 owf respectively to monitor the vibration of the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf four three directional accelerometers were used to acquire the low frequency and multi directional dynamic signals the measurements were taken at four levels at four locations with a sampling frequency of 300 hz moreover four three directional displacement sensors and two three directional accelerometers mounted only at the top and bottom of the tower were used to acquire multi directional dynamic signals of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf at a sampling frequency of 200 hz the measurement locations of these two owts are shown in fig 14 by red circles while the data acquisition system is indicated by a green circle the locations were chosen based on the convenience of sensor mounting such as the vicinity of the platforms devriendt et al 2013b during these two short measurement campaigns with a total duration of one month the ambient and operational data wind speed wind direction power rotor speed and pitch angle were collected at 8 s intervals based on the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system in recent years operational modal analysis oma methods have been developed to identify the modal parameters from the response of a structure to unknown random perturbations carne and james 2010 in addition the ambient vibration test is usually performed for oma with the advantage of being practical and economical the oma methods work under the assumption that the system is linear time invariant during the analysed time interval and the excitation is white noise within the frequency band of interest devriendt et al 2012 in this research one oma method called stochastic subspace identification ssi was used to estimate the modal damping ratios of these two owts in parked conditions the ssi method has been identified as the most effective damping estimation technique anela et al 2017 with a lower mean squared error in comparison to the error from the eigensystem realization algorithm and the enhanced frequency domain decomposition during this period the blades were pitched out of the wind with pitch angle values around 90 the system is time invariant and oma assumptions are fulfilled in parked conditions devriendt et al 2013b a time segment of 10 min was considered to find estimates for the damping ratios of the owt devriendt et al 2013a this time segment is sufficient to robustly identify the modal parameters of the owt moreover a time segment of 10 min allows for the assumption that the ambient conditions remain constant which is needed for the oma time invariant assumption in addition 10 min is the commonly used time interval for the meteo data and thus it easier to analyze data in the future subsequently each of the measurements was cut in sequences of 10 min and fed to the ssi algorithm moreover for the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf when the owt is in parked conditions its operational data and external wind data during the selected analysis time period is shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively as shown in fig 15 when the owt is parked the pitch angle is 87 75 the rotational speed is almost zero the yaw angle is also stable at approximately 230 and the power of the system is negative thus the structural system needs to be supplied with energy from the outside as shown in fig 16 the wind speed changes within the range of 0 m s 30 m s during the monitoring process while the wind direction angle is within the range of 50 300 both the wind speed and wind direction vary widely in the analysis 4 2 wind and wave correspondence because no wave information is available in these two observations the wave parameters may be derived by assuming a wind generated sea state the correlation between the sea state parameters and wind speed can be provided by the equations for the fully developed jonswap spectrum according to the following equations lloyd 2005 19 t p u 10 g 1 0 16 20 h s 0 0094 0 16 5 3 u 10 2 g where t p is the peak period h s is the significant wave height and u 10 is the hourly mean wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface which can be calculated according to the wind speed measured at the hub height u 0 as follows lloyd 2005 21 u 0 u 10 z 0 10 0 12 here u 0 is the wind speed at the hub height and z 0 is the hub height of the owt it is assumed that the wind and wave are aligned and in the direction of the nacelle moreover the influence of the water depth on the wave parameters should be considered lloyd 2005 therefore the correspondence between the wind and wave parameters in these two observations is listed in table 7 and table 8 respectively 4 3 comparison of the measurements and calculation results based on the equations derived in section 3 1 1 the hydrodynamic damping under different wind conditions can be solved using the wind wave correspondence in tables 7 and 8 the corresponding calculation results are listed in table 9 from table 9 the hydrodynamic damping of the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf increases from 0 002 at a low wind speed to 0 062 with the increase in wind speed while that of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf increases from 0 003 to 0 074 as the wind speed increases the soil damping of these two different owts supported by wsbf can be obtained by the method proposed in section 3 2 the required parameters of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf and its soil profile are shown in table 10 and table 11 respectively in the process of calculating soil damping it needs to establish the finite element model and theoretical model of the owt firstly and then use the established finite element model to obtain the strain level of the soil through the free vibration analysis subsequently the strain level is used to obtain the damping factor corresponding to each layer of soil and the damping coefficient of dashpots c h c φ for the wsbf can be calculated according to eq 14 eq 18 in this paper it is then applied to the theoretical model of the owt supported by the wsbf finally the soil damping is quantified from the free vibration time history at the hub of theoretical model using the logarithmic decrement method junni et al 2021 according to the calculation results we selected the soil damping values of 0 120 for the 3 0 mw owt and 0 396 for the 3 3 mw owt subsequently the ssi method can be used to identify the total damping of the owt in the fore aft direction based on the measured vibration data of the two owts supported by the wsbf additionally the measured and calculated damping of the two different owts for different wind speeds in parked conditions is shown in fig 17 in fig 17 the scatter on the measured damping is high and the calculated damping shows an obvious increasing trend with the increase in wind speed the repeatability of damping measurements is typically poor with 10 20 variability chen and duffour 2018 which causes scatter in the damping value part of this high scatter can be explained by the high dependence of damping on the ambient parameters wind turbulence wind speed temperature etc devriendt et al 2014 moreover only 10 min of data was used for analysis and this affects the quality of the damping estimates a similar phenomenon was also found in devriendt s research in his research the damping of the first two modes of the owt presented a high scatter and high standard deviation devriendt et al 2014 to reduce the impact of damping variability the mean value of the measured damping of 2 m s wind speed intervals was used for a comparative analysis the comparison of the mean value of the total measured damping and the calculation results at different wind speeds is listed in table 12 as listed in table 12 the deviation between the calculated damping and measured mean damping can be controlled within 30 at different wind speeds in parked conditions moreover the average deviation is 11 20 while the minimum deviation reaches 0 08 as the wind speed increases the measured mean damping and calculated damping show the same increasing trend in the two different owfs in addition the total damping of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf is larger than that of the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf for the damping value a variation from approximately 0 8 1 3 for the measured mean damping occurs in 1 owf while the variation for the calculated damping is approximately 0 9 1 1 for the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf the variation in the measured mean damping is approximately 1 0 1 3 while the calculated damping is from approximately 1 2 1 3 thus in summary good agreement was shown between the calculated damping and measured damping during the parked period of these two owts supported by the wsbf the rational of the damping calculation method proposed in this research was further verified based on these results 5 comparison between wsbf and monopile as an obvious contender for the water depths considered the total damping of the owt supported by the wsbf should be compared with the result of the owt supported by the monopile hence one 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile in 1 owf was selected for monitoring to estimate its total damping in parked conditions the parameters of the selected owt on monopile are listed in table 3 in this long term field measurement a three directional displacement sensor was used to acquire the low frequency and multi directional dynamic signals the measurements were only taken at the top of the tower with a sampling frequency of 200 hz the measurement location of this owt is indicated by red circles in fig 18 while the data acquisition system is indicated by a green circle then the measured data was cut in sequences of 10 min and fed to the ssi identification algorithm further the measured damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile and wsbf under different wind speeds in parked conditions is shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 19 the measured mean damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile in a parked condition is approximately 0 887 while the value of the owt supported by the wsbf is 1 006 within the same wind speed range 4 m s 6 m s the damping value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile is smaller than that of the wsbf moreover the damping values for a parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile with a water depth of 22 9 m varied between 0 8 and 1 2 devriendt et al 2014 which was in good agreement with the suggested value from gl gl 2005 and is close to the value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf 0 8 1 3 however the water depth of 1 owf is approximately 10 m which is less than the water depth of the sea area where this monopile is located according to the analysis results in section 3 1 3 a deeper water depth leads to higher hydrodynamic damping of the owt on the monopile therefore when the monopile and wsbf are installed at the same water depth the total damping value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile may be slightly smaller than that of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf moreover damping plays a key role in fatigue loads and has a positive influence on decreasing fatigue damage accumulation during the lifetime of the owt thus the owt supported by the wsbf has better fatigue resistance than the owt supported by the monopile further based on the measured data the first modal frequency for the parked owt supported by these two different types of foundations can also be obtained by the ssi algorithm as shown in fig 20 the natural modal frequency for the owt supported by the monopile is approximately 0 30 hz while the wsbf is approximately 0 35 hz therefore the owt supported by the wsbf is considered to be more rigid than the owt supported by the monopile the structural vibration of the owt supported by the monopile may be more obvious than that of the owt supported by the wsbf owing to its smaller total damping and structural rigidity for the parked condition with a wind speed of 2 5 m s the displacement response time history at the top of the tower for the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf is shown in fig 21 the root mean square value of the monopile is 13 50 mm while that of the wsbf is 10 01 mm which is smaller than that of the monopile this can be attributed to the combined effect of the greater damping and rigidness of the parked owt supported by the wsbf 6 conclusions damping of owt is considered a critical parameter and has an important influence on the vibration response prediction and fatigue analysis although numerous studies have been performed to characterize several sources of damping in owts mainly focusing on owts supported by a monopile the published values vary widely and uncertainty still remains as a novel bucket foundation corresponding research is minimal on vibration damping of the owt on the wsbf compared with other types of foundations for owts the damping difference of the owts on the wsbf is mainly reflected in hydrodynamic damping and soil damping therefore a series of simple physics based models to quantify hydrodynamic damping and soil damping were separately proposed for the parked owt supported by the wsbf to obtain the total damping of the structure and key conclusions are obtained as follows 1 first a simple method for calculating the hydrodynamic damping of an owt under an irregular wave was proposed based on morison s equation the calculation results showed that the hydrodynamic damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf of 0 0128 is smaller than that of the owt on a monopile of 0 0193 in the same owf of china moreover the hydrodynamic damping of owts supported by the monopile and wsbf shows an increasing trend with the increase of the water depth and significant wave height except for the water depth condition of less than 12 m 2 subsequently the soil damping of the owt supported by the wsbf was estimated using a proposed theoretical method considering a 3 0 mw owt on the wsbf as the research object the calculated result of its soil damping is 0 120 3 third the total damping of a parked owt supported by the wsbf can be approximated as a linear combination of three damping sources including hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping further the structural damping ratio adopted in this research is 0 85 based on a detailed literature survey which accounts for a large proportion of the total damping in parked conditions 4 finally the calculated theoretical damping of two owts supported by the wsbf in different owfs is in good agreement with the measured damping in parked conditions and the average deviation is 11 20 which further verifies the rationality of the calculation method for the total damping proposed in this research moreover the total damping value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile is slightly smaller than that of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf in summary the damping estimation approach is proposed for the owt supported by wsbf with the steel tower and concrete transition section the influence of site conditions has been considered in the calculation method of soil damping this research provides guiding significance for the dynamic fatigue analysis and design of owts supported by the wsbf in engineering and can be used for the promotion and development of the wsbf in addition the proposed estimation approach of different damping sources can be a reference for the estimation of damping for the owts on other foundation types however there is no doubt that the size components and structures of the owt will affect the total damping especially the structural damping in parked conditions given the importance of damping further investigation of this subject is recommended credit

20485,the damping characteristic has an important influence on reliably predicting the dynamic response and fatigue life of the support structure of an offshore wind turbine owt generally the damping sources of an owt in parked conditions always include hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping ignoring aerodynamic damping however the difficulties in identifying the total damping of the owt have created uncertainty and variation in the value of damping recommended in the design in this research an estimation approach for total damping was proposed for an owt supported by a wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf which is considered a novel bucket foundation and its damping characteristics are still unclear the hydrodynamic damping calculated based on morison s equation of 0 0128 for the owt supported by wsbf is smaller than the value of the monopile foundation the soil damping is approximately 0 120 obtained using the proposed theoretical method finally the computational damping of the owt in parked conditions was verified by the measured total damping of two parked owts at two different offshore wind farms owfs of china the results show that the damping obtained by these two methods was in good agreement with the average deviation of 11 20 keywords offshore wind turbine owt wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf computational damping hydrodynamic damping soil damping field measurement 1 introduction in 2019 the 6 15 gw new installations of offshore wind turbine owt led the global offshore wind power market to grow by 41 38 compared to that in 2018 reaching a global cumulative installed capacity of 29 14 gw the united kingdom remains the world s biggest offshore wind market with 9 72 gw of total installed capacity while china is rapidly catching up with a cumulative installed capacity of 6 84 gw gwec 2020 however with the rapid development of offshore wind power in recent years the owt has become structurally more flexible to increase power generation and limit weight devriendt et al 2014 therefore structural fatigue is considered a governing factor and dynamic analysis is often mandatory for an accurate fatigue assessment in the design process of the support structures for owts salzmann and tempel 2005 moreover damping is an important influencing factor for the dynamic analysis and plays an active role in mitigating the fatigue accumulation of owts which directly affects the cost of the entire owt structure versteijlen et al 2011 because of the large size numerous components complex structure and diverse site conditions the damping mechanism of an owt is complicated in the dynamic analysis the damping ratio is a critical parameter for measuring the damping magnitude therefore increasing the accuracy of the damping ratio estimation is considered an important task to improve the reliability of the structural dynamic response analysis however when estimating the damping ratio even small discrepancies could cause large differences in the dynamic response during the operational conditions the damping sources for the owt include aerodynamic damping hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping which are affected by several different factors as shown in fig 1 a recommended practice published jointly by the american wind energy association awea and the american society of civil engineers asce suggests that seismic design spectra for parked owt structures should be based on a total damping of 1 whereas design spectra for operational owt structures should choose a total damping of 5 asce awea 2011 however the variations in published values for most damping sources remain large and these create uncertainty of the total damping in the design therefore most current designs of owts may be unsafe or overly conservative during the power production process aerodynamic damping is a dominant source of damping in the fore aft direction however it is far less significant in the fore aft direction for parked rotors or the side to side direction for design situations including wind wave misalignment shirzadeh et al 2013 tarpjohansen et al 2009 valamanesh and myers 2014 without considering the influence of aerodynamic damping this research focuses on the total damping of owts in parked conditions including hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping hydrodynamic damping is composed of radiation damping and viscous damping soil damping can be conveniently expressed by equivalent viscous damping and rayleigh damping is usually adopted for structural damping recently the actual damping calculation is an important issue in the coupled dynamic analysis of owt structures and there are several prior studies on damping estimation especially soil damping gl 2005 cook and vandiver 1982 tarpjohansen et al 2009 carswell et al 2015 which is the most uncertain contributor to the total damping of the owt an analysis of the total damping for a single pile platform was presented in 1982 cook and vandiver 1982 and in this predictive analysis the components of the total modal damping were separately computed from this cook et al suggested a value of 0 26 for hydrodynamic damping and 0 6 for soil damping johansen et al estimated the individual contributions of damping sources of cross wind motion for owts tarpjohansen et al 2009 they suggested that a value of 0 80 for soil damping should be used to account for the nonlinear behaviour of the soil while 0 22 was used for hydrodynamic damping versteijlen et al found that the effect of soil on the damping of a particular owt was large with soil damping of 1 5 versteijlen et al 2011 shirzadeh et al observed an effect of the wave direction on the hydrodynamic damping of owts shirzadeh et al 2013 moreover carswell et al investigated the significance of soil damping on monopile supported owts subjected to extreme storm loading using a linear elastic two dimensional finite element model carswell et al 2015 gres et al quantified the damping of an offshore meteorological mast supported by a mono bucket foundation based on a long term experimental campaign with a mean value of 1 11 of total damping gres et al 2016 chen et al proposed methods to quantify the contributions from different sources of damping for owts on a monopile chen and duffour 2018 damping ratio contributions of the owts supported by the jacket on suction caissons is recommended by saleh et al in his research the hydrodynamic damping was in the range of 0 07 0 23 the soil damping ranged from 0 44 to 1 and the structural damping was 0 15 1 5 saleh and subhamoy 2020 the total damping estimations from previous research for parked owts are listed in table 1 for comparison versteijlen et al 2011 devriendt et al 2013a shirzadeh et al 2013 carswell et al 2015 gres et al 2016 chen and duffour 2018 saleh and subhamoy 2020 these values reflect the range and uncertainties in damping from different sources for different types of foundations a large deviation was observed in the damping estimation in these studies as a novel foundation type the wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf has the advantages of high load capacity lian et al 2014 self floating ability le et al 2013 and low cost compared with other foundation types of owts because the seven rooms inside the foundation are divided by steel bulkheads the wsbf has reasonable motion characteristics and towing reliability during the wet tow construction process zhang 2019 additionally integrated transportation and installation techniques have been implemented in two different owfs based on this novel foundation and good economic benefits were obtained ding et al 2013 lian et al 2019 the foundation type of the owts affects the hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping however there is minimal effect on aerodynamic damping thus there are some differences between the damping of the monopod bucket and wsbf owing to their different material compositions and construction methods however few researches on the damping of the owt supported by this novel foundation were completed thus a cautious calculation method and theoretical reconstruction should be conducted to estimate the individual damping contributions in this research an estimation approach for the total damping of the parked owt supported by the wsbf including hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping has been proposed further a simplified modelling method to quantify the damping contributions from the hydrodynamic effect was introduced the measured damping of the owt was used to verify the calculation method of total damping based on two typical owts supported by the wsbf the remainder of this paper is organised into five sections section 2 briefly introduces the wsbf and its engineering example in section 3 the calculation method and model of total damping are presented with the given structural damping based on the equations and numerical method used to estimate hydrodynamic damping and soil damping respectively then two prototype observations of the owt supported by the wsbf for different owfs of china are introduced in section 4 the measured mean damping of these two parked owts under different wind speeds was used to verify the total damping model and equations proposed in section 3 good agreement between the calculated damping and measured mean damping of the owts in parked conditions was observed section 5 compares the total damping of a parked owt supported by the wsbf with the result of an owt supported by a monopile finally the key conclusions of this research are presented in section 6 2 wide shallow bucket foundation wsbf the wsbf with a special load bearing mode and better bearing capacity was first proposed by lian et al based on the conventional bucket foundation lian et al 2011 as shown in fig 2 compared with traditional suction caissons the wsbf has an excellent performance such as better bearing capacity low engineering investment and convenient transportation and installation lian et al 2011 2012 this new type of foundation can effectively convert the extremely large bending moment of the tower to the ground via a variable diameter concrete transition section zhang 2019 in addition the integrated transportation and installation techniques can be utilized for the owt supported by the wsbf based on the dedicated transportation vessel the cost is approximately 30 lower than that of existing relevant techniques ding et al 2011 this type of foundation has been applied to two different owfs in china one 1 owf is 10 km off the coast of the yellow sea with a water depth of 8 m 12 m and the other 2 owf is approximately 45 km off the coast of the yellow sea with a water depth of 8 m 15 m the basic properties of wsbfs wsbf for 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf and wsbf for 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf considered in this research are listed in table 2 the diameter of the concrete transition section of the 3 0 mw owt changes from 5 1 m to 20 m while that of the 3 3 mw owt is 6 3 m 21 m in contrast to driven piles just like tree planting the integrated transportation and installation techniques for the owt supported by the wsbf reduce the need for large scale installation equipment which is costly there are seven rooms inside the wsbf divided by steel bulkheads which are arranged in a honeycomb structure as shown in fig 2 b the wsbf is installed using a combination of self weight and applied suction during the installation process the installation of the owt only requires approximately one to two days in the sea area within a 35 m water depth ding et al 2013 moreover this novel foundation is considered an attractive alternative for owt installation because the noise disturbance of marine life and environmental influence during the installation process can also be reduced and diminished 3 damping of the owt supported by the wsbf under parked conditions the total damping of the owt consists of aerodynamic damping hydrodynamic damping structural damping and soil damping the aerodynamic damping is mainly affected by the operational state of the owt and the geometry of the blades the shape and material of different types of foundations directly affect the hydrodynamic damping and soil damping caused by its interaction with water and soil in addition different types of foundations affect the structural damping which is closely related to the structural material and type of connections in the structure thus the aerodynamic damping of the owt is minimally affected by the type of foundation while hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping are greatly affected by this factor therefore further research should be conducted on damping sources other than aerodynamic damping for this novel bucket foundation in parked conditions the pitch angle of the owt is approximately 90 thus it can be assumed that the aerodynamic damping in the fore aft direction can be neglected in addition assuming that source damping can be modelled separately and superimposed damgaard et al 2012 gl 2005 shirzadeh et al 2013 tarpjohansen et al 2009 the total measured damping in parked conditions can be approximated as the sum of the following damping sources 1 ξ t o t a l ξ s t r u c ξ s o i l ξ h y d r o where ξ t o t a l ξ s t r u c ξ s o i l and ξ h y d r o are the total damping ratio structural damping ratio soil damping ratio and hydrodynamic damping ratio of the owt respectively 3 1 hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf hydrodynamic damping which is almost unaffected by the operational state of the owt may result from the interaction between the foundation and seawater therefore a simplified calculation method for the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf under irregular waves was derived based on morison s equation 3 1 1 hydrodynamic damping the equation of motion of the owt system under the wave load can be generally expressed as follows 2 m m a x c x k x ρ v c m u 1 2 ρ c d a u x u x where m is the mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix ρ is the density of water c m and c d are the mass and drag coefficients respectively a is the projection area matrix v is the projection volume matrix x is the displacement of the motion response and u is the velocity of the water particles the hydrodynamic damping mainly affects the second term on the right side of eq 2 hydrodynamic damping usually comes from two sources wave radiation damping and viscous damping these two damping sources are implicitly considered in morison s equation for an oscillating cylinder excited by waves the wave force per unit length can be expressed as follows 3 d f d z π 4 d z 2 c m ρ u ρ 2 c d d z u x u x here f is the wave force d z is the diameter of the cylinder considering the foundation element of the owt as a one degree of freedom mass spring system eq 3 can be substituted into the equation of motion m x k x d f d z and the subsequent equation can be rewritten as follows 4 m x k x π 4 d z 2 c m ρ u ρ 2 c d d z u x u x in the process of deriving the hydrodynamic damping the hydrodynamic damping always hinders the movement of the structure and the direction of movement has no effect on the value of the hydrodynamic damping coefficient so the absolute value in eq 4 may not be used 5 m x ρ c d d z u x k x π 4 d z 2 c m ρ u ρ 2 c d d z u 2 x 2 the damping force term equals the term related to the structural velocity x the hydrodynamic damping per unit length is 6 d c a d z ρ c d d z u c a 0 η ρ c d d z u d z here c a is the hydrodynamic damping and η is the wave elevation consequently the hydrodynamic damping ratio ξ n for the nth mode can be expressed as follows 7 ξ n c a 2 m n ω n 1 2 m n ω n 0 η ρ c d d z u d z where m n is the nth modal mass of the owt and ω n is the nth natural frequency of the owt however the diameter of foundation d f varies along the vertical direction for the wsbf as shown in fig 3 therefore eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 8 ξ n 1 2 m n ω n 0 η ρ c d d f z u d z where d f z is the diameter of the concrete transition section of the wsbf which varies as a function of height z 3 1 2 calculation example of hydrodynamic damping to calculate the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by wsbf the jonswap spectrum was used to generate the time histories of irregular waves subsequently the hydrodynamic damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile and wsbf were calculated using the equations proposed in section 3 1 1 the main parameters of the monopile are listed in table 3 while the properties of the wsbf are listed in table 2 the external environmental parameters including water depth significant wave height and wave period are listed in table 4 this single combination of average values of the wave period and wave height was selected for simplicity however this is representative of the most common sea states in the yellow sea area of china gao et al 2019 in addition the schematic diagrams of the hydrodynamic damping effect of these two different types of foundations are shown in fig 4 the detailed calculation for the hydrodynamic damping was provided in appendix 1 the calculation results of the hydrodynamic damping on these two different types of foundations are shown in fig 5 the hydrodynamic damping of the wsbf and monopile both show fluctuations over time and are stable at approximately 0 0128 and 0 0193 respectively the calculation result of the hydrodynamic damping for the monopile 0 0193 in this paper is consistent with the calculation result 0 0174 of the owt supported by monopile with the same rotor diameter in the research of chen et al chen and duffour 2018 in addition the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf is less than that of the owt on the monopile 3 1 3 factors influence on hydrodynamic damping based on the calculation process in section 3 1 1 the hydrodynamic damping of the whole system is mainly affected by the water depth and significant wave height considering the average significant wave height listed in table 4 assumed for the 3 0 mw owt the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf under different water depths was analysed and the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a deeper water depth leads to a higher hydrodynamic damping of the owt on the monopile which shows a clear linear increasing trend while the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the wsbf decreases first and then increases with increasing water depth in addition when the water depth increases to 12 m the hydrodynamic damping of the owt on the wsbf reaches a minimum at approximately 0 012 the consequence of two concomitant mechanisms was used to explain this change phenomenon in the owt supported by the wsbf one is the variation in the diameter of the foundation vertically and the other is the increase in the area in contact with seawater with increasing water depth specifically the diameter of the foundation decreases with an increase in water depth leading to a decrease in hydrodynamic damping however when the water depth increases beyond a critical value there is minimal variation in the diameter of the foundation section thus as the water depth increases the increased area in contact with seawater will increase hydrodynamic damping subsequently the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf under different significant wave heights was also analysed with the results shown in fig 7 when the water depth was assumed to be 10 m from fig 7 the hydrodynamic damping of the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf shows an increasing trend with the increase in the significant wave height 3 2 soil damping of the owt supported by the wsbf the soil damping of an owt can generally be divided into radiation damping and hysteretic material damping carswell et al 2015 tarpjohansen et al 2009 the radiation damping is caused by the geometric dissipation of waves from spreading which depends on the frequencies of the external excitation however radiation damping can be negligible when the excitation frequencies are less than the natural frequency of the soil stratum gazetas and dobry 1984 the hysteretic material damping of soils is considered a result of friction between soil particles strain rate effects and nonlinearity of the stress strain relationship darendeli 2001 considering the complexity of soil behaviour soil damping is the least studied gl 2005 furthermore soil damping varies greatly owing to the differences in soil properties foundation type wind turbines etc 3 2 1 dynamic soil properties the performance of soil which is considered a natural material and exhibits nonlinear behaviour tends to change significantly in different sea areas in addition the dynamic properties of the soil can be expressed by shear modulus g and damping factor d ishibashi and zhang 1993 for all types of soils including sands and clays that do not have large volume changes under dynamic loading the relationship between the soil dynamics parameters and shearing strain amplitude is typically characterized by normalized curves as shown in fig 8 darendeli 2001 as shown in fig 8 the shear modulus g decreases with increasing strain amplitude while the damping factor d increases with the same change in strain amplitude the dynamic parameters of soil can be estimated using the following empirical equations ishibashi and zhang 1993 9 g g max k γ p i σ 0 m γ p i m 0 where 10 m γ p i m 0 0 272 1 tanh ln 0 000556 γ 0 4 e 0 0145 p i 1 3 11 k γ p i 0 5 1 tanh ln 0 000102 n p

mean effective confining pressure pi is the soil plasticity index and γ is the shearing strain amplitude the damping curve can be associated with the normalized modulus reduction curve as follows 13 d 0 333 1 e 0 0145 p i 1 3 2 0 586 g g max 2 1 547 g g max 1 moreover the material damping ratio of soil β is related to the damping factor d through the expression carswell et al 2015 14 β ω n ω d where ω n is the undamped natural frequency and ω is the given angular frequency of load 3 2 2 viscous dashpot of the wsbf the corresponding soil damping of the wsbf can be computed based on analytical or empirical equations that account for energy dissipation through soil hysteretic behaviour a viscous rotational dashpot c φ and horizontal translation dashpot c h can be introduced to represent the hysteretic damping from the foundation soil interaction a schematic of these dashpots between the soil and foundation is shown in fig 9 the dashpot coefficient c of soil can be obtained as follows gazetas and dobry 1984 15 c 2 k β ω 16 k δ e s where β represents the material damping ratio of the soil k is the secant modulus defined as the ratio of the static local soil reaction per unit length to the corresponding local deflection ω is the circular frequency of the excitation δ is the empirical coefficient δ 1 0 1 2 gazetas and dobry 1984 and e s is young s modulus then the dashpot viscous damping constant c h and c φ of the wsbf can be computed as 17 c h 0 h c ε s 1 2 z d z 18 c φ 0 l c ε s 2 2 r r d r where h is the height of the wsbf c is the dashpot coefficient l is the diameter of the wsbf ε s 1 z ε s 2 r represent the horizontal and rotational normalization static deflection profile respectively this deflection profile is mainly determined based on the characteristics of the rigid mass body which is simplified from the wsbf 3 2 3 soil damping of the wsbf one 3 0 mw owt with the parameters listed in table 5 in 1 owf of china was selected to quantify the soil damping of the owt supported by the wsbf and the considered soil profile is from a specific yellow sea offshore site for this 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf as listed in table 6 the soil types analysed in this study included silt and clay to estimate the strain level of the soil profile a coupled finite infinite element abaqus model was employed for the analysis and an infinite element boundary was implemented to absorb the radiated wave energy as shown in fig 10 in this model the soil is modelled as an elastic plastic model with a total depth of 47 9 m and obeys the mohr coulomb yield criterion kumar and chakraborty 2015 liu et al 2014 for the element types eight node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r are used for the 3d solid elements infinite elements cin3d8 are used for the infinite element boundary and four node doubly curved thin elements s4r are used for the shell elements surface to surface contact is used to simulate the interaction between the steel bucket and soil and detachment is allowed a free vibration time history analysis of the finite element model was used to obtain the strain level in the soil the free vibration analysis was performed by gradually applying the load at the top of tower and then releasing the applied load to allow it to vibrate freely an example of the finite element result which shows the distribution of the strain is shown in fig 11 and the shear strain level in the soil is approximately 10 4 near the bucket toe at this strain level the material damping ratio β of each layer of soil can be obtained according to eq 9 eq 14 moreover the value of the fundamental natural frequency of the soil stratum f s can be obtained from published solutions dobry et al 1976 with a result of 0 8446 hz thus the radiation damping of the foundation is negligible in the analysis gazetas and dobry 1984 because most excitations such as wind and wave loads have frequencies below 0 8446 hz lombardi et al 2013 petersen 2010 for the owt supported by the wsbf based on the distribution of the compression modulus and the material damping ratio of this soil profile the damping coefficient of dashpots c h c φ for the wsbf can be calculated based on eq 15 eq 18 it is then applied to the theoretical model of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf as shown in fig 12 the entire theoretical model is considered to be linear thus the effect of the initial displacement amplitude on the damping calculation result can be ignored global soil damping is quantified from the free vibration time history shown in fig 13 at the hub of this model using the logarithmic decrement method junni et al 2021 the calculated result of the soil damping was 0 120 moreover the finite element method can also be used to estimate the soil damping of this 3 0 mw owt in this method the material damping ratio of the soil was applied to the finite element model by the rayleigh damping junni et al 2021 the soil damping also can be quantified from the free vibration time history at the hub of the finite element model using the logarithmic decrement method with a value of 0 125 it shows a good agreement with the result of 0 120 estimated by the theoretical method 3 3 structural damping structural damping is an inherent property of the owt structure and also an energy dissipation that can convert vibration energy into heat through internal friction of the material the structural damping of the owts could be larger than that in onshore wind turbines because of their complex foundation and possible grouting connections the structural damping of the owts is found to be between 0 2 and 1 5 chen and duffour 2018 in recent years structural damping of the owts has received minimal attention the structural damping of the owts is assumed to follow standard steel structures for which damping values are available chen and duffour 2018 in this research the wsbf consists of a steel bucket and concrete transition piece the concrete material is damped more than that of steel therefore the structural damping of the owt supported by the wsbf is considered to be larger than that of the monopile the structural damping is usually 0 48 for the blades and 0 8 for the tower veritas 2009 therefore an average value of 0 85 for the structural damping of the owt supported by the wsbf was adopted chopra 1995 which is larger than the value of 0 60 adopted for the monopile shirzadeh et al 2013 4 verification of damping model with measured data 4 1 prototype observation the measurement campaign was performed for a 3 0 mw owt and a 3 3 mw owt supported by the wsbf in two different owfs 1 owf and 2 owf respectively to monitor the vibration of the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf four three directional accelerometers were used to acquire the low frequency and multi directional dynamic signals the measurements were taken at four levels at four locations with a sampling frequency of 300 hz moreover four three directional displacement sensors and two three directional accelerometers mounted only at the top and bottom of the tower were used to acquire multi directional dynamic signals of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf at a sampling frequency of 200 hz the measurement locations of these two owts are shown in fig 14 by red circles while the data acquisition system is indicated by a green circle the locations were chosen based on the convenience of sensor mounting such as the vicinity of the platforms devriendt et al 2013b during these two short measurement campaigns with a total duration of one month the ambient and operational data wind speed wind direction power rotor speed and pitch angle were collected at 8 s intervals based on the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system in recent years operational modal analysis oma methods have been developed to identify the modal parameters from the response of a structure to unknown random perturbations carne and james 2010 in addition the ambient vibration test is usually performed for oma with the advantage of being practical and economical the oma methods work under the assumption that the system is linear time invariant during the analysed time interval and the excitation is white noise within the frequency band of interest devriendt et al 2012 in this research one oma method called stochastic subspace identification ssi was used to estimate the modal damping ratios of these two owts in parked conditions the ssi method has been identified as the most effective damping estimation technique anela et al 2017 with a lower mean squared error in comparison to the error from the eigensystem realization algorithm and the enhanced frequency domain decomposition during this period the blades were pitched out of the wind with pitch angle values around 90 the system is time invariant and oma assumptions are fulfilled in parked conditions devriendt et al 2013b a time segment of 10 min was considered to find estimates for the damping ratios of the owt devriendt et al 2013a this time segment is sufficient to robustly identify the modal parameters of the owt moreover a time segment of 10 min allows for the assumption that the ambient conditions remain constant which is needed for the oma time invariant assumption in addition 10 min is the commonly used time interval for the meteo data and thus it easier to analyze data in the future subsequently each of the measurements was cut in sequences of 10 min and fed to the ssi algorithm moreover for the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf when the owt is in parked conditions its operational data and external wind data during the selected analysis time period is shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively as shown in fig 15 when the owt is parked the pitch angle is 87 75 the rotational speed is almost zero the yaw angle is also stable at approximately 230 and the power of the system is negative thus the structural system needs to be supplied with energy from the outside as shown in fig 16 the wind speed changes within the range of 0 m s 30 m s during the monitoring process while the wind direction angle is within the range of 50 300 both the wind speed and wind direction vary widely in the analysis 4 2 wind and wave correspondence because no wave information is available in these two observations the wave parameters may be derived by assuming a wind generated sea state the correlation between the sea state parameters and wind speed can be provided by the equations for the fully developed jonswap spectrum according to the following equations lloyd 2005 19 t p u 10 g 1 0 16 20 h s 0 0094 0 16 5 3 u 10 2 g where t p is the peak period h s is the significant wave height and u 10 is the hourly mean wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface which can be calculated according to the wind speed measured at the hub height u 0 as follows lloyd 2005 21 u 0 u 10 z 0 10 0 12 here u 0 is the wind speed at the hub height and z 0 is the hub height of the owt it is assumed that the wind and wave are aligned and in the direction of the nacelle moreover the influence of the water depth on the wave parameters should be considered lloyd 2005 therefore the correspondence between the wind and wave parameters in these two observations is listed in table 7 and table 8 respectively 4 3 comparison of the measurements and calculation results based on the equations derived in section 3 1 1 the hydrodynamic damping under different wind conditions can be solved using the wind wave correspondence in tables 7 and 8 the corresponding calculation results are listed in table 9 from table 9 the hydrodynamic damping of the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf increases from 0 002 at a low wind speed to 0 062 with the increase in wind speed while that of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf increases from 0 003 to 0 074 as the wind speed increases the soil damping of these two different owts supported by wsbf can be obtained by the method proposed in section 3 2 the required parameters of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf and its soil profile are shown in table 10 and table 11 respectively in the process of calculating soil damping it needs to establish the finite element model and theoretical model of the owt firstly and then use the established finite element model to obtain the strain level of the soil through the free vibration analysis subsequently the strain level is used to obtain the damping factor corresponding to each layer of soil and the damping coefficient of dashpots c h c φ for the wsbf can be calculated according to eq 14 eq 18 in this paper it is then applied to the theoretical model of the owt supported by the wsbf finally the soil damping is quantified from the free vibration time history at the hub of theoretical model using the logarithmic decrement method junni et al 2021 according to the calculation results we selected the soil damping values of 0 120 for the 3 0 mw owt and 0 396 for the 3 3 mw owt subsequently the ssi method can be used to identify the total damping of the owt in the fore aft direction based on the measured vibration data of the two owts supported by the wsbf additionally the measured and calculated damping of the two different owts for different wind speeds in parked conditions is shown in fig 17 in fig 17 the scatter on the measured damping is high and the calculated damping shows an obvious increasing trend with the increase in wind speed the repeatability of damping measurements is typically poor with 10 20 variability chen and duffour 2018 which causes scatter in the damping value part of this high scatter can be explained by the high dependence of damping on the ambient parameters wind turbulence wind speed temperature etc devriendt et al 2014 moreover only 10 min of data was used for analysis and this affects the quality of the damping estimates a similar phenomenon was also found in devriendt s research in his research the damping of the first two modes of the owt presented a high scatter and high standard deviation devriendt et al 2014 to reduce the impact of damping variability the mean value of the measured damping of 2 m s wind speed intervals was used for a comparative analysis the comparison of the mean value of the total measured damping and the calculation results at different wind speeds is listed in table 12 as listed in table 12 the deviation between the calculated damping and measured mean damping can be controlled within 30 at different wind speeds in parked conditions moreover the average deviation is 11 20 while the minimum deviation reaches 0 08 as the wind speed increases the measured mean damping and calculated damping show the same increasing trend in the two different owfs in addition the total damping of the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf is larger than that of the 3 0 mw owt in 1 owf for the damping value a variation from approximately 0 8 1 3 for the measured mean damping occurs in 1 owf while the variation for the calculated damping is approximately 0 9 1 1 for the 3 3 mw owt in 2 owf the variation in the measured mean damping is approximately 1 0 1 3 while the calculated damping is from approximately 1 2 1 3 thus in summary good agreement was shown between the calculated damping and measured damping during the parked period of these two owts supported by the wsbf the rational of the damping calculation method proposed in this research was further verified based on these results 5 comparison between wsbf and monopile as an obvious contender for the water depths considered the total damping of the owt supported by the wsbf should be compared with the result of the owt supported by the monopile hence one 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile in 1 owf was selected for monitoring to estimate its total damping in parked conditions the parameters of the selected owt on monopile are listed in table 3 in this long term field measurement a three directional displacement sensor was used to acquire the low frequency and multi directional dynamic signals the measurements were only taken at the top of the tower with a sampling frequency of 200 hz the measurement location of this owt is indicated by red circles in fig 18 while the data acquisition system is indicated by a green circle then the measured data was cut in sequences of 10 min and fed to the ssi identification algorithm further the measured damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile and wsbf under different wind speeds in parked conditions is shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 19 the measured mean damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile in a parked condition is approximately 0 887 while the value of the owt supported by the wsbf is 1 006 within the same wind speed range 4 m s 6 m s the damping value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile is smaller than that of the wsbf moreover the damping values for a parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile with a water depth of 22 9 m varied between 0 8 and 1 2 devriendt et al 2014 which was in good agreement with the suggested value from gl gl 2005 and is close to the value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf 0 8 1 3 however the water depth of 1 owf is approximately 10 m which is less than the water depth of the sea area where this monopile is located according to the analysis results in section 3 1 3 a deeper water depth leads to higher hydrodynamic damping of the owt on the monopile therefore when the monopile and wsbf are installed at the same water depth the total damping value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile may be slightly smaller than that of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf moreover damping plays a key role in fatigue loads and has a positive influence on decreasing fatigue damage accumulation during the lifetime of the owt thus the owt supported by the wsbf has better fatigue resistance than the owt supported by the monopile further based on the measured data the first modal frequency for the parked owt supported by these two different types of foundations can also be obtained by the ssi algorithm as shown in fig 20 the natural modal frequency for the owt supported by the monopile is approximately 0 30 hz while the wsbf is approximately 0 35 hz therefore the owt supported by the wsbf is considered to be more rigid than the owt supported by the monopile the structural vibration of the owt supported by the monopile may be more obvious than that of the owt supported by the wsbf owing to its smaller total damping and structural rigidity for the parked condition with a wind speed of 2 5 m s the displacement response time history at the top of the tower for the owt supported by the monopile and wsbf is shown in fig 21 the root mean square value of the monopile is 13 50 mm while that of the wsbf is 10 01 mm which is smaller than that of the monopile this can be attributed to the combined effect of the greater damping and rigidness of the parked owt supported by the wsbf 6 conclusions damping of owt is considered a critical parameter and has an important influence on the vibration response prediction and fatigue analysis although numerous studies have been performed to characterize several sources of damping in owts mainly focusing on owts supported by a monopile the published values vary widely and uncertainty still remains as a novel bucket foundation corresponding research is minimal on vibration damping of the owt on the wsbf compared with other types of foundations for owts the damping difference of the owts on the wsbf is mainly reflected in hydrodynamic damping and soil damping therefore a series of simple physics based models to quantify hydrodynamic damping and soil damping were separately proposed for the parked owt supported by the wsbf to obtain the total damping of the structure and key conclusions are obtained as follows 1 first a simple method for calculating the hydrodynamic damping of an owt under an irregular wave was proposed based on morison s equation the calculation results showed that the hydrodynamic damping of the 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf of 0 0128 is smaller than that of the owt on a monopile of 0 0193 in the same owf of china moreover the hydrodynamic damping of owts supported by the monopile and wsbf shows an increasing trend with the increase of the water depth and significant wave height except for the water depth condition of less than 12 m 2 subsequently the soil damping of the owt supported by the wsbf was estimated using a proposed theoretical method considering a 3 0 mw owt on the wsbf as the research object the calculated result of its soil damping is 0 120 3 third the total damping of a parked owt supported by the wsbf can be approximated as a linear combination of three damping sources including hydrodynamic damping soil damping and structural damping further the structural damping ratio adopted in this research is 0 85 based on a detailed literature survey which accounts for a large proportion of the total damping in parked conditions 4 finally the calculated theoretical damping of two owts supported by the wsbf in different owfs is in good agreement with the measured damping in parked conditions and the average deviation is 11 20 which further verifies the rationality of the calculation method for the total damping proposed in this research moreover the total damping value of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the monopile is slightly smaller than that of the parked 3 0 mw owt supported by the wsbf in summary the damping estimation approach is proposed for the owt supported by wsbf with the steel tower and concrete transition section the influence of site conditions has been considered in the calculation method of soil damping this research provides guiding significance for the dynamic fatigue analysis and design of owts supported by the wsbf in engineering and can be used for the promotion and development of the wsbf in addition the proposed estimation approach of different damping sources can be a reference for the estimation of damping for the owts on other foundation types however there is no doubt that the size components and structures of the owt will affect the total damping especially the structural damping in parked conditions given the importance of damping further investigation of this subject is recommended credit

20486,ice class propellers often bear substantial loads during their life cycle and their strength must therefore be analysed and evaluated during the design phase in this study a blade strength evaluation method was established and the influences of various propeller parameters on the strength were analysed considering the unified polar class rules uri3 specifications further a primary optimisation method was proposed based on the strength assessment approximation model both the hydrodynamic load and ice load were considered in the strength assessment process and in house code was developed based on the panel and finite element methods fem to combine the fluid and structural calculation models the entire analysis process was performed for an r class propeller and considering the strength assessment and analysis results the reverse rotating scenario denoted as case 5 was deemed the most dangerous working condition for the r class propeller it was found that the thickness rotation speed chord and mutual interactions significantly impact the blade strength keywords ice class propeller blade strength sensitivity analysis r class propeller uri3 1 introduction the arctic area is one of the most extreme environments on earth sufficient natural resources such as mining and hydrocarbons beneath the ice sheets in this area have the potential to provide utilities or economic benefits to humanity in addition the unique geographical position of this area makes it possible to shorten the required transportation routes of such materials which can dramatically reduce the associated costs and emissions melia et al 2016 smith and stephenson 2013 as a result ice going ships which are the primary transport used by various countries exploiting the polar area have attracted significant research attention from scholars when a ship navigates ice covered waters interactions such as milling and the impact between the propeller and ice blocks will inevitably occur under such conditions the propeller can experience a much higher load than it does in ice free working environments which may cause damage to the propeller structure primarily along the edges and affect the proper functioning of the propulsion systems ye et al 2017 in addition designers tend to utilise a large design margin to ensure that the paddles possess sufficient strength during propeller ice contact however this may increase the weight and manufacturing costs as well as worsen the hydrodynamic performance of the resulting propeller young 2008 therefore it is necessary to evaluate and analyse the strength of polar class propellers few previous publications have considered the strength of ice class propellers compared to those analysing the strength of conventional propellers this may be because several fundamental problems related to propeller ice interactions have not yet been solved for instance the real loads experienced by propellers are unknown so most researchers tend to evaluate propeller strength using either their experience or rules specified by classification societies or other international organisations carlton 2018 according to these previously published papers many scholars have attempted to establish an ice propeller interaction model to predict the performances of propellers under the influence of sea ice the first model of propeller action in ice used to simulate blade loads due to milling action was presented by jagodkin 1963 and this model has acted as a basis for the development of many subsequent analysis models over the last several decades numerous researchers such as wind 1984 soininen 1998 and liu 2000 and other relevant specialists have presented many simplified models and utilised functions based on scientific data obtained from model tests to determine ice induced forces concomitant with advancements in computational technologies numerical methods have been applied to analyse the performances of ice class propellers since the 1900s in terms of the hydrodynamic and cavitation characteristics additional loads induced by the ice proximity effect have been investigated by bose 1996 and walker 1996 using panel method codes while the cavitation performance under ice blockage conditions was later investigated by walker et al 1997 further lobachev et al 2017 presented a blade modification method for increasing the hydrodynamic and cavitation characteristics of an ice class propeller with the computational fluid dynamic software star ccm veitch et al 1997 established contact models to predict ice collision and milling forces liu 2003 developed and validated the in house code propella with which propeller ice interactions can be thoroughly considered all these studies investigated the influences of ice on the propeller performance and provided a basis for engineering designs codes and standards for regulatory bodies consequently the original regulations that stipulated the desired thickness of a blade required to ensure the integrity of ice class propellers as indicated by classification societies have been gradually improved based on these investigations in 2007 the international association of classification societies iacs presented a set of unified requirements and rules uri3 for polar class ships including explicit rules for ice class propellers lee 2008 2007 applied uri3 using the cantilever beam and finite element methods and found that the strength assessment results obtained based on the former method were too conservative liu et al 2015 developed a procedure to evaluate design and optimise the strength and integrity of polar class propellers using the panel method and finite element method according to uri3 ye et al 2019 established a strength assessment method for ice class propellers and calculated the stresses of the blades using uri3 in addition the commercial software ansys workbench has also been widely used in the strength evaluation of ice class propellers chang et al 2018 sun 2016 in this current study the strength of an ice class propeller was evaluated and analysed the hydrodynamic performance calculation module was implemented in the code which was used as a tool to evaluate the hydrodynamic loads the novelty of this study resides in the quantitative analysis of the influence of propeller parameters on blade strength the results were used to guide the optimisation of the propeller strength the remainder of this paper is organised as follows first the panel and finite element methods are introduced in sections 2 1 and 2 2 the iacs uri3 rules concerning ice class propellers are briefly presented in section 2 3 and the procedure used to assess and analyse the strength is illustrated in section 2 4 next the calculation model and loading scenarios are provided in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the mesh convergence and verification of the strength assessment method are demonstrated in section 3 3 and the results are discussed in section 3 4 subsequently a parameter sensitivity analysis is performed in section 3 5 the approximation models and a primary strength optimisation method are presented in sections 3 6 and 3 7 concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 analysis method and implementation of uri3 2 1 panel method code in the framework of potential theory a scalar function can be used to simulate a solid body in the flow field panel methods which are a type of potential methods establish integral functions over the entire body surface and these methods do not require the excessive simplification of the geometry of the item to be examined panel methods can provide accurate pressure distributions and have been widely used in the research and development of lift bodies such as aircraft wings hydrofoils and aerial and marine propellers in this study a low order panel method based on velocity potential was adopted the method employs source dipole mixed distribution and hyperboloid panel in the method interpolation functions are mainly applied to mesh panels with the assumption of an inviscid irrotational and incompressible fluid the problem of the flow around a propeller can be converted into an intensity of mathematical singularities that may be solved based on green s third identity 1 2 π φ p s b φ q n q 1 r p q d s s w δ φ q 1 n q 1 1 r p q 1 d s s b φ q n q 1 r p q d s here φ is the perturbation potential that satisfies laplace s equation r p q and r p q 1 are the distances from the field point p to points q located on the blade surface and q 1 located on the trailing vertical wake surface respectively n is the unit vector normal to the boundary surface δ φ is the potential jump between the upper and lower sides of the trailing vertical wake s b and s w represent the fully wetted and trailing vertical wake surface areas respectively the set of required boundary conditions for the solution of eq 1 include the kinematic boundary condition on the blade surface that defines the sources strength 2 φ q n q v 0 n q and the kutta condition at the trailing edge of the blade to limit the pressure jump 3 δ p t e p t e p t e 0 considering these boundary conditions discretising eq 1 can provide a linear system of algebraic equations 4 j 1 n δ i j c i j φ j l 1 n w w i l δ φ l j 1 n b i j v 0 n j i 1 2 n here n and n w are the numbers of panels on the blades and wake surfaces respectively c ij b ij and w ij are different influencing coefficients that can be calculated by the morino approach the solution of eq 4 provides the dipole intensity experienced over each panel and its value is equal to the perturbation potential subsequently the total velocity and local pressure coefficients on the propeller blades can be calculated using numerical differentiation and bernoulli s theorem finally the hydrodynamic performance in terms of propeller thrust and torque can be obtained by integrating the pressure over the surface of the blades fig 1 shows the detailed implementation method of the panel code to integrate the fluid and structural models the same surface mesh pattern should be adopted in the analysis process each node and panel have a unique number during calculation as shown in fig 2 and the hydrodynamic pressure on every single panel is stored in the code 2 2 finite element method code to overcome the shortcomings of the cantilever beam approach such as the limited calculation region and lower accuracy for high skew propellers the finite element method was utilised to evaluate the propeller strength the choice of the solid element type is crucial in the finite element method because it could present a massive difference to the simulation accuracy in this study hexahedron solid elements were used in the structural analysis for considering the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation moreover considering the maximum thickness to radius ratio of the r class propeller is larger than 0 1 transverse shear deformation cannot be overlooked therefore shell element is not an ideal choice to mesh the solid blades at present work hughes 1987 manual 2020 in a blade fixed coordinate system the global equation of the dynamic motion for propeller blades can be written as follows 5 m u c u k u f ce f co f r where m c and k are the global mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively u u and u are the acceleration velocity and displacement respectively and f ce f co and f r are the centrifugal coriolis and external forces respectively the strength assessment method for ice class propellers in uri3 is a static analytical method and the values of u u and f co are all equal to zero eq 5 can then be simplified to 6 k u f ce f r a linearised system of equations can be obtained from the discretisation of eq 6 using a series of hexahedron elements a numerical solution of the blade strength can be obtained using the solution to the linearised system of equations the global stiffness matrix k and global nodal force f f ce f r are integrated and superposed by all the element stiffness matrices and equivalent element nodal forces respectively the stress of the propeller blade can be approximately represented by the stresses of all nodes in the elements all loads including the centrifugal and external forces should be shifted to the nodes equivalently the centrifugal force induced by the rotation of the propellers can be considered as a volume force and its equivalent nodal force can be expressed as follows 7 f ce e v ρ n t ω ω x dxdydz where n is the functional shape matrix ω is the angular rotational speed of the propeller and x is the vector of the nodes the shape function matrix is composed of 8 shape functions which can be calculated as 8 n k ξ η ζ 1 8 1 ξ k ξ 1 η k η 1 ζ k ζ k 1 2 3 8 where n is shape function k is the number of the element node and ξ η and ζ are the coordinates of the local coordinate system with the origin at the element centroid as shown in fig 3 each solid structural element is numbered only the first and last level solid elements have hydrodynamic loads whereas the partial superficial elements suffer ice loads both the design ice and hydrodynamic loads can be treated as surface forces affecting the propeller blades after shifting the equivalent nodal force can be represented by 9 f r e a n t p e da where p e is the pressure and its components can be estimated by uri3 the set of required boundary conditions for eq 6 is that the nodes on the blade root are specified using the rigid constraint the displacement and stress of the nodes can then be calculated and the equivalent stress von mises stress can be obtained by transforming the calculated nodal stress using eq 10 10 σ σ x σ y 2 σ x σ y 2 σ x σ y 2 6 τ x y 2 τ y z 2 τ z x 2 2 2 3 implementation of uri3 the iacs uri3 rules which came into effect in march 2008 have explicit requirements for all polar class ships according to the capacity of icebreaking ice going ships are divided into seven polar classes in which class 1 requires the most robust structure and class 7 possesses the lowest strength a description of each class is provided by these rules iacs 2011 uri3 specifies the ice load for both open and ducted type propellers with a fixed or controllable pitch the present work will consider the r class propeller as an example for evaluating and analysing the strengths of ice class propellers and the specifications for an open fixed pitch propeller are described below the maximum blade backward force on the blade back f b experienced during the propeller lifetime in newtons is as follows 11 f b 27000 s i c e n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 d 2 i f d 0 85 h i c e 1 4 f b 23000 s i c e n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 h i c e 1 4 d i f d 0 85 h

radius and c is the chord length the five loading cases consider both the back and blade faces normal and reverse rotating cases are also considered for all loading cases the ice forces calculated using eqs 11 and 12 should be converted into pressure values such that eq 9 can be used directly uri3 specifies that the minimum safety factor s f for blade strength must be greater than 1 5 as specified by the following 13 s f σ r e f σ 1 5 where σ is the calculated equivalent stress σ r e f is the reference stress that is equal to min 0 7 σ u 0 6 σ 0 4 σ 0 2 and σ u and σ 0 2 are the ultimate tensile strength and the proof stress at a 0 2 strain of the blade material respectively 2 4 strength evaluation and analysis procedure the present work involves both hydrodynamic loads and ice loads and the ice loads remain constant however the hydrodynamic loads may change with the blade displacement according to the results from the literature sampson et al 2009 the degree of ice loads is higher than that of the hydrodynamic loads moreover considering that the displacement of the propeller blade is small the magnitude of the blade displacement due to the ice loads is 10 3 times the blade diameter ye et al 2019 the influence of blade deformation on the hydrodynamic performance can be neglected based on the careful consideration of the calculation resources and precision the unidirectional coupling method is applied to the strength assessment process in this study information is transferred from the fluid model to the structural model the same blade surface meshing method in the hydrodynamic and structure analyses was used to ensure the accuracy of the transferred information the detailed strength evaluation and analysis procedures are shown in fig 4 3 strength assessment and analysis 3 1 calculation model and relative parameters to verify the strength assessment method used in this study the same r class propeller that was used by liu et al 2015 was adopted the r class propeller employed for the canadian coast guard ship ccgs icebreakers has been used as an example by several researchers to investigate propeller ice interactions as such a large amount of testing data for this type of propeller is available the details of the propeller and ccgs icebreaker are given in table 2 the blade material has a significant influence on the strength of the propeller nickel aluminium bronze nab is considered in this study and its exact material properties are listed in table 3 σ r e f was considered to be 457 mpa liu et al 2015 3 2 loading scenarios to avoid the reduction of the ice load during the programming process different advanced coefficients were adopted under different ice loading conditions according to the relationship between the directions of the hydrodynamic and ice loads for ice loading cases 1 and 2 on the blade back the direction of the hydrodynamic load is opposite to that of the ice load and therefore the hydrodynamic pressure was set to zero for ice loading cases 3 and 4 on the blade face the hydrodynamic load and ice load are in the same direction therefore the bollard pull condition j 0 in which the total load is maximum was chosen for the backward ice loading condition in case 5 similar to cases 1 and 2 the hydrodynamic pressure was set to zero in the program for all five loading cases the corresponding values of j and kt are provided in table 4 3 3 mesh convergence analysis and method verification to verify the feasibility of the proposed method the maximum stress of the blade under the conditions of case 4 including both the hydrodynamic and ice loads with different meshing values is analysed and the safety factor under the five load case scenarios are compared with the results obtained by liu et al 2015 in the numerical calculation process meshing is crucial for both fluid analysis and structural assessment because it affects the numerical results using a high quality mesh not only improves the calculation accuracy but also promotes computational efficiency ye et al 2019 investigated the mesh convergence of the propeller strength obtained under various ice loads and found that the mesh number of 24 24 6 is acceptable to ensure calculation accuracy and efficiency considering that the code used in the present work was supplemented with a hydrodynamic model based on the original model and that the propeller model is similar between these models a similar meshing pattern is selected to analyse the mesh convergence the solid body of the propeller meshes into elements along the radial chordwise and thickness directions considering the meshing manner the half cosine dividing method is adopted in the radial direction to encrypt the blade tip area in the chordwise and thickness directions the cosine dividing method is chosen such that the blade edge and blade surface area are denser than the blade central area considering the mesh number six sets of meshes are tested and compared 16 16 4 20 20 5 22 22 5 22 22 6 24 24 6 and 27 27 6 according to the calculation procedure presented in section 2 4 the displacement and stress obtained under the load in case 4 with different mesh numbers are analysed as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively hereafter unless specified otherwise the unit of displacement and stress are m and mpa respectively the displacement distribution characteristics with different mesh numbers as shown in fig 5 are essentially uniform and the maximum displacement gradually increases from the blade root to the tip fig 5 e and 5 f show similar displacement distribution indicating that the range of the selected mesh number is feasible fig 6 shows that the stress distribution varies with the mesh number when the mesh number is small the stress distribution is non uniform the boundary of the stress concentration area indicated in red is not smooth and the developmental trend of this area is clear as the mesh number is increased the stress distribution becomes more uniform and exhibits a converging trend the indicated boundary also becomes smooth under the last two meshing pattern conditions fig 6 e and f the stress distribution is similar the value and area of the maximum stresses obtained under these conditions are similar therefore a mesh number of 24 24 6 is adequate for use in the strength assessment process to further analyse the effects of the mesh number on the numerical results the relationship between the maximum displacement around blade tip and the mesh number is shown in fig 7 a in addition fig 7 b shows a similar relationship between the maximum stress around point a and the mesh number it should be noted that the total mesh number along the horizontal axis is the product of the mesh dimensions from fig 7 it is clear that the tendency of the maximum stress is consistent with that of maximum displacement both the maximum displacement and maximum stress generally demonstrate an increasing trend as the mesh number is increased while a fluctuation occurs in both cases when the mesh number is equal to 2000 20 20 5 when the mesh number is 3456 24 24 6 the growth rates of the maximum displacement and maximum stress are much lower than that observed between the previous mesh numbers although the mesh number is increased by 48 between this mesh number and the following mesh number the displacement and stress only increased by 3 and 2 respectively therefore the calculation results can be considered to converge under a mesh number of 24 24 6 see fig 7 the fluctuation observed in fig 7 can be explained simply it can be seen from fig 4 that both the hydrodynamic and structural calculations influence the final results first the effects of the mesh number on the fluid model are considered the hydrodynamic performance in the programming implementation process is calculated and the total thrust coefficients are 0 3142 and 0 3146 for the 20 20 5 and 22 22 5 meshes respectively under these two meshes the pressure coefficients of the panels on which the stress is maximum point a are 0 08541 and 0 09472 while the pressure coefficients of around 75 of the panels are on the order of 10 1 therefore the hydrodynamic loads on the blade surface are similar in the two aforementioned cases and the fluid results can be considered to have converged in addition the ice loads calculated using eqs 11 and 12 are identical under these two meshing conditions therefore the surface loads in which f r is the sum of the hydrodynamic and ice loads obtained from eq 6 are equivalent it is considered that the rotational speed remains constant under the meshes of 20 20 5 and 22 22 5 such that the volume force of f ce does not change finally it can be speculated that the observed fluctuation may be induced by the global stiffness matrix k overall the trend towards convergence is evident as the mesh number is increased and the meshing pattern of 24 24 6 can therefore be used in the strength assessment process next the code execution and calculation of the safety factors under the five different loading conditions were considered a comparison of the safety factors between these cases is shown in fig 8 the solid black line represents results from liu et al 2015 the red line indicates results from the present work and the dotted line indicates the minimum safety factor required by iacs overall the safety factors calculated by the two methods meet the requirements and the trends are similar as well that is both calculated safety factors first increase and then decrease with the scenario change from case 1 to case 5 considering the impact of numerical precision and model differences the average error of the first four loading conditions is 7 06 and it can be concluded that the calculation method proposed in this study is effective however the results of reverse rotating in case 5 are quite different leading to a difference in the determination of a dangerous scenario liu et al 2015 consider that forward case 1 is the most dangerous condition because the minimum safety factor is obtained under this condition compared to the other four cases in this study case 5 is considered to be the worst condition because its safety factor is 1 71 which is smaller than those of the other conditions the determination of a dangerous scenario is vital for engineering design to investigate case 5 further the commercial structural analysis software ansys workbench was utilised to re evaluate the blade strength under scenario 5 adaptive meshing was used to divide the concrete structure and the total number of meshes was 33072 the details of the modelling meshing and loading area division can be found in the literature chang et al 2018 figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the grid division and stress calculation results it can be seen from fig 10 that the maximum stress calculated by ansys is approximately 280 mpa the calculated safety factor using eq 13 is 1 63 which is close to that obtained in this study the error is approximately 4 therefore the proposed strength assessment method is feasible a small difference in the modelling conditions could cause a deviation of the safety factors obtained under case 5 conditions which may occur if the thickness or camber distribution is varied the errors of the blade back loading scenarios 1 and 2 are smaller than those of the blade face loading scenarios 3 4 and 5 indicating the direction of ice load could cause a difference in the results further the camber distribution influences the shape of the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil moreover the error in case 3 is smaller than that in case 5 and the main difference between these two cases is that case 3 is loaded on the leading edge area while case 5 is loaded on the treading area the leading edge area is thicker than the treading edge area therefore the subtle difference in thickness or camber distribution near the treading edge area may have resulted in the deviation under case 5 overall it was demonstrated that the in house code can effectively evaluate the strength of the examined ice class propeller 3 4 analysis of the strength assessment results to analyse further the strength results and provide guidance for the engineering design of these propellers the stress distributions of the polar class propeller under the five loading scenarios are shown in fig 11 considering the area and location of the stress concentration the five cases can be roughly divided into three categories the maximum stresses experienced in cases 1 3 and 4 occurred in the middle section of the airfoil near the boss some nodes in this area are fixed in such cases so that the deformation is relatively more extensive than experienced in other areas the displacement is small which can lead to a concentration of stress for case 2 the maximum stress is present in the central section around 0 7r in this case the chord direction distribution of the ice load is relatively uniform and acts on the blade tip where the boundary constraints do not exist and therefore the stress may become concentrated in this area due to the cantilever beam effect in case 5 the stress around the trading edge around 0 5r is the largest except for case 5 the maximum stress experienced in the other four scenarios appeared on the blade back considering the stress distribution trend the five cases may also be roughly divided into three categories that is cases 1 and 3 cases 2 and 4 and case 5 the stress distribution of the blade back in cases 1 and 3 presents an elliptical shape from the hub to the leading edge the blade surfaces in these two cases are similar in that the minimum stress appears around the trading edge the stress distribution of the blade back in cases 2 and 4 also shows an elliptical shape but it extends from the hub to the tip and stress troughs are formed on both edges a saddle shaped stress distribution is shown on the blade face in these two cases the stress distribution in case 5 is quite different on the blade back the stress can be divided into two regions along the chord midline and the quantity of stress in the rightmost region is larger than that in the leftmost region on the blade face the stress is concentrated on the trading edge the overall stress gradient of the blade in case 5 is larger than that in the other cases different loading areas result in different stress distribution trends cases 1 and 3 are loaded on the leading edge cases 2 and 4 are loaded on the blade tip and case 5 is loaded on the trailing edge considering the maximum stress values as described in the previous section the value of the maximum stress in case 5 is approximately 260 mpa which is the largest among the five cases the stress present in working condition 4 is the smallest which is approximately 120 mpa therefore if the ships in which these propellers are to be used must perform reverse manoeuvres special attention should be paid to whether the blade strength meets the requirements for such procedures 3 5 sensitivity analysis in this study a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine whether the uncertainty in the blade strength can be divided and allocated to different sources of uncertainty in terms of the geometry parameters and working conditions of the blade there are many approaches that may be used to perform sensitivity analyses however multivariate quadratic regression methods are used in this study because of their exploration ability nonlinear response characteristics and consideration for interaction effects chiang 2003 the primary analysis procedures adhere to the following three steps santner et al 2003 step 1 quantify the variation range for each input and perform sampling step 2 perform a strength assessment for each sample step 3 analyse the sensitivity based on the results of step 2 to conduct step 1 and ensure the geometric smoothness of the parametric propeller models the parameters of the original prototype propeller are set as the baseline and scaled to obtain different samples the variation range and selected parameters influence the sensitivity analysis results however there is no explicit standard for setting the boundary of the variation range and many engineers define this range according to their experience carlton 2018 this study focuses on the analysis process therefore the obtained results are not of considerable importance because propeller designs are variable the results obtained via this analysis were not valuable for most optimisation tasks except for the particular ships ccgs and propellers r class propeller considered in this study the rotation speed rs pitch thickness skew chord and rake are selected as design variables and the variation ranges for these parameters are provided in table 5 in total 400 sets of testing samples are considered via the sobol sequence sampling method sobol 2001 the multivariate quadratic regression analysis method was used to analyse the sensitivity of the above samples and the corresponding target value are shown in fig 12 as six parameters are selected there are 28 influencing factors in the multivariate quadratic regression analysis process 1 c 6 1 c 6 2 c 6 1 wherein one constant is included and c indicates combination some factors have little influence on the strength as shown in yellow in fig 12 the red regions indicate that these factors positively influence the blade strength while the blue regions indicate a negative influence therefore increasing the red and decreasing the blue regions can strengthen the propeller it can be seen from fig 12 that different parameters have different sensitivities toward the blade strength under the different cases in general the thickness rotation speed chord and mutual interaction have an apparent influence on the blade strength in cases 1 and 5 the thickness is the most influential factor 54 38 and 33 93 respectively while the rotation speed was dominant in cases 3 and 4 43 1 and 60 03 respectively for case 2 the blade strength had the most significant sensitivity toward the chord 40 13 considering that the normal rotating condition is considered as the design basis for most propellers case 1 is considered as an example of this condition apart from the aforementioned influence factors pitch and skew also influence the blade strength and their contributions are 1 65 and 1 76 respectively other factors such as the rake and its interaction with other parameters have a total contribution of 7 39 more attention should be paid to case 3 because the chord has an unusual effect on the propeller strength in this case generally increasing the thickness and chord length is an effective way to decrease the maximum stress of the blade and this is proven to be true in other cases as shown in fig 12 however in case 3 increasing the chord can increase the maximum stress in the design space 3 6 approximation model in the sensitivity analysis process 400 samples were considered and assessed and the results may be used to establish approximation models approximation models do not depend on detailed physics processes they instead provide a surrogate method that can be used to solve complex problems quickly artificial neural networks kriging predictors response surface methodologies and polynomial models are popular approximation models and they are widely used in propeller performance prediction and optimisation approaches vesting and bensow 2014 in this study two models were established and compared in the propeller strength assessment the coefficients of the multivariate quadratic regression represent the contribution to the blade strength of the corresponding factors presented in the former section and a simple approximation model can be obtained based on these coefficients the scale factors of chord pitch rake skew thickness and rotation speed are set as x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 and x 6 respectively and the maximum blade stress under the five cases are set as y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 and y 5 respectively as shown in eq 14 the elements a x y in the matrix are the coefficients of the multivariate quadratic regression detailed data are provided in table 6 according to eq 14 the maximum stress experienced under the five scenarios can be evaluated quickly 14 a 1 1 a 1 28 a 5 1 a 5 28 1 x 1 x 6 x 1 2 x 6 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 6 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 5 x 6 y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 artificial neural networks can achieve high precision hornik et al 1989 proved that a multilayer feedforward neural network can approximate continuous arbitrary complexity functions with arbitrary precision requiring an intermediate layer containing sufficient neurons in this study an elliptical basis function ebf feedforward neural network was adopted to simulate the stress calculation procedure on the isight platform van der velden and koch 2010 the selected six parameters are set as input variables and the maximum stress is considered as the output target as shown in fig 13 ω and υ are linking weights x b and y are the input vector hidden layer vector and output vector respectively to verify the feasibility of the approximation models 15 samples were randomly selected to perform a cross validation error analysis and the r squared values r 2 i 1 s y i y 2 i 1 s y i y 2 wherein y i is the actual response of the samples y is the average value of y i y i is the response of the approximation model at point i and s is the number of test samples are provided in table 7 in practice the acceptance level of the r squared value is 0 9 moore and kirkland 2007 it can be seen from table 6 that both the quadratic polynomial model and neural network provide satisfying approximations and they can predict the maximum stress correctly within the design space 3 7 strength optimisation the primary strength optimisation is presented in this section the dangerous backward and forward scenarios as presented by cases 5 and 1 are considered as examples according to fig 12 e the thickness and chord have an apparent influence on the maximum stress under case 5 while the other parameters have less influence therefore based on the established approximation model herein the quadratic polynomial model is used the relationship between the maximum stress under case 5 and the thickness and chord scale factors is shown in fig 14 smith and stephenson 2013 for strength optimisation it is assumed that the r class propeller only needs to have a safety factor of 1 5 and that the maximum stress is 316 6 mpa the contour line at 316 6 mpa is shown in fig 14 designers can adjust the blade thickness and chord according to this contour line based on other design considerations for example assuming that the strength optimisation process requires the utilisation of the lowest amount of blade material possible the optimisation process can be described as follows a simplified linear function may be obtained via fig 14 15 x 1 1 0535 x 5 1 9518 where x 1 and x 5 represent the chord and thickness scale factors respectively the optimisation target is to minimise the following mass 16 m ρ e a r t ave x 1 x 5 where m is the blade mass ρ is the density of the blade and t ave is the average thickness of the blade the design boundary is provided in table 5 eqs 15 and 16 may then be easily solved to obtain x 1 0 9 and x 5 0 998 for case 1 fig 12 a shows that the weight of thickness accounts for over 50 that is the thickness dominates the blade strength moreover assuming that the other parameters including the second important parameter rotation speed remain constant the strength can be optimised only by adjusting the thickness in this ideal condition a similar relationship between the maximum stress under case 1 and the thickness scale factor can be acquired from the approximation model this relationship is presented in fig 15 assuming that the optimisation under case 1 has identical stress restrictions and target with those under case 5 a trend line equation can be obtained according to fig 15 17 y 1 521 04 x 5 2 1456 x 5 1137 7 where y 1 is the maximum stress under case 1 and x 5 represents the thickness scale factor although the thickness boundary does not cover the target stress value 316 6 mpa in fig 15 the corresponding thickness can be easily calculated based on eq 17 and x 5 0 79 considering that this result is out of the boundary of sensitivity analysis the strength of this optimised r class propeller was re evaluated based on the referred finite element method the maximum stress is 316 mpa which proves the feasibility of this optimisation method in addition the optimisation result with the thickness scale factor is 0 79 under case 1 is in good agreement with the value of 0 8 obtained in the study by liu under the same case liu et al 2015 therefore based on these two examples different strategies can be applied to optimise the propeller strength according to the sensitivity analysis results this process will improve the efficiency of the optimisation 4 conclusions in this study a panel method and a finite element method were developed to assess and analyse the strength of polar class propellers blade ice loading was presented based on iacs uri3 a mesh independence analysis and verification of the method were conducted to verify the feasibility of the method the blade stress obtained under five different loading cases was evaluated and a sensitivity analysis was performed the major conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the model propeller could meet the strength demands as specified by the unified polar class rules uri3 case 5 represented the most dangerous working condition and the safety factor in this case is slightly larger than the minimum requirement case 1 also represented a dangerous working condition 2 the maximum stress in case 5 appeared around the trading edge at the inner radius of the blade face while in the other cases the maximum stress appeared around the middle chord of the blade back the stress was concentrated on the outer radius in case 2 and in the root in cases 1 3 and 4 3 the thickness rotation speed chord and mutual interaction have an apparent influence on the blade strength in cases 1 and 5 the thickness is the most influential factor 54 38 and 33 93 respectively while the rotation speed was dominant in cases 3 and 4 43 1 and 60 03 respectively for case 2 the blade strength had the most significant sensitivity toward the chord 40 13 4 the established polynomial models and artificial neural networks provide good approximation precision and the statistical measurement provided via the r squared values for both models in the five cases are above the acceptance level based on these approximation models the proposed primary optimisation method can be used to optimise the blade strength effectively this study only considered the static strength as defined via uri3 therefore further research concerning the dynamic blade strength must be conducted in addition the formula presented for strength optimisation is only appropriate for the propeller type considered in this study and further numerical results and test data are needed to modify and improve this formula the numerical model established in this study neglects the influence of propeller deformation on its hydrodynamic performance a more accurate propeller strength assessment model should therefore be established in a future study that considers the influence of

20486,ice class propellers often bear substantial loads during their life cycle and their strength must therefore be analysed and evaluated during the design phase in this study a blade strength evaluation method was established and the influences of various propeller parameters on the strength were analysed considering the unified polar class rules uri3 specifications further a primary optimisation method was proposed based on the strength assessment approximation model both the hydrodynamic load and ice load were considered in the strength assessment process and in house code was developed based on the panel and finite element methods fem to combine the fluid and structural calculation models the entire analysis process was performed for an r class propeller and considering the strength assessment and analysis results the reverse rotating scenario denoted as case 5 was deemed the most dangerous working condition for the r class propeller it was found that the thickness rotation speed chord and mutual interactions significantly impact the blade strength keywords ice class propeller blade strength sensitivity analysis r class propeller uri3 1 introduction the arctic area is one of the most extreme environments on earth sufficient natural resources such as mining and hydrocarbons beneath the ice sheets in this area have the potential to provide utilities or economic benefits to humanity in addition the unique geographical position of this area makes it possible to shorten the required transportation routes of such materials which can dramatically reduce the associated costs and emissions melia et al 2016 smith and stephenson 2013 as a result ice going ships which are the primary transport used by various countries exploiting the polar area have attracted significant research attention from scholars when a ship navigates ice covered waters interactions such as milling and the impact between the propeller and ice blocks will inevitably occur under such conditions the propeller can experience a much higher load than it does in ice free working environments which may cause damage to the propeller structure primarily along the edges and affect the proper functioning of the propulsion systems ye et al 2017 in addition designers tend to utilise a large design margin to ensure that the paddles possess sufficient strength during propeller ice contact however this may increase the weight and manufacturing costs as well as worsen the hydrodynamic performance of the resulting propeller young 2008 therefore it is necessary to evaluate and analyse the strength of polar class propellers few previous publications have considered the strength of ice class propellers compared to those analysing the strength of conventional propellers this may be because several fundamental problems related to propeller ice interactions have not yet been solved for instance the real loads experienced by propellers are unknown so most researchers tend to evaluate propeller strength using either their experience or rules specified by classification societies or other international organisations carlton 2018 according to these previously published papers many scholars have attempted to establish an ice propeller interaction model to predict the performances of propellers under the influence of sea ice the first model of propeller action in ice used to simulate blade loads due to milling action was presented by jagodkin 1963 and this model has acted as a basis for the development of many subsequent analysis models over the last several decades numerous researchers such as wind 1984 soininen 1998 and liu 2000 and other relevant specialists have presented many simplified models and utilised functions based on scientific data obtained from model tests to determine ice induced forces concomitant with advancements in computational technologies numerical methods have been applied to analyse the performances of ice class propellers since the 1900s in terms of the hydrodynamic and cavitation characteristics additional loads induced by the ice proximity effect have been investigated by bose 1996 and walker 1996 using panel method codes while the cavitation performance under ice blockage conditions was later investigated by walker et al 1997 further lobachev et al 2017 presented a blade modification method for increasing the hydrodynamic and cavitation characteristics of an ice class propeller with the computational fluid dynamic software star ccm veitch et al 1997 established contact models to predict ice collision and milling forces liu 2003 developed and validated the in house code propella with which propeller ice interactions can be thoroughly considered all these studies investigated the influences of ice on the propeller performance and provided a basis for engineering designs codes and standards for regulatory bodies consequently the original regulations that stipulated the desired thickness of a blade required to ensure the integrity of ice class propellers as indicated by classification societies have been gradually improved based on these investigations in 2007 the international association of classification societies iacs presented a set of unified requirements and rules uri3 for polar class ships including explicit rules for ice class propellers lee 2008 2007 applied uri3 using the cantilever beam and finite element methods and found that the strength assessment results obtained based on the former method were too conservative liu et al 2015 developed a procedure to evaluate design and optimise the strength and integrity of polar class propellers using the panel method and finite element method according to uri3 ye et al 2019 established a strength assessment method for ice class propellers and calculated the stresses of the blades using uri3 in addition the commercial software ansys workbench has also been widely used in the strength evaluation of ice class propellers chang et al 2018 sun 2016 in this current study the strength of an ice class propeller was evaluated and analysed the hydrodynamic performance calculation module was implemented in the code which was used as a tool to evaluate the hydrodynamic loads the novelty of this study resides in the quantitative analysis of the influence of propeller parameters on blade strength the results were used to guide the optimisation of the propeller strength the remainder of this paper is organised as follows first the panel and finite element methods are introduced in sections 2 1 and 2 2 the iacs uri3 rules concerning ice class propellers are briefly presented in section 2 3 and the procedure used to assess and analyse the strength is illustrated in section 2 4 next the calculation model and loading scenarios are provided in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the mesh convergence and verification of the strength assessment method are demonstrated in section 3 3 and the results are discussed in section 3 4 subsequently a parameter sensitivity analysis is performed in section 3 5 the approximation models and a primary strength optimisation method are presented in sections 3 6 and 3 7 concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 analysis method and implementation of uri3 2 1 panel method code in the framework of potential theory a scalar function can be used to simulate a solid body in the flow field panel methods which are a type of potential methods establish integral functions over the entire body surface and these methods do not require the excessive simplification of the geometry of the item to be examined panel methods can provide accurate pressure distributions and have been widely used in the research and development of lift bodies such as aircraft wings hydrofoils and aerial and marine propellers in this study a low order panel method based on velocity potential was adopted the method employs source dipole mixed distribution and hyperboloid panel in the method interpolation functions are mainly applied to mesh panels with the assumption of an inviscid irrotational and incompressible fluid the problem of the flow around a propeller can be converted into an intensity of mathematical singularities that may be solved based on green s third identity 1 2 π φ p s b φ q n q 1 r p q d s s w δ φ q 1 n q 1 1 r p q 1 d s s b φ q

located on the trailing vertical wake surface respectively n is the unit vector normal to the boundary surface δ φ is the potential jump between the upper and lower sides of the trailing vertical wake s b and s w represent the fully wetted and trailing vertical wake surface areas respectively the set of required boundary conditions for the solution of eq 1 include the kinematic boundary condition on the blade surface that defines the sources strength 2 φ q n q v 0 n q and the kutta condition at the trailing edge of the blade to limit the pressure jump 3 δ p t e p t e p t e 0 considering these

panels on the blades and wake surfaces respectively c ij b ij and w ij are different influencing coefficients that can be calculated by the morino approach the solution of eq 4 provides the dipole intensity experienced over each panel and its value is equal to the perturbation potential subsequently the total velocity and local pressure coefficients on the propeller blades can be calculated using numerical differentiation and bernoulli s theorem finally the hydrodynamic performance in terms of propeller thrust and torque can be obtained by integrating the pressure over the surface of the blades fig 1 shows the detailed implementation method of the panel code to integrate the fluid and structural models the same surface mesh pattern should be adopted in the analysis process each node and panel have a unique number during calculation as shown in fig 2 and the hydrodynamic pressure on every single panel is stored in the code 2 2 finite element method code to overcome the shortcomings of the cantilever beam approach such as the limited calculation region and lower accuracy for high skew propellers the finite element method was utilised to evaluate the propeller strength the choice of the solid element type is crucial in the finite element method because it could present a massive difference to the simulation accuracy in this study hexahedron solid elements were used in the structural analysis for considering the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation moreover considering the maximum thickness to radius ratio of the r class propeller is larger than 0 1 transverse shear deformation cannot be overlooked therefore shell element is not an ideal choice to mesh the solid blades at present work hughes 1987 manual 2020 in a blade fixed coordinate system the global equation of the dynamic motion for propeller blades can be written as follows 5 m u c u k u f ce f co f r where m c and k are the global mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively u u and u are the acceleration velocity and displacement respectively and f ce f co and f r are the centrifugal coriolis and external forces respectively the strength assessment method for ice class propellers in uri3 is a static analytical method and the values of u u and f co are all equal to zero eq 5 can then be simplified to 6 k u f ce f r a linearised system of equations can be obtained from the discretisation of eq 6 using a series of hexahedron elements a numerical solution of the blade strength can be obtained using the solution to the linearised system of equations the global stiffness matrix k and global nodal force f f ce f r are integrated and superposed by all the element stiffness matrices and equivalent element nodal forces respectively the stress of the propeller blade can be approximately represented by the stresses of all nodes in the elements all loads including the centrifugal and external forces should be shifted to the nodes equivalently the centrifugal force induced by the rotation of the propellers can be considered as a volume force and its equivalent nodal force can be expressed as follows 7 f ce e v ρ n t ω ω x dxdydz where n is the functional shape matrix ω is the angular rotational speed of the propeller and x is the vector of the nodes the shape function matrix is composed of 8 shape functions which can be calculated as 8 n k ξ η ζ 1 8 1 ξ k ξ 1 η k η 1 ζ k ζ k 1 2 3 8 where n is shape function k is the number of the element node and ξ η and ζ are the coordinates of the local coordinate system with the origin at the element centroid as shown in fig 3 each solid structural element is numbered only the first and last level solid elements have hydrodynamic loads whereas the partial superficial elements suffer ice loads both the design ice and hydrodynamic loads can be treated as surface forces affecting the propeller blades after shifting the equivalent nodal force can be represented by 9 f r e a n t p e da where p e is the pressure and its components can be estimated by uri3 the set of required boundary conditions for eq 6 is that the nodes on the blade root are specified using the rigid constraint the displacement and stress of the nodes can then be calculated and the equivalent stress von mises stress can be obtained by transforming the calculated nodal stress using eq 10 10 σ σ x σ y 2 σ x σ y 2 σ x σ y 2 6 τ x y 2 τ y z 2 τ z x 2 2 2 3 implementation of uri3 the iacs uri3 rules which came into effect in march 2008 have explicit requirements for all polar class ships according to the capacity of icebreaking ice going ships are divided into seven polar classes in which class 1 requires the most robust structure and class 7 possesses the lowest strength a description of each class is provided by these rules iacs 2011 uri3 specifies the ice load for both open and ducted type propellers with a fixed or controllable pitch the present work will consider the r class propeller as an example for evaluating and analysing the strengths of ice class propellers and the specifications for an open fixed pitch propeller are described below the maximum blade backward force on the blade back f b experienced during the propeller lifetime in newtons is as follows 11 f b 27000 s i c e n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 d 2 i f d 0 85 h i c e 1 4 f b 23000 s i c e n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 h i c e 1 4 d i f d 0 85 h i c e 1 4 where d ear and z are the propeller diameter m expanded area ratio and number of blades respectively s i c e and h i c e are the ice strength index and the design ice thickness m respectively these two parameters for the different polar classes are given in table 1 n is the shaft speed rps for fixed pitch propellers fpp n 85 of the nominal rotational speed at the maximum continuous rate mcr under free running conditions the maximum blade forward force on the blade back f f during the propeller lifetime in newton is as follows 12 f f 250000 e a r z d 2 i f d 2 h i c e 1 d d f f 500000 1 1 d d h i c e e a r z d i f d 2 h i c e 1 d d where d is the propeller hub diameter m uri3 divides the ice loading into five scenarios as shown in table 1 wherein r is the propeller radius and c is the chord length the five loading cases consider both the back and blade faces normal and reverse rotating cases are also considered for all loading cases the ice forces calculated using eqs 11 and 12 should be converted into pressure values such that eq 9 can be used directly uri3 specifies that the minimum safety factor s f for blade strength must be greater than 1 5 as specified by the following 13 s f σ r e f σ 1 5 where σ is the calculated equivalent stress σ r e f is the reference stress that is equal to min 0 7 σ u 0 6 σ 0 4 σ 0 2 and σ u and σ 0 2 are the ultimate tensile strength and the proof stress at a 0 2 strain of the blade material respectively 2 4 strength evaluation and analysis procedure the present work involves both hydrodynamic loads and ice loads and the ice loads remain constant however the hydrodynamic loads may change with the blade displacement according to the results from the literature sampson et al 2009 the degree of ice loads is higher than that of the hydrodynamic loads moreover considering that the displacement of the propeller blade is small the magnitude of the blade displacement due to the ice loads is 10 3 times the blade diameter ye et al 2019 the influence of blade deformation on the hydrodynamic performance can be neglected based on the careful consideration of the calculation resources and precision the unidirectional coupling method is applied to the strength assessment process in this study information is transferred from the fluid model to the structural model the same blade surface meshing method in the hydrodynamic and structure analyses was used to ensure the accuracy of the transferred information the detailed strength evaluation and analysis procedures are shown in fig 4 3 strength assessment and analysis 3 1 calculation model and relative parameters to verify the strength assessment method used in this study the same r class propeller that was used by liu et al 2015 was adopted the r class propeller employed for the canadian coast guard ship ccgs icebreakers has been used as an example by several researchers to investigate propeller ice interactions as such a large amount of testing data for this type of propeller is available the details of the propeller and ccgs icebreaker are given in table 2 the blade material has a significant influence on the strength of the propeller nickel aluminium bronze nab is considered in this study and its exact material properties are listed in table 3 σ r e f was considered to be 457 mpa liu et al 2015 3 2 loading scenarios to avoid the reduction of the ice load during the programming process different advanced coefficients were adopted under different ice loading conditions according to the relationship between the directions of the hydrodynamic and ice loads for ice loading cases 1 and 2 on the blade back the direction of the hydrodynamic load is opposite to that of the ice load and therefore the hydrodynamic pressure was set to zero for ice loading cases 3 and 4 on the blade face the hydrodynamic load and ice load are in the same direction therefore the bollard pull condition j 0 in which the total load is maximum was chosen for the backward ice loading condition in case 5 similar to cases 1 and 2 the hydrodynamic pressure was set to zero in the program for all five loading cases the corresponding values of j and kt are provided in table 4 3 3 mesh convergence analysis and method verification to verify the feasibility of the proposed method the maximum stress of the blade under the conditions of case 4 including both the hydrodynamic and ice loads with different meshing values is analysed and the safety factor under the five load case scenarios are compared with the results obtained by liu et al 2015 in the numerical calculation process meshing is crucial for both fluid analysis and structural assessment because it affects the numerical results using a high quality mesh not only improves the calculation accuracy but also promotes computational efficiency ye et al 2019 investigated the mesh convergence of the propeller strength obtained under various ice loads and found that the mesh number of 24 24 6 is acceptable to ensure calculation accuracy and efficiency considering that the code used in the present work was supplemented with a hydrodynamic model based on the original model and that the propeller model is similar between these models a similar meshing pattern is selected to analyse the mesh convergence the solid body of the propeller meshes into elements along the radial chordwise and thickness directions considering the meshing manner the half cosine dividing method is adopted in the radial direction to encrypt the blade tip area in the chordwise and thickness directions the cosine dividing method is chosen such that the blade edge and blade surface area are denser than the blade central area considering the mesh number six sets of meshes are tested and compared 16 16 4 20 20 5 22 22 5 22 22 6 24 24 6 and 27 27 6 according to the calculation procedure presented in section 2 4 the displacement and stress obtained under the load in case 4 with different mesh numbers are analysed as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively hereafter unless specified otherwise the unit of displacement and stress are m and mpa respectively the displacement distribution characteristics with different mesh numbers as shown in fig 5 are essentially uniform and the maximum displacement gradually increases from the blade root to the tip fig 5 e and 5 f show similar displacement distribution indicating that the range of the selected mesh number is feasible fig 6 shows that the stress distribution varies with the mesh number when the mesh number is small the stress distribution is non uniform the boundary of the stress concentration area indicated in red is not smooth and the developmental trend of this area is clear as the mesh number is increased the stress distribution becomes more uniform and exhibits a converging trend the indicated boundary also becomes smooth under the last two meshing pattern conditions fig 6 e and f the stress distribution is similar the value and area of the maximum stresses obtained under these conditions are similar therefore a mesh number of 24 24 6 is adequate for use in the strength assessment process to further analyse the effects of the mesh number on the numerical results the relationship between the maximum displacement around blade tip and the mesh number is shown in fig 7 a in addition fig 7 b shows a similar relationship between the maximum stress around point a and the mesh number it should be noted that the total mesh number along the horizontal axis is the product of the mesh dimensions from fig 7 it is clear that the tendency of the maximum stress is consistent with that of maximum displacement both the maximum displacement and maximum stress generally demonstrate an increasing trend as the mesh number is increased while a fluctuation occurs in both cases when the mesh number is equal to 2000 20 20 5 when the mesh number is 3456 24 24 6 the growth rates of the maximum displacement and maximum stress are much lower than that observed between the previous mesh numbers although the mesh number is increased by 48 between this mesh number and the following mesh number the displacement and stress only increased by 3 and 2 respectively therefore the calculation results can be considered to converge under a mesh number of 24 24 6 see fig 7 the fluctuation observed in fig 7 can be explained simply it can be seen from fig 4 that both the hydrodynamic and structural calculations influence the final results first the effects of the mesh number on the fluid model are considered the hydrodynamic performance in the programming implementation process is calculated and the total thrust coefficients are 0 3142 and 0 3146 for the 20 20 5 and 22 22 5 meshes respectively under these two meshes the pressure coefficients of the panels on which the stress is maximum point a are 0 08541 and 0 09472 while the pressure coefficients of around 75 of the panels are on the order of 10 1 therefore the hydrodynamic loads on the blade surface are similar in the two aforementioned cases and the fluid results can be considered to have converged in addition the ice loads calculated using eqs 11 and 12 are identical under these two meshing conditions therefore the surface loads in which f r is the sum of the hydrodynamic and ice loads obtained from eq 6 are equivalent it is considered that the rotational speed remains constant under the meshes of 20 20 5 and 22 22 5 such that the volume force of f ce does not change finally it can be speculated that the observed fluctuation may be induced by the global stiffness matrix k overall the trend towards convergence is evident as the mesh number is increased and the meshing pattern of 24 24 6 can therefore be used in the strength assessment process next the code execution and calculation of the safety factors under the five different loading conditions were considered a comparison of the safety factors between these cases is shown in fig 8 the solid black line represents results from liu et al 2015 the red line indicates results from the present work and the dotted line indicates the minimum safety factor required by iacs overall the safety factors calculated by the two methods meet the requirements and the trends are similar as well that is both calculated safety factors first increase and then decrease with the scenario change from case 1 to case 5 considering the impact of numerical precision and model differences the average error of the first four loading conditions is 7 06 and it can be concluded that the calculation method proposed in this study is effective however the results of reverse rotating in case 5 are quite different leading to a difference in the determination of a dangerous scenario liu et al 2015 consider that forward case 1 is the most dangerous condition because the minimum safety factor is obtained under this condition compared to the other four cases in this study case 5 is considered to be the worst condition because its safety factor is 1 71 which is smaller than those of the other conditions the determination of a dangerous scenario is vital for engineering design to investigate case 5 further the commercial structural analysis software ansys workbench was utilised to re evaluate the blade strength under scenario 5 adaptive meshing was used to divide the concrete structure and the total number of meshes was 33072 the details of the modelling meshing and loading area division can be found in the literature chang et al 2018 figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the grid division and stress calculation results it can be seen from fig 10 that the maximum stress calculated by ansys is approximately 280 mpa the calculated safety factor using eq 13 is 1 63 which is close to that obtained in this study the error is approximately 4 therefore the proposed strength assessment method is feasible a small difference in the modelling conditions could cause a deviation of the safety factors obtained under case 5 conditions which may occur if the thickness or camber distribution is varied the errors of the blade back loading scenarios 1 and 2 are smaller than those of the blade face loading scenarios 3 4 and 5 indicating the direction of ice load could cause a difference in the results further the camber distribution influences the shape of the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil moreover the error in case 3 is smaller than that in case 5 and the main difference between these two cases is that case 3 is loaded on the leading edge area while case 5 is loaded on the treading area the leading edge area is thicker than the treading edge area therefore the subtle difference in thickness or camber distribution near the treading edge area may have resulted in the deviation under case 5 overall it was demonstrated that the in house code can effectively evaluate the strength of the examined ice class propeller 3 4 analysis of the strength assessment results to analyse further the strength results and provide guidance for the engineering design of these propellers the stress distributions of the polar class propeller under the five loading scenarios are shown in fig 11 considering the area and location of the stress concentration the five cases can be roughly divided into three categories the maximum stresses experienced in cases 1 3 and 4 occurred in the middle section of the airfoil near the boss some nodes in this area are fixed in such cases so that the deformation is relatively more extensive than experienced in other areas the displacement is small which can lead to a concentration of stress for case 2 the maximum stress is present in the central section around 0 7r in this case the chord direction distribution of the ice load is relatively uniform and acts on the blade tip where the boundary constraints do not exist and therefore the stress may become concentrated in this area due to the cantilever beam effect in case 5 the stress around the trading edge around 0 5r is the largest except for case 5 the maximum stress experienced in the other four scenarios appeared on the blade back considering the stress distribution trend the five cases may also be roughly divided into three categories that is cases 1 and 3 cases 2 and 4 and case 5 the stress distribution of the blade back in cases 1 and 3 presents an elliptical shape from the hub to the leading edge the blade surfaces in these two cases are similar in that the minimum stress appears around the trading edge the stress distribution of the blade back in cases 2 and 4 also shows an elliptical shape but it extends from the hub to the tip and stress troughs are formed on both edges a saddle shaped stress distribution is shown on the blade face in these two cases the stress distribution in case 5 is quite different on the blade back the stress can be divided into two regions along the chord midline and the quantity of stress in the rightmost region is larger than that in the leftmost region on the blade face the stress is concentrated on the trading edge the overall stress gradient of the blade in case 5 is larger than that in the other cases different loading areas result in different stress distribution trends cases 1 and 3 are loaded on the leading edge cases 2 and 4 are loaded on the blade tip and case 5 is loaded on the trailing edge considering the maximum stress values as described in the previous section the value of the maximum stress in case 5 is approximately 260 mpa which is the largest among the five cases the stress present in working condition 4 is the smallest which is approximately 120 mpa therefore if the ships in which these propellers are to be used must perform reverse manoeuvres special attention should be paid to whether the blade strength meets the requirements for such procedures 3 5 sensitivity analysis in this study a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine whether the uncertainty in the blade strength can be divided and allocated to different sources of uncertainty in terms of the geometry parameters and working conditions of the blade there are many approaches that may be used to perform sensitivity analyses however multivariate quadratic regression methods are used in this study because of their exploration ability nonlinear response characteristics and consideration for interaction effects chiang 2003 the primary analysis procedures adhere to the following three steps santner et al 2003 step 1 quantify the variation range for each input and perform sampling step 2 perform a strength assessment for each sample step 3 analyse the sensitivity based on the results of step 2 to conduct step 1 and ensure the geometric smoothness of the parametric propeller models the parameters of the original prototype propeller are set as the baseline and scaled to obtain different samples the variation range and selected parameters influence the sensitivity analysis results however there is no explicit standard for setting the boundary of the variation range and many engineers define this range according to their experience carlton 2018 this study focuses on the analysis process therefore the obtained results are not of considerable importance because propeller designs are variable the results obtained via this analysis were not valuable for most optimisation tasks except for the particular ships ccgs and propellers r class propeller considered in this study the rotation speed rs pitch thickness skew chord and rake are selected as design variables and the variation ranges for these parameters are provided in table 5 in total 400 sets of testing samples are considered via the sobol sequence sampling method sobol 2001 the multivariate quadratic regression analysis method was used to analyse the sensitivity of the above samples and the corresponding target value are shown in fig 12 as six parameters are selected there are 28 influencing factors in the multivariate quadratic regression analysis process 1 c 6 1 c 6 2 c 6 1 wherein one constant is included and c indicates combination some factors have little influence on the strength as shown in yellow in fig 12 the red regions indicate that these factors positively influence the blade strength while the blue regions indicate a negative influence therefore increasing the red and decreasing the blue regions can strengthen the propeller it can be seen from fig 12 that different parameters have different sensitivities toward the blade strength under the different cases in general the thickness rotation speed chord and mutual interaction have an apparent influence on the blade strength in cases 1 and 5 the thickness is the most influential factor 54 38 and 33 93 respectively while the rotation speed was dominant in cases 3 and 4 43 1 and 60 03 respectively for case 2 the blade strength had the most significant sensitivity toward the chord 40 13 considering that the normal rotating condition is considered as the design basis for most propellers case 1 is considered as an example of this condition apart from the aforementioned influence factors pitch and skew also influence the blade strength and their contributions are 1 65 and 1 76 respectively other factors such as the rake and its interaction with other parameters have a total contribution of 7 39 more attention should be paid to case 3 because the chord has an unusual effect on the propeller strength in this case generally increasing the thickness and chord length is an effective way to decrease the maximum stress of the blade and this is proven to be true in other cases as shown in fig 12 however in case 3 increasing the chord can increase the maximum stress in the design space 3 6 approximation model in the sensitivity analysis process 400 samples were considered and assessed and the results may be used to establish approximation models approximation models do not depend on detailed physics processes they instead provide a surrogate method that can be used to solve complex problems quickly artificial neural networks kriging predictors response surface methodologies and polynomial models are popular approximation models and they are widely used in propeller performance prediction and optimisation approaches vesting and bensow 2014 in this study two models were established and compared in the propeller strength assessment the coefficients of the multivariate quadratic regression represent the contribution to the blade strength of the corresponding factors presented in the former section and a simple approximation model can be obtained based on these coefficients the scale factors of chord pitch rake skew thickness and rotation speed are set as x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 and x 6 respectively and the maximum blade stress under the five cases are set as y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 and y 5 respectively as shown in eq 14 the elements a x y in the matrix are the coefficients of the multivariate quadratic regression detailed data are provided in table 6 according to eq 14 the maximum stress experienced under the five scenarios can be evaluated quickly 14 a 1 1 a 1 28 a 5 1 a 5 28 1 x 1 x 6 x 1 2 x 6 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 6 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 5 x 6 y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 artificial neural networks can achieve high precision hornik et al 1989 proved that a multilayer feedforward neural network can approximate continuous arbitrary complexity functions with arbitrary precision requiring an intermediate layer containing sufficient neurons in this study an elliptical basis function ebf feedforward neural network was adopted to simulate the stress calculation procedure on the isight platform van der velden and koch 2010 the selected six parameters are set as input variables and the maximum stress is considered as the output target as shown in fig 13 ω and υ are linking weights x b and y are the input vector hidden layer vector and output vector respectively to verify the feasibility of the approximation models 15 samples were randomly selected to perform a cross validation error analysis and the r squared values r 2 i 1 s y i y 2 i 1 s y i y 2 wherein y i is the actual response of the samples y is the average value of y i y i is the response of the approximation model at point i and s is the number of test samples are provided in table 7 in practice the acceptance level of the r squared value is 0 9 moore and kirkland 2007 it can be seen from table 6 that both the quadratic polynomial model and neural network provide satisfying approximations and they can predict the maximum stress correctly within the design space 3 7 strength optimisation the primary strength optimisation is presented in this section the dangerous backward and forward scenarios as presented by cases 5 and 1 are considered as examples according to fig 12 e the thickness and chord have an apparent influence on the maximum stress under case 5 while the other parameters have less influence therefore based on the established approximation model herein the quadratic polynomial model is used the relationship between the maximum stress under case 5 and the thickness and chord scale factors is shown in fig 14 smith and stephenson 2013 for strength optimisation it is assumed that the r class propeller only needs to have a safety factor of 1 5 and that the maximum stress is 316 6 mpa the contour line at 316 6 mpa is shown in fig 14 designers can adjust the blade thickness and chord according to this contour line based on other design considerations for example assuming that the strength optimisation process requires the utilisation of the lowest amount of blade material possible the optimisation process can be described as follows a simplified linear function may be obtained via fig 14 15 x 1 1 0535 x 5 1 9518 where x 1 and x 5 represent the chord and thickness scale factors respectively the optimisation target is to minimise the following mass 16 m ρ e a r t ave x 1 x 5 where m is the blade mass ρ is the density of the blade and t ave is the average thickness of the blade the design boundary is provided in table 5 eqs 15 and 16 may then be easily solved to obtain x 1 0 9 and x 5 0 998 for case 1 fig 12 a shows that the weight of thickness accounts for over 50 that is the thickness dominates the blade strength moreover assuming that the other parameters including the second important parameter rotation speed remain constant the strength can be optimised only by adjusting the thickness in this ideal condition a similar relationship between the maximum stress under case 1 and the thickness scale factor can be acquired from the approximation model this relationship is presented in fig 15 assuming that the optimisation under case 1 has identical stress restrictions and target with those under case 5 a trend line equation can be obtained according to fig 15 17 y 1 521 04 x 5 2 1456 x 5 1137 7 where y 1 is the maximum stress under case 1 and x 5 represents the thickness scale factor although the thickness boundary does not cover the target stress value 316 6 mpa in fig 15 the corresponding thickness can be easily calculated based on eq 17 and x 5 0 79 considering that this result is out of the boundary of sensitivity analysis the strength of this optimised r class propeller was re evaluated based on the referred finite element method the maximum stress is 316 mpa which proves the feasibility of this optimisation method in addition the optimisation result with the thickness scale factor is 0 79 under case 1 is in good agreement with the value of 0 8 obtained in the study by liu under the same case liu et al 2015 therefore based on these two examples different strategies can be applied to optimise the propeller strength according to the sensitivity analysis results this process will improve the efficiency of the optimisation 4 conclusions in this study a panel method and a finite element method were developed to assess and analyse the strength of polar class propellers blade ice loading was presented based on iacs uri3 a mesh independence analysis and verification of the method were conducted to verify the feasibility of the method the blade stress obtained under five different loading cases was evaluated and a sensitivity analysis was performed the major conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the model propeller could meet the strength demands as specified by the unified polar class rules uri3 case 5 represented the most dangerous working condition and the safety factor in this case is slightly larger than the minimum requirement case 1 also represented a dangerous working condition 2 the maximum stress in case 5 appeared around the trading edge at the inner radius of the blade face while in the other cases the maximum stress appeared around the middle chord of the blade back the stress was concentrated on the outer radius in case 2 and in the root in cases 1 3 and 4 3 the thickness rotation speed chord and mutual interaction have an apparent influence on the blade strength in cases 1 and 5 the thickness is the most influential factor 54 38 and 33 93 respectively while the rotation speed was dominant in cases 3 and 4 43 1 and 60 03 respectively for case 2 the blade strength had the most significant sensitivity toward the chord 40 13 4 the established polynomial models and artificial neural networks provide good approximation precision and the statistical measurement provided via the r squared values for both models in the five cases are above the acceptance level based on these approximation models the proposed primary optimisation method can be used to optimise the blade strength effectively this study only considered the static strength as defined via uri3 therefore further research concerning the dynamic blade strength must be conducted in addition the formula presented for strength optimisation is only appropriate for the propeller type considered in this study and further numerical results and test data are needed to modify and improve this formula the numerical model established in this study neglects the influence of propeller deformation on its hydrodynamic performance a more accurate propeller strength assessment model should therefore be established in a future study that considers the influence of blade deformation credit authorship contribution statement chunyu guo conceptualization methodology kang han writing original draft chao wang conceptualization writing review editing liyu ye

20487,this paper addresses the safety of marine operations related to a seafastening system for large object transport the aim is to present a structural reliability approach to accommodate the uncertainties affecting design checks the probability of structural failure by use of design standards for assessing marine operations is studied using structural reliability analyses to shed light on the implicit reliability levels of such standards a structural reliability model that includes the effect of uncertainty in weather forecasts is established the reliability analyses show that the method to account for forecast uncertainty as defined in the standards compensates well for that uncertainty and the failure probabilities in the case studies are between 1 0 4 and 1 0 3 per operation a reliability model that includes the long term statistical distribution of the environmental conditions is also established this model is applicable for operations with a duration longer than three days and is used to study seasonal variations and the failure probability as a function of the duration of operations the failure probability is calculated for execution in several months showing the dependency on the time of the year and the duration of the operations the failure probabilities are on the order of 1 0 4 per operation keywords marine operation sea transport structural reliability analysis structural capacity 1 introduction in this paper we study marine operations related to the sea transport of large and heavy objects the consequences of failure can be severe but an excessively conservative approach will increase costs therefore an optimized safety level should be targeted the uncertainties inherent in marine operations must thus be quantified in a reliability context to provide a rational basis for decision making we will present a method to estimate the failure probability of seafastening and apply the method in studies related to sea transport on a towed barge the study addresses both weather restricted and weather unrestricted transports two different methods are used in this paper to calculate wave induced barge motions one approach is used for structural design when planning the transport and another approach is applied in structural reliability analyses the two different methods used are the design check of the required capacity of the support points is based on the barge motions given in a design standard the structural reliability analyses are based on barge motions as calculated by a 3d panel model the design check could have been based on motions calculated by the panel model instead of the standard method the standard method was chosen to investigate the failure probability by the use of a simplified method for calculating barge motions as given by a design standard for weather restricted operations normally operations with a duration of less than three days the significant wave heights are based on weather forecasts and the uncertainty in the weather forecasts of the significant wave height should be accounted for the approach applied in this study is based on natskår et al 2015 where the uncertainty in the forecasts is included as described in section 2 7 several other researchers have studied the uncertainty in predicted significant wave height for example de girolamo et al 2017 they studied the reliability of weather forecasts by analyzing the probability of correctly predicting a given threshold value of significant wave height they studied the probability of missed alarms i e where the predicted significant wave height is below the threshold and the actual significant wave height is above the threshold using different quantiles in the probability distribution of the forecast error gintautas and sørensen 2016 developed a reliability based method to estimate the number of weather windows and their length within a given time period they concluded that the improved predictability of their approach increased the total length of the weather windows by 11 within the test period while we study marine operations through sea transportation several other studies focused on the installation phase guachamin acero et al 2016 studied marine operations with regard to the assessment of the operational limits and the operability of marine operations related to the installation of an offshore wind turbine by a floating crane they proposed a methodology where the operational limits were established in terms of maximum allowable sea states by taking into account the duration of subactivities other aspects of installation have also been studied for example by guachamin acero et al 2015 who analyzed the crane installation of offshore wind turbines by calculating the motion in a sophisticated manner including both the 1st and 2nd order responses of the crane barge and the lifted object sea transport and installation have in common that planning e g accounting for the uncertainty in the predicted wave heights and calculating the vessel response is vital for the control of the reliability level inherent in the operations research has also been performed on the hull girder capacity in ship transport e g by shu and moan 2011 who studied the interaction between the local load from the sea pressure and the hull girder bending of a bulk carrier they found that the correlation between the wave induced global and local loads had a negligible influence on the probability of failure and that it was reasonable to not consider the correlation between global and local wave loads in the structural reliability analysis in this paper we focus on the support structure rather than the bending of the hull girder of the transport vessel for weather unrestricted operations operations with durations of more than three days the significant wave heights are based on long term distributions which in this study are estimated from hindcast data for the northern north sea the failure probability for a weather unrestricted operation based on the long term statistical data of the significant wave height is calculated assuming that the transport starts in several months throughout the year the reliability target level is based on existing structures because the target level should be consistent with the implied reliability level in current accepted design practice this study aims to provide an indication of this reliability level the target reliability level could depend on e g the consequences of failure but that factor is not considered here this paper deals with the reliability of the seafastening system as affected by normal uncertainties due to the fundamental variability uncertainty and lack of data human errors and omissions as well as organizational factors in the planning of the operation and design of the equipment and fabrication as well as during the execution of the marine operation might also cause failure it is assumed herein that such errors are eliminated by suitable verification and control during the design fabrication and operation an organized risk management effort is normally used to manage the design process and there should be continuous control and verification of the fabrication proper training of the personnel to be involved during the execution of the operation is also vital in this paper human errors are not considered and the focus is on handling normal uncertainties in the framework of the structural reliability analysis in this paper the planning and execution of marine operations are assumed to be performed according to the design standard marine operations and marine warranty dnvgl st n001 2020 1 1 dnvgl st n001 is not freely available however the requirements in that standard referred to in

structure to be transported e g from its fabrication site to its final destination there are several temporary phases e g loading of the transport vessel sea transport and discharge herein we focus on the sea transport phase the aim of the paper is to develop a reliability model for the structural capacity of cargo supports furthermore we perform structural reliability analyses of the support structure and compare the implicit reliability level for various design conditions e g for several forecasted significant wave heights as a function of the duration of the operation assuming that the operation occurs in various seasons of the year 2 3 typical transport configurations large and heavy objects can be transported on ships and barges a transport barge loaded with a large object is shown in fig 1 the transported object is typically placed on preinstalled grillage beams e g 2 5 m high depending on the weight of the transported object among other factors the grillage beam configuration is shown in fig 2 the grillage beams transfer the vertical load from the transported object into the barge structure through the grillage beam end plates wing plates which are located on top of the bulkheads see fig 3 the object is secured against movements in horizontal directions by the seafastening system roll and pitch stoppers in this paper the vertical supports are the components of interest 2 4 critical events and failure modes 2 4 1 critical events in calm water and in moderate waves the transport heads toward the destination independently of the wave and wind directions when the environmental conditions exceed defined limits the tow is assumed to head up against the waves riding off the storm while trying to limit the barge roll motions the relative wave direction for the barge is then head seas θ the angle θ depends on the tug s ability to keep the towline tight and prevent yaw motions of the barge the layout of the transported object and the barge also affects the relative wave direction if the wind seas and swell directions are different with the tow head up against the wind the barge is exposed to waves from the side independent of θ as a result there could be a large relative wave angle these effects are not investigated further within the present study and the barge is therefore assumed to be exposed to beam seas corresponding to θ 90 in the case of a tug breakdown or towline failure the barge drifts and may turn 90 degrees to the wave direction beam sea exposure is therefore taken to be the governing wave direction 2 4 2 failure modes the following ultimate limit state failure modes are considered structural failure of the barge structural failure of the transported object and structural failure of the vertical supports the capacity limits of the critical structural components are discussed in section 2 8 fatigue failure collapse due to accidental loads caused by e g human error the effect of local damage corrosion and accidental heel trim due to water ingress are not considered 2 5 design of structural components 2 5 1 calculation of characteristic forces the governing load effects due to static loads and wave induced barge motions must be calculated as inputs to the structural design the support forces can be found from a hydrodynamic analysis using a 3d panel model where the characteristic load is calculated as e g the most probable maximum value or expected maximum value during a suitably selected sea state that analysis is not performed here to investigate the implicit safety level by use of a practical design approach the method in the standard for marine operation dnvgl st n001 2020 is used to calculate the characteristic dynamic loads in the vertical support wind contributes to the design load and could be included in the reliability analysis because the wind load is relatively small however the impact on the reliability is also relatively small thus the wind is not included in the analyses 2 5 2 design criteria in ultimate capacity analysis the structural design is based on a standard capacity equation in the ultimate limit state here we consider the static load effect from gravity and the dynamic load effect from the wave induced motions of the barge the capacity check is expressed as follows 1 r c γ m γ g s c g γ e s c e r c is the characteristic capacity generally defined as the 5 fractile value see e g en 1990 2005 or dnvgl st n001 2020 γ m is the material factor equal to 1 15 for steel structures according to dnvgl st n001 2020 s c g and s c e are the characteristic static and dynamic load effects respectively the characteristic load effects used in the case studies are given in section 3 1 2 the load factors for the ultimate limit state are given in table 1 the load and material factors correspond to a specific reliability index that is not known and is investigated as part of this work the sea transports considered here are custom made nonroutine transports the design of the seafastening system is assumed to fulfill eq 1 hence we have 2 r c γ m γ g s c g γ e s c e where the parameters are defined in relation to eq 1 2 5 3 structural elements in the seafastening system the structural elements specially designed for marine transports are typically grillage beams to transfer the vertical load into the transport vessel and braces to transfer the horizontal loads from the rolling and pitching of the vessel we consider the vertical load transfer and typical structural components are grillage beams constructed by i girders or box girders the connection between the grillage beams and the barge deck typically made of wing plates welded to the vessel deck to distribute the load into web frames and bulkheads and stiffened plate panels in the bulkheads 2 6 structural reliability analysis 2 6 1 reliability formulation the reliability analysis methods are described in detail by e g madsen et al 1986 and melchers and beck 2018 a brief account is given below the limit state function or failure function g x is defined for a particular problem where g x 0 represents failure the probability of structural failure is expressed as follows 3 p f p g x 0 g x 0 f x x d x x i g x 0 f x x d x where i is an indicator function equal to 1 if is true and 0 if is false x is a vector of variables representing the load effects and the capacity f x x is the joint probability density of all the variables involved equivalent to the failure probability we can report the reliability index β φ 1 p f as a safety measure where φ is the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution the integral in eq 3 can be solved by numerical integration by the first or second order reliability method form sorm or by monte carlo simulation the sorm is used to calculate the failure probabilities in the case studies in section 3 and the results are spot checked by monte carlo simulations the calculations are performed using the computer program proban tvedt 2006 when modeling the structural capacity and the load effect by stochastic variables r and s respectively the failure function can be expressed simply as follows 4 g x r s while the capacity check in eq 2 is semiprobabilistic eq 4 represents the capacity check in a probabilistic format when r and s are statistically independent we have f x x d x f r r f s s d r d s in eq 3 the structural capacity can be expressed by a random variable r as follows 5 r χ r r c where χ r is a variable to account for uncertainties in the ultimate capacity model see section 2 8 and r c is calculated from eq 2 the load effect is expressed by a random variable s as follows 6 s χ s g s g χ s e s e where s g is the static load effect taken equal to s c g in eq 2 χ s g is a random variable representing the uncertainty in the calculated static load effect see section 2 7 2 χ s e is a random variable representing the uncertainty in the calculated wave induced vessel motions and the corresponding load effects in the seafastening system see section 2 7 3 s e is the wave induced load effect see section 2 7 4 note that this term is not the same as s c e in eq 2 in section 2 5 1 2 6 2 uncertainty importance factors the uncertainty importance factors provide information on the influence of the variables in g x from eq 4 on the failure probability the importance factors represent the percentage of the total uncertainty in the reliability index β due to the corresponding random variable or group of random variables the importance factors are defined as 100 α i 2 where α i are the sensitivity factors which are defined as follows see e g madsen 1988 7 α i β u i u the importance factors are calculated by form where the variables are transferred to u space u i are random variables with a standard normal distribution and u is the design point in u space if an importance factor is low the uncertainty in the corresponding variable has little effect on the failure probability 2 7 load effect modeling 2 7 1 variables included in the analysis the statistical uncertainties in the variables included in the reliability analysis are discussed below the following variables are included the static load effect uncertainty χ s g section 2 7 2 the dynamic load effect uncertainty χ s e section 2 7 3 the wave induced load effect s e section 2 7 4 the significant wave height h s section 2 7 5 and the wave period t z section 2 7 6 the uncertainty variables are modeled by normal distributions χ s g and χ s e with the estimated bias and coefficient of variation cov the bias is the mean value of the random variable μ χ and is defined as the ratio between the true and estimated values of the variable the cov is defined as σ χ μ χ where σ χ is the standard deviation of the variable 2 7 2 uncertainty in the calculated static load effect χ s g the characteristic load effect from gravity s c g is calculated based on the maximum expected weight of the transported object the load distribution between the supports depends on the elasticity of the supports fabrication tolerances etc the load distribution can also depend on the ballast condition of the barge after the transported object is set down such effects are not included here and the weight is simply divided between four supports the transported object is usually weighed upon completion hence prior to transport the actual weight is known with high accuracy assuming a conservative approach in the design phase i e the estimated values are on the high side a bias in the weight is expected in the case studies χ s g is modeled as a normally distributed variable with a mean value of 0 95 the cov is set equal to 0 1 2 7 3 uncertainty in the calculated dynamic wave induced load effects χ s e the uncertainty in the calculated dynamic wave induced load effects χ s e depends on the wave data as discussed above the calculated motions of the transport vessel χ s e 1 and the method for calculating the structural load effects due to vessel motions χ s e 2 the last two items are included here and the resulting uncertainty is estimated by χ s e χ s e 1 χ s e 2 in natskår and steen 2013 the support forces calculated from motion analyses and from model tests were compared and a bias was estimated by comparing the standard deviations and maximum values of the response the bias was estimated at 0 75 0 94 bias 1 i e conservative analysis results for the maximum roll angle and 0 65 0 8 for the vertical support force depending on the type of analysis these model tests were performed in severe seas some of the sea states had very steep waves and there were nonlinear effects that limited the barge response in the model tests water on deck etc in the current study we need a bias representative of all sea states included in the long term distribution hence for χ s e 1 a moderate bias of 0 9 is chosen for the given environmental conditions using a linear analysis with a stochastic linearization of viscous roll damping the uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a cov of 0 1 the uncertainties in the calculated load effects χ s e 2 are assumed to be the same as for the static load effect i e a mean value of 0 95 and cov of 0 1 see above note that even if a simple statistical uncertainty model suffices for beam seas in a real case the uncertainty could depend on the ballast condition the relative stiffness between the supports and the wave direction the resulting uncertainty χ s e has a mean value of 0 86 and a cov of 0 14 for the product of two statistically independent variables χ χ 1 χ 2 the mean value is μ χ μ χ 1 μ χ 2 and the coefficient of variation is cov cov χ 1 2 cov χ 2 2 see e g melchers and beck 2018 2 7 4 wave induced load effects s e the wave induced load effect is derived from vessel motion calculated by potential theory for a 3 d panel model of the barge using the computer program package sesam 2019 in principle the barge is subjected to wind seas and swells however the period of swell is much larger than the roll period which is of main importance and the dynamic effects will be limited moreover the accelerations in long periodic motions are relatively small hence the current study considers wind sea only the analysis is based on linear theory and nonlinear roll damping due to eddy making is not included in the hydrodynamic analysis this damping is included by stochastic linearization of the quadratic viscous damping the wave induced seafastening loads are calculated by requiring dynamic equilibrium of the transported object exposed to the barge motions accelerations calculated in the hydrodynamic analysis see natskår and steen 2013 because the calculation of forces is based on a simple equilibrium of the cargo uncertainties arise due to the interaction between the cargo and the barge however if the center of gravity is close to or at the geometric center and we consider beam seas such a simplified approach can produce good results in principle this calculation also involves uncertainties in s g and s e as mentioned in sec section 2 7 3 the statistical distribution of the individual response maxima is defined as follows see e g naess and moan 2013 8 f s e s e 0 0 f s e h s t z s e h s t z f h s t z h s t z d h s d t z where f s e h s t z s e h s t z is the cumulative distribution of the extreme value for the individual support force conditional on the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period and f h s t z h s t z is the joint probability density function for the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period the distribution of the individual response maxima within a sea state i e for a given h s and t z is assumed to be the extreme value distribution according to the rayleigh distribution 9 f s e h s t z s e h s t z 1 exp 1 2 s e σ s e h s t z 2 n h s t z σ s e h s t z is the standard deviation or the rms value of the support force numerical values are given in the case studies in section 3 1 5 the total number of response cycles during marine operation for a given sea state is n h s t z t r ν 0 h s t z where t r is the duration of the operation and ν 0 h s t z is the mean zero upcrossing rate of the response the mean zero upcrossing rate of the vertical support force in beam sea conditions is practically independent of the significant wave height for the barge transport we consider in the case studies below hence n t z t r ν 0 t z where ν 0 t z can be estimated by fitting e g an exponential curve to the actual upcrossing rate see section 3 1 6 in reality the duration of a marine operation is a stochastic variable however here it is treated as a deterministic value the joint probability density function of h s and t z is expressed by the relation 10 f h s t z h s t z f t z h s t z h s f h s h s 2 7 5 the significant wave height the statistical description of the significant wave height depends on the category i e if the operation is weather restricted or weather unrestricted operations with a planned duration of not more than 72 h not more than 96 h when contingency time is included can be defined as weather restricted the significant wave height to be used in the design of the operation h s d e s i g n also called the operational limit h s o p l i m is defined chosen during the planning of the operation the operation can commence when the forecasted significant wave height is lower than the operational limit with a defined safety margin this is the alpha factor method where h s f o r e c a s t α h s d e s i g n and α 1 α is given in dnvgl st n001 2020 operations with planned durations longer than 72 h must be defined as weather unrestricted and the design significant wave height to be used in the planning of the operation is based on long term wave data statistics weather forecasts are still received regularly typically every 12 h but the operation cannot be aborted one example is that of overseas transport for both categories the inherent uncertainties in the significant wave height are accounted for for weather restricted operations there are uncertainties in the forecasted h s and the forecasted wave period t z the forecasted wave period is not used in this study instead the statistical distribution of t z conditional on h s is used see section 2 7 6 for weather unrestricted operations we have data uncertainty in h s and fundamental variability in the long term distribution long term data for sea states are subject to statistical uncertainty when the dataset is limited to only a few years moan et al 2005 the present study is based on 60 years of hindcast data section 3 1 8 and the statistical uncertainty is therefore neglected for weather restricted operations the significant wave height is based on weather forecasts the actual true significant wave height during a marine operation is described by a lognormal distribution see e g bury 1999 as follows 11 f h s h s 1 h s σ ln h s 2 π exp 1 2 ln h s μ ln h s σ ln h s 2 the parameters in the distribution are see e g natskår et al 2015 12a μ ln h s ln h s f c μ ln χ 12b σ ln h s σ ln χ where h s f c is the maximum forecasted significant wave height during the operation given in meters the stochastic variable χ represents the uncertainty in the weather forecasts χ h s h i n d c a s t h s f o r e c a s t numerical values are given in table 6 long term statistics are used for weather unrestricted operations because the significant wave height cannot be based on weather forecasts the significant wave height is assumed to follow a three parameter weibull distribution see e g bury 1999 as follows 13 f h s h 0 if h c b a h c a b 1 exp h c a b if h c from this distribution it follows that p h s c 0 i e h s is never lower than c the parameters a b and c are calculated based on hindcast data see section 3 1 8 the value of the parameter c is on the order of 0 5 1 0 m and the probability density function represents the wave heights that play a role in the calculation of the p f well hindcast data are used in this study to quantify the uncertainty in weather forecasts and to calculate the long term distribution of the significant wave height as mentioned above the statistical uncertainty of the long term sea state data is neglected the uncertainty in the forecasted significant wave height is estimated by comparing one year of forecast and hindcast data the limited duration and uncertainty in the hindcast data may therefore affect the results the accuracy of the hindcast significant wave height compared to measurements was studied by haver 1994 the difference between the hindcast and measured h s had a standard deviation of 1 15 m based on 168 storm events with h s h i n d c a s t 7 5 m no clear dependence on the wave height was observed however we are mainly interested in lower wave heights typically with h s values of 3 5 m and assuming that the accuracy has improved over the years the uncertainty is expected to be lower in our case according to brooker et al 2004 a scatter index i e the standard deviation of the difference between measured and modeled h s values normalized by the mean of the observations of 10 15 for significant wave heights from hindcast data is representative of modern hindcasts compared with measured values a comparison study of hindcast data with measurements was performed by bruserud and haver 2016 they found the hindcast significant wave height from nora10 as described by reistad et al 2011 to be slightly conservative compared with measurements however the difference was small and they did not correct the hindcast significant wave height the same trend was observed by haakenstad et al 2020 when comparing nora10 data with measurements for the north sea the norwegian sea and the barents sea the conclusion for our study is that even if the hindcast values are not exact the deviation from the measured h s values is moderate and the uncertainty in hindcast h s is not included in the current study 2 7 6 wave period the wave period is described in the reliability analyses by a lognormal distribution as shown by e g bitner gregersen and haver 1991 the distribution of the mean zero crossing period t z follows a lognormal distribution that is conditional on h s 14 f t z h s t z h s 1 t z σ ln t z h s 2 π exp 1 2 ln t z μ ln t z h s σ ln t z h s 2 the mean value and the standard deviation for ln t z are calculated as follows 15a μ ln t z h s a 1 a 2 h s a 3 15b σ ln t z h s b 1 b 2 e b 3 h s the parameters a i and b i i 1 2 3 are estimated from hindcast data and are given in section 3 1 9 2 8 resistance modeling χ r 2 8 1 design of the grillage and seafastening a typical grillage beam structure for the transport of heavy objects is shown in fig 2 the support point for the transported object is located on the box girder which has internal reinforcement at the support point for the transported object the box girder transfers the load to two i girders at each of the ends of the i girders there is an end plate welded to the deck of the transport vessel in line with the longitudinal bulkheads or the barge side see fig 2 we consider the structural capacity of the grillage beams and the attachment points bulkheads in the transport vessel the uncertainty in the capacity is divided into uncertainty in the material parameters and model uncertainty 2 8 2 uncertainty in the calculated capacity of the grillage beams the grillage beams are exposed to shear force and bending moment which for the example shown in fig 2 can be found by hand calculations for more complicated structures a linear finite element analysis would typically be run the model uncertainty in the shear and bending capacity typically has a mean value of 1 0 and a cov of 0 05 see jcss 2000 table 3 9 1 the uncertainty in the material parameters i e the yield stress can generally be modeled with a mean value range of 1 05 to 1 15 and a cov range of 0 05 to 0 1 see e g moan 1995 we calculate the bias and cov according to jcss 2000 for steel with a characteristic yield stress the 5 fractile equal to 355 mpa typical steel quality for seafastening steel the mean value is 378 mpa i e a bias of 1 07 the cov is 0 07 the resulting uncertainty including both the model and material uncertainty has a mean value of 1 07 and a cov of 0 09 this model with a lognormal distribution represents χ r for the grillage beams 2 8 3 uncertainty in the calculated capacity of the bulkhead bulkheads with stiffeners and web frames are shown in fig 3 the capacity of the stiffened plate panels can be calculated according to e g dnv rp c201 2010 for in plane loading parallel to the stiffeners and lateral loading on the plate plane the model uncertainty in the calculated capacity can be described by a lognormal distribution with a mean value of 1 21 and a cov of 0 15 see ssc 433 2004 table 5 1 we are not aware of such information for a load acting perpendicular to the stiffeners we discuss two failure modes for stiffened plate panels local buckling of plates between stiffeners and failure of stiffeners uncertainties related to any reduced capacity due to corrosion or local damage are not included here the bulkhead is loaded from the wing plate welded to the deck see fig 3 the capacity of the plate e g in k n m is not uniform over the plate width b toward the edge buckling does not occur and the plate can be loaded until yield see fig 4 in the central part of the plate the capacity is limited by the buckling of the plate the capacity of the bulkhead can be formulated as follows 16 n f y t b e f f f k t b b e f f this capacity formula is similar to eq 6 6 in dnv rp c201 2010 t is the plate thickness the first term represents the full yield capacity at the plate edges over a length b e f f 2 at each end and the second term represents the buckling capacity over the central part of the plate with length b b e f f the buckling stress capacity f k is calculated by idealizing the central part of the plate as a column with length s where s is the center distance between the horizontal stiffeners the buckling capacity of the central part of the plate is for reduced slenderness λ c 2 0 see eq 6 7 in dnv rp c201 2010 calculated similar to buckling curve a in e g en 1993 1 1 2005 in this calculation the plate edges are assumed to be simply supported i e they are free to rotate in reality there is some restrained rotation of the plate edge and the assumption that the edges are free to rotate is conservative hence in reliability analyses the bias is larger than one the purpose of the stiffeners is to provide support for bulkhead plates of size b s i e to prevent global buckling of the bulkhead plates imperfections from fabrication result in a lateral load on the stiffeners the loading mechanism is shown in fig 5 where the fabrication tolerance for the misalignment of one stiffener relative to the adjacent stiffeners is given the lateral load i e out of plane load on the stiffeners can be calculated from eq 7 8 in dnv rp c201 2010 the lateral load is resisted by a shear force and bending moment in the stiffeners which indicates that standard measures for the uncertainty in the capacity model could be applied however the load is not the vertical load applied directly on the bulkhead but a lateral load calculated as a function of the vertical load the geometry of the stiffeners etc assuming that the uncertainty in the lateral load is accounted for through the variables χ s g and χ s e the resulting bias and cov of the calculated stiffener capacity are assumed to follow the uncertainty for ordinary beams in bending see section 2 8 2 to summarize the bulkhead capacity for a vertical load is limited by yielding at the edges of the bulkhead plate buckling in the mid part of the bulkhead plate and buckling of the stiffeners due to second order deformation we conclude that the capacity model for the bulkheads should not be different from the case with axial loading parallel to the stiffeners or the case of lateral loading the model uncertainty is therefore taken from ssc 433 2004 as lognormally distributed with a mean value of 1 21 and a cov of 0 15 similar to the steps performed in section 2 8 2 the mean value of the yield stress is calculated according to jcss 2000 for steel with a characteristic yield stress equal to 235 mpa typical steel quality for barges the bias is found to be 1 04 and the cov is 0 07 the uncertainty in the calculated capacity of the bulkhead is modeled with a mean value of 1 25 and a cov of 0 17 2 8 4 capacity of the transported object the capacity of the transported object should be checked sea transport is typically included in the engineering phase where it is checked together with the in place condition however those analyses are not included here 2 8 5 resulting uncertainty in the structural capacity based on the previous discussion the uncertainty of the grillage beams is modeled with a bias of 1 07 and a cov of 0 09 the bulkhead uncertainty is described by a bias of 1 25 and a cov of 0 17 despite the higher bias the bulkhead is associated with a larger failure probability because of the larger cov hence the values for the bulkhead are used in the case studies see table 4 a sensitivity study with variable bias and cov is included in section 3 6 2 9 target reliability level during temporary phases decision making relating to the reliability of structures involves an assessment of the reliability as outlined above as well as evaluating the reliability in view of a target reliability level this section deals with the basis for establishing a target reliability level in transport operations using towed barges the barges are usually unmanned and only material damage is considered a severe structural failure resulting in the total loss of the handled object will lead to economic losses due to the cost of replacing the lost asset it could also be expensive to recover the lost object and scrap it in addition there could be indirect costs due to delays in the production start increased insurance costs for future projects and a loss of future contracts for the companies involved to define a target reliability level the reference period must be given for permanent offshore structures the service lifetime may range from 20 to 100 years while a marine operation typically will have a duration of a few hours up to a few weeks for a permanent structure it is convenient to relate the target reliability levels to an annual failure probability with a similar approach for marine operation the failure probability per operation depends on the duration from an insurance point of view it is more convenient to define the failure probability per operation independent of the duration for fatalities the target probabilities could be given per year but that aspect is not considered here for a structure under operating conditions the recommended target levels for annual failure probabilities depending on the consequence of failure are given e g in iso 2394 2015 the target levels for failure probability in temporary conditions can also reflect the consequences of failure the target level could for example be defined per operation based on the following aspects risk of fatalities e g whether a towed barge is manned or unmanned risk of environmental pollution risk of economic loss e g target level depending on the value of the transported object and consequential losses e g delayed start of production such an approach is not used by dnvgl st n001 2020 for marine operations instead a constant target level for the failure probability is given the probability of structural failure leading to a total loss should be less than 10 4 per operation this level was first given in the standard for insurance warranty surveys in marine operations issued by dnv in 1985 even if this threshold was not very rigorously determined it has since been accepted by the industry and insurance companies the calculated failure probabilities are sensitive to the assumptions they are based on e g the bias and cov of the variables involved so the calculated failure probability can deviate from the recommended target levels however in the case studies in section 3 the absolute probability is not of main interest it is the relative failure probability e g for various durations of an operation that is of greatest interest 3 case studies 3 1 system modeling 3 1 1 general we consider a transport barge loaded with a large object as shown in fig 1 the barge is a flat top barge with dimensions of 91 4 27 4 6 1 m and a raked bow and stern the draft is 3 m and the natural period in rolling is 8 5 s viscous roll damping is included through equivalent stochastic linearization the transported object has a length of 30 m a width of 20 m and a height of 20 m with a uniformly distributed mass and the center of gravity at the geometric center the mass is 3500 tonnes the object is placed on 2 m high grillage beams on the barge more information about this case is given by natskår and steen 2013 the following case studies are included in section 3 2 3 6 1 for weather restricted transport the failure probability is calculated as a function of the duration and the forecasted wave height the failure probabilities are calculated with and without accounting for the uncertainty in the weather forecasts case 1 2 for weather unrestricted transport the failure probabilities are compared for operations executed in july and october case 2 furthermore we calculate the failure probability for the execution of the transport in each of the months within the autumn season case 3 we then compare the use of seasonal and year round data case 4 3 the sensitivity is studied through the failure probability and the importance factors for a base case and for variations in the random variables 3 1 2 characteristic load effects in the supports the characteristic load effects in the ultimate limit state are calculated for the following three conditions 1 weather unrestricted transport worldwide 2 significant wave height limited to 6 m and 3 significant wave height limited to 4 m in a previous version of the dnv standard for marine operations dnv os h202 it was indicated that the standard acceleration for h s 6 m condition 2 in table 2 could be used for weather unrestricted transport during the summer june august in the north sea this fits well with the one year return period significant wave heights as given in table 7 below see also section 3 3 for the transported object with mass m and geometry as given in section 3 1 1 the vertical characteristic support reactions s c e due to roll motion are presented in table 2 for weather unrestricted transport and for transports with significant wave heights limited to 6 and 4 m the vertical static load effect at each support is s c g 0 25 m g because we have assumed that the center of gravity is located at the geometric center of the transported object based on these characteristic forces the required structural capacity i e r c in eq 2 is calculated it is emphasized that the environmental load effects in table 2 are not based on a stochastic analysis they are not described by a probability distribution and they do not depend on the duration of the operation they are deterministically calculated characteristic loads from a design standard to be applied directly in eq 2 3 1 3 forecast uncertainty the characteristic load effects for h s equal to 4 and 6 m are given in table 2 because of the forecast uncertainty the forecasted significant wave height prior to the start of an operation must be lower than the design h s i e the value of h s used to calculate the vessel motion and support forces the maximum allowed forecasted significant wave heights are given in table 3 3 1 4 failure function for the reliability analysis the failure function for calculating the probability of failure from eq 3 is as follows 17 g χ r r c χ s g s g χ s e s e where the parameters are defined in relation to eqs 5 and 6 information for the variables is given in table 4 3 1 5 load effects to be used in the reliability analysis the wave induced load effect in a vertical support is described by the standard deviation of the response as a function of the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period σ s e h s t z the standard deviation is represented by a response surface given as follows see e g rajashekhar and ellingwood 1993 18 σ s e h s t z a 1 t z a 2 t z h s a 3 t z h s 2 m g the standard deviation is almost linear with h s for a given t z but the quadratic roll damping makes the response slightly nonlinear hence the h s squared term is included the parameters a 1 a 2 and a 3 are calculated from 19 a i t z k i 1 k i 2 t z k i 3 t z 2 f o r i 1 2 3 the coefficients k i j for the barge in section 3 1 1 exposed to long crested seas are given in table 5 the response surface is an approximation and for periods lower than 4 s the response surface overestimates the support force however such low wave periods are relevant only for very small h s values which do not occur often in open seas furthermore even if the support force is overestimated for t z 4 m it is still small and does not contribute significantly to the failure probability the inaccuracy resulting from the fitted response surface is fairly moderate and can be represented by a variable with a mean value of 1 0 and a cov of 0 05 this inaccuracy is neglected in the case studies the most probable maximum support load which is calculated based on the standard deviation of the response from eq 18 is shown in fig 6 as a function of the significant wave height the support load is calculated using a modified version of eq 8 by integrating over t z only and solving for s from f s h s s h s e 1 3 1 6 the mean zero upcrossing rate of the response the mean zero upcrossing rate of the response is input into eq 9 the mean zero upcrossing rate is calculated from the hydrodynamic analysis and an exponential curve is fitted to the calculated results as follows 20 ν 0 t z 0 12 0 87 e 0 64 t z where t z is given in seconds and the unit for ν 0 is s 1 this curve represents the mean zero upcrossing rate well the values from eq 20 are within 2 of the mean zero upcrossing rate from the hydrodynamic analysis for a large value of t z ν 0 converges toward 0 12 s 1 this is the natural frequency of the barge in roll 3 1 7 forecast uncertainty of the significant wave height the parameters μ ln h s and σ ln h s to be used in eq 12 are shown in table 6 as a function of the duration of the operation 3 1 8 long term distribution of the significant wave height the long term distribution of the significant wave height is needed for weather unrestricted operations and is given by the weibull distribution in eq 13 in this paper we use parameters representative of the northern north sea the parameters are based on hindcast data see e g reistad et al 2011 from a location 150 km west of haugesund norway from september 1957 until december 2017 the weibull parameters are estimated by the method of moments see e g bury 1999 sec 17 6 the parameters for each month and for the year are given in table 7 instead of monthly data the data may be divided into seasons which are typically winter december february spring march may summer june august and autumn september november seasonal data are given in table 8 together with the weibull parameters examples of significant wave heights to be used in the design of a weather unrestricted operation with a duration of up to one month are shown there is an approximately 10 probability of exceeding these significant wave heights during a one month exposure time 3 1 9 distribution of t z conditional upon h s the conditional distribution of the mean zero crossing wave period t z is estimated from the same hindcast data as the significant wave height while the distribution for h s was estimated for each month and season the year round data are included for the distribution fitted to t z the values for the parameters in the lognormal distribution from section 2 7 6 are given in table 9 3 2 case 1 seafastening designed for weather restricted transport 3 2 1 case description for weather restricted transport we calculate the failure probability with and without considering the uncertainty in the weather forecasts according to the alpha factor method described in section 2 7 5 in section 3 2 2 we assume that the supports are designed for h s 6 m according to section 3 1 2 when the forecast uncertainty is considered according to the alpha factor method we perform the following 1 the forecasted h s to start the operation is taken according to table 3 hence the forecasted h s is equal to 4 7 m for a one day operation 4 4 m for two days and 4 3 m for three days 2 the uncertainty in the significant wave height is accounted for by applying the lognormal distribution according to eq 11 with the mean and standard deviation taken from table 6 hence μ l n χ 0 055 and σ l n χ 0 112 for a one day operation and so on 3 the failure probability is calculated according to eq 3 for 24 48 and 72 h as a quick check of how reasonable the forecast limits seem let us consider the uncertainty given in table 6 for a forecasted significant wave height of 6 m the mean value plus two standard deviations after 48 h is 1 08 2 0 13 6 m 8 m which is well above the design h s when the forecast indicates a significant wave height of no more than 4 4 m over the next two days as required above the mean value plus two standard deviations equals 5 9 m which is close to the design value hence the reduction in the design h s to reach the forecast h s seems plausible when the forecast uncertainty is not considered we do not reduce the forecast limit to start the operation the operation starts when the forecasted h s is equal to 6 m this is a hypothetical situation because it implies that the weather forecasts are exact and that the true h s is identical to the forecasted h s the purpose is to quantify the effect of forecast uncertainty under this assumption the failure probability is calculated for one two and three days all with h s 6 m in section 3 2 3 we perform the same steps as described above but in this case the seafastening system is designed for h s 4 m i e according to option 3 from section 3 1 2 we assume that the forecasted significant wave height remains constant during the operation period this condition does not necessarily hold as the forecasted h s varies over time however for moderate sea states the significant wave height can be approximately the same over several consecutive days and therefore a constant h s during the operation is chosen 3 2 2 design limit h s 6 m the maximum forecasted h s to start the transport is 4 7 m for an operation period of one day decreasing to 4 3 m for a period of 3 days according to the data in table 3 the failure probability accounting for the forecast uncertainty is shown in table 10 the failure probability without forecast uncertainty is also calculated for h s 6 m the failure probability increases with the increasing duration both with and without forecast uncertainty because the maximum forces extreme values increase over time for a given h s when forecast uncertainty is included there is an additional effect because the forecast uncertainty also increases with time however the increased uncertainty is counteracted by the reduced forecasted h s for longer operations in fact the reduced startup criterion accounts for the uncertainty and results in a lower failure probability when the forecast uncertainty is included 3 2 3 design limit h s 4 m in table 11 the failure probability accounting for forecast uncertainty is calculated for a forecasted wave height equal to the operational limit from table 3 the failure probability without forecast uncertainty is also calculated for h s 4 m the results compare well with the previous design case table 10 3 3 case 2 weather unrestricted transport executed in july and october we now consider weather unrestricted transport where the grillage and seafastening have been designed according to the weather unrestricted option described in section 3 1 2 the failure probabilities are calculated for a duration of three days to three weeks with the assumption that the operation is executed in july or october the failure probabilities are shown in table 12 note that the effect of the uncertainty in the weather forecasts is not included here the duration is more than three days and the operation does not depend on weather forecasts but on long term statistical data the failure probability differs substantially depending on the time of year p f is 18 times higher in october than in july the failure probability increases slightly with the increasing duration and doubles as the duration increases from 3 to 21 days as mentioned in section 3 1 2 dnv os h202 allows the grillage and seafastening to be designed for h s 6 m for weather unrestricted summer transport operation in the north sea the failure probability would then be 1 8 1 0 5 for a three day transport operation instead of 3 7 1 0 6 in table 12 increasing to 3 4 1 0 5 for 21 days hence there is a better balance between transport operations in july and october p f is four times higher in october than in july 3 4 case 3 the influence of the startup date within a season for the case in section 3 3 we study how the startup date within the season i e the month within a season in which the operation is executed affects the failure probability let us use the statistics for the autumn i e september november the failure probabilities based on the monthly and seasonal statistics from tables 7 and 8 are shown in table 13 the failure probability is 1 5 times higher if the analysis is based on data from november instead of seasonal data if the analysis is based on data for september p f is less than half that calculated for the season 3 5 case 4 the effect of seasonal versus year round data iso 19901 6 2009 requires that the weather conditions used for the design of weather unrestricted operations shall reflect the statistical extremes for the area and season concerned according to dnvgl st n001 2020 seasons may be accounted for when planning sea voyages we now discuss the effect of using seasonal or monthly versus year round statistics traditionally the use of seasonal variations has been optional the normal approach has generally been to use year round data and utilize seasonal variations when it is beneficial in the sense that the loads are reduced we again consider the weather unrestricted seafastening design from section 3 1 2 in table 14 p f is calculated based on environmental data from january and year round data the failure probability is 2 3 times higher based on january statistics than on year round data next let us assume a duration equal to seven days for example we compare p f for each month with that calculated with year round data the p f based on year round data is 8 5 1 0 5 while p f based on monthly data varies as shown in fig 7 for operations during the summer period p f is very low as expected this could be viewed as unnecessary conservatism by the use of the weather unrestricted design option for the summer period if the seafastening system is designed based on year round data and transport is performed in january the failure probability is three times the target level as mentioned in section 2 7 the duration of a marine operation is actually a stochastic variable that has been assumed to be a deterministic variable in the structural reliability analysis the duration could be modeled as a stochastic variable and the revised failure probabilities could be calculated however from the case studies above it is observed that p f is not very sensitive to the duration so it is reasonable to model the duration as a fixed variable 3 6 sensitivity study the importance factors see section 2 6 2 for two selected cases one weather restricted and one weather unrestricted are shown in table 15 in the weather restricted case the seafastening system is designed for a significant wave height equal to 4 m and the operational duration is three days 72 h the forecasted h s is 2 7 m from table 3 in the weather unrestricted case the duration is seven days and the significant wave height is based on year round long term statistics the vertical support was designed for weather unrestricted transport see section 3 1 2 in addition to the base cases we consider alternatives with changes in bias and cov on the capacity and one alternative with increased cov on the uncertainty in the calculated dynamic load effect details on the alternatives and the importance factors as well as the reliability index and the failure probability are given in table 15 the importance factor for the structural capacity χ r dominates in all cases for weather unrestricted operation the wave induced load s e contributes significantly more to the failure probability than for weather restricted operation as expected the failure probability increases when the bias on χ r is reduced and when the cov of χ s e is increased in alternative 4 an increase in the cov for the capacity leads to a substantial increase in the failure probability the main observation is that the uncertainty in the structural capacity dominates in the structural reliability analyses the capacity depends on the structural design and fabrication for actual transport and a focus on this aspect is suggested in the planning of grillage and seafastening in connection with the transport of heavy objects 4 results and discussion this paper analyzes the implied failure probability of a seafastening structure designed by the use of standard motion criteria for a barge transport operation incorporating the influence of weather forecasts the duration of the transport and the time of year two categories of marine operations have been considered i e weather restricted and weather unrestricted operations in the first category the significant wave height is given by weather forecasts and the uncertainty in the forecasts is accounted for in the second category the significant wave height is based on long term statistics regarding the northern north sea the motion analysis of the transport barge is limited to situations with wind generated seas acting in one main direction in our case rolling of the barge dominates the loading and the load effects in the supports are overestimated more realistic modeling would include wind generated sea and swell with different mean directions such an extension of the analysis would require a more detailed assessment of the model uncertainty related to such conditions than is included in the present analysis but may be interesting to include in future studies the sensitivity analyses show that the structural capacity has the largest importance factors of the parameters examined table 15 consequently the failure probabilities are sensitive to variations in the bias and cov for the structural capacity the structural capacity of a bulkhead with horizontal stiffeners exposed to vertical loading should be studied for example by a more detailed load effect calculation and detailed fe analyses of the support points to reduce the uncertainty in this variable for a weather restricted operation the failure probabilities are calculated by the following two methods i e by assuming that the decision to start sea transport is made accounting for the uncertainty in the weather forecasts and not accounting for the uncertainty in the weather forecasts i e assuming perfect forecasts the reduction in the maximum allowed significant wave height in the alpha factor method compensates for the forecast uncertainty such that p f is lower when the forecast uncertainty is included than when it is not see table 10 the failure probabilities shown in table 10 are sensitive to the input parameters and they are somewhat higher than 10 4 per operation however the comparison of the probabilities not the absolute values is of main interest here the failure probability for a weather unrestricted operation depends on the time of year the operation is executed for example case studies indicate that for a given seafastening design the failure probability is 1 5 times higher using environmental data for november instead of seasonal data for the autumn september november the failure probability calculated using statistical data for january is three times higher than that calculated using year round data and the failure probability is 15 20 times higher in october than in july for a design based on standard motion criteria the differences in the failure probabilities are not dramatic in the first two examples a consequence of the first bullet point is that a marine operation executed in november may be designed based on seasonal data for the autumn and not necessarily the actual month furthermore an operation executed in january designed for year round data will have a failure probability equal to three times the target value which is still not dramatic in the third bullet point it is assumed that the standard weather unrestricted criterion has been applied for the design of the grillage and seafastening while the failure probability is equal to the target level for october transport this probability is much lower for summer transport introducing additional conservatism conservatism is acceptable but results in an increased fabrication cost an alternative to an unrestricted design could be to estimate the design sea state for the geographic area time of year and duration of the operation and to design the grillage and seafastening for that sea state e g the h s 6 m or h s 4 m criterion in dnvgl st n001 2020 for weather unrestricted transport operations 5 conclusions and recommendations based on the study the following conclusions are drawn for a weather restricted operation the reduction in the wave height to account for the forecast uncertainty compensates adequately for the uncertainty inherent in the forecasted significant wave height and is a good approach with respect to the failure probability for weather unrestricted transport the use of seasonal or annual data affects the results the use of seasonal data is optional in dnvgl st n001 2020 where seasonal data may be accounted for the use of seasons could also be mandatory e g as required by iso 19901 6 2009 which requires that the statistical extremes for the season concerned be reflected it is recommended that this aspect be considered for inclusion in future design standards the calculated failure probabilities in the study span a large range as a result of seasonal variations however the calculated probabilities are of the same order of magnitude as the target value indicated by dnvgl st n001 of 10 4 per operation for the north sea the failure probability obtained by using the simplified design criteria compares well with the target reliability level however because the uncertainty in strength dominates and the strength depends on temporary solutions for each transport operation a focus on this aspect is recommended in the integrity management of the grillage and seafastening in connection with transport of heavy objects in the present work the design of the module supports is based on motion from a design standard it would be of interest for future work to study the reliability level of a transport designed according to criteria from other design standards or by vessel motions obtained from the 3d panel model the effect of wind seas and swell with different mean

20487,this paper addresses the safety of marine operations related to a seafastening system for large object transport the aim is to present a structural reliability approach to accommodate the uncertainties affecting design checks the probability of structural failure by use of design standards for assessing marine operations is studied using structural reliability analyses to shed light on the implicit reliability levels of such standards a structural reliability model that includes the effect of uncertainty in weather forecasts is established the reliability analyses show that the method to account for forecast uncertainty as defined in the standards compensates well for that uncertainty and the failure probabilities in the case studies are between 1 0 4 and 1 0 3 per operation a reliability model that includes the long term statistical distribution of the environmental conditions is also established this model is applicable for operations with a duration longer than three days and is used to study seasonal variations and the failure probability as a function of the duration of operations the failure probability is calculated for execution in several months showing the dependency on the time of the year and the duration of the operations the failure probabilities are on the order of 1 0 4 per operation keywords marine operation sea transport structural reliability analysis structural capacity 1 introduction in this paper we study marine operations related to the sea transport of large and heavy objects the consequences of failure can be severe but an excessively conservative approach will increase costs therefore an optimized safety level should be targeted the uncertainties inherent in marine operations must thus be quantified in a reliability context to provide a rational basis for decision making we will present a method to estimate the failure probability of seafastening and apply the method in studies related to sea transport on a towed barge the study addresses both weather restricted and weather unrestricted transports two different methods are used in this paper to calculate wave induced barge motions one approach is used for structural design when planning the transport and another approach is applied in structural reliability analyses the two different methods used are the design check of the required capacity of the support points is based on the barge motions given in a design standard the structural reliability analyses are based on barge motions as calculated by a 3d panel model the design check could have been based on motions calculated by the panel model instead of the standard method the standard method was chosen to investigate the failure probability by the use of a simplified method for calculating barge motions as given by a design standard for weather restricted operations normally operations with a duration of less than three days the significant wave heights are based on weather forecasts and the uncertainty in the weather forecasts of the significant wave height should be accounted for the approach applied in this study is based on natskår et al 2015 where the uncertainty in the forecasts is included as described in section 2 7 several other researchers have studied the uncertainty in predicted significant wave height for example de girolamo et al 2017 they studied the reliability of weather forecasts by analyzing the probability of correctly predicting a given threshold value of significant wave height they studied the probability of missed alarms i e where the predicted significant wave height is below the threshold and the actual significant wave height is above the threshold using different quantiles in the probability distribution of the forecast error gintautas and sørensen 2016 developed a reliability based method to estimate the number of weather windows and their length within a given time period they concluded that the improved predictability of their approach increased the total length of the weather windows by 11 within the test period while we study marine operations through sea transportation several other studies focused on the installation phase guachamin acero et al 2016 studied marine operations with regard to the assessment of the operational limits and the operability of marine operations related to the installation of an offshore wind turbine by a floating crane they proposed a methodology where the operational limits were established in terms of maximum allowable sea states by taking into account the duration of subactivities other aspects of installation have also been studied for example by guachamin acero et al 2015 who analyzed the crane installation of offshore wind turbines by calculating the motion in a sophisticated manner including both the 1st and 2nd order responses of the crane barge and the lifted object sea transport and installation have in common that planning e g accounting for the uncertainty in the predicted wave heights and calculating the vessel response is vital for the control of the reliability level inherent in the operations research has also been performed on the hull girder capacity in ship transport e g by shu and moan 2011 who studied the interaction between the local load from the sea pressure and the hull girder bending of a bulk carrier they found that the correlation between the wave induced global and local loads had a negligible influence on the probability of failure and that it was reasonable to not consider the correlation between global and local wave loads in the structural reliability analysis in this paper we focus on the support structure rather than the bending of the hull girder of the transport vessel for weather unrestricted operations operations with durations of more than three days the significant wave heights are based on long term distributions which in this study are estimated from hindcast data for the northern north sea the failure probability for a weather unrestricted operation based on the long term statistical data of the significant wave height is calculated assuming that the transport starts in several months throughout the year the reliability target level is based on existing structures because the target level should be consistent with the implied reliability level in current accepted design practice this study aims to provide an indication of this reliability level the target reliability level could depend on e g the consequences of failure but that factor is not considered here this paper deals with the reliability of the seafastening system as affected by normal uncertainties due to the fundamental variability uncertainty and lack of data human errors and omissions as well as organizational factors in the planning of the operation and design of the equipment and fabrication as well as during the execution of the marine operation might also cause failure it is assumed herein that such errors are eliminated by suitable verification and control during the design fabrication and operation an organized risk management effort is normally used to manage the design process and there should be continuous control and verification of the fabrication proper training of the personnel to be involved during the execution of the operation is also vital in this paper human errors are not considered and the focus is on handling normal uncertainties in the framework of the structural reliability analysis in this paper the planning and execution of marine operations are assumed to be performed according to the design standard marine operations and marine warranty dnvgl st n001 2020 1 1 dnvgl st n001 is not freely available however the requirements in that standard referred to in

structure to be transported e g from its fabrication site to its final destination there are several temporary phases e g loading of the transport vessel sea transport and discharge herein we focus on the sea transport phase the aim of the paper is to develop a reliability model for the structural capacity of cargo supports furthermore we perform structural reliability analyses of the support structure and compare the implicit reliability level for various design conditions e g for several forecasted significant wave heights as a function of the duration of the operation assuming that the operation occurs in various seasons of the year 2 3 typical transport configurations large and heavy objects can be transported on ships and barges a transport barge loaded with a large object is shown in fig 1 the transported object is typically placed on preinstalled grillage beams e g 2 5 m high depending on the weight of the transported object among other factors the grillage beam configuration is shown in fig 2 the grillage beams transfer the vertical load from the transported object into the barge structure through the grillage beam end plates wing plates which are located on top of the bulkheads see fig 3 the object is secured against movements in horizontal directions by the seafastening system roll and pitch stoppers in this paper the vertical supports are the components of interest 2 4 critical events and failure modes 2 4 1 critical events in calm water and in moderate waves the transport heads toward the destination independently of the wave and wind directions when the environmental conditions exceed defined limits the tow is assumed to head up against the waves riding off the storm while trying to limit the barge roll motions the relative wave direction for the barge is then head seas θ the angle θ depends on the tug s ability to keep the towline tight and prevent yaw motions of the barge the layout of the transported object and the barge also affects the relative wave direction if the wind seas and swell directions are different with the tow head up against the wind the barge is exposed to waves from the side independent of θ as a result there could be a large relative wave angle these effects are not investigated further within the present study and the barge is therefore assumed to be exposed to beam seas corresponding to θ 90 in the case of a tug breakdown or towline failure the barge drifts and may turn 90 degrees to the wave direction beam sea exposure is therefore taken to be the governing wave direction 2 4 2 failure modes the following ultimate limit state failure modes are considered structural failure of the barge structural failure of the transported object and structural failure of the vertical supports the capacity limits of the critical structural components are discussed in section 2 8 fatigue failure collapse due to accidental loads caused by e g human error the effect of local damage corrosion and accidental heel trim due to water ingress are not considered 2 5 design of structural components 2 5 1 calculation of characteristic forces the governing load effects due to static loads and wave induced barge motions must be calculated as inputs to the structural design the support forces can be found from a hydrodynamic analysis using a 3d panel model where the characteristic load is calculated as e g the most probable maximum value or expected maximum value during a suitably selected sea state that analysis is not performed here to investigate the implicit safety level by use of a practical design approach the method in the standard for marine operation dnvgl st n001 2020 is used to calculate the characteristic dynamic loads in the vertical support wind contributes to the design load and could be included in the reliability analysis because the wind load is relatively small however the impact on the reliability is also relatively small thus the wind is not included in the analyses 2 5 2 design criteria in ultimate capacity analysis the structural design is based on a standard capacity equation in the ultimate limit state here we consider the static load effect from gravity and the dynamic load effect from the wave induced motions of the barge the capacity check is expressed as follows 1 r c γ m γ g s c g γ e s c e r c is the characteristic capacity generally defined as the 5 fractile value see e g en 1990 2005 or dnvgl st n001 2020 γ m is the material factor equal to 1 15 for steel structures according to dnvgl st n001 2020 s c g and s c e are the characteristic static and dynamic load effects respectively the characteristic load effects used in the case studies are given in section 3 1 2 the load factors for the ultimate limit state are given in table 1 the load and material factors correspond to a specific reliability index that is not known and is investigated as part of this work the sea transports considered here are custom made nonroutine transports the design of the seafastening system is assumed to fulfill eq 1 hence we have 2 r c γ m γ g s c g γ e s c e where the parameters are defined in relation to eq 1 2 5 3 structural elements in the seafastening system the structural elements specially designed for marine transports are typically grillage beams to transfer the vertical load into the transport vessel and braces to transfer the horizontal loads from the rolling and pitching of the vessel we consider the vertical load transfer and typical structural components are grillage beams constructed by i girders or box girders the connection between the grillage beams and the barge deck typically made of wing plates welded to the vessel deck to distribute the load into web frames and bulkheads and stiffened plate panels in the bulkheads 2 6 structural reliability analysis 2 6 1 reliability formulation the reliability analysis methods are described in detail by e g madsen et al 1986 and melchers and beck 2018 a brief account is given below the limit state function or failure function g x is defined for a particular problem where g x 0 represents failure the probability of structural failure is expressed as follows 3 p f p g x 0 g x 0 f x x d x x i g x 0 f x x d x where i is an indicator function equal to 1 if is true and 0 if is false x is a vector of variables representing the load effects and the capacity f x x is the joint probability density of all the variables involved equivalent to the failure probability we can report the reliability index β φ 1 p f as a safety measure where φ is the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution the integral in eq 3 can be solved by numerical integration by the first or second order reliability method form sorm or by monte carlo simulation the sorm is used to calculate the failure probabilities in the case studies in section 3 and the results are spot checked by monte carlo simulations the calculations are performed using the computer program proban tvedt 2006 when modeling the structural capacity and the load effect by stochastic variables r and s respectively the failure function can be expressed simply as follows 4 g x r s while the capacity check in eq 2 is semiprobabilistic eq 4 represents the capacity check in a probabilistic format when r and s are statistically independent we have f x x d x f r r f s s d r d s in eq 3 the structural capacity can be expressed by a random variable r as follows 5 r χ r r c where χ r is a variable to account for uncertainties in the ultimate capacity model see section 2 8 and r c is calculated from eq 2 the load effect is expressed by a random variable s as follows 6 s χ s g s g χ s e s e where s g is the static load effect taken equal to s c g in eq 2 χ s g is a random variable representing the uncertainty in the calculated static load effect see section 2 7 2 χ s e is a random variable representing the uncertainty in the calculated wave induced vessel motions and the corresponding load effects in the seafastening system see section 2 7 3 s e is the wave induced load effect see section 2 7 4 note that this term is not the same as s c e in eq 2 in section 2 5 1 2 6 2 uncertainty importance factors the uncertainty importance factors provide information on the influence of the variables in g x from eq 4 on the failure probability the importance factors represent the percentage of the total uncertainty in the reliability index β due to the corresponding random variable or group of random variables the importance factors are defined as 100 α i 2 where α i are the sensitivity factors which are defined as follows see e g madsen 1988 7 α i β u i u the importance factors are calculated by form where the variables are transferred to u space u i are random variables with a standard normal distribution and u is the design point in u space if an importance factor is low the uncertainty in the corresponding variable has little effect on the failure probability 2 7 load effect modeling 2 7 1 variables included in the analysis the statistical uncertainties in the variables included in the reliability analysis are discussed below the following variables are included the static load effect uncertainty χ s g section 2 7 2 the dynamic load effect uncertainty χ s e section 2 7 3 the wave induced load effect s e section 2 7 4 the significant wave height h s section 2 7 5 and the wave period t z section 2 7 6 the uncertainty variables are modeled by normal distributions χ s g and χ s e with the estimated bias and coefficient of variation cov the bias is the mean value of the random variable μ χ and is defined as the ratio between the true and estimated values of the variable the cov is defined as σ χ μ χ where σ χ is the standard deviation of the variable 2 7 2 uncertainty in the calculated static load effect χ s g the characteristic load effect from gravity s c g is calculated based on the maximum expected weight of the transported object the load distribution between the supports depends on the elasticity of the supports fabrication tolerances etc the load distribution can also depend on the ballast condition of the barge after the transported object is set down such effects are not included here and the weight is simply divided between four supports the transported object is usually weighed upon completion hence prior to transport the actual weight is known with high accuracy assuming a conservative approach in the design phase i e the estimated values are on the high side a bias in the weight is expected in the case studies χ s g is modeled as a normally distributed variable with a mean value of 0 95 the cov is set equal to 0 1 2 7 3 uncertainty in the calculated dynamic wave induced load effects χ s e the uncertainty in the calculated dynamic wave induced load effects χ s e depends on the wave data as discussed above the calculated motions of the transport vessel χ s e 1 and the method for calculating the structural load effects due to vessel motions χ s e 2 the last two items are included here and the resulting uncertainty is estimated by χ s e χ s e 1 χ s e 2 in natskår and steen 2013 the support forces calculated from motion analyses and from model tests were compared and a bias was estimated by comparing the standard deviations and maximum values of the response the bias was estimated at 0 75 0 94 bias 1 i e conservative analysis results for the maximum roll angle and 0 65 0 8 for the vertical support force depending on the type of analysis these model tests were performed in severe seas some of the sea states had very steep waves and there were nonlinear effects that limited the barge response in the model tests water on deck etc in the current study we need a bias representative of all sea states included in the long term distribution hence for χ s e 1 a moderate bias of 0 9 is chosen for the given environmental conditions using a linear analysis with a stochastic linearization of viscous roll damping the uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a cov of 0 1 the uncertainties in the calculated load effects χ s e 2 are assumed to be the same as for the static load effect i e a mean value of 0 95 and cov of 0 1 see above note that even if a simple statistical uncertainty model suffices for beam seas in a real case the uncertainty could depend on the ballast condition the relative stiffness between the supports and the wave direction the resulting uncertainty χ s e has a mean value of 0 86 and a cov of 0 14 for the product of two statistically independent variables χ χ 1 χ 2 the mean value is μ χ μ χ 1 μ χ 2 and the coefficient of variation is cov cov χ 1 2 cov χ 2 2 see e g melchers and beck 2018 2 7 4 wave induced load effects s e the wave induced load effect is derived from vessel motion calculated by potential theory for a 3 d panel model of the barge using the computer program package sesam 2019 in principle the barge is subjected to wind seas and swells however the period of swell is much larger than the roll period which is of main importance and the dynamic effects will be limited moreover the accelerations in long periodic motions are relatively small hence the current study considers wind sea only the analysis is based on linear theory and nonlinear roll damping due to eddy making is not included in the hydrodynamic analysis this damping is included by stochastic linearization of the quadratic viscous damping the wave induced seafastening loads are calculated by requiring dynamic equilibrium of the transported object exposed to the barge motions accelerations calculated in the hydrodynamic analysis see natskår and steen 2013 because the calculation of forces is based on a simple equilibrium of the cargo uncertainties arise due to the interaction between the cargo and the barge however if the center of gravity is close to or at the geometric center and we consider beam seas such a simplified approach can produce good results in principle this calculation also involves uncertainties in s g and s e as mentioned in sec section 2 7 3 the statistical distribution of the individual response maxima is defined as follows see e g naess and moan 2013 8 f s e s e 0 0 f s e h s t z s e h s t z f h s t z h s t z d h s d t z where f s e h s t z s e h s t z is the cumulative distribution of the extreme value for the individual support force conditional on the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period and f h s t z h s t z is the joint probability density function for the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period the distribution of the individual response maxima within a sea state i e for a given h s and t z is assumed to be the extreme value distribution according to the rayleigh distribution 9 f s e h s t z s e h s t z 1 exp 1 2 s e σ s e h s t z 2 n h s t z σ s e h s t z is the standard deviation or the rms value of the support force numerical values are given in the case studies in section 3 1 5 the total number of response cycles during marine operation for a given sea state is n h s t z t r ν 0 h s t z where t r is the duration of the operation and ν 0 h s t z is the mean zero upcrossing rate of the response the mean zero upcrossing rate of the vertical support force in beam sea conditions is practically independent of the significant wave height for the barge transport we consider in the case studies below hence n t z t r ν 0 t z where ν 0 t z can be estimated by fitting e g an exponential curve to the actual upcrossing rate see section 3 1 6 in reality the duration of a marine operation is a stochastic variable however here it is treated as a deterministic value the joint probability density function of h s and t z is expressed by the relation 10 f h s t z h s t z f t z h s t z h s f h s h s 2 7 5 the significant wave height the statistical description of the significant wave height depends on the category i e if the operation is weather restricted or weather unrestricted operations with a planned duration of not more than 72 h not more than 96 h when contingency time is included can be defined as weather restricted the significant wave height to be used in the design of the operation h s d e s i g n also called the operational limit h s o p l i m is defined chosen during the planning of the operation the operation can commence when the forecasted significant wave height is lower than the operational limit with a defined safety margin this is the alpha factor method where h s f o r e c a s t α h s d e s i g n and α 1 α is given in dnvgl st n001 2020 operations with planned durations longer than 72 h must be defined as weather unrestricted and the design significant wave height to be used in the planning of the operation is based on long term wave data statistics weather forecasts are still received regularly typically every 12 h but the operation cannot be aborted one example is that of overseas transport for both categories the inherent uncertainties in the significant wave height are accounted for for weather restricted operations there are uncertainties in the forecasted h s and the forecasted wave period t z the forecasted wave period is not used in this study instead the statistical distribution of t z conditional on h s is used see section 2 7 6 for weather unrestricted operations we have data uncertainty in h s and fundamental variability in the long term distribution long term data for sea states are subject to statistical uncertainty when the dataset is limited to only a few years moan et al 2005 the present study is based on 60 years of hindcast data section 3 1 8 and the statistical uncertainty is therefore neglected for weather restricted operations the significant wave height is based on weather forecasts the actual true significant wave height during a marine operation is described by a lognormal distribution see e g bury 1999 as follows 11 f h s h s 1 h s σ ln h s 2 π exp 1 2 ln h s μ ln h s σ ln h s 2 the parameters in the distribution are see e g natskår et al 2015 12a μ ln h s ln h s f c μ ln χ 12b σ ln h s σ ln χ where h s f c is the maximum forecasted significant wave height during the operation given in meters the stochastic variable χ represents the uncertainty in the weather forecasts χ h s h i n d c a s t h s f o r e c a s t numerical values are given in table 6 long term statistics are used for weather unrestricted operations because the significant wave height cannot be based on weather forecasts the significant wave height is assumed to follow a three parameter weibull distribution see e g bury 1999 as follows 13 f h s h 0 if h c b a h c a b 1 exp h c a b if h c from this distribution it follows that p h s c 0 i e h s is never lower than c the parameters a b and c are calculated based on hindcast data see section 3 1 8 the value of the parameter c is on the order of 0 5 1 0 m and the probability density function represents the wave heights that play a role in the calculation of the p f well hindcast data are used in this study to quantify the uncertainty in weather forecasts and to calculate the long term distribution of the significant wave height as mentioned above the statistical uncertainty of the long term sea state data is neglected the uncertainty in the forecasted significant wave height is estimated by comparing one year of forecast and hindcast data the limited duration and uncertainty in the hindcast data may therefore affect the results the accuracy of the hindcast significant wave height compared to measurements was studied by haver 1994 the difference between the hindcast and measured h s had a standard deviation of 1 15 m based on 168 storm events with h s h i n d c a s t 7 5 m no clear dependence on the wave height was observed however we are mainly interested in lower wave heights typically with h s values of 3 5 m and assuming that the accuracy has improved over the years the uncertainty is expected to be lower in our case according to brooker et al 2004 a scatter index i e the standard deviation of the difference between measured and modeled h s values normalized by the mean of the observations of 10 15 for significant wave heights from hindcast data is representative of modern hindcasts compared with measured values a comparison study of hindcast data with measurements was performed by bruserud and haver 2016 they found the hindcast significant wave height from nora10 as described by reistad et al 2011 to be slightly conservative compared with measurements however the difference was small and they did not correct the hindcast significant wave height the same trend was observed by haakenstad et al 2020 when comparing nora10 data with measurements for the north sea the norwegian sea and the barents sea the conclusion for our study is that even if the hindcast values are not exact the deviation from the measured h s values is moderate and the uncertainty in hindcast h s is not included in the current study 2 7 6 wave period the wave period is described in the reliability analyses by a lognormal distribution as shown by e g bitner gregersen and haver 1991 the distribution of the mean zero crossing period t z follows a lognormal distribution that is conditional on h s 14 f t z h s t z h s 1 t z σ ln t z h s 2 π exp 1 2 ln t z μ ln t z h s σ ln t z h s 2 the mean value and the standard deviation for ln t z are calculated as follows 15a μ ln t z h s a 1 a 2 h s a 3 15b σ ln t z h s b 1 b 2 e b 3 h s the parameters a i and b i i 1 2 3 are estimated from hindcast data and are given in section 3 1 9 2 8 resistance modeling χ r 2 8 1 design of the grillage and seafastening a typical grillage beam structure for the transport of heavy objects is shown in fig 2 the support point for the transported object is located on the box girder which has internal reinforcement at the support point for the transported object the box girder transfers the load to two i girders at each of the ends of the i girders there is an end plate welded to the deck of the transport vessel in line with the longitudinal bulkheads or the barge side see fig 2 we consider the structural capacity of the grillage beams and the attachment points bulkheads in the transport vessel the uncertainty in the capacity is divided into uncertainty in the material parameters and model uncertainty 2 8 2 uncertainty in the calculated capacity of the grillage beams the grillage beams are exposed to shear force and bending moment which for the example shown in fig 2 can be found by hand calculations for more complicated structures a linear finite element analysis would typically be run the model uncertainty in the shear and bending capacity typically has a mean value of 1 0 and a cov of 0 05 see jcss 2000 table 3 9 1 the uncertainty in the material parameters i e the yield stress can generally be modeled with a mean value range of 1 05 to 1 15 and a cov range of 0 05 to 0 1 see e g moan 1995 we calculate the bias and cov according to jcss 2000 for steel with a characteristic yield stress the 5 fractile equal to 355 mpa typical steel quality for seafastening steel the mean value is 378 mpa i e a bias of 1 07 the cov is 0 07 the resulting uncertainty including both the model and material uncertainty has a mean value of 1 07 and a cov of 0 09 this model with a lognormal distribution represents χ r for the grillage beams 2 8 3 uncertainty in the calculated capacity of the bulkhead bulkheads with stiffeners and web frames are shown in fig 3 the capacity of the stiffened plate panels can be calculated according to e g dnv rp c201 2010 for in plane loading parallel to the stiffeners and lateral loading on the plate plane the model uncertainty in the calculated capacity can be described by a lognormal distribution with a mean value of 1 21 and a cov of 0 15 see ssc 433 2004 table 5 1 we are not aware of such information for a load acting perpendicular to the stiffeners we discuss two failure modes for stiffened plate panels local buckling of plates between stiffeners and failure of stiffeners uncertainties related to any reduced capacity due to corrosion or local damage are not included here the bulkhead is loaded from the wing plate welded to the deck see fig 3 the capacity of the plate e g in k n m is not uniform over the plate width b toward the edge buckling does not occur and the plate can be loaded until yield see fig 4 in the central part of the plate the capacity is limited by the buckling of the plate the capacity of the bulkhead can be formulated as follows 16 n f y t b e f f f k t b b e f f this capacity formula is similar to eq 6 6 in dnv rp c201 2010 t is the plate thickness the first term represents the full yield capacity at the plate edges over a length b e f f 2 at each end and the second term represents the buckling capacity over the central part of the plate with length b b e f f the buckling stress capacity f k is calculated by idealizing the central part of the plate as a column with length s where s is the center distance between the horizontal stiffeners the buckling capacity of the central part of the plate is for reduced slenderness λ c 2 0 see eq 6 7 in dnv rp c201 2010 calculated similar to buckling curve a in e g en 1993 1 1 2005 in this calculation the plate edges are assumed to be simply supported i e they are free to rotate in reality there is some restrained rotation of the plate edge and the assumption that the edges are free to rotate is conservative hence in reliability analyses the bias is larger than one the purpose of the stiffeners is to provide support for bulkhead plates of size b s i e to prevent global buckling of the bulkhead plates imperfections from fabrication result in a lateral load on the stiffeners the loading mechanism is shown in fig 5 where the fabrication tolerance for the misalignment of one stiffener relative to the adjacent stiffeners is given the lateral load i e out of plane load on the stiffeners can be calculated from eq 7 8 in dnv rp c201 2010 the lateral load is resisted by a shear force and bending moment in the stiffeners which indicates that standard measures for the uncertainty in the capacity model could be applied however the load is not the vertical load applied directly on the bulkhead but a lateral load calculated as a function of the vertical load the geometry of the stiffeners etc assuming that the uncertainty in the lateral load is accounted for through the variables χ s g and χ s e the resulting bias and cov of the calculated stiffener capacity are assumed to follow the uncertainty for ordinary beams in bending see section 2 8 2 to summarize the bulkhead capacity for a vertical load is limited by yielding at the edges of the bulkhead plate buckling in the mid part of the bulkhead plate and buckling of the stiffeners due to second order deformation we conclude that the capacity model for the bulkheads should not be different from the case with axial loading parallel to the stiffeners or the case of lateral loading the model uncertainty is therefore taken from ssc 433 2004 as lognormally distributed with a mean value of 1 21 and a cov of 0 15 similar to the steps performed in section 2 8 2 the mean value of the yield stress is calculated according to jcss 2000 for steel with a characteristic yield stress equal to 235 mpa typical steel quality for barges the bias is found to be 1 04 and the cov is 0 07 the uncertainty in the calculated capacity of the bulkhead is modeled with a mean value of 1 25 and a cov of 0 17 2 8 4 capacity of the transported object the capacity of the transported object should be checked sea transport is typically included in the engineering phase where it is checked together with the in place condition however those analyses are not included here 2 8 5 resulting uncertainty in the structural capacity based on the previous discussion the uncertainty of the grillage beams is modeled with a bias of 1 07 and a cov of 0 09 the bulkhead uncertainty is described by a bias of 1 25 and a cov of 0 17 despite the higher bias the bulkhead is associated with a larger failure probability because of the larger cov hence the values for the bulkhead are used in the case studies see table 4 a sensitivity study with variable bias and cov is included in section 3 6 2 9 target reliability level during temporary phases decision making relating to the reliability of structures involves an assessment of the reliability as outlined above as well as evaluating the reliability in view of a target reliability level this section deals with the basis for establishing a target reliability level in transport operations using towed barges the barges are usually unmanned and only material damage is considered a severe structural failure resulting in the total loss of the handled object will lead to economic losses due to the cost of replacing the lost asset it could also be expensive to recover the lost object and scrap it in addition there could be indirect costs due to delays in the production start increased insurance costs for future projects and a loss of future contracts for the companies involved to define a target reliability level the reference period must be given for permanent offshore structures the service lifetime may range from 20 to 100 years while a marine operation typically will have a duration of a few hours up to a few weeks for a permanent structure it is convenient to relate the target reliability levels to an annual failure probability with a similar approach for marine operation the failure probability per operation depends on the duration from an insurance point of view it is more convenient to define the failure probability per operation independent of the duration for fatalities the target probabilities could be given per year but that aspect is not considered here for a structure under operating conditions the recommended target levels for annual failure probabilities depending on the consequence of failure are given e g in iso 2394 2015 the target levels for failure probability in temporary conditions can also reflect the consequences of failure the target level could for example be defined per operation based on the following aspects risk of fatalities e g whether a towed barge is manned or unmanned risk of environmental pollution risk of economic loss e g target level depending on the value of the transported object and consequential losses e g delayed start of production such an approach is not used by dnvgl st n001 2020 for marine operations instead a constant target level for the failure probability is given the probability of structural failure leading to a total loss should be less than 10 4 per operation this level was first given in the standard for insurance warranty surveys in marine operations issued by dnv in 1985 even if this threshold was not very rigorously determined it has since been accepted by the industry and insurance companies the calculated failure probabilities are sensitive to the assumptions they are based on e g the bias and cov of the variables involved so the calculated failure probability can deviate from the recommended target levels however in the case studies in section 3 the absolute probability is not of main interest it is the relative failure probability e g for various durations of an operation that is of greatest interest 3 case studies 3 1 system modeling 3 1 1 general we consider a transport barge loaded with a large object as shown in fig 1 the barge is a flat top barge with dimensions of 91 4 27 4 6 1 m and a raked bow and stern the draft is 3 m and the natural period in rolling is 8 5 s viscous roll damping is included through equivalent stochastic linearization the transported object has a length of 30 m a width of 20 m and a height of 20 m with a uniformly distributed mass and the center of gravity at the geometric center the mass is 3500 tonnes the object is placed on 2 m high grillage beams on the barge more information about this case is given by natskår and steen 2013 the following case studies are included in section 3 2 3 6 1 for weather restricted transport the failure probability is calculated as a function of the duration and the forecasted wave height the failure probabilities are calculated with and without accounting for the uncertainty in the weather forecasts case 1 2 for weather unrestricted transport the failure probabilities are compared for operations executed in july and october case 2 furthermore we calculate the failure probability for the execution of the transport in each of the months within the autumn season case 3 we then compare the use of seasonal and year round data case 4 3 the sensitivity is studied through the failure probability and the importance factors for a base case and for variations in the random variables 3 1 2 characteristic load effects in the supports the characteristic load effects in the ultimate limit state are calculated for the following three conditions 1 weather unrestricted transport worldwide 2 significant wave height limited to 6 m and 3 significant wave height limited to 4 m in a previous version of the dnv standard for marine operations dnv os h202 it was indicated that the standard acceleration for h s 6 m condition 2 in table 2 could be used for weather unrestricted transport during the summer june august in the north sea this fits well with the one year return period significant wave heights as given in table 7 below see also section 3 3 for the transported object with mass m and geometry as given in section 3 1 1 the vertical characteristic support reactions s c e due to roll motion are presented in table 2 for weather unrestricted transport and for transports with significant wave heights limited to 6 and 4 m the vertical static load effect at each support is s c g 0 25 m g because we have assumed that the center of gravity is located at the geometric center of the transported object based on these characteristic forces the required structural capacity i e r c in eq 2 is calculated it is emphasized that the environmental load effects in table 2 are not based on a stochastic analysis they are not described by a probability distribution and they do not depend on the duration of the operation they are deterministically calculated characteristic loads from a design standard to be applied directly in eq 2 3 1 3 forecast uncertainty the characteristic load effects for h s equal to 4 and 6 m are given in table 2 because of the forecast uncertainty the forecasted significant wave height prior to the start of an operation must be lower than the design h s i e the value of h s used to calculate the vessel motion and support forces the maximum allowed forecasted significant wave heights are given in table 3 3 1 4 failure function for the reliability analysis the failure function for calculating the probability of failure from eq 3 is as follows 17 g χ r r c χ s g s g χ s e s e where the parameters are defined in relation to eqs 5 and 6 information for the variables is given in table 4 3 1 5 load effects to be used in the reliability analysis the wave induced load effect in a vertical support is described by the standard deviation of the response as a function of the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period σ s e h s t z the standard deviation is represented by a response surface given as follows see e g rajashekhar and ellingwood 1993 18 σ s e h s t z a 1 t z a 2 t z h s a 3 t z h s 2 m g the standard deviation is almost linear with h s for a given t z but the quadratic roll damping makes the response slightly nonlinear hence the h s squared term is included the parameters a 1 a 2 and a 3 are calculated from 19 a i t z k i 1 k i 2 t z k i 3 t z 2 f o r i 1 2 3 the coefficients k i j for the barge in section 3 1 1 exposed to long crested seas are given in table 5 the response surface is an approximation and for periods lower than 4 s the response surface overestimates the support force however such low wave periods are relevant only for very small h s values which do not occur often in open seas furthermore even if the support force is overestimated for t z 4 m it is still small and does not contribute significantly to the failure probability the inaccuracy resulting from the fitted response surface is fairly moderate and can be represented by a variable with a mean value of 1 0 and a cov of 0 05 this inaccuracy is neglected in the case studies the most probable maximum support load which is calculated based on the standard deviation of the response from eq 18 is shown in fig 6 as a function of the significant wave height the support load is calculated using a modified version of eq 8 by integrating over t z only and solving for s from f s h s s h s e 1 3 1 6 the mean zero upcrossing rate of the response the mean zero upcrossing rate of the response is input into eq 9 the mean zero upcrossing rate is calculated from the hydrodynamic analysis and an exponential curve is fitted to the calculated results as follows 20 ν 0 t z 0 12 0 87 e 0 64 t z where t z is given in seconds and the unit for ν 0 is s 1 this curve represents the mean zero upcrossing rate well the values from eq 20 are within 2 of the mean zero upcrossing rate from the hydrodynamic analysis for a large value of t z ν 0 converges toward 0 12 s 1 this is the natural frequency of the barge in roll 3 1 7 forecast uncertainty of the significant wave height the parameters μ ln h s and σ ln h s to be used in eq 12 are shown in table 6 as a function of the duration of the operation 3 1 8 long term distribution of the significant wave height the long term distribution of the significant wave height is needed for weather unrestricted operations and is given by the weibull distribution in eq 13 in this paper we use parameters representative of the northern north sea the parameters are based on hindcast data see e g reistad et al 2011 from a location 150 km west of haugesund norway from september 1957 until december 2017 the weibull parameters are estimated by the method of moments see e g bury 1999 sec 17 6 the parameters for each month and for the year are given in table 7 instead of monthly data the data may be divided into seasons which are typically winter december february spring march may summer june august and autumn september november seasonal data are given in table 8 together with the weibull parameters examples of significant wave heights to be used in the design of a weather unrestricted operation with a duration of up to one month are shown there is an approximately 10 probability of exceeding these significant wave heights during a one month exposure time 3 1 9 distribution of t z conditional upon h s the conditional distribution of the mean zero crossing wave period t z is estimated from the same hindcast data as the significant wave height while the distribution for h s was estimated for each month and season the year round data are included for the distribution fitted to t z the values for the parameters in the lognormal distribution from section 2 7 6 are given in table 9 3 2 case 1 seafastening designed for weather restricted transport 3 2 1 case description for weather restricted transport we calculate the failure probability with and without considering the uncertainty in the weather forecasts according to the alpha factor method described in section 2 7 5 in section 3 2 2 we assume that the supports are designed for h s 6 m according to section 3 1 2 when the forecast uncertainty is considered according to the alpha factor method we perform the following 1 the forecasted h s to start the operation is taken according to table 3 hence the forecasted h s is equal to 4 7 m for a one day operation 4 4 m for two days and 4 3 m for three days 2 the uncertainty in the significant wave height is accounted for by applying the lognormal distribution according to eq 11 with the mean and standard deviation taken from table 6 hence μ l n χ 0 055 and σ l n χ 0 112 for a one day operation and so on 3 the failure probability is calculated according to eq 3 for 24 48 and 72 h as a quick check of how reasonable the forecast limits seem let us consider the uncertainty given in table 6 for a forecasted significant wave height of 6 m the mean value plus two standard deviations after 48 h is 1 08 2 0 13 6 m 8 m which is well above the design h s when the forecast indicates a significant wave height of no more than 4 4 m over the next two days as required above the mean value plus two standard deviations equals 5 9 m which is close to the design value hence the reduction in the design h s to reach the forecast h s seems plausible when the forecast uncertainty is not considered we do not reduce the forecast limit to start the operation the operation starts when the forecasted h s is equal to 6 m this is a hypothetical situation because it implies that the weather forecasts are exact and that the true h s is identical to the forecasted h s the purpose is to quantify the effect of forecast uncertainty under this assumption the failure probability is calculated for one two and three days all with h s 6 m in section 3 2 3 we perform the same steps as described above but in this case the seafastening system is designed for h s 4 m i e according to option 3 from section 3 1 2 we assume that the forecasted significant wave height remains constant during the operation period this condition does not necessarily hold as the forecasted h s varies over time however for moderate sea states the significant wave height can be approximately the same over several consecutive days and therefore a constant h s during the operation is chosen 3 2 2 design limit h s 6 m the maximum forecasted h s to start the transport is 4 7 m for an operation period of one day decreasing to 4 3 m for a period of 3 days according to the data in table 3 the failure probability accounting for the forecast uncertainty is shown in table 10 the failure probability without forecast uncertainty is also calculated for h s 6 m the failure probability increases with the increasing duration both with and without forecast uncertainty because the maximum forces extreme values increase over time for a given h s when forecast uncertainty is included there is an additional effect because the forecast uncertainty also increases with time however the increased uncertainty is counteracted by the reduced forecasted h s for longer operations in fact the reduced startup criterion accounts for the uncertainty and results in a lower failure probability when the forecast uncertainty is included 3 2 3 design limit h s 4 m in table 11 the failure probability accounting for forecast uncertainty is calculated for a forecasted wave height equal to the operational limit from table 3 the failure probability without forecast uncertainty is also calculated for h s 4 m the results compare well with the previous design case table 10 3 3 case 2 weather unrestricted transport executed in july and october we now consider weather unrestricted transport where the grillage and seafastening have been designed according to the weather unrestricted option described in section 3 1 2 the failure probabilities are calculated for a duration of three days to three weeks with the assumption that the operation is executed in july or october the failure probabilities are shown in table 12 note that the effect of the uncertainty in the weather forecasts is not included here the duration is more than three days and the operation does not depend on weather forecasts but on long term statistical data the failure probability differs substantially depending on the time of year p f is 18 times higher in october than in july the failure probability increases slightly with the increasing duration and doubles as the duration increases from 3 to 21 days as mentioned in section 3 1 2 dnv os h202 allows the grillage and seafastening to be designed for h s 6 m for weather unrestricted summer transport operation in the north sea the failure probability would then be 1 8 1 0 5 for a three day transport operation instead of 3 7 1 0 6 in table 12 increasing to 3 4 1 0 5 for 21 days hence there is a better balance between transport operations in july and october p f is four times higher in october than in july 3 4 case 3 the influence of the startup date within a season for the case in section 3 3 we study how the startup date within the season i e the month within a season in which the operation is executed affects the failure probability let us use the statistics for the autumn i e september november the failure probabilities based on the monthly and seasonal statistics from tables 7 and 8 are shown in table 13 the failure probability is 1 5 times higher if the analysis is based on data from november instead of seasonal data if the analysis is based on data for september p f is less than half that calculated for the season 3 5 case 4 the effect of seasonal versus year round data iso 19901 6 2009 requires that the weather conditions used for the design of weather unrestricted operations shall reflect the statistical extremes for the area and season concerned according to dnvgl st n001 2020 seasons may be accounted for when planning sea voyages we now discuss the effect of using seasonal or monthly versus year round statistics traditionally the use of seasonal variations has been optional the normal approach has generally been to use year round data and utilize seasonal variations when it is beneficial in the sense that the loads are reduced we again consider the weather unrestricted seafastening design from section 3 1 2 in table 14 p f is calculated based on environmental data from january and year round data the failure probability is 2 3 times higher based on january statistics than on year round data next let us assume a duration equal to seven days for example we compare p f for each month with that calculated with year round data the p f based on year round data is 8 5 1 0 5 while p f based on monthly data varies as shown in fig 7 for operations during the summer period p f is very low as expected this could be viewed as unnecessary conservatism by the use of the weather unrestricted design option for the summer period if the seafastening system is designed based on year round data and transport is performed in january the failure probability is three times the target level as mentioned in section 2 7 the duration of a marine operation is actually a stochastic variable that has been assumed to be a deterministic variable in the structural reliability analysis the duration could be modeled as a stochastic variable and the revised failure probabilities could be calculated however from the case studies above it is observed that p f is not very sensitive to the duration so it is reasonable to model the duration as a fixed variable 3 6 sensitivity study the importance factors see section 2 6 2 for two selected cases one weather restricted and one weather unrestricted are shown in table 15 in the weather restricted case the seafastening system is designed for a significant wave height equal to 4 m and the operational duration is three days 72 h the forecasted h s is 2 7 m from table 3 in the weather unrestricted case the duration is seven days and the significant wave height is based on year round long term statistics the vertical support was designed for weather unrestricted transport see section 3 1 2 in addition to the base cases we consider alternatives with changes in bias and cov on the capacity and one alternative with increased cov on the uncertainty in the calculated dynamic load effect details on the alternatives and the importance factors as well as the reliability index and the failure probability are given in table 15 the importance factor for the structural capacity χ r dominates in all cases for weather unrestricted operation the wave induced load s e contributes significantly more to the failure probability than for weather restricted operation as expected the failure probability increases when the bias on χ r is reduced and when the cov of χ s e is increased in alternative 4 an increase in the cov for the capacity leads to a substantial increase in the failure probability the main observation is that the uncertainty in the structural capacity dominates in the structural reliability analyses the capacity depends on the structural design and fabrication for actual transport and a focus on this aspect is suggested in the planning of grillage and seafastening in connection with the transport of heavy objects 4 results and discussion this paper analyzes the implied failure probability of a seafastening structure designed by the use of standard motion criteria for a barge transport operation incorporating the influence of weather forecasts the duration of the transport and the time of year two categories of marine operations have been considered i e weather restricted and weather unrestricted operations in the first category the significant wave height is given by weather forecasts and the uncertainty in the forecasts is accounted for in the second category the significant wave height is based on long term statistics regarding the northern north sea the motion analysis of the transport barge is limited to situations with wind generated seas acting in one main direction in our case rolling of the barge dominates the loading and the load effects in the supports are overestimated more realistic modeling would include wind generated sea and swell with different mean directions such an extension of the analysis would require a more detailed assessment of the model uncertainty related to such conditions than is included in the present analysis but may be interesting to include in future studies the sensitivity analyses show that the structural capacity has the largest importance factors of the parameters examined table 15 consequently the failure probabilities are sensitive to variations in the bias and cov for the structural capacity the structural capacity of a bulkhead with horizontal stiffeners exposed to vertical loading should be studied for example by a more detailed load effect calculation and detailed fe analyses of the support points to reduce the uncertainty in this variable for a weather restricted operation the failure probabilities are calculated by the following two methods i e by assuming that the decision to start sea transport is made accounting for the uncertainty in the weather forecasts and not accounting for the uncertainty in the weather forecasts i e assuming perfect forecasts the reduction in the maximum allowed significant wave height in the alpha factor method compensates for the forecast uncertainty such that p f is lower when the forecast uncertainty is included than when it is not see table 10 the failure probabilities shown in table 10 are sensitive to the input parameters and they are somewhat higher than 10 4 per operation however the comparison of the probabilities not the absolute values is of main interest here the failure probability for a weather unrestricted operation depends on the time of year the operation is executed for example case studies indicate that for a given seafastening design the failure probability is 1 5 times higher using environmental data for november instead of seasonal data for the autumn september november the failure probability calculated using statistical data for january is three times higher than that calculated using year round data and the failure probability is 15 20 times higher in october than in july for a design based on standard motion criteria the differences in the failure probabilities are not dramatic in the first two examples a consequence of the first bullet point is that a marine operation executed in november may be designed based on seasonal data for the autumn and not necessarily the actual month furthermore an operation executed in january designed for year round data will have a failure probability equal to three times the target value which is still not dramatic in the third bullet point it is assumed that the standard weather unrestricted criterion has been applied for the design of the grillage and seafastening while the failure probability is equal to the target level for october transport this probability is much lower for summer transport introducing additional conservatism conservatism is acceptable but results in an increased fabrication cost an alternative to an unrestricted design could be to estimate the design sea state for the geographic area time of year and duration of the operation and to design the grillage and seafastening for that sea state e g the h s 6 m or h s 4 m criterion in dnvgl st n001 2020 for weather unrestricted transport operations 5 conclusions and recommendations based on the study the following conclusions are drawn for a weather restricted operation the reduction in the wave height to account for the forecast uncertainty compensates adequately for the uncertainty inherent in the forecasted significant wave height and is a good approach with respect to the failure probability for weather unrestricted transport the use of seasonal or annual data affects the results the use of seasonal data is optional in dnvgl st n001 2020 where seasonal data may be accounted for the use of seasons could also be mandatory e g as required by iso 19901 6 2009 which requires that the statistical extremes for the season concerned be reflected it is recommended that this aspect be considered for inclusion in future design standards the calculated failure probabilities in the study span a large range as a result of seasonal variations however the calculated probabilities are of the same order of magnitude as the target value indicated by dnvgl st n001 of 10 4 per operation for the north sea the failure probability obtained by using the simplified design criteria compares well with the target reliability level however because the uncertainty in strength dominates and the strength depends on temporary solutions for each transport operation a focus on this aspect is recommended in the integrity management of the grillage and seafastening in connection with transport of heavy objects in the present work the design of the module supports is based on motion from a design standard it would be of interest for future work to study the reliability level of a transport designed according to criteria from other design standards or by vessel motions obtained from the 3d panel model the effect of wind seas and swell with different mean

20488,a new analytical flexural solution based on double finite integral fourier transform and trigonometric series differentiation procedures was developed for thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plates resting on winkler elastic foundation in air and water the effect of material anisotropy coupled hydro mechanical loads and underwater floor inclination angle which were overlooked in the literature is considered in this study furthermore the predetermination of the shape deformation function is not required in our proposed analytical solution which offers more accurate results for the particular cases where the plate made of isotropic material is in air the analytical results are compared with and verified by the literature literature is lacking to investigate thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plates with free edges and under hydro mechanical load hence our analytical results are compared with and verified by numerical analysis employing finite element method fem the analytical results provide excellent agreement with both literature and the proposed fem fem is shown to be time intensive since the results converge after 60 seconds runtime with

rapidly growing due to their exceptional properties such as enhanced stiffness lower weight high toughness and excellent durability panduro and mantari 2016 altunsaray 2017 gulizzi et al 2020 multi layered composite structures possess enhanced stiffness to weight and high strength to weight ratios which make them excellent candidate for numerous engineering problems across the fields of aerospace automotive civil electrical mechanical structural and biomedical engineering vattré and pan 2021 zhang et al 2017 khosravani et al 2019 fiber composite hybrid laminates or fiber metal laminates are light weight structures which exhibit enhanced mechanical properties combining advantages of metal laminates and fiber reinforced composites they have numerous applications in aerospace and transportation fields chen et al 2020 this is why their essential engineering design that is accompanied by diverse loading and environmental conditions is gaining widespread importance proper comprehension of advanced materials such as composites under cyclic loading is necessary in many engineering applications rahmanpanah et al 2020 mouloodi et al 2020a in the following paragraph some of the latest elastic deformation analysis of engineering structures made of isotropic and composite materials that undergo various loading and environmental conditions is discussed a novel hybrid energy transformation procedure was developed that allowed constructing a mathematical link between the derived energy functional framework and a simpler engineering method e g mindlin reissner lee and hodges 2018 that method assists in the elimination of redundant mathematical complexities and physical interpretation of boundary conditions in the mechanical analysis of laminated composite shells traditional three dimensional 3d anisotropic elasticity theory and simplified two dimensional 2d plate models bring overwhelming complexity to the derived plate models and are only well suited for subject specific cases yifeng et al 2015 this diminishes their high fidelity practical application to composite structures and as such a hybrid transformation procedure is recommended that allows the elimination of partial derivative terms on the energy functional space to obtain a simpler 2d generalized stiffness matrices for the mindlin reissner model yifeng et al 2015 a novel hybridizing fibers approach that presented an experimental protocol of reinforcing material surrounding high modulus fibers was adopted to enhance compressive strength behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composites makeev et al 2019 that approach was shown to be motivational in obtaining a desired composite structure with an enhanced compressive strength a generalized quasi 3d higher order shear deformation theory hosdt was employed to analyze free vibration problems associated with functionally graded composite plates placed on an elastic foundation mantari et al 2014 in that study the fundamental motion equations were obtained based on hamilton s principle and were solved via the navier solution the fundamental frequencies were then obtained by solving eigenvalue problems with proper validation of the model with literature tehrani and kabir investigated the nonlinear load deflection behavior of a composite plate integrated with shape memory alloys smas and under a lateral pressure and thermo mechanical loading tavousitehrani and kabir 2018 the plate was also resting on an elastic foundation li et al proposed a novel superposition approach to calculate flexural bending of thin plates with rectangular shape all four free edges of which were resting on winkler elastic foundation li et al 2013 winkler model is the simplest model for analyzing elastic foundations and is represented via a combination of separated springs with a constant stiffness flexural responses of multi layered composite plates resting on an elastic foundation and under uniformly distributed load were investigated in a study by lai et al lal et al 2007 the influence of random material properties as well as random elastic foundation stiffness parameters was also considered in that study the responses of a system under load will become random due to considerable uncertainties triggered by variations in mechanical properties and geometry hence stochastic analysis of thin plates placed on an elastic foundation is essential bahmyari and khedmati 2017 several theories of composite laminated plates such as classical plate theory cpt adopted for multi layered composite plates first order mindlin reissner theory and reddy hosdt were employed to analyze multi layered composite plates placed on an elastic foundation akavci 2005 the results of their proposed method showed good agreement as comparison with the results of published literature rithz method was adopted to analyze bending of an isotropic rectangular plate under simple support constraints and placed on an elastic foundation considered as winkler model with linear variation stiffness and then the results of analytical method were compared against the fe counterparts hien and quang 2019 rouzegar and sharifpoor analyzed thick isotropic plates placed on elastic foundation based on two variable refined plate theory they examined the effects of several loading conditions foundation modulus and plate thickness rouzegar and sharifpoor 2015 semi analytical approach based on extended form of kantorovich method was studied by nik and tahani in order to find flexural solutions of multi layered composite plates under transverse loads and with arbitrary lamination and boundary condition nik and tahani 2009 xu et al employed the method of double finite integral transform in order to investigate the flexural response of thin multi layered composite plates with consideration of several boundary conditions problem the strategy in that study provided a more sensible approach to quantify mechanical responses of the plates since the predetermination of the deflection function was not required zhang et al 2020 the literature survey reveals a major gap in an investigation into flexural response of thick multi layered composite rectangular plates resting on winkler elastic foundation and under hydro mechanical loads the effect of material anisotropy and coupled hydro mechanical induced elastic deformation was overlooked in the published literature as such this research aims to develop a new analytical solution to obtain the elastic flexure of this class of engineering structures based on double finite integral fourier transform and trigonometric series differentiation procedures the proposed analytical solution does not relay on predetermination of a shape and or trial function and is highly efficient as compared with fem based on the convergence study this proposed method can be a useful tool for design engineers when both the accuracy of results and efficiency are simultaneously sought 2 governing 3d hydro mechanical bending equations and analytical procedures classical plate theory cpt which is only applicable to thin plates neglects the tsd effect and is not suitable to analyze thick plates in reality numerous laminated composite hybrid plates are considered thick and therefore their tsd effect should not be disregarded unlike isotropic materials some quantities of the in plane composite hybrid plate stiffness are dominated by the in plane fibers placement and the plate transverse shear stiffness is dominated by the properties of the composite matrix as such the tsd is predominant when a thick composite hybrid plate is subjected to elastic deformation vinson 2005 in this study eqs 1 3 were derived appendix a based on the equations associated with the mindlin reissner theory for thick orthotropic rectangular plates vinson 2005 this is adopted in order to reflect the effect of hydro mechanical loads in a thick multi layered composite hybrid plate under pressure loads and concentrated loads that is submerged in water we assumed that a thick multi layered composite hybrid plate whose entire edges are free is resting on winkler elastic foundation and

functions associated with the mid plane lateral displacement and tsd rotation components of a thick multi layered composite hybrid plate placed on winkler elastic foundation and submerged in water the finite number of fourier series terms m 0 1 2 and n 0 1 2 leads to convergence and hence accurate results 4 proposed analytical solution verification convergence study and case study examples this section provides various case study examples in which the results associated with the proposed analytical solution are compared with and verified by the published benchmark results available in the literature however there is no study in the literature to consider thick multi layered composite hybrid plates with all edges free that is placed on winkler elastic foundation furthermore no study has to date taken into account the effect of coupled hydro mechanical load and inclined underwater floor as such we have relied upon numerical implementation with fem using abaqus package to validate the present analytical solution when the plate is made of multi layered composite material and is submerged in water a programming package such as matlab and fortran can be used to solve the four linear simultaneous multivariable series equations eqs 53 56 to give confidence in efficiency of the present method small amounts for m and n are initially selected and the analytical results convergence are inspected by comparing with 1 the results in the literature and 2 the results obtained from employing fem an 8 node doubly curved thick shell reduced integration is used as the element type in abaqus the convergence results provide excellent agreement with the literature and fem apart from the high cost of fe packages such as abaqus the case study examples demonstrate that the convergence can easily be achieved through small values for m and n as opposed to fem where mesh refinement leads to results convergence only after 12159 elements are defined as a result the proposed analytical solution can deliver highly accurate results within 5 seconds of runtime as compared with fem which demonstrates a computational time of approximately 1 minute per case study example in the following

elastic foundation is considered the plate s layer configuration is al 90 0 90 0 90 al each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m in this example the effect of aspect ratio on elastic bending is investigated to do so three plates with the dimensions a b 1 m a 2 m and b 1 m a 3 m and b 1 m are considered the loading condition is same as case study 4 comparison of the 3d elastic bending

when the elastic foundation is made of sandstone is shown in fig 5 4 7 case study 7 in this example the elastic bending of thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plates of various sizes resting on winkler elastic foundation in water is investigated the plate is made of al and cfrp materials with the layer configuration 0 90 0 al 0 90 0 each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m the plates are submerged in water and are placed on an inclined surface see fig 1 no mechanical load is considered for this case study and thus only the hydrostatic pressure is considered the distance along the x axis from the edge of the submerged thick plate placed on the inclined floor to the free water surface is x o 50 m the winkler foundation modulus k e 30 mn m3 the effect of inclination angle and plate s geometry are both taken into account and the results are presented in table 5 good agreement between the proposed analytical results and fem is observed since the hydrostatic pressure is uniformly applied the effect of normal and shear stresses are negligible furthermore the transverse shear deformation σ yz is also equal to zero due to the hydrostatic pressure being constant along the y axis and merely fluctuating along the x axis the effect of underwater floor inclination angle on the transverse shear deformation σ xz at the center of the plate is shown in fig 6 the changes in the geometrical dimensions are shown to be irrespective of σ xz the 3d elastic bending deformation of the submerged thick composite rectangular plate of various sizes resting on winkler elastic

between the results is observed 4 9 case study 9 consider a thick multi layer composite hybrid rectangular plate placed on winkler elastic foundation the plate is made of al and cfrp materials submerged in water and placed on horizontal surface thus the magnitude of the uniformly distributed hydrostatic pressure is constant see fig 1 the plate s dimensions are a 3 m b 1 m and the layers configuration is 0 90 0 al 0 90 0 each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m the winkler elastic foundation modulus is k e 30 mn m3 this time the effect of layer thickness on elastic bending deformation in air and water is investigated a point load f a b 2 100 kpa is applied to the plate and the results obtained from the present analytical study and fem are shown in fig 8 5 concluding remarks in this research a new analytical solution was developed to obtain the elastic bending deformation of thick multi layered composite hybrid plates with rectangular shape and that were placed on winkler elastic foundation the effect of hydro mechanical loads was taken into account when the plate was in air or submerged in water double finite integral fourier transform and trigonometric series differentiation procedures were utilized to derive the exact elasticity equations of thick multi layered composite rectangular plates submerged in water the convergence study associated with the proposed analytical solution was conducted and the analytical results were then compared with and verified by 1 the published results in the literature and 2 author implemented fem using abaqus excellent agreement between the results was observed the analytical results demonstrated that the proposed analytical solution is highly accurate and provides more efficient results as compared with fem therefore it can be used as a benchmark solution and guideline by design engineers to calculate the elastic bending of complex engineering structures made of advanced composite materials and submerged in water due to limitation of the proposed analytical solution to static bending deformation of thick cross ply composite hybrid plate laminates with symmetrical stacking sequence the future work is planned to investigate the effects of symmetry and asymmetry lamination and bending twisting coupling on elastic deformation of laminated composite and or composite hybrid plates shells subjected to more general loading conditions such as static dynamic and bucking loads a drawback associated with the use of fem was associated with its time intensive simulation it is recommended to employ intelligent models in which fem and machine learning algorithms are coupled to promptly and accurately estimate the mechanical deformation stress and strain distribution in complex nonlinear and composite structures rahmanpanah et al 2020 mouloodi et al 2020a mouloodi et al 2019 mouloodi et al 2020b for the future studies the authors are also aiming to employ artificial neural networks to be designed and trained to take its input information from fem to then directly output the mechanical deformation stress and strain distributions bypassing the fem calculation process this will offer novel computational

20488,a new analytical flexural solution based on double finite integral fourier transform and trigonometric series differentiation procedures was developed for thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plates resting on winkler elastic foundation in air and water the effect of material anisotropy coupled hydro mechanical loads and underwater floor inclination angle which were overlooked in the literature is considered in this study furthermore the predetermination of the shape deformation function is not required in our proposed analytical solution which offers more accurate results for the particular cases where the plate made of isotropic material is in air the analytical results are compared with and verified by the literature literature is lacking to investigate thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plates with free edges and under hydro mechanical load hence our analytical results are compared with and verified by numerical analysis employing finite element method fem the analytical results provide excellent agreement with both literature and the proposed fem fem is shown to be time intensive since the results converge after 60 seconds runtime with definition of 12159 elements during mesh refinement yet the proposed analytical method demonstrates that the convergence can easily be achieved after 5 seconds runtime through selecting small values

rapidly growing due to their exceptional properties such as enhanced stiffness lower weight high toughness and excellent durability panduro and mantari 2016 altunsaray 2017 gulizzi et al 2020 multi layered composite structures possess enhanced stiffness to weight and high strength to weight ratios which make them excellent candidate for numerous engineering problems across the fields of aerospace automotive civil electrical mechanical structural and biomedical engineering vattré and pan 2021 zhang et al 2017 khosravani et al 2019 fiber composite hybrid laminates or fiber metal laminates are light weight structures which exhibit enhanced mechanical properties combining advantages of metal laminates and fiber reinforced composites they have numerous applications in aerospace and transportation fields chen et al 2020 this is why their essential engineering design that is accompanied by diverse loading and environmental conditions is gaining widespread importance proper comprehension of advanced materials such as composites under cyclic loading is necessary in many engineering applications rahmanpanah et al 2020 mouloodi et al 2020a in the following paragraph some of the latest elastic deformation analysis of engineering structures made of isotropic and composite materials that undergo various loading and environmental conditions is discussed a novel hybrid energy transformation procedure was developed that allowed constructing a mathematical link between the derived energy functional framework and a simpler engineering method e g mindlin reissner lee and hodges 2018 that method assists in the elimination of redundant mathematical complexities and physical interpretation of boundary conditions in the mechanical analysis of laminated composite shells traditional three dimensional 3d anisotropic elasticity theory and simplified two dimensional 2d plate models bring overwhelming complexity to the derived plate models and are only well suited for subject specific cases yifeng et al 2015 this diminishes their high fidelity practical application to composite structures and as such a hybrid transformation procedure is recommended that allows the elimination of partial derivative terms on the energy functional space to obtain a simpler 2d generalized stiffness matrices for the mindlin reissner model yifeng et al 2015 a novel hybridizing fibers approach that presented an experimental protocol of reinforcing material surrounding high modulus fibers was adopted to enhance compressive strength behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composites makeev et al 2019 that approach was shown to be motivational in obtaining a desired composite structure with an enhanced compressive strength a generalized quasi 3d higher order shear deformation theory hosdt was employed to analyze free vibration problems associated with functionally graded composite plates placed on an elastic foundation mantari et al 2014 in that study the fundamental motion equations were obtained based on hamilton s principle and were solved via the navier solution the fundamental frequencies were then obtained by solving eigenvalue problems with proper validation of the model with literature tehrani and kabir investigated the nonlinear load deflection behavior of a composite plate integrated with shape memory alloys smas and under a lateral pressure and thermo mechanical loading tavousitehrani and kabir 2018 the plate was also resting on an elastic foundation li et al proposed a novel superposition approach to calculate flexural bending

represented via a combination of separated springs with a constant stiffness flexural responses of multi layered composite plates resting on an elastic foundation and under uniformly distributed load were investigated in a study by lai et al lal et al 2007 the influence of random material properties as well as random elastic foundation stiffness parameters was also considered in that study the responses of a system under load will become random due to considerable uncertainties triggered by variations in mechanical properties and geometry hence stochastic analysis of thin plates placed on an elastic foundation is essential bahmyari and khedmati 2017 several theories of composite laminated plates such as classical plate theory cpt adopted for multi layered composite plates first order mindlin reissner theory and reddy hosdt were employed to analyze multi layered composite plates placed on an elastic foundation akavci 2005 the results of their proposed method showed good agreement as comparison with the results of published literature rithz method was adopted to analyze bending of an isotropic rectangular plate under simple support constraints and placed on an elastic foundation considered as winkler model with linear variation stiffness and then the results of analytical method were compared against the fe counterparts hien and quang 2019 rouzegar and sharifpoor analyzed thick isotropic plates placed on elastic foundation based on two variable refined plate theory they examined the effects of several loading conditions foundation modulus and plate thickness rouzegar and sharifpoor 2015 semi analytical approach based on extended form of kantorovich method was studied by nik and tahani in order to find flexural solutions of multi layered composite plates under transverse loads and with arbitrary lamination and boundary condition nik and tahani 2009 xu et al employed the method of double finite integral transform in order to investigate the flexural response of thin multi layered composite plates with consideration of several boundary conditions problem the strategy in that study provided a more sensible approach to quantify mechanical responses of the plates since the predetermination of the deflection function was not required zhang et al 2020 the literature survey reveals a major gap in an investigation into flexural response of thick multi layered composite rectangular plates resting on winkler elastic foundation and under hydro mechanical loads the effect of material anisotropy and coupled hydro mechanical induced elastic deformation was overlooked in the published literature as such this research aims to develop a new analytical solution to obtain the elastic flexure of this class of engineering structures based on double finite integral fourier transform and trigonometric series differentiation procedures the proposed analytical solution does not relay on predetermination of a shape and or trial function and is highly efficient as compared with fem based on the convergence study this proposed method can be a useful tool for design engineers when both the accuracy of results and efficiency are simultaneously sought 2 governing 3d hydro mechanical bending equations and analytical procedures classical plate theory cpt which is only applicable to thin plates neglects the tsd effect and is not suitable to analyze thick plates in reality numerous laminated composite hybrid plates are considered thick and therefore their tsd effect should not be disregarded unlike isotropic materials some quantities of the in plane composite hybrid plate stiffness are dominated by the in plane fibers placement and the plate transverse shear stiffness is dominated by the properties of the composite matrix as such the tsd is predominant when a thick composite hybrid plate is subjected to elastic deformation vinson 2005 in this study eqs 1 3 were derived appendix a based on the equations associated with the mindlin reissner theory for thick orthotropic rectangular plates vinson 2005 this is adopted in order to reflect the effect of hydro mechanical loads in a thick multi layered composite hybrid plate under pressure loads and concentrated loads that is submerged in water we assumed that a thick multi layered composite hybrid plate whose entire edges are free is resting on winkler elastic foundation and

mechanical and hydrostatic loads the finite integral transform of hydro mechanical loads was shown in eq 25e in this section the derivation of both mechanical and fluid induced loads in eq 25e is discussed for the fluid induced load two generalized case studies are taken into account including a submerged thick multi layered composite hybrid plate resting on winkler elastic foundation and placed on 1 a horizontal floor and 2 an inclined floor with an inclination angle of θ tangent to the axis of free water surface in case of non existence of one or both of these loading conditions one

functions associated with the mid plane lateral displacement and tsd rotation components of a thick multi layered composite hybrid plate placed on winkler elastic foundation and submerged in water the finite number of fourier series terms m 0 1 2 and n 0 1 2 leads to convergence and hence accurate results 4 proposed analytical solution verification convergence study and case study examples this section provides various case study examples in which the results associated with the proposed analytical solution are compared with and verified by the published benchmark results available in the literature however there is no study in the literature to consider thick multi layered composite hybrid plates with all edges free that is placed on winkler elastic foundation furthermore no study has to date taken into account the effect of coupled hydro mechanical load and inclined underwater floor as such we have relied upon numerical implementation with fem using abaqus package to validate the present analytical solution when the plate is made of multi layered composite material and is submerged in water a programming package such as matlab and fortran can be used to solve the four linear simultaneous multivariable series equations eqs 53 56 to give confidence in efficiency of the present method small amounts for m and n are initially selected and the analytical results convergence are inspected by comparing with 1 the results in the literature and 2 the results obtained from employing fem an 8 node doubly curved thick shell reduced integration is used as the element type in abaqus the convergence results provide excellent agreement with the literature and fem apart from the high cost of fe packages such as abaqus the case study examples demonstrate that the convergence can easily be achieved through small values for m and n as opposed to fem where mesh refinement leads to results convergence only after 12159 elements are defined as a result the proposed analytical solution can deliver highly accurate results within 5 seconds of runtime as compared with fem which demonstrates a computational time of approximately 1 minute per case study example in the following

displacements associated with the proposed analytical study are compared with and validated by the results of literature and are presented in table 3 4 4 case study 4 the thick multi layered composite and composite hybrid square plates placed on winkler elastic foundation is considered the laminated plate consists of several layers made of aluminum al and or carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp materials each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m and the total thickness depends on the number of layers h k t m where k represents the number of layers the square plate s specifications are the dimensions a b 1 m and the winkler foundation modulus k e 30 mn m3 the elastic properties of al are the elasticity modulus e 11 e 22 e 33 75 22 gpa the poisson s ratios ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 33 the elastic properties of cfrp are the elasticity modulus e 11 150 gpa e 22 e 33 9 gpa the poisson s ratios ν 12 ν 13 ν 23 0 3 the shear modulus g 12 g13 7 1 gpa g 23 2 5 gpa a uniformly distributed patch load q

study are compared with and validated by fem and are presented in table 4 4 5 case study 5 a thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plate made of al and cfrp materials and placed on winkler elastic foundation is considered the plate s layer configuration is al 90 0 90 0 90 al each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m in this example the effect of aspect ratio on elastic bending is investigated to do so three plates with the dimensions a b 1 m a 2 m and b 1 m a 3 m and b 1 m are considered the loading condition is same as case study 4 comparison of the 3d elastic bending deformation results between the proposed analytical solution m n 100 and fem are shown in fig 2 the maximum and minimum lateral displacements associated with each aspect ratio are also provided in fig 2 comparison of the results shows excellent agreement the stresses distributed though the thickness of the plate is plotted in fig 3 4 6 case study 6 a thick multi layered composite hybrid square plate made of al and cfrp materials and resting on three types of winkler elastic foundations known as basalt sandstone and concrete with the foundation modulus of k e 28 kn m3 k e 22 8 23 6 kn m3 and k e 15 7 23 6 kn m3 respectively is considered for sandstone and concrete cases the average of the elastic foundation modulus is taken into account the plate has the dimensions a b 1 m and layer configuration 0 90 0 al 0 90 0 each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m a uniformly distributed patch load q 10 kpa is applied at the center of the plate on a square area x 1p y 1p 0 4 m and x 2p y 2p 0 6 m comparison of the 3d elastic bending deformation results between the proposed analytical solution m n 100 and fem are shown in fig 4 distribution of the bending twisting and shear force resultants when the elastic foundation is made of sandstone is shown in fig 5 4 7 case study 7 in this example the elastic bending of thick multi layered composite hybrid rectangular plates of various sizes resting on winkler elastic foundation in water is investigated the plate is made of al and cfrp materials with the layer configuration 0 90 0 al 0 90 0 each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m the plates are submerged in water and are placed on an inclined surface see fig 1 no mechanical load is considered for this case study and thus only the hydrostatic pressure is considered the distance along the x axis from the edge of the submerged thick plate placed on the inclined floor to the free water surface is x o 50 m the winkler foundation modulus k e 30 mn m3 the effect of inclination angle and plate s geometry are both taken into account and the results are presented in table 5 good agreement between the proposed analytical results and fem is observed since the hydrostatic pressure is uniformly applied the effect of normal and shear stresses are negligible furthermore the transverse shear deformation σ yz is also equal to zero due to the hydrostatic pressure being constant along the y axis and merely fluctuating along the x axis the effect of underwater floor inclination angle on the transverse shear deformation σ xz at the center of the plate is shown in fig 6 the changes in the geometrical dimensions are shown to be irrespective of σ xz the 3d elastic bending deformation of the submerged thick composite rectangular plate of various sizes resting on winkler elastic foundation for a particular case θ 45 is shown in fig 7 4 8 case study 8 consider a thick multi layer composite hybrid square plate placed on winkler elastic foundation the plate is made of al and cfrp materials submerged in water and placed on an inclined surface of various angles the plate s dimensions are a b 1 m and the layers configuration is 0 90 0 al 0 90 0 each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m the winkler elastic foundation modulus is k e 30 mn m3 this time the plate is under both mechanical load and hydrostatic pressure three cases of point load are considered 1 f a 0 10 kn 2 f a 2 b 2 10 kn and 3 f 1 a 0 10 kn f 2 a b 10 kn the maximum and minimum lateral deflections of the plate obtained by the present analytical study and fem are presented in table 6 excellent agreement between the results is observed 4 9 case study 9 consider a thick multi layer composite hybrid rectangular plate placed on winkler elastic foundation the plate is made of al and cfrp materials submerged in water and placed on horizontal surface thus the magnitude of the uniformly distributed hydrostatic pressure is constant see fig 1 the plate s dimensions are a 3 m b 1 m and the layers configuration is 0 90 0 al 0 90 0 each layer has the thickness t 0 05 m the winkler elastic foundation modulus is k e 30 mn m3 this time the effect of layer thickness on elastic bending deformation in air and water is investigated a point load f a b 2 100 kpa is applied to the plate and the results obtained from the present analytical study and fem are shown in fig 8 5 concluding remarks in this research a new analytical solution was developed to obtain the elastic bending deformation of thick multi layered composite hybrid plates with rectangular shape and that were placed on winkler elastic foundation the effect of hydro mechanical loads was taken into account when the plate was in air or submerged in water double finite integral fourier transform and trigonometric series differentiation procedures were utilized to derive the exact elasticity equations of thick multi layered composite rectangular plates submerged in water the convergence study associated with the proposed analytical solution was conducted and the analytical results were then compared with and verified by 1 the published results in the literature and 2 author implemented fem using abaqus excellent agreement between the results was observed the analytical results demonstrated that the proposed analytical solution is highly accurate and provides more efficient results as compared with fem therefore it can be used as a benchmark solution and guideline by design engineers to calculate the elastic bending of complex engineering structures made of advanced composite materials and submerged in water due to limitation of the proposed analytical solution to static bending deformation of thick cross ply composite hybrid plate laminates with symmetrical stacking sequence the future work is planned to investigate the effects of symmetry and asymmetry lamination and bending twisting coupling on elastic deformation of laminated composite and or composite hybrid plates shells subjected to more general loading conditions such as static dynamic and bucking loads a drawback associated with the use of fem was associated with its time intensive simulation it is recommended to employ intelligent models in which fem and machine learning algorithms are coupled to promptly and accurately estimate the mechanical deformation stress and strain distribution in complex nonlinear and composite structures

to take its input information from fem to then directly output the mechanical deformation stress and strain distributions bypassing the fem calculation process this will offer novel computational

20489,a damage detection method is presented which combines the random decrement technique rdt with long and short term memory lstm networks the method uses the measured vibration response of offshore structures subjected to random excitation and is able to locate and assess the damage with accuracy even in noisy conditions the applicability of the proposed rdt lstm method is verified through a numerical example and laboratory tests the numerical example consists of a jacket platform subjected to random wave excitation the simulated damage cases encompass single and multiple damage locations not only on whole segments but also on local elements one fifth of the whole segment of the numerical structure with minor 1 5 severity and different noise levels rdt is applied first to process the noisy random data and then the damage detection is carried out using lstm after the numerical example the proposed method is applied to laboratory tests of a jacket platform model under random loading produced by a shaking table minor and major damages and their combination at different locations are discussed both the numerical simulation and laboratory test show that the proposed rdt lstm method has an outstanding performance in structural damage detection keywords long and short term memory networks random decrement technique damage detection offshore structures 1 introduction structural health monitoring shm of offshore structures plays a major role in reducing the maintenance costs and guaranteeing the operation safety during their service in harsh marine environments nichols 2003 ren et al 2006 jahangiri et al 2016 haeri et al 2017 among the plethora of shm methods vibration based methods such as global shm methods have been widely used to determine the damage location and damage level of a structure using damage indicators based on the measured vibration responses vibration based methods can be divided into two categories parametric and nonparametric approaches according to whether or not the modal parameters are used to construct the damage indicators abdeljaber et al 2017 the basic principle behind the parametric methods is that the modal parameters are associated with the physical parameters of the structures hence the changes of modal parameters drew from the collected vibration response data based on sensors and the data acquisition system related to the damaged and undamaged structures are used to construct the damage indicators during the past few decades the parametric methods have made great advances they are typically based on natural frequency or mode shape ding et al 2016 bao et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 frequency response function mohan et al 2013 mao et al 2018 lin and ng 2018 and modal strain energy mse ashory et al 2017 tan et al 2017 dehcheshmeh et al 2020 in recent years the parametric methods especially the mse based methods have often been applied for damage detection of marine structures li et al 2008 proposed a cross model cross mode cmcm approach to determine the damage of offshore jacket platforms by using spatially incomplete modal data to identify the damage of individual components liu et al 2014 introduced the factors of mode correction and defined a new damage indicator based on the concept of mse to localize the damage of offshore wind turbines based on spatial incompleteness with better accuracy li et al 2016 introduced frequency information into the traditional stubbs index method the effectiveness of the improved method for damage localization was proved by the numerical example and laboratory study of jacket platforms a review of four typical mse related damage detection methods i e stubbs damage index mse change ratio cross mse and mse decomposition was presented by wang and xu 2019 in which the four methods for offshore platforms damage localization were compared as the parametric methods rely heavily on the accuracy of the modal analysis some signal processing techniques have been proposed to overcome the problems that arise in the identification of modal parameters e g mode mixing sensitivity to noise hu et al 2013 proposed the prony based on state space model prony ss method which can improve the precision of the signal decomposition and avoid the shortcomings of the prony method such as noise sensitivity and truncation error liu et al 2019 a liu et al 2020 proposed a single mode function smf decomposition method to reduce the mode mixing in the hilbert huang transform hht for the shm of offshore wind turbines bao and shi 2019 developed the operational modal analysis procedure next slra ce in which the noise elimination method slra and ambient vibration responses processing method next are combined with the modal parameters identification method ce however in practice these parametric methods still present challenges incomplete and inaccurate modal information li et al 2008 noisy measurements liu et al 2019 b bao et al 2020 solution of the ill conditioned over determined system of linear equations wang et al 2019 etc on the other hand the nonparametric methods aim to construct damage indicators from the measured data of a structure based on signal processing and statistical methods instead of modal analysis an overview of the common signal processing techniques for shm of civil structures was given by amezquita sanchez and adeli 2016 including statistical time series ts models kalman filter kf wavelet transform wt s transform st and newer signal processing algorithms e g fast s transform complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd empirical wavelet transform ewt the main advantages and disadvantages of these methods were also summarized asgarian et al 2016 adopted the rate of signal energy rse of wavelet packet transform based on measured accelerations as a damage index and the experimental results indicate that rse is more sensitive to the damage location than other locations however the greatest difficulty of the nonparametric approaches lies in detecting the damage effectively and efficiently from the huge amount of noise polluted online data collected by many sensors in the past few years machine learning techniques have been used in numerous vibration based structural damage detection approaches these are divided into parametric and non parametric methods avci et al 2021 parametric machine learning based approaches rely on modal parameters such as natural frequencies and mode shapes as extracted features and then the classification is performed by a well trained classifier to assess the structural damage instead non parametric machine learning based methods use the outputs of certain signal processing methods which extract damage sensitive features without the need of modal analysis the extracted features are then fed into a machine learning algorithm to perform the damage detection the most popular methods for feature extraction are auto regressive ar modeling figueiredo et al 2011 santos et al 2016 gui et al 2017 and principal component analysis pca dackermann et al 2010 bandara et al 2013 2014 however machine learning based structural damage detection methods depend to a great extent on the selected damage sensitive features and classifiers the feature extraction techniques such as modal identification ar modeling and pca usually lead to considerable computational complexity and time and the classifier needs to be tested to ensure the robustness of the machine learning methods for the damage detection which affects the application of machine learning based methods in real time shm operations avci et al 2021 unlike machine learning deep learning methods have a large number of hidden layers and can automatically extract features without the need for manual feature extraction sony et al 2021 nowadays deep learning algorithms have achieved tremendous success in a variety of application domains alom et al 2019 including shm deep learning methods may provide a solution to the problem of the traditional nonparametric approaches i e handling a large number of noise polluted online data due to their strong capability to deal with high redundancy data for feature extraction among them the convolutional neural network cnn is one of the most popular methods used for structure damage identification liu and zhang 2019 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 khodabandehlou et al 2019 truong et al 2020 compared with traditional machine learning methods such as svm random forest and decision tree cnn has obvious advantages no need for pre and post processing or for extracting features manually abdeljaber et al 2017 and less noise sensitivity lin et al 2018 however most of the cnn damage identification methods are employed considering simple damage scenarios and some of these methods make use of two dimensional image data rather than one dimensional time series data to determine structural damage bao et al 2021 recent studies abdeljaber et al 2017 2018 avci et al 2018 ince et al 2016 kiranyaz et al 2018 have shown that one dimensional cnns have advantages over two dimensional cnns when dealing with one dimensional signals one dimensional cnns have a compact structure fewer hidden layers and neurons and can learn challenging tasks with small amounts of training data in addition the computational complexity of one dimensional cnns is significantly lower than that of two dimensional cnns long short term memory lstm networks a major branch of recurrent neural networks rnn are popular for temporal information processing in recent years lstm has become the most modern technique for various machine learning problems such as computer vision time series data prediction and natural language processing however lstm networks have not received much attention in the shm field so far luo et al 2019 proposed an shm method using the dual tree complex wavelet enhanced convolutional lstm network the results of their automotive suspension experiment showed accurate prediction with high efficiency yang et al 2020 proposed a cnn lstm method for modal frequency identification which showed high accuracy in the tests of various materials zhang et al 2020 presented a crack detection method for concrete bridge decks based on a combination of one dimensional cnn and lstm methods trained by numerous images of intact and damaged structures to date lstm networks have seldom been applied to damage detection of large and complex structures such as offshore platforms bridges and high buildings based on one dimensional measured vibration responses in addition the deep learning methods for damage detection are usually sensitive to noise and there are few researches on anti noise procedures for damage identification based on deep learning methods under random excitation the random decrement technique rdt ﬁrst proposed by cole 1968 is an averaging technique it is able to draw the free decaying response data from the random vibration response data of a structure under zero mean and stationary gaussian random excitation as it is simple and effective in processing random vibration response output and without any prior knowledge of input the method is commonly applied to identify modal parameters for civil and offshore structures budipriyanto et al 2007 lin and chiang 2012 brincker and ventura 2015 feng et al 2017 currently rdt has also been used for structure damage detection shiryayev and slater 2008 applied statistical characters of random signatures to identify the damage of a frame structure elshafey et al 2010 adopted the combined method of rdt with neural networks to detect the damage of offshore platforms under random excitation morsy et al 2017 implemented multi channel rdt to localize the damage of concrete bridge girders because the rdt has the ability to extract the free decaying response from random signals in noisy conditions and the lstm method has a long term memory function which can deal well with the gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems during the long time series data processing a novel approach based on the combination of rdt and lstm is proposed in this study to determine the damage location and damage severity of a structure based on noisy random vibration response data the paper is organized as follows the lstm and rdt are briefly introduced in sections 2 and 3 respectively section 4 presents the numerical study of the rdt lstm method for damage detection of a jacket platform subjected to random wave excitation the simulated single and multiple minor damages on whole segments and local elements respectively are considered as well as the noise rdt is applied first to process the noisy random data and then the lstm for damage detection is carried out utilizing the processed time series data in section 5 experimental research with the proposed method for a scaled jacket platform model under random load produced by a shaking table is presented and the performance evaluation for different damage cases including the combination of minor and major damage on different locations is discussed finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 brief introduction to the lstm method traditional rnn can guarantee the continuity of information well and has achieved great success in text image and speech identification as shown in fig 1 x t is the input information to neural network a and the final output is h t it is seen that the information can be transferred from the current step to the next step in the rnn however if the transmission distance becomes longer it is difficult to ensure the continuity of the information in order to overcome this shortcoming a lstm network was proposed which is a variant of rnn and has the ability to store long distance historical information wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the configuration of the lstm network has obvious differences with the rnn consisting of three gates the forget input and output gates and an update status 2 1 forget gate the forget gate is used to select which information needs to be discarded through the sigmoid layer the diagram is shown in fig 3 the red lines and the output of the forget gate f t can be expressed as 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where σ is the sigmoid function h t 1 is the previous output x t is the current input w f is the weight and b f is the bias term note that the output of the forget gate should be converted into the value between 0 and 1 for the state of c t 1 which represents the pass rate of the information for example 0 indicates that no information passes and 1 indicates that all information passes 2 2 input gate as shown in fig 4 the input gate serves to clarify the information that needs to be stored which includes two parts i obtaining the value that needs to be updated through the sigmoid layer and the update probability i t that can be expressed as eq 2 and ii constructing the candidate vector c t through the hyperbolic tangent function in eq 3 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c where w i and w c represent the weight and b i and b c denote the bias term 2 3 update status the update process from c t 1 to c t fig 5 is expressed by 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where is the element wise product the element wise product of c t 1 and f t represents the information that needs to be forgotten and the element wise product of i t and c t represents the information that needs to be added 2 4 output gate as shown in fig 6 the output gate serves to obtain the output information o t through the sigmoid layer and subsequently to obtain the final output h t through the element wise product of o t and the processed information tanh c t by the tanh function which can be expressed as 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where w o is the weight and b o is the bias term and is the element wise product 3 the concept of the random decrement technique the rdt is a method of data processing which refers to the conversion of random vibration response signals into free decaying vibration signals the concept of the rdt is easy to understand and has been widely used to process the dynamic response data of large structures under environmental excitation for modal analysis or damage detection according to the derivation of cole 1971 the random decrement function δ y y τ is regarded as the average of the time segments y t i τ of the response signal and the triggering condition for each segment is y t i a 0 expressed as 7 δ y y τ 1 n i 1 n y t i τ y t i a 0 where τ t t i is the time past the triggering time t i a n d n represents the number of triggering points eq 7 can be rewritten in a more general form 8 δ y y τ e y t i τ t y t the random decrement function δ y y τ is estimated as a conditional expected value the value of the triggering condition t y t is determined by the user usually in the range of 1 2 σ y where σ y is the standard deviation of the signal y t 4 numerical studies 4 1 numerical model a numerical model of a jacket platform was constructed using the ansys software the dimensions of transverse brace tb pile leg pl and slanted brace sb of the model are illustrated in table 1 the platform is about 60 m in height located in a water depth of 41 m and its superstructure weighs 2 8 105 kg as described in fig 7 the superstructure of the platform is modeled as four lumped mass points placed on top of the four pls the material properties of the platform are as follows density 7850 kg m3 poisson s ratio 0 3 and young s modulus 210 gpa assuming that the structure is excited by the random wave produced by ten regular waves with different wave heights 0 3 1 0 m and periods 3 5 6 0 s along the x direction in ansys the damage simulation is to reduce the young s modulus of one or more components of the structure 4 2 damage localization it is a challenging work to identify minor damages of a complex structure for evaluating the applicability of the proposed method the damage severity simulated in this study is less than 5 in this section a total of 5 damage cases are analyzed including 2 single and 1 multiple damage locations on whole segments 1 single and 1 multiple damage locations on local elements one fifth of the whole segment of pl tb and sb respectively altogether 5 scenarios corresponding to each damage case are considered in this study consisting of an intact and 4 damage scenarios the details of the damage cases are clarified in table 2 and fig 7 a to fig 7 e in case 5 for example fig 7 e demonstrates the 4 multiple damage scenarios on local elements with different locations and different severities for the first damage scenario the damage severity is 5 for local element on tb 2 for local element on pl and 3 for local element on sb the rest are similar to the first damage scenario the axial strain responses from 8 sampling points channels of the structure fig 7 f corresponding to the pre and post damage structure subjected to the random wave fig 8 a are obtained note that the 8 sampling channels are fixed for all the damage cases fig 8 b describes the axial strain responses obtained from channel 1 corresponding to two scenarios i e the intact and damage with 4 severity in case 1 the difference between the time domain data in the two scenarios is found to be minor due to the minor damage severity 4 2 1 construction of lstm network the flowchart of lstm network for damage detection in this work is described in fig 9 in order to improve the calculation efficiency similar to the image recognition of a normal neural network the one dimensional vibration response data need to be transformed into two dimensional time series data and then the standardization of the data is conducted by subtracting the original time series data from the mean values and then dividing by its standard deviation thereafter the standardized data are divided into the training dataset 70 of the data and the testing dataset 30 of the data during the training step the lstm networks are updated by determining the minimum value of the loss function note that the cross entropy function is selected to be the loss function in the damage localization process finally in the testing or validation step the updated lstm network is used to evaluate the prediction ability of damage localization based on the testing dataset the configuration of the lstm network used in this work is as follows the number of units is 120 the input shape is 10 8 and the output shape is 1 1 the softmax function is utilized in the dense layer adam s algorithm is applied for the training process with a learning rate of 0 0001 the length of the strain response data obtained from each of 8 points is 128 s with the sampling frequency 100 hz it follows that the size of the dataset corresponding to each scenario is 1280 10 8 and the total dimension of the dataset for the 5 scenarios of each damage case is 6400 10 8 the size of the training dataset is 4480 10 8 70 and the size of the testing dataset is 1920 10 8 30 it is noted that each datum should be labeled during the processing of lstm the intact scenario is labeled as 0 and the damage scenarios are labeled as 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for all the 5 damage cases which are clarified in fig 7 a to fig 7 e furthermore the convergence history of training accuracy and loss value for damage case 1 is demonstrated in fig 10 it is seen that both the accuracy and loss value reach a stable state after 300 iterations the calculation time of damage case 1 for the epoch of 300 is 296 8 s with a computer configuration consisting of an intel core i7 9750h cpu the windows 64 bit v10 system and python 3 7 4 2 2 damage localization results the results of damage localization for each of the 5 damage cases is described by the confusion matrix see fig 11 a to e in which the prediction accuracy of the lstm for different damage locations with different damage severities is illustrated respectively the confusion matrix is usually applied to evaluate the quality of the output of a classifier in this study the diagonal elements represent the probabilities of the predicted label being equal to the true label whereas the off diagonal elements represent the probabilities of mislabeling by the classifier the higher the trace of the confusion matrix i e the sum of the elements on its main diagonal the better indicating many correct predictions the sum of the elements in each row is 100 for example the damage case 1 single damage location on whole segment of pl fig 11 a shows that the damage localization accuracy of label 0 intact scenario is 95 92 while the probability of misidentifying label 0 as label 1 is 3 53 and the probability of misidentifying label 0 as label 2 is 0 55 similarly the damage localization accuracy of label 1 is 92 7 label 2 is 100 label 3 is 98 45 and label 4 is 99 75 the mean identification accuracy for damage case 1 is then calculated to be 97 37 from the 5 diagonal elements fig 11 b and c demonstrate the prediction accuracies of the lstm for damage cases 2 single damage location on whole segment of tb and 3 multiple damage locations on whole segments of tb pl sb respectively the mean prediction accuracies can be calculated to be 98 79 for case 2 and 99 43 for case 3 furthermore fig 11 d and e demonstrate the prediction accuracies of the lstm for damage cases 4 single damage location on local element of pl and 5 multiple damage locations on local elements of tb pl sb respectively it is calculated that the mean prediction accuracies are 98 27 and 99 37 for case 4 and case 5 respectively the results show that lstm is capable of determining damage locations for the jacket platform with great accuracy both for the whole segments or the local elements even though the damage severity is very small furthermore the prediction accuracies are slightly higher for the multiple damage locations than those for the single damage location 4 3 damage localization considering the influence of noise in real engineering it is inevitable that the measured vibration response data will be contaminated by noise at the same time for proving the effectiveness of the rdt and lstm method under the noise condition additive gaussian white noise is considered with 5 10 and 20 noise level without loss of generality the damage case 5 with several noise levels is considered in this section in addition the traditional machine learning method svm is applied to identify the damage location for comparison with the lstm the method of parameter optimization is used to find the best parameters of svm as c 1 γ 0 092 and kernel rbf the results of identification accuracy for case 5 with several noise levels are listed in table 3 it is seen that both the lstm and svm methods can identify the damage location with accuracy more than 99 based on the noise free data however with the increase in noise level the accuracy of the two methods decreases significantly most notably in the case of the svm method for overcoming the influence of noise on the lstm method the rdt is applied for noisy data preprocessing fig 12 for the noisy data of each channel of each damage case the length of output data is set to 6400 i e half length of the noisy data and the triggering condition is selected to be 1 2 times the standard deviation of the noisy signal during the rdt process then the new processed data are obtained by averaging the subsamples of the noisy signal after the signal processing based on rdt for the noisy data of the 5 damage cases the dimension of the new dataset becomes 50 of the original dataset then the lstm and svm methods are applied to identify the damage location table 3 also lists the results of identification accuracy using lstm and svm after data preprocessed by rdt for damage case 5 with different noise levels it is found that the damage localization accuracy of the two methods combined with rdt has been significantly improved reaching 100 even for the 20 noise level fig 13 a b and c show the original data noisy data with 20 noise level and processed data by rdt of channel 1 with 5 scenarios labels in damage case 5 respectively which can be the possible explanations for the differences between the damage localization accuracy based on the original data noisy data and processed data in fig 13 a the differences of the original data among the 5 labels are less visible since the damage severities at different positions are small however the identification accuracies are still more than 99 using both the lstm and svm methods it is worth noting that the noisy data corresponding to the 5 labels fig 13 b are extremely confused and not easy to distinguish by lstm or svm alone furthermore the data processed by rdt are shown in fig 13 c from which we can find the obvious differences between the intact label 0 and damage scenarios label 1 2 3 and 4 even though the differences among the damage scenarios are still not very visible the results indicate that the proposed rdt lstm approach is capable of localizing the damage from the noisy data with great accuracy even if the damage severity is very small 4 4 identification of the damage severity as the lstm method has been validated in the simulation to be able to accurately identify and localize the damage on no matter whole segments or local elements the verification of the effectiveness of the lstm method for minor and close damage severity identification is then carried out in this section for local elements of the structure see fig 14 subjected to random wave excitation in y direction the minor damage severity on different locations is randomly generated between 1 and 5 the lstm adopts the regression method to identify the damage severity and the mean square error to be the loss function the performances of the lstm method for damage severity identification are demonstrated based on the original data noisy data with 5 noise level and processed data by the rdt respectively table 4 lists the damage severity estimation results for 4 damage cases including 2 single damage cases and 2 multiple damage cases it is seen that the estimation error based on the original data is very little no more than 2 00 while based on the noisy data the maximum error is 33 33 however the accuracy of the damage severity identification based on the processed data by rdt for noisy data is quite high with error no more than 1 50 the results indicate the lstm method can effectively estimate the minor and close damage severity of the local element of a structure based on the clean vibration response data in the case of noisy data however the identification accuracy of the damage severity can be significantly improved by the proposed rdt lstm method nevertheless for the sake of comparison with lstm the traditional machine learning method svm has also been applied to identify the damage severity the results of identification for 4 single damage cases without consideration of the noise are listed in table 5 it is found that the errors of the damage severity identification in different cases with svm are much larger than those with lstm especially in cases with very minor damage case e g case 5 based on these results the svm and rdt svm methods for the damage severity identification under noise conditions are not used in this work traditional machine learning methods present obvious limitations compared with deep learning methods abdeljaber et al 2017 lin et al 2018 svm for example has inherent shortcomings its noise resistance is poor and its process of parameter optimization is computationally expensive 5 experimental study the experimental study of the proposed rdt lstm approach for damage detection was also conducted for a steel jacket platform model under the random load produced by a shaking table as shown in fig 15 the jacket platform model was placed in a sand bucket and the bucket was fixed with bolts onto the shaking table the layer spacing of the model is 15 cm 15 cm 25 cm 30 cm and 30 cm respectively the outer diameter and thickness of the pile legs is 20 mm 2 mm and those of the transverse braces and slanted braces are 12 mm 2 mm the dimensions of the two decks are 460 mm 460 mm 6 mm the inclinations of the 4 pile legs are 1 10 as shown in fig 16 there were 20 strain gauges mounted on the members of the structure with the connection of half bridge that is 10 channels were constructed to acquire the vibration response data in the experiment using the dynamic data acquisition system the damage was simulated through removing some of the bolts on a segment of the member note that there are 8 bolts in both sides of the small segment i e 4 bolts in each side two kinds of damage severity were tested in this experiment including the major and minor damage on the members of tb pl and sb the major damage was produced by removing all the 8 bolts on the member and then completely detaching the small segment while the minor damage was produced by removing only 4 bolts on one side of the segment and by imposing that the segment remain in contact with the member see fig 15 a total of 8 damage cases were simulated in the experiments including the major and minor damages on different members and their combination table 6 lists the damage locations severities and labels needed in the processing of lstm in each of the 8 damage cases the dynamic data acquisition system was used to collect the strain response data from 10 channels under the random excitation the sampling frequency was 1024 hz and sampling time 60 s fig 17 illustrates a 12 5 s segment of strain response signals acquired from channel 1 corresponding to the 8 damage cases respectively it is found that there are some differences among the amplitudes of the data in the different cases as expected but the differences corresponding to some cases labels are not very significant for example labels 1 and 5 labels 3 and 7 the total dataset constructed with the dimension of 10240 10 10 was input into the lstm for damage localization 70 of the data with the size of 7168 10 10 were used as the training dataset and 30 of the data with the size of 3072 10 10 were used as the testing dataset as illustrated in fig 18 the performance of the lstm for determining the damage locations of the jacket platform model is satisfactory with the prediction accuracy of more than 99 and 100 for 5 of the 8 cases although the noise level in the experiment maybe small the effectiveness of the rdt lstm method was also studied in this section in order to provide references for its application in engineering the rdt was first used for the collected data from each channel corresponding to each damage case to reconstruct the dataset as shown in fig 19 the length of the processed data by the rdt was one half of the original data in addition the amplitude differences of the processed data among different damage cases were much more significant than those of the original data fig 17 then the lstm was applied to identify and localize the damages based on the processed data as shown in fig 20 the prediction accuracy is 100 for all the 8 damage cases the result demonstrates that the performance of the rdt lstm method for damage localization is outstanding even though the damage cases are complicated including major and minor damages on different members and their combination 6 conclusions the rdt lstm method is proposed in this study for the localization and severity assessment of random vibration based structural damage especially in noisy conditions the rdt is first applied to preprocess the collected random vibrational response data then the lstm for damage detection is conducted on the basis of the processed time series data the rdt lstm method is validated by means of a numerical application and laboratory tests of jacket platforms subjected to a random excitation the main conclusions are as follows first in the absence of noise the lstm approach has an excellent performance in determining the presence location and severity of single and multiple damage even when the simulated damage severities are very small no more than 5 and on local elements one fifth of the whole segment of the numerical structure with increasing noise levels the accuracy of damage localization and severity identification of the lstm method reduces significantly second the utilization of the rdt for random vibration response data preprocessing can remarkably improve the capability of damage localization and severity identification of the lstm method in noisy conditions third the experimental research results show that the rdt lstm approach can accurately identify and localize the damage of the jacket platform model under random excitation including the minor and major damages on different members and their combination in summary these results indicate that the rdt lstm method combined with certain types of vibration measurement and signal transmission system

numerical example and laboratory tests the numerical example consists of a jacket platform subjected to random wave excitation the simulated damage cases encompass single and multiple damage locations not only on whole segments but also on local elements one fifth of the whole segment of the numerical structure with minor 1 5 severity and different noise levels rdt is applied first to process the noisy random data and then the damage detection is carried out using lstm after the numerical example the proposed method is applied to laboratory tests of a jacket platform model under random loading produced by a shaking table minor and major damages and their combination at different locations are discussed both the numerical simulation and laboratory test show that the proposed rdt lstm method has an outstanding performance in structural damage detection keywords long and short term memory networks random decrement technique damage detection offshore structures 1 introduction structural health monitoring shm of offshore structures plays a major role in reducing the maintenance costs and guaranteeing the operation safety during their service in harsh marine environments nichols 2003 ren et al 2006 jahangiri et al 2016 haeri et al 2017 among the plethora of shm methods vibration based methods such as global shm methods have been widely used to determine the damage location and damage level of a structure using damage indicators based on the measured vibration responses vibration based methods can be divided into two categories parametric and nonparametric approaches according to whether or not the modal parameters are used to construct the damage indicators abdeljaber et al 2017 the basic principle behind the parametric methods is that the modal parameters are associated with the physical parameters of the structures hence the changes of modal parameters drew from the collected vibration response data based on sensors and the data acquisition system related to the damaged and undamaged structures are used to construct the damage indicators during the past few decades the parametric methods have made great advances they are typically based on natural frequency or mode shape ding et al 2016 bao et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 frequency response function mohan et al 2013 mao et al 2018 lin and ng 2018 and modal strain energy mse ashory et al 2017 tan et al 2017 dehcheshmeh et al 2020 in recent years the parametric methods especially the mse based methods have often been applied for damage detection of marine structures li et al 2008 proposed a cross model cross mode cmcm approach to determine the damage of offshore jacket platforms by using spatially incomplete modal data to identify the damage of individual components liu et al 2014 introduced the factors of mode correction and defined a new damage indicator based on the concept of mse to localize the damage of offshore wind turbines based on spatial incompleteness with better accuracy li et al 2016 introduced frequency information into the traditional stubbs index method the effectiveness of the improved method for damage localization was proved by the numerical example and laboratory study of jacket platforms a review of four typical mse related damage detection methods i e stubbs damage index mse change ratio cross mse and mse decomposition was presented by wang and xu 2019 in which the four methods for offshore platforms damage localization were compared as the parametric methods rely heavily on the accuracy of the modal analysis some signal processing techniques have been proposed to overcome the problems that arise in the identification of modal parameters e g mode mixing sensitivity to noise hu et al 2013 proposed the prony based on state space model prony ss method which can improve the precision of the signal decomposition and avoid the shortcomings of the prony method such as noise sensitivity and truncation error liu et al 2019 a liu et al 2020 proposed a single mode function smf decomposition method to reduce the mode mixing in the hilbert huang transform hht for the shm of offshore wind turbines bao and shi 2019 developed the operational modal analysis procedure next slra ce in which the noise elimination method slra and ambient vibration responses processing method next are combined with the modal parameters identification method ce however in practice these parametric methods still present challenges incomplete and inaccurate modal information li et al 2008 noisy measurements liu et al 2019 b bao et al 2020 solution of the ill conditioned over determined system of linear equations wang et al 2019 etc on the other hand the nonparametric methods aim to construct damage indicators from the measured data of a structure based on signal processing and statistical methods instead of modal analysis an overview of the common signal processing techniques for shm of civil structures was given by amezquita sanchez and adeli 2016 including statistical time series ts models kalman filter kf wavelet transform wt s transform st and newer signal processing algorithms e g fast s transform complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd empirical wavelet transform ewt the main advantages and disadvantages of these methods were also summarized asgarian et al 2016 adopted the rate of signal energy rse of wavelet packet transform based on measured accelerations as a damage index and the experimental results indicate that rse is more sensitive to the damage location than other locations however the greatest difficulty of the nonparametric approaches lies in detecting the damage effectively and efficiently from the huge amount of noise polluted online data collected by many sensors in the past few years machine learning techniques have been used in numerous vibration based structural damage detection approaches these are divided into parametric and non parametric methods avci et al 2021 parametric machine learning based approaches rely on modal parameters such as natural frequencies and mode shapes as extracted features and then the classification is performed by a well trained classifier to assess the structural damage instead non parametric machine learning based methods use the outputs of certain signal processing methods which extract damage sensitive features without the need of modal analysis the extracted features are then fed into a machine learning algorithm to perform the damage detection the most popular methods for feature extraction are auto regressive ar modeling figueiredo et al 2011 santos et al 2016 gui et al 2017 and principal component analysis pca dackermann et al 2010 bandara et al 2013 2014 however machine learning based structural damage detection methods depend to a great extent on the selected damage sensitive features and classifiers the feature extraction techniques such as modal identification ar modeling and pca usually lead to considerable computational complexity and time and the classifier needs to be tested to ensure the robustness of the machine learning methods for the damage detection which affects the application of machine learning based methods in real time shm operations avci et al 2021 unlike machine learning deep learning methods have a large number of hidden layers and can automatically extract features without the need for manual feature extraction sony et al 2021 nowadays deep learning algorithms have achieved tremendous success in a variety of application domains alom et al 2019 including shm deep learning methods may provide a solution to the problem of the traditional nonparametric approaches i e handling a large number of noise polluted online data due to their strong capability to deal with high redundancy data for feature extraction among them the convolutional neural network cnn is one of the most popular methods used for structure damage identification liu and zhang 2019 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 khodabandehlou et al 2019 truong et al 2020 compared with traditional machine learning methods such as svm random forest and decision tree cnn has obvious advantages no need for pre and post processing or for extracting features manually abdeljaber et al 2017 and less noise sensitivity lin et al 2018 however most of the cnn damage identification methods are employed considering simple damage scenarios and some of these methods make use of two dimensional image data rather than one dimensional time series data to determine structural damage bao et al 2021 recent studies abdeljaber et al 2017 2018 avci et al 2018 ince et al 2016 kiranyaz et al 2018 have shown that one dimensional cnns have advantages over two dimensional cnns when dealing with one dimensional signals one dimensional cnns have a compact structure fewer hidden layers and neurons and can learn challenging tasks with small amounts of training data in addition the computational complexity of one dimensional cnns is significantly lower than that of two dimensional cnns long short term memory lstm networks a major branch of recurrent neural networks rnn are popular for temporal information processing in recent years lstm has become the most modern technique for various machine learning problems such as computer vision time series data prediction and natural language processing however lstm networks have not received much attention in the shm field so far luo et al 2019 proposed an shm method using the dual tree complex wavelet enhanced convolutional lstm network the results of their automotive suspension experiment showed accurate prediction with high efficiency yang et al 2020 proposed a cnn lstm method for modal frequency identification which showed high accuracy in the tests of various materials zhang et al 2020 presented a crack detection method for concrete bridge decks based on a combination of one dimensional cnn and lstm methods trained by numerous images of intact and damaged structures to date lstm networks have seldom been applied to damage detection of large and complex structures such as offshore platforms bridges and high buildings based on one dimensional measured vibration responses in addition the deep learning methods for damage detection are usually sensitive to noise and there are few researches on anti noise procedures for damage identification based on deep learning methods under random excitation the random decrement technique rdt ﬁrst proposed by cole 1968 is an averaging technique it is able to draw the free decaying response data from the random vibration response data of a structure under zero mean and stationary gaussian random excitation as it is simple and effective in processing random vibration response output and without any prior knowledge of input the method is commonly applied to identify modal parameters for civil and offshore structures budipriyanto et al 2007 lin and chiang 2012 brincker and ventura 2015 feng et al 2017 currently rdt has also been used for structure damage detection shiryayev and slater 2008 applied statistical characters of random signatures to identify the damage of a frame structure elshafey et al 2010 adopted the combined method of rdt with neural networks to detect the damage of offshore platforms under random excitation morsy et al 2017 implemented multi channel rdt to localize the damage of concrete bridge girders because the rdt has the ability to extract the free decaying response from random signals in noisy conditions and the lstm method has a long term memory function which can deal well with the gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems during the long time series data processing a novel approach based on the combination of rdt and lstm is proposed in this study to determine the damage location and damage severity of a structure based on noisy random vibration response data the paper is organized as follows the lstm and rdt are briefly introduced in sections 2 and 3 respectively section 4 presents the numerical study of the rdt lstm method for damage detection of a jacket platform subjected to random wave excitation the simulated single and multiple minor damages on whole segments and local elements respectively are considered as well as the noise rdt is applied first to process the noisy random data and then the lstm for damage detection is carried out utilizing the processed time series data in section 5 experimental research with the proposed method for a scaled jacket platform model under random load produced by a shaking table is presented and the performance evaluation for different damage cases including the combination of minor and major damage on different locations is discussed finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 brief introduction to the lstm method traditional rnn can guarantee the continuity of information well and has achieved great success in text image and speech identification as shown in fig 1 x t is the input information to neural network a and the final output is h t it is seen that the information can be transferred from the current step to the next step in the rnn however if the transmission distance becomes longer it is difficult to ensure the continuity of the information in order to overcome this shortcoming a lstm network was proposed which is a variant of rnn and has the ability to store long distance historical information wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the configuration of the lstm network has obvious differences with the rnn consisting of three gates the forget input and output gates and an update status 2 1 forget gate the forget gate is used to select which information needs to be discarded through the sigmoid layer the diagram is shown in fig 3 the red lines and the output of the forget gate f t can be expressed as 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where σ is the sigmoid function h t 1 is the previous output x t is the current input w f is the weight and b f is the bias term note that the output of the forget gate should be converted into the value between 0 and 1 for the state of c t 1 which represents the pass rate of the information for example 0 indicates that no information passes and 1 indicates that all information passes 2 2 input gate as shown in fig 4 the input gate serves to clarify the information that needs to be stored which includes two parts i obtaining the value that needs to be updated through the sigmoid layer and the update probability i t that can be expressed as eq 2 and ii constructing the candidate vector c t through the hyperbolic tangent function in eq 3 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c where w i and w c represent the weight and b i and b c denote the bias term 2 3 update status the update process from c t 1 to c t fig 5 is expressed by 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where is the element wise product the element wise product of c t 1 and f t represents the information that needs to be forgotten and the element wise product of i t and c t represents the information that needs to be added 2 4 output gate as shown in fig 6 the output gate serves to obtain the output information o t through the sigmoid layer and subsequently to obtain the final output h t through the element wise product of o t and the processed information tanh c t by the tanh function which can be expressed as 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where w o is the weight and b o is the bias term and is the element wise product 3 the concept of the random decrement technique the rdt is a method of data processing which refers to the conversion of random vibration response signals into free decaying vibration signals the concept of the rdt is easy to understand and has been widely used to process the dynamic response data of large structures under environmental excitation for modal analysis or damage detection according to the derivation of cole 1971 the random decrement function δ y y τ is regarded as the average of the time segments y t i τ of the response signal and the triggering condition for each segment is y t i a 0 expressed as 7 δ y y τ 1 n i 1 n y t i τ y t i a 0 where τ t t i is the time past the triggering time t i a n d n represents the number of triggering points eq 7 can be rewritten in a more general form 8 δ y y τ e y t i τ t y t the random decrement function δ y y τ is estimated as a conditional expected value the value of the triggering condition t y t is determined by the user usually in the range of 1 2 σ y where σ y is the standard deviation of the signal y t 4 numerical studies 4 1 numerical model a numerical model of a jacket platform was constructed using the ansys software the dimensions of transverse brace tb pile leg pl and slanted brace sb of the model are illustrated in table 1 the platform is about 60 m in height located in a water depth of 41 m and its superstructure weighs 2 8 105 kg as described in fig 7 the superstructure of the platform is modeled as four lumped mass points placed on top of the four pls the material properties of the platform are as follows density 7850 kg m3 poisson s ratio 0 3 and young s modulus 210 gpa assuming that the structure is excited by the random wave produced by ten regular waves with different wave heights 0 3 1 0 m and periods 3 5 6 0 s along the x direction in ansys the damage simulation is to reduce the young s modulus of one or more components of the structure 4 2 damage localization it is a challenging work to identify minor damages of a complex structure for evaluating the applicability of the proposed method the damage severity simulated in this study is less than 5 in this section a total of 5 damage cases are analyzed including 2 single and 1 multiple damage locations on whole segments 1 single and 1 multiple damage locations on local elements one fifth of the whole segment of pl tb and sb respectively altogether 5 scenarios corresponding to each damage case are considered in this study consisting of an intact and 4 damage scenarios the details of the damage cases are clarified in table 2 and fig 7 a to fig 7 e in case 5 for example fig 7 e demonstrates the 4 multiple damage scenarios on local elements with different locations and different severities for the first damage scenario the damage severity is 5 for local element on tb 2 for local element on pl and 3 for local element on sb the rest are similar to the first damage scenario the axial strain responses from 8 sampling points channels of the structure fig 7 f corresponding to the pre and post damage structure subjected to the random wave fig 8 a are obtained note that the 8 sampling channels are fixed for all the damage cases fig 8 b describes the axial strain responses obtained from channel 1 corresponding to two scenarios i e the intact and damage with 4 severity in case 1 the difference between the time domain data in the two scenarios is found to be minor due to the minor damage severity 4 2 1 construction of lstm network the flowchart of lstm network for damage detection in this work is described in fig 9 in order to improve the calculation efficiency similar to the image recognition of a normal neural network the one dimensional vibration response data need to be transformed into two dimensional time series data and then the standardization of the data is conducted by subtracting the original time series data from the mean values and then dividing by its standard deviation thereafter the standardized data are divided into the training dataset 70 of the data and the testing dataset 30 of the data during the training step the lstm networks are updated by determining the minimum value of the loss function note that the cross entropy function is selected to be the loss function in the damage localization process finally in the testing or validation step the updated lstm network is used to evaluate the prediction ability of damage localization based on the testing dataset the configuration of the lstm network used in this work is as follows the number of units is 120 the input shape is 10 8 and the output shape is 1 1 the softmax function is utilized in the dense layer adam s algorithm is applied for the training process with a learning rate of 0 0001 the length of the strain response data obtained from each of 8 points is 128 s with the sampling frequency 100 hz it follows that the size of the dataset corresponding to each scenario is 1280 10 8 and the total dimension of the dataset for the 5 scenarios of each damage case is 6400 10 8 the size of the training dataset is 4480 10 8 70 and the size of the testing dataset is 1920 10 8 30 it is noted that each datum should be labeled during the processing of lstm the intact scenario is labeled as 0 and the damage scenarios are labeled as 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for all the 5 damage cases which are clarified in fig 7 a to fig 7 e furthermore the convergence history of training accuracy and loss value for damage case 1 is demonstrated in fig 10 it is seen that both the accuracy and loss value reach a stable state after 300 iterations the calculation time of damage case 1 for the epoch of 300 is 296 8 s with a computer configuration consisting of an intel core i7 9750h cpu the windows 64 bit v10 system and python 3 7 4 2 2 damage localization results the results of damage localization for each of the 5 damage cases is described by the confusion matrix see fig 11 a to e in which the prediction accuracy of the lstm for different damage locations with different damage severities is illustrated respectively the confusion matrix is usually applied to evaluate the quality of the output of a classifier in this study the diagonal elements represent the probabilities of the predicted label being equal to the true label whereas the off diagonal elements represent the probabilities of mislabeling by the classifier the higher the trace of the confusion matrix i e the sum of the elements on its main diagonal the better indicating many correct predictions the sum of the elements in each row is 100 for example the damage case 1 single damage location on whole segment of pl fig 11 a shows that the damage localization accuracy of label 0 intact scenario is 95 92 while the probability of misidentifying label 0 as label 1 is 3 53 and the probability of misidentifying label 0 as label 2 is 0 55 similarly the damage localization accuracy of label 1 is 92 7 label 2 is 100 label 3 is 98 45 and label 4 is 99 75 the mean identification accuracy for damage case 1 is then calculated to be 97 37 from the 5 diagonal elements fig 11 b and c demonstrate the prediction accuracies of the lstm for damage cases 2 single damage location on whole segment of tb and 3 multiple damage locations on whole segments of tb pl sb respectively the mean prediction accuracies can be calculated to be 98 79 for case 2 and 99 43 for case 3 furthermore fig 11 d and e demonstrate the prediction accuracies of the lstm for damage cases 4 single damage location on local element of pl and 5 multiple damage locations on local elements of tb pl sb respectively it is calculated that the mean prediction accuracies are 98 27 and 99 37 for case 4 and case 5 respectively the results show that lstm is capable of determining damage locations for the jacket platform with great accuracy both for the whole segments or the local elements even though the damage severity is very small furthermore the prediction accuracies are slightly higher for the multiple damage locations than those for the single damage location 4 3 damage localization considering the influence of noise in real engineering it is inevitable that the measured vibration response data will be contaminated by noise at the same time for proving the effectiveness of the rdt and lstm method under the noise condition additive gaussian white noise is considered with 5 10 and 20 noise level without loss of generality the damage case 5 with several noise levels is considered in this section in addition the traditional machine learning method svm is applied to identify the damage location for comparison with the lstm the method of parameter optimization is used to find the best parameters of svm as c 1 γ 0 092 and kernel rbf the results of identification accuracy for case 5 with several noise levels are listed in table 3 it is seen that both the lstm and svm methods can identify the damage location with accuracy more than 99 based on the noise free data however with the increase in noise level the accuracy of the two methods decreases significantly most notably in the case of the svm method for overcoming the influence of noise on the lstm method the rdt is applied for noisy data preprocessing fig 12 for the noisy data of each channel of each damage case the length of output data is set to 6400 i e half length of the noisy data and the triggering condition is selected to be 1 2 times the standard deviation of the noisy signal during the rdt process then the new processed data are obtained by averaging the subsamples of the noisy signal after the signal processing based on rdt for the noisy data of the 5 damage cases the dimension of the new dataset becomes 50 of the original dataset then the lstm and svm methods are applied to identify the damage location table 3 also lists the results of identification accuracy using lstm and svm after data preprocessed by rdt for damage case 5 with different noise levels it is found that the damage localization accuracy of the two methods combined with rdt has been significantly improved reaching 100 even for the 20 noise level fig 13 a b and c show the original data noisy data with 20 noise level and processed data by rdt of channel 1 with 5 scenarios labels in damage case 5 respectively which can be the possible explanations for the differences between the damage localization accuracy based on the original data noisy data and processed data in fig 13 a the differences of the original data among the 5 labels are less visible since the damage severities at different positions are small however the identification accuracies are still more than 99 using both the lstm and svm methods it is worth noting that the noisy data corresponding to the 5 labels fig 13 b are extremely confused and not easy to distinguish by lstm or svm alone furthermore the data processed by rdt are shown in fig 13 c from which we can find the obvious differences between the intact label 0 and damage scenarios label 1 2 3 and 4 even though the differences among the damage scenarios are still not very visible the results indicate that the proposed rdt lstm approach is capable of localizing the damage from the noisy data with great accuracy even if the damage severity is very small 4 4 identification of the damage severity as the lstm method has been validated in the simulation to be able to accurately identify and localize the damage on no matter whole segments or local elements the verification of the effectiveness of the lstm method for minor and close damage severity identification is then carried out in this section for local elements of the structure see fig 14 subjected to random wave excitation in y direction the minor damage severity on different locations is randomly generated between 1 and 5 the lstm adopts the regression method to identify the damage severity and the mean square error to be the loss function the performances of the lstm method for damage severity identification are demonstrated based on the original data noisy data with 5 noise level and processed data by the rdt respectively table 4 lists the damage severity estimation results for 4 damage cases including 2 single damage cases and 2 multiple damage cases it is seen that the estimation error based on the original data is very little no more than 2 00 while based on the noisy data the maximum error is 33 33 however the accuracy of the damage severity identification based on the processed data by rdt for noisy data is quite high with error no more than 1 50 the results indicate the lstm method can effectively estimate the minor and close damage severity of the local element of a structure based on the clean vibration response data in the case of noisy data however the identification accuracy of the damage severity can be significantly improved by the proposed rdt lstm method nevertheless for the sake of comparison with lstm the traditional machine learning method svm has also been applied to identify the damage severity the results of identification for 4 single damage cases without consideration of the noise are listed in table 5 it is found that the errors of the damage severity identification in different cases with svm are much larger than those with lstm especially in cases with very minor damage case e g case 5 based on these results the svm and rdt svm methods for the damage severity identification under noise conditions are not used in this work traditional machine learning methods present obvious limitations compared with deep learning methods abdeljaber et al 2017 lin et al 2018 svm for example has inherent shortcomings its noise resistance is poor and its process of parameter optimization is computationally expensive 5 experimental study the experimental study of the proposed rdt lstm approach for damage detection was also conducted for a steel jacket platform model under the random load produced by a shaking table as shown in fig 15 the jacket platform model was placed in a sand bucket and the bucket was fixed with bolts onto the shaking table the layer spacing of the model is 15 cm 15 cm 25 cm 30 cm and 30 cm respectively the outer diameter and thickness of the pile legs is 20 mm 2 mm and those of the transverse braces and slanted braces are 12 mm 2 mm the dimensions of the two decks are 460 mm 460 mm 6 mm the inclinations of the 4 pile legs are 1 10 as shown in fig 16 there were 20 strain gauges mounted on the members of the structure with the connection of half bridge that is 10 channels were constructed to acquire the vibration response data in the experiment using the dynamic data acquisition system the damage was simulated through removing some of the bolts on a segment of the member note that there are 8 bolts in both sides of the small segment i e 4 bolts in each side two kinds of damage severity were tested in this experiment including the major and minor damage on the members of tb pl and sb the major damage was produced by removing all the 8 bolts on the member and then completely detaching the small segment while the minor damage was produced by removing only 4 bolts on one side of the segment and by imposing that the segment remain in contact with the member see fig 15 a total of 8 damage cases were simulated in the experiments including the major and minor damages on different members and their combination table 6 lists the damage locations severities and labels needed in the processing of lstm in each of the 8 damage cases the dynamic data acquisition system was used to collect the strain response data from 10 channels under the random excitation the sampling frequency was 1024 hz and sampling time 60 s fig 17 illustrates a 12 5 s segment of strain response signals acquired from channel 1 corresponding to the 8 damage cases respectively it is found that there are some differences among the amplitudes of the data in the different cases as expected but the differences corresponding to some cases labels are not very significant for example labels 1 and 5 labels 3 and 7 the total dataset constructed with the dimension of 10240 10 10 was input into the lstm for damage localization 70 of the data with the size of 7168 10 10 were used as the training dataset and 30 of the data with the size of 3072 10 10 were used as the testing dataset as illustrated in fig 18 the performance of the lstm for determining the damage locations of the jacket platform model is satisfactory with the prediction accuracy of more than 99 and 100 for 5 of the 8 cases although the noise level in the experiment maybe small the effectiveness of the rdt lstm method was also studied in this section in order to provide references for its application in engineering the rdt was first used for the collected data from each channel corresponding to each damage case to reconstruct the dataset as shown in fig 19 the length of the processed data by the rdt was one half of the original data in addition the amplitude differences of the processed data among different damage cases were much more significant than those of the original data fig 17 then the lstm was applied to identify and localize the damages based on the processed data as shown in fig 20 the prediction accuracy is 100 for all the 8 damage cases the result demonstrates that the performance of the rdt lstm method for damage localization is outstanding even though the damage cases are complicated including major and minor damages on different members and their combination 6 conclusions the rdt lstm method is proposed in this study for the localization and severity assessment of random vibration based structural damage especially in noisy conditions the rdt is first applied to preprocess the collected random vibrational response data then the lstm for damage detection is conducted on the basis of the processed time series data the rdt lstm method is validated by means of a numerical application and laboratory tests of jacket platforms subjected to a random excitation the main conclusions are as follows first in the absence of noise the lstm approach has an excellent performance in determining the presence location and severity of single and multiple damage even when the simulated damage severities are very small no more than 5 and on local elements one fifth of the whole segment of the numerical structure with increasing noise levels the accuracy of damage localization and severity identification of the lstm method reduces significantly second the utilization of the rdt for random vibration response data preprocessing can remarkably improve the capability of damage localization and severity identification of the lstm method in noisy conditions third the experimental research results show that the rdt lstm approach can accurately identify and localize the damage of the jacket platform model under random excitation including the minor and major damages on different members and their combination in summary these results indicate that the rdt lstm method combined with certain types of vibration measurement and signal transmission system constitutes a practical and effective approach to the shm of offshore structures credit authorship contribution statement xingxian bao conceptualization methodology writing original draft zhichao wang
