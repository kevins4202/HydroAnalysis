18610,this work presents a kinetic analysis of the exogenous photo induced disinfection of e coli in natural waters herein the inactivation of bacteria by light and photo generated transient species i e hydroxyl radical ho excited triplet states of organic matter 3cdom and singlet oxygen 1o2 was studied it was found that the exogenous disinfection of e coli proceeds through a lag time followed by an exponential phase triggered by photo generated ho 1o2 and 3cdom also we report that the concentration increased of transient species and especially ho precursors decreased the lag times of bacteria inactivation due to the limitations of the competition kinetics methodology to include the lag phase an alternative strategy to study the interaction between e coli and photo generated transient species was proposed considering the log linear pseudo first order rate constants and lag times on this basis and by using apex software a full kinetic analysis of exogenous bacterial inactivation taking into account both lag time and exponential decay was developed this approach provided insights into the conditions that could make exogenous inactivation competitive with the endogenous process for the e coli inactivation in natural sunlit waters hence this research contributes to the understanding of fundamental kinetic aspects of photoinduced bacterial inactivation which is the basis for light assisted processes such as the solar disinfection sodis graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria inactivation kinetic modeling solar disinfection transient species natural waters 1 introduction solar irradiation of natural waters is an efficient means of disinfection especially against microorganisms such as escherichia coli enterococcus fecalis vibrio cholerae or salmonella sp which are responsible for several enteric diseases mcguigan et al 2012 indeed solar light inactivates bacteria in natural waters and it has been developed into a technique broadly known as sodis which is successfully used in many developing countries in order to obtain safe drinking water fernàndez ibañez et al 2017 ndounla et al 2014 contrary to its simple application solar mediated bacterial inactivation is a complex process that involves a range of diverse intracellular oxidative pathways giannakis et al 2016a b as well as extracellular attacks by reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen or other transient species produced in the water bulk or inside the cell davies colley et al 2000 maraccini et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 natural waters contain compounds that can act as photosensitizers e g chromophoric dissolved organic mater cdom nitrate or nitrite the photosensitizers absorb sunlight and produce a range of reactive transient species for instance the interactions of solar light with cdom nitrate and nitrite yield hydroxyl radical ho vione et al 2006 furthermore cdom can also induce the generation of other species of interest for bacterial inactivation namely singlet oxygen 1o2 and excited triplet states of organic matter 3cdom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 a way to describe the interaction of bacteria with photogenerated transient species i e ho 3cdom 1o2 is kinetic analysis based on second order reaction rate constants serna galvis et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 which is currently used in the case of xenobiotics minella et al 2017 and can also be applied to viruses kohn et al 2016 for chemical contaminants two different methodologies are mostly used to determine the second order reaction rate constants with photo induced transients and they could be considered for bacterial inactivation as well the first method uses probe compounds to determine the steady state concentration or the formation rate of each transient species or scavengers that selectively react with the transients and inhibit the relevant degradation processes de laurentiis et al 2014 the second method is based on competition kinetics which uses reference compounds of known reactivity with the transients and compares their degradation kinetics with that of the target xenobiotic onstein et al 1999 in the case of bacteria the former method may prove difficult to use as the probe compounds and the scavengers which are commonly alcohols or aromatic derivatives and or their degradation products have toxic effect on living cells see text s1 and fig s1 in the supplementary material hereafter sm meanwhile competition kinetics was recently proven to be a viable option in the case of bacteria provided that non toxic reference compounds are chosen and abetted to determine the second order reaction rate constants of transient species with bacteria serna galvis et al 2018 or viruses kohn et al 2016 however these rate constants can only be measured in the exponential decay phase that follows the lag phase in bacterial inactivation serna galvis et al 2018 in many cases bacterial disinfection promoted by sunlight is characterized by an initial lag time followed by an exponential decay giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2015a b ndounla et al 2014 2013 sciacca et al 2010 the prevailing theory for the explanation of the phenomenon lies in the need for damages via an intracellular bacterial oxidative stress and the capacity of bacteria to withstand a certain level of damage demonstrated as lag after which their capacity to maintain their life cycle is diminished giannakis et al 2018 imlay 2003 hence a complete kinetic analysis for describing and modeling disinfection efficiencies and inactivation rates of bacteria in sunlight exposed surface waters should include both lag phase and exponential decay this work presents an innovative strategy for the kinetic analysis of the lag time during the inactivation of bacteria promoted by photo induced transient species initially experimental results of photo induced inactivation of e coli in water which show lag phase and exponential decay are presented after discussing the limitation of competition kinetics to include the lag phase of bacterial inactivation an alternative kinetic analysis is hereby proposed then we determined how the photogenerated transients i e ho 3cdom and 1o2 affect both the lag times and the subsequent exponential inactivation of the bacteria finally a deep kinetic analysis by simulation with the apex software bodrato and vione 2014 of photo induced bacterial inactivation is carried out by including the lag phase under different conditions of water depth and matrix composition 2 materials and

naproxen npx 98 aniline 99 5 n n dimethyl aniline dma 99 furfuryl alcohol ffa 98 and tetra butyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate tba 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich acetonitrile acn 99 8 was obtained from avantor 2 propanol ipa 99 was provided by merck all solutions were prepared using milli q water obtained from a millipore elix merck instrument nano3 was used as source of hydroxyl radicals ho mack and bolton 1999 aq2s was chosen as a proxy compound for cdom to assess the photochemical production of triplet states and their reactivity aq2s belongs to the class of quinones which are significant photoactive components of dissolved organic matter cory and mcknight 2005 when irradiated by uva aq2s selectively produces 3aq2s without yielding either singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radicals loeff et al 1984 maddigapu et al 2010 for this reason in this work 3aq2s was used as 3cdom proxy because 3aq2s is known to be more reactive than typical 3cdom avetta et al 2016 the associated reactivity is an upper limit for that of cdom triplet states finally rose bengal rb was used as source of singlet oxygen 1o2 due to its high ability to generate this transient species kochevar and redmond 2000 2 2 microorganism preparation and bacterial enumeration escherichia coli k12 e coli from the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen dsm no 498 was used for the disinfection experiments e coli was selected as model bacterial species due to its common presence in fecal contaminated waters it is a simple prokaryotic microorganism but it constitutes an adequate model for various types of enteric related diseases giannakis 2018 the bacteria were prepared in the same way as described in our previous works giannakis et al 2015a b in the reaction systems the initial e coli population was 106 cfu ml 1 and was obtained by dilution of the stock solution samples of 1 0 ml were periodically taken from the reactor into sterile eppendorf vials successive dilutions were made using a saline solution of 0 8 w w nacl and 0 08 w w kcl and 100 μl of these were plated on plate count agar and incubated 18 24 h at 37 c before enumeration 2 3 irradiation experiments aqueous samples of 50 ml were introduced in cylindrical pyrex glass bottles diameter 4 cm height 7 5 cm with a cut off wavelength of 295 nm the solutions were magnetically stirred at 350 rpm to ensure a selective excitation of the photosensitizers and minimize the occurrence of any unwanted side photoreactions specific lamps were used for each sensitization experiment three 20 w philips tl d 01 uvb lamps 40 w m 2 irradiance with a narrowband emission at 313 nm were used to generate ho from nano3 five 18 w philips tl d blb lamps 68 w m 2 with a narrowband emission at 365 nm were used to produce 3aq2s the excitation of rb as 1o2 source was done under yellow light using five philips tl d 18 w 16 lamps 38 w m 2 the irradiance emitted by the lamps was measured using an usb2000 spectrophotometer equipped with a pyranometer which is able to measure irradiance from 300 to 2800 nm the lamps were turned on 30 min before the beginning of the experiments to ensure a constant irradiation as well as a constant wavelength emission 2 4 analytical procedures the analysis of the different reference compounds used for competition kinetics with the purpose of assessing their time evolution was done by using a hp agilent 1100 series hplc equipped with a dad detector and an ascentis c18 hplc column the chromatographic methods are summarized in table s1 in the sm 2 5 kinetic modeling of the photo inactivation processes the steady state concentrations of photo induced transient species ho 1o2 3cdom in sunlit natural waters and the corresponding first order rate constants of bacterial inactivation after the lag phase were modeled with the apex software aquatic photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics which is available for free as electronic supplementary information of bodrato and vione 2014 apex predicts photochemical reaction kinetics in the case of bacteria it predicts the exogenous photo inactivation rate constants after the lag phase serna galvis et al 2018 from photo reactivity parameters in this case the second order inactivation rate constants of e coli by ho 1o2 and 3cdom sunlight irradiance and data of water chemistry and depth bodrato and vione 2014 apex calculates the absorption of radiation by the photosensitizers cdom nitrate and nitrite on the basis of competition for sunlight irradiance in a lambert beer approach bodrato and vione 2014 braslavsky 2007 the software considers both the kinetics of transient photo generation by the irradiated photo sensitizers and the scavenging of the transients themselves by the system components in particular ho is scavenged by dom dissolved organic matter of which cdom is the light absorbing fraction as well as by hco3 and co3 2 1o2 is inactivated by collision with water molecules and 3cdom is largely quenched by dissolved o2 vione et al 2014 the model results apply to well mixed waters and provide average values over the whole water column with contributions from the well illuminated surface layer and from darker water in the lower depths loiselle et al 2008 as mentioned the software is suitable to model the exponential decay phase of exogenous bacterial photo inactivation in contrast the modeling of the lag phase cannot be undertaken by using apex alone 3 results and discussion 3 1 the lag phase and exponential decay during e coli disinfection by photo induced transient species the measured experimental data for the photo induced of inactivation of e coli are reported in fig 1 this figure presents e coli inactivation under irradiation in absence and presence of the transient species precursors i e nano3 aq2s and rb two important aspects of the disinfection conditions have to be noted here 1 the precursors did not affect the bacterial population after long periods of exposure in the absence of irradiation 2 under irradiation and in presence of precursor bacterial inactivation was higher than that obtained with light alone such aspects indicate that the precursors at the considered concentration had no disinfecting toxic effect on e coli by themselves i e in the dark and the tested lights effectively promote the transient species formation accelerating bacterial inactivation from fig 1 it can be also noted that in the presence of precursors under irradiation e coli inactivation kinetics demonstrated an initial lag time followed by an exponential decay this behavior has been widely reported for disinfection of both synthetic and real waters by sodis giannakis et al 2015 2018 ndounla et al 2014 2013 sciacca et al 2010 the photo induced bacterial inactivation can involve internal and or external pathways giannakis et al 2018 imlay 2003 since photo generated ho 1o2 and 3aq2s have a short lifetime ns μs which is much shorter than the time taken to diffuse across the membrane thus they can t cross and reach the internal cell components and high reactivity with bacterial cell wall components the damage they inflict to the microorganism would be limited to the membrane itself in other words short lived extracellular transient species kill bacteria or at least impair their ability to replicate as seen by colonies formation by disrupting the cell membrane giannakis et al 2016 2018 however the bacteria can sustain a certain level of damage before rupture therefore for these systems photosensitized with nano3 aq2s and rb a significant amount of damage induced by ho 1o2 or 3aq2s is required to achieve bacterial death via membrane disruption and the transient species action is reflected by a shortening of the lag time indeed a previous report mentions numbers up to 109 ho in order to inactivate 1 cell marugán et al 2008 after the lag phase the exponential inactivation phase can be triggered giannakis et al 2015 2018 in the case of endogenous bacterial inactivation by irradiation alone the lag time is caused by enzymatic dna repair mechanisms that contrast up to a certain degree the dna damage caused by uv photons rastogi et al 2010 hence a complete kinetic analysis of the interaction of bacteria with ho 3aq2s and 1o2 should consider both lag phase and exponential decay 3 2 limitation of the competition kinetics method for a complete analysis of bacterial inactivation the competition kinetics method has been applied to characterize the interaction of bacteria with ho 3aq2s and 1o2 text s2 and serna galvis et al 2018 however the rate constants for e coli inactivation can only be determined after the lag phase has finished which means that the first data point used to calculate the fitting curve of the exponential phase is not the time zero point fig s3 therefore the use of competition kinetics implies that the lag phase of bacterial inactivation is completely ignored this is a strong limitation for the modeling of solar disinfection because the process comprises both the lag phase and the exponential decay therefore a different strategy is required to take the lag phase into account previous works on degradation of organic pollutants in water have shown a good fitting to a lag equation carena et al 2017 thus an alternative option for the kinetic analysis of photo induced bacteria inactivation consists in the fit of the experimental data to a lag type equation having the following form eq 1 1 c f u t c f u o e k t e k l 1 e k l 1 e k t where cfut is the bacterial count at the time t cfuo the initial bacterial count k the pseudo first order rate constant of bacterial inactivation and l the lag time data fit of experimental results taken from fig 1 to eq 1 was tested and a good fit was found depicted in fig 2 then to understand how the photo generated transient species affect both the lag times and the subsequent exponential inactivation phase of the bacteria the concentrations of the experimental photosensitizers i e nano3 aq2s and rb were varied fig s4 and the values for l and k were determined table 1 it can be seen that by increasing the concentration of the experimental photosensitizers i e nano3 aq2s and rb one obtains a shorter lag time and faster decay thereafter in the system containing nitrate under uvb irradiation the main phenomena occurring in the exponential phase after the lag time are endogenous inactivation and exogenous inactivation by ho serna galvis et al 2018 by assuming that both processes independently follow pseudo first order kinetics with respective rate constants k endo and k exo one has k k endo k exo the role of endogenous inactivation can be assessed in irradiation experiments of e coli alone without nano3 which allows for the determination of k endo the value of k exo depends on the reaction between ho and the bacteria as k exo k h o e c o l i ho where k h o e c o l i is the second order inactivation rate constant of e coli by ho 2 5 1011 l mol 1 s 1 serna galvis et al 2018 note that the diffusion control limit in aqueous solution which constitutes an upper limit for the second order reaction rate constants can be much higher than 1010 l mol 1 s 1 if the two reactive species have very different size like ho and a bacterium desmond le quéméner and bouchez 2014 therefore k exo measures the steady state ho in the irradiated system containing nitrate and the experimental value of k obtained upon application of eq 1 can be used to derive ho after accounting for endogenous inactivation i e ho k k endo k h o e c o l i 1 this was derived by using the steady state approach which establishes that k1st order k2nd order transient species ss additionally k h o e c o l i is a known value taken from literature serna galvis et al 2018 by so doing one gets that in the experimental conditions of fig s4a the steady state ho varies in the range of 10 14 10 13 mol l 1 as nano3 varies from 0 005 to 0 05 mol l 1 the concentration of nitrate varies very slowly as the uvb irradiation progresses mack and bolton 1999 thus the ho value found in the exponential decay phase can be considered as representative of the lag phase as well it is interesting to look for a correlation between the lag time and the steady state ho based on the assumption that the higher is ho the faster the bacterial membrane is damaged and the shorter is the lag time as a consequence however irradiation itself also contributes to cell damage and the irradiation of the bacteria without nitrate yields a lag time as well in the case of the irradiation experiments in the presence of nitrate one can make the simplified but reasonable assumption that the lag time is due to the action of two independent processes radiation endogenous and ho exogenous the time l taken to reach the threshold the loss of bacterial cell integrity by the two processes acting together is lower than the times taken by the two processes acting separately l endo and l exo respectively therefore the experimentally observed lag time l can be expressed as follows eq 2 hammes 1978 2 1 l 1 l e n d o 1 l e x o the value of l endo can be derived from the irradiation alone experiments without nano3 and in our conditions a value of 35 min was obtained from eq 2 one can then derive the value of l exo and then study the effect of ho on l exo the plot of l exo vs ho fig 3 showed a decreasing trend that was phenomenologically well fitted with an exponential function r2 0 996 having the following form eq 3 3 l e x o 158 10 e 3 0 0 3 10 13 h o where l exo is in minutes and ho has units of m mol l 1 l exo varied from 114 to 15 min as ho varied between 1 9 10 14 mol l 1 fig 3 figure s4b presents the inactivation of e coli under uva irradiation only with aq2s in the dark as well as under uva in the presence of aq2s at different concentrations aq2s in the dark control experiment showed no inactivation even after 180 min of contact time with the bacteria uva radiation alone induced a 2 log bacterial reduction in the studied time frame of 180 min and the trend of the curve suggests that higher inactivation could be reached at longer irradiation times on the other hand the addition of aq2s under irradiation significantly improved inactivation in particular 6 log inactivation could be reached in 120 min irradiation in the presence of 0 50 mm aq2s both table 1 and fig s4b suggest that the lag time did not change much as aq2s increased considering that the triplet state 3aq2s is by far the main reactive species in irradiated aq2s solutions bedini et al 2012 maddigapu et al 2010 it can be inferred that 3aq2s accelerated degradation by increasing k but had practically no effect on l a possible tentative explanation for this behavior is that 3aq2s is too bulky to reach cell membrane sites where to make damage differently from the much smaller ho in contrast during the lag phase aq2s may have time to enter the bacterial cell and there contribute to the acceleration of the exponential decay phase through formation of intra cellular 3aq2s figure s4c shows the inactivation trend of e coli in the presence of rose bengal rb as 1o2 source first of all the control experiment with rb in the dark showed that this compound is not toxic for bacteria moreover no inactivation was caused by yellow light alone 550 nm which can be related to the low energy of this long wavelength radiation in contrast significant inactivation was caused by the simultaneous occurrence of rb and yellow light which is known to yield 1o2 kellogg and fridovich 1975 for instance a 5 log inactivation was found after 3 h irradiation in the presence of 50 μm rb and when doubling the rb concentration the inactivation rate increased to achieve 6 log reduction after 2 5 h 150 min by applying the same approach as in the case of hydroxyl radical nano3 irradiation it was possible to assess the values of k exo and l exo that can be attributed to the action of 1o2 moreover absence of inactivation by yellow light alone ensures that k exo k and l exo l also in this case the bacteria can be used as 1o2 probes in the irradiated solutions k exo k o 2 1 e c o l i 1o2 serna galvis et al 2018 and by so doing one obtains that l exo values in the range of 65 40 min are associated to steady state 1o2 in the range of 0 7 1 0 10 10 mol l 1 interestingly the steady state 1o2 obtained here for 100 μmol l 1 rb 10 10 mol l 1 is one order of magnitude higher compared to a previous study that used 10 μmol l 1 rb i e 10 times lower compared to this study under an otherwise similar irradiation set up de laurentiis et al 2014 1o2 can thus induce similar l exo values as ho but with 1o2 103 ho interestingly this ratio runs in the opposite direction compared to the second order reaction rate constants of 1o2 and ho with e coli k h o e c o l i k o 2 1 e c o l i 1 104 serna galvis et al 2018 and table s2 3 3 implications for sunlit natural waters in the previous sections it was shown that e coli could be inactivated by ho 1o2 and triplet states in an exponential way after a certain lag time however as far as the lag time itself is concerned the triplet state 3aq2s played a negligible role considering that 3aq2s is usually more reactive than average 3cdom avetta et al 2016 it can be reasonably assumed that the natural excited tripled states 3cdom would not affect the bacterial lag time the lag time could be modified in the presence of ho and 1o2 and a comparable effect of the two species was observed for 1o2 103 ho in sunlit natural waters one often has 1o2 ho vione et al 2014 but it is important to assess which 1o2 ho 1 ratios can be expected under different environmental conditions in this way one can see which of the two species is most likely to affect the lag time of the bacteria in the natural environment to this purpose photochemical modeling with the apex software was carried out under different conditions of water depth and chemistry with particular emphasis on doc nitrate and nitrite that are most likely to affect the steady state ho and 1o2 vione et al 2014 the chosen conditions of sunlight irradiance were referred to the tropical belt 19 n 15 july at noon under clear sky and the sunlight spectrum was obtained by means of the tuv software national center for atmospheric research 2015 the choice of the latitude is motivated by the fact that bacteria photoinactivation is often exploited at the tropics e g in the case of solar disinfection sodis for water treatment fernàndez ibañez et al 2017 ndounla et al 2014 the simulation results are reported in fig 4 under conditions of relatively high nitrate and nitrite 10 4 and 10 6 mol l 1 respectively fig 4a that tend to favor the ho occurrence or with low nitrate and nitrite 10 6 and 10 8 mol l 1 respectively fig 4b that would in contrast favor 1o2 processes at the expense of ho vione et al 2014 the 1o2 ho 1 ratio under the modeled conditions never exceeded 102 although higher ratios could be obtained for doc 10 mgc l 1 one would require unrealistically high doc values to get 1o2 103 ho which is suggested by our experimental results to be the ratio where the two species comparably affect the bacterial lag time the reported results were obtained by means of modeling but there is evidence that the model reliability is high kohn et al 2016 and the safety margin between 102 and 103 range is enough to ensure the validity of the present conclusions moreover experimental data obtained upon simulated sunlight irradiation of lake water samples from temperate areas yielded 1o2 ho 1 102 vione et al 2010 which is not far from our model results therefore because 1o2 103 ho is hardly attained in natural waters one can conclude that the e coli exogenous lag time in the natural environment would be mainly controlled by ho in the case of the exogenous inactivation of e coli an approach to model the exponential decay phase which is accounted for by ho 3cdom and 1o2 after the lag time has already been developed in our previous publication serna galvis et al 2018 moreover the ho affected lag time of exogenous inactivation is described by eq 3 such an equation is just phenomenological thus it is only valid in the same 10 14 mol l 1 ho range where it was obtained despite these limitations the present approach allows for a complete modeling lag time plus exponential phase of the exogenous photoinactivation of e coli under sunlight irradiation an example of the comparison between experimental irradiation data e coli inactivation by irradiated nano3 and photochemical modeling based on eqs 1 3 is provided in fig 5 showing a satisfactory agreement to allow for comparison with actual experimental data experimentally derived endogenous inactivation kinetics was added to the modeled exogenous one to produce the predictive curves in the fig 5 in order to obtain steady state ho values around 10 14 mol l 1 in a real world setting we had to assume summertime and fair weather tropical irradiation conditions 15 july 19 n high nitrate low doc and low water depth the apex software was thus employed to search for suitable environmental conditions that provide ho in the range of 10 14 mol l 1 considering that solar disinfection can be used in tropical countries to obtain drinking water fernàndez ibañez et al 2017 ndounla et al 2014 the chosen nitrate levels up to 1 mm were in the upper range of those still compatible with the who guidelines for drinking water quality world health organization 2017 full photochemical modeling of bacterial inactivation should take the form of eq 1 thus there is the need to provide a model assessment of both the first order inactivation rate constant k and the lag time l the model determination of k can be made with the apex software on the basis of sunlight irradiance water chemistry depth as well as the e coli inactivation rate constants with ho 3cdom and 1o2 following a procedure that has been already described serna galvis et al 2018 the assessment of l can be done with eq 3 provided that ho is not far from 10 14 mol l 1 levels an example of the results that can be obtained in this scenario is provided in fig 6 where the complete inactivation curves are shown for different ho levels the water conditions that produce the relevant ho values are given in the figure caption with ho 10 14 mol l 1 the hydroxyl radical would largely control not only the lag time l but also the inactivation rate constant k the results reported in fig 6 suggest a quite fast bacterial photo inactivation which would make the exogenous process competitive with the endogenous one it should be stressed that these results were obtained by assuming specific water conditions low depth very low doc high nitrate low depth and low doc are quite applicable to sodis conditions because low water depth is prescribed in the guidelines of sodis that suppose disinfection in pet or glass bottles max 2 l volume 10 cm diameter while low doc values are preferred for drinking water additionally nitrate values in the high μm range are common and even 1 2 mm nitrate is reported for water intended for human use ndounla et al 2014 finally it should be observed that the approach described here allowed us to fully model the exogenous bacterial photo inactivation trend under natural water conditions that are characterized by high ho in several real cases the steady state ho would actually be lower and sometimes much lower than 10 14 mol l 1 however in such circumstances the ho induced rate constant of exponential inactivation would also be quite low and the ho associated lag time quite long making bacterial inactivation by ho ineffective therefore in the presence of low ho the associated inactivation kinetics would be slow as compared with typical sodis exposure times serna galvis et al 2018 making the role of ho in bacterial inactivation negligible therefore while on the one hand our approach strictly requires ho in the range of 10 14 mol l 1 to fully model e coli inactivation on the other hand lower ho levels would produce insignificant inactivation that is of limited interest for modeling moreover to obtain ho 10 14 mol l 1 that is also outside our modeling range one needs toxic nitrate concentration values that are not relevant to sodis additionally it must be mentioned that in actual waters photoinduced ros such as hydroxyl radical or singlet oxygen are able to react with other components in the aqueous media alvear daza et al 2018 gutiérrez zapata et al 2017 hence due the competition effects in such context the ros induced rate constant of exponential inactivation could also be lower than predicted by the modeling 4 conclusions the photoinduced e coli inactivation has both lag and exponential decay phases and a quantitative description of the system cannot be achieved by using competition kinetics alone which only helps quantify the exponential phase we showed that the lag time is mostly influenced by irradiation endogenous inactivation and ho exogenous inactivation while 1o2 and triplet states only affect the exponential phase the contribution of ho to the lag time l was phenomenologically well fitted with an exponential function that correlates l with the steady state ho unfortunately this phenomenological equation works just in the 10 14 mol l 1 ho range where it was obtained but we got evidence that only these steady state concentration values are significant to sodis indeed apex modeling of the exogenous photo inactivation of e coli suggests that lower ho would produce insignificant cell death thus ho in such conditions would hardly affect either the lag or the exponential phase on the other hand much higher ho values are not significant to sodis because they require excessively high nitrate levels that would be toxic for humans therefore despite its limitations our approach achieved the full modeling of exogenous photo inactivation where it has chances to be significant the next problem to be tackled in future works should be the full modeling of endogenous bacterial inactivation with particular emphasis on the lag phase different strains and different microorganisms might have dissimilar responses to extracellular damages thus for the extracellular photosensitized inactivation the differences among strains and microorganisms would be reflected by the corresponding values of reaction rate constants related to the exponential decay after the lag phase in turn for internal inactivation promoted by uvb or uva light on some bacteria exhibiting strong antioxidant capacity e g presence of high number of catalases it could be expected a longer lag phase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen or other transient species produced in the water bulk or inside the cell davies colley et al 2000 maraccini et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 natural waters contain compounds that can act as photosensitizers e g chromophoric dissolved organic mater cdom nitrate or nitrite the photosensitizers absorb sunlight and produce a range of reactive transient species for instance the interactions of solar light with cdom nitrate and nitrite yield hydroxyl radical ho vione et al 2006 furthermore cdom can also induce the generation of other species of interest for bacterial inactivation namely singlet oxygen 1o2 and excited triplet states of organic matter 3cdom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 a way to describe the interaction of bacteria with photogenerated transient species i e ho 3cdom 1o2 is kinetic analysis based on second order reaction rate constants serna galvis et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 which is currently used in the case of xenobiotics minella et al 2017 and can also be applied to viruses kohn et al 2016 for chemical contaminants two different methodologies are mostly used to determine the second order reaction rate constants with photo induced transients and they could be considered for bacterial inactivation as well the first method uses probe compounds to determine the steady state concentration or the formation rate of each transient species or scavengers that selectively react with the transients and inhibit the relevant degradation processes de laurentiis et al 2014 the second method is based on competition kinetics which uses reference compounds of known reactivity with the transients and compares their degradation kinetics with that of the target xenobiotic onstein et al 1999 in the case of bacteria the former method may prove difficult to use as the probe compounds and the scavengers which are commonly alcohols or aromatic derivatives and or their degradation products have toxic effect on living cells see text s1 and fig s1 in the supplementary material hereafter sm meanwhile competition kinetics was recently proven to be a viable option in the case of bacteria provided that non toxic reference compounds are chosen and abetted to determine the second order reaction rate constants of transient species with bacteria serna galvis et al 2018 or viruses kohn et al 2016 however these rate constants can only be measured in the exponential decay phase that follows the lag phase in bacterial inactivation serna galvis et al 2018 in many cases bacterial disinfection promoted by sunlight is characterized by an initial lag time followed by an exponential decay giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2015a b ndounla et al 2014 2013 sciacca et al 2010 the prevailing theory for the explanation of the phenomenon lies in the need for damages via an intracellular bacterial oxidative stress and the capacity of bacteria to withstand a certain level of damage demonstrated as lag after which their capacity to maintain their life cycle is diminished giannakis et al 2018 imlay 2003 hence a complete kinetic analysis for describing and modeling disinfection efficiencies and inactivation rates of bacteria in sunlight exposed surface waters should include both lag phase and exponential decay this work presents an innovative strategy for the kinetic analysis of the lag time during the inactivation of bacteria promoted by photo induced transient species initially experimental results of photo induced inactivation of e coli in water which show lag phase and exponential decay are presented after discussing the limitation of competition kinetics to include the lag phase of bacterial inactivation an alternative kinetic analysis is hereby proposed then we determined how the photogenerated transients i e ho 3cdom and 1o2 affect both the lag times and the subsequent exponential inactivation of the bacteria finally a deep kinetic analysis by simulation with the apex software bodrato and vione 2014 of photo induced bacterial inactivation is carried out by including the lag phase under different conditions of water depth and matrix composition 2 materials and

mack and bolton 1999 aq2s was chosen as a proxy compound for cdom to assess the photochemical production of triplet states and their reactivity aq2s belongs to the class of quinones which are significant photoactive components of dissolved organic matter cory and mcknight 2005 when irradiated by uva aq2s selectively produces 3aq2s without yielding either singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radicals loeff et al 1984 maddigapu et al 2010 for this reason in this work 3aq2s was used as 3cdom proxy because 3aq2s is known to be more reactive than typical 3cdom avetta et al 2016 the associated reactivity is an upper limit for that of cdom triplet states finally rose bengal rb was used as source of singlet oxygen 1o2 due to its high ability to generate this transient species kochevar and redmond 2000 2 2 microorganism preparation and bacterial enumeration escherichia coli k12 e coli from the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen dsm no 498 was used for the disinfection experiments e coli was selected as model bacterial species due to its common presence in fecal contaminated waters it is a simple prokaryotic microorganism but it constitutes an adequate model for various types of enteric related diseases giannakis 2018 the bacteria were prepared in the same way as described in our previous works giannakis et al 2015a b in the reaction systems the initial e coli population was 106 cfu ml 1 and was obtained by dilution of the stock solution samples of 1 0 ml were periodically taken from the reactor into sterile eppendorf vials successive dilutions were made using a saline solution of 0 8 w w nacl and 0 08 w w kcl and 100 μl of these were plated on plate count agar and incubated 18 24 h at 37 c before enumeration 2 3 irradiation experiments aqueous samples of 50 ml were introduced in cylindrical pyrex glass bottles diameter 4 cm height 7 5 cm with a cut off wavelength of 295 nm the solutions were magnetically stirred at 350 rpm to ensure a selective excitation of the photosensitizers and minimize the occurrence of any unwanted side photoreactions specific lamps were used for each sensitization experiment three 20 w philips tl d 01 uvb lamps 40 w m 2 irradiance with a narrowband emission at 313 nm were used to generate ho from nano3 five 18 w philips tl d blb lamps 68 w m 2 with a narrowband emission at 365 nm were used to produce 3aq2s the excitation of rb as 1o2 source was done under yellow light using five philips tl d 18 w 16 lamps 38 w m 2 the irradiance emitted by the lamps was measured using an usb2000 spectrophotometer equipped with a pyranometer which is able to measure irradiance from 300 to 2800 nm the lamps were turned on 30 min before the beginning of the experiments to ensure a constant irradiation as well as a constant wavelength emission 2 4 analytical procedures the analysis of the different reference compounds used for competition kinetics with the purpose of assessing their time evolution was done by using a hp agilent 1100 series hplc equipped with a dad detector and an ascentis c18 hplc column the chromatographic methods are summarized in table s1 in the sm 2 5 kinetic modeling of the photo inactivation processes the steady state concentrations of photo induced transient species ho 1o2 3cdom in sunlit natural waters and the corresponding first order rate

supplementary information of bodrato and vione 2014 apex predicts photochemical reaction kinetics in the case of bacteria it predicts the exogenous photo inactivation rate constants after the lag phase serna galvis et al 2018 from photo reactivity parameters in this case the second order inactivation rate constants of e coli by ho 1o2 and 3cdom sunlight irradiance and data of water chemistry and depth bodrato and vione 2014 apex calculates the absorption of radiation by the photosensitizers cdom nitrate and nitrite on the basis of competition for sunlight irradiance in a lambert beer approach bodrato and vione 2014 braslavsky 2007 the software considers both the kinetics of transient photo generation by the irradiated photo sensitizers and the scavenging of the transients themselves by the system components in particular ho is scavenged by dom dissolved organic matter of which cdom is the light absorbing fraction as well as by hco3 and co3 2 1o2 is inactivated by collision with water molecules and 3cdom is largely quenched by dissolved o2 vione et al 2014 the model results apply to well mixed waters and provide average values over the whole water column with contributions from the well illuminated surface layer and from darker water in the lower depths loiselle et al 2008 as mentioned the software is suitable to model the exponential decay phase of exogenous bacterial photo inactivation in contrast the modeling of the lag phase cannot be undertaken by using apex alone 3 results and discussion 3 1 the lag phase and exponential decay during e coli disinfection by photo induced transient species the measured experimental data for the photo induced of inactivation of e coli are reported in fig 1 this figure presents e coli inactivation under irradiation in absence and presence of the transient species precursors i e nano3 aq2s and rb two important aspects of the disinfection conditions have to be noted here 1 the precursors did not affect the bacterial population after long periods of exposure in the absence of irradiation 2 under irradiation and in presence of precursor bacterial inactivation was higher than that obtained with light alone such aspects indicate that the precursors at the considered concentration had no disinfecting toxic effect on e coli by themselves i e in the dark and the tested lights effectively promote the transient species formation accelerating bacterial inactivation from fig 1 it can be also noted that in the presence of precursors under irradiation e coli inactivation kinetics demonstrated an initial lag time followed by an exponential decay this behavior has been widely reported for disinfection of both synthetic and real waters by sodis giannakis et al 2015 2018 ndounla et al 2014 2013 sciacca et al 2010 the photo induced bacterial inactivation can involve internal and or external pathways giannakis et al 2018 imlay 2003 since photo generated ho 1o2 and 3aq2s have a short lifetime ns μs which is much shorter than the time taken to diffuse across the membrane thus they can t cross and reach the internal cell components and high reactivity with bacterial cell wall components the damage they inflict to the microorganism would be limited to the membrane itself in other words short lived extracellular transient species kill bacteria or at least impair their ability to replicate as seen by colonies formation by disrupting the cell membrane giannakis et al 2016 2018 however the bacteria can sustain a certain level of damage before rupture therefore for these systems photosensitized with nano3 aq2s and rb a significant amount of damage induced by ho 1o2 or 3aq2s is required to achieve bacterial death via membrane disruption and the transient species action is reflected by a shortening of the lag time indeed a previous report mentions numbers up to 109 ho in order to inactivate 1 cell marugán et al 2008 after the lag phase the exponential inactivation phase can be triggered giannakis et al 2015 2018 in the case of endogenous bacterial inactivation by irradiation alone the lag time is caused by enzymatic dna repair mechanisms that contrast up to a certain degree the dna damage caused by uv photons rastogi et al 2010 hence a complete kinetic analysis of the interaction of bacteria with ho 3aq2s and 1o2 should consider both lag phase and exponential decay 3 2 limitation of the competition kinetics method for a complete analysis of bacterial inactivation the competition kinetics method has been applied to characterize the interaction of bacteria with ho 3aq2s and 1o2 text s2 and serna galvis et al 2018 however the rate constants for e coli inactivation can only be determined after the lag phase has finished which means that the first data point used to calculate the fitting curve of the exponential phase is not the time zero point fig s3 therefore the use of competition kinetics implies that the lag phase of bacterial inactivation is completely ignored this is a strong limitation for the modeling of solar disinfection because the process comprises both the lag phase and the exponential decay therefore a different strategy is required to take the lag phase into account previous works on degradation of organic pollutants in water have shown a good fitting to a lag equation carena et al 2017 thus an alternative option for the kinetic analysis of photo induced bacteria inactivation consists in the fit of the experimental data to a lag type equation having the following form eq 1 1 c f u t c f u o e k t e k l 1 e k l 1 e k t where cfut is the bacterial count at the time t cfuo the initial bacterial count k the pseudo first order rate constant of bacterial inactivation and l the lag time data fit of experimental results taken from fig 1 to eq 1 was tested and a good fit was found depicted in fig 2 then to understand how the photo generated transient species affect both the lag times and the subsequent exponential inactivation phase of the bacteria the concentrations of the experimental photosensitizers i e nano3 aq2s and rb were varied fig s4 and the values for l and k were determined table 1 it can be seen that by increasing the concentration of the experimental photosensitizers i e nano3 aq2s and rb one obtains a shorter lag time and faster decay thereafter in the system containing nitrate under uvb irradiation the main phenomena occurring in the exponential phase after the lag time are endogenous inactivation and exogenous inactivation by ho serna galvis et al 2018 by assuming that both processes independently follow pseudo first order kinetics with respective rate constants k endo and k exo one has k k endo k exo the role of endogenous inactivation can be assessed in irradiation experiments of e coli alone without nano3 which allows for the determination of k endo the value of k exo depends on the reaction between ho and the bacteria as k exo k h o e c o l i ho where k h o e c o l i is the second order inactivation rate constant of e coli by ho 2 5 1011 l mol 1 s 1 serna galvis et al 2018 note that the diffusion control limit in aqueous solution which constitutes an upper limit for the second order reaction rate constants can be much higher than 1010 l mol 1 s 1 if the two reactive species have very different size like ho and a bacterium desmond le quéméner and bouchez 2014 therefore k exo measures the steady state ho in the irradiated system containing nitrate and the experimental value of k obtained upon application of eq 1 can be used to derive ho after accounting for endogenous inactivation i e ho k k endo k h o e c o l i 1 this was derived by using the steady state approach which establishes that k1st order k2nd order transient species ss additionally k h o e c o l i is a known value taken from literature serna galvis et al 2018 by so doing one gets that in the experimental conditions of fig s4a the steady state ho varies in the range of 10 14 10 13 mol l 1 as nano3 varies from 0 005 to 0 05 mol l 1 the concentration of nitrate varies very slowly as the uvb irradiation progresses mack and bolton 1999 thus the ho value found in the exponential decay phase can be considered as representative of the lag phase as well it is interesting to look for a correlation between the lag time and the steady state ho based on the assumption that the higher is ho the faster the bacterial membrane is damaged and the shorter is the lag time as a consequence however irradiation itself also contributes to cell damage and the irradiation of the bacteria without nitrate yields a lag time as well in the case of the irradiation experiments in the presence of nitrate one can make the simplified but reasonable assumption that the lag time is due to the action of two independent processes radiation endogenous and ho exogenous the time l taken to reach the threshold the loss of bacterial cell integrity by the two processes acting together is lower than the times taken by the two processes acting separately l endo and l exo respectively therefore the experimentally observed lag time l can be expressed as follows eq 2 hammes 1978 2 1 l 1 l e n d o 1 l e x o the value of l endo can be derived from the irradiation alone experiments without nano3 and in our conditions a value of 35 min was obtained from eq 2 one can then derive the value of l exo and then study the effect of ho on l exo the plot of l exo vs ho fig 3 showed a decreasing trend that was phenomenologically well fitted with an exponential function r2 0 996 having the following form eq 3 3 l e x o 158 10 e 3 0 0 3 10 13 h o where l exo is in minutes and ho has units of m mol l 1 l exo varied from 114 to 15 min as ho varied between 1 9 10 14 mol l 1 fig 3 figure s4b presents the inactivation of e coli under uva irradiation only with aq2s in the dark as well as under uva in the presence of aq2s at different concentrations aq2s in the dark control experiment showed no inactivation even after 180 min of contact time with the bacteria uva radiation alone induced a 2 log bacterial reduction in the studied time frame of 180 min and the trend of the curve suggests that higher inactivation could be reached at longer irradiation times on the other hand the addition of aq2s under irradiation significantly improved inactivation in particular 6 log inactivation could be reached in 120 min irradiation in the presence of 0 50 mm aq2s both table 1 and fig s4b suggest that the lag time did not change much as aq2s increased considering that the triplet state 3aq2s is by far the main reactive species in irradiated aq2s solutions bedini et al 2012 maddigapu et al 2010 it can be inferred that 3aq2s accelerated degradation by increasing k but had practically no effect on l a possible tentative explanation for this behavior is that 3aq2s is too bulky to reach cell membrane sites where to make damage differently from the much smaller ho in contrast during the lag phase aq2s may have time to enter the bacterial cell and there contribute to the acceleration of the exponential decay phase through formation of intra cellular 3aq2s figure s4c shows the inactivation trend of e coli in the presence of rose bengal rb as 1o2 source first of all the control experiment with rb in the dark showed that this compound is not toxic for bacteria moreover no inactivation was caused by yellow light alone 550 nm which can be related to the low energy of this long wavelength radiation in contrast significant inactivation was caused by the simultaneous occurrence of rb and yellow light which is known to yield 1o2 kellogg and fridovich 1975 for instance a 5 log inactivation was found after 3 h irradiation in the presence of 50 μm rb and when doubling the rb concentration the inactivation rate increased to achieve 6 log reduction after 2 5 h 150 min by applying the same approach as in the case of hydroxyl radical nano3 irradiation it was possible to assess the values of k exo and l exo that can be attributed to the action of 1o2 moreover absence of inactivation by yellow light alone ensures that k exo k and l exo l also in this case the bacteria can be used as 1o2 probes in the irradiated solutions k exo k o 2 1 e c o l i 1o2 serna galvis et al 2018 and by so doing one obtains that l exo values in the range of 65 40 min are associated to steady state 1o2 in the range of 0 7 1 0 10 10 mol l 1 interestingly the steady state 1o2 obtained here for 100 μmol l 1 rb 10 10 mol l 1 is one order of magnitude higher compared to a previous study that used 10 μmol l 1 rb i e 10 times lower compared to this study under an otherwise similar irradiation set up de laurentiis et al 2014 1o2 can thus induce similar l exo values as ho but with 1o2 103 ho interestingly this ratio runs in the opposite direction compared to the second order reaction rate constants of 1o2 and ho with e coli k h o e c o l i k o 2 1 e c o l i 1 104 serna galvis et al 2018 and table s2 3 3 implications for sunlit natural waters in the previous sections it was shown that e coli could be inactivated by ho 1o2 and triplet states in an exponential way after a certain lag time however as far as the lag time itself is concerned the triplet state 3aq2s played a negligible role considering that 3aq2s is usually more reactive than average 3cdom avetta et al 2016 it can be reasonably assumed that the natural excited tripled states 3cdom would not affect the bacterial lag time the lag time could be modified in the presence of ho and 1o2 and a comparable effect of the two species was observed for 1o2 103 ho in sunlit natural waters one often has 1o2 ho vione et al 2014 but it is important to assess which 1o2 ho 1 ratios can be expected under different environmental conditions in this way one can see which of the two species is most likely to affect the lag time of the bacteria in the natural environment to this purpose photochemical modeling with the apex software was carried out under different conditions of water depth and chemistry with particular emphasis on doc nitrate and nitrite that are most likely to affect the steady state ho and 1o2 vione et al 2014 the chosen conditions of sunlight irradiance were referred to the tropical belt 19 n 15 july at noon under clear sky and the sunlight spectrum was obtained by means of the tuv software national center for atmospheric research 2015 the choice of the latitude is motivated by the fact that bacteria photoinactivation is often exploited at the tropics e g in the case of solar disinfection sodis for water treatment fernàndez ibañez et al 2017 ndounla et al 2014 the simulation results are reported in fig 4 under conditions of relatively high nitrate and nitrite 10 4 and 10 6 mol l 1 respectively fig 4a that tend to favor the ho occurrence or with low nitrate and nitrite 10 6 and 10 8 mol l 1 respectively fig 4b that would in contrast favor 1o2 processes at the expense of ho vione et al 2014 the 1o2 ho 1 ratio under the modeled conditions never exceeded 102 although higher ratios could be obtained for doc 10 mgc l 1 one would require unrealistically high doc values to get 1o2 103 ho which is suggested by our experimental results to be the ratio where the two species comparably affect the bacterial lag time the reported results were obtained by means of modeling but there is evidence that the model reliability is high kohn et al 2016 and the safety margin between 102 and 103 range is enough to ensure the validity of the present conclusions moreover experimental data obtained upon simulated sunlight irradiation of lake water samples from temperate areas yielded 1o2 ho 1 102 vione et al 2010 which is not far from our model results therefore because 1o2 103 ho is hardly attained in natural waters one can conclude that the e coli exogenous lag time in the natural environment would be mainly controlled by ho in the case of the exogenous inactivation of e coli an approach to model the exponential decay phase which is accounted for by ho 3cdom and 1o2 after the lag time has already been developed in our previous publication serna galvis et al 2018 moreover the ho affected lag time of exogenous inactivation is described by eq 3 such an equation is just phenomenological thus it is only valid in the same 10 14 mol l 1 ho range where it was obtained despite these limitations the present approach allows for a complete modeling lag time plus exponential phase of the exogenous photoinactivation of e coli under sunlight irradiation an example of the comparison between experimental irradiation data e coli inactivation by irradiated nano3 and photochemical modeling based on eqs 1 3 is provided in fig 5 showing a satisfactory agreement to allow for comparison with actual experimental data experimentally derived endogenous inactivation kinetics was added to the modeled exogenous one to produce the predictive curves in the fig 5 in order to obtain steady state ho values around 10 14 mol l 1 in a real world setting we had to assume summertime and fair weather tropical irradiation conditions 15 july 19 n high nitrate low doc and low water depth the apex software was thus employed to search for suitable environmental conditions that provide ho in the range of 10 14 mol l 1 considering that solar disinfection can be used in tropical countries to obtain drinking water fernàndez ibañez et al 2017 ndounla et al 2014 the chosen nitrate levels up to 1 mm were in the upper range of those still compatible with the who guidelines for drinking water quality world health organization 2017 full photochemical modeling of bacterial inactivation should take the form of eq 1 thus there is the need to provide a model assessment of both the first order inactivation rate constant k and the lag time l the model determination of k can be made with the apex software on the basis of sunlight irradiance water chemistry depth as well as the e coli inactivation rate constants with ho 3cdom and 1o2 following a procedure that has been already described serna galvis et al 2018 the assessment of l can be done with eq 3 provided that ho is not far from 10 14 mol l 1 levels an example of the results that can be obtained in this scenario is provided in fig 6 where the complete inactivation curves are shown for different ho levels the water conditions that produce the relevant ho values are given in the figure caption with ho 10 14 mol l 1 the hydroxyl radical would largely control not only the lag time l but also the inactivation rate constant k the results reported in fig 6 suggest a quite fast bacterial photo inactivation which would make the exogenous process competitive with the endogenous one it should be stressed that these results were obtained by assuming specific water conditions low depth very low doc high nitrate low depth and low doc are quite applicable to sodis conditions because low water depth is prescribed in the guidelines of sodis that suppose disinfection in pet or glass bottles max 2 l volume 10 cm diameter while low doc values are preferred for drinking water additionally nitrate values in the high μm range are common and even 1 2 mm nitrate is reported for water intended for human use ndounla et al 2014 finally it should be observed that the approach described here allowed us to fully model the exogenous bacterial photo inactivation trend under natural water conditions that are characterized by high ho in several real cases the steady state ho would actually be lower and sometimes much lower than 10 14 mol l 1 however in such circumstances the ho induced rate constant of exponential inactivation would also be quite low and the ho associated lag time quite long making bacterial inactivation by ho ineffective therefore in the presence of low ho the associated inactivation kinetics would be slow as compared with typical sodis exposure times serna galvis et al 2018 making the role of ho in bacterial inactivation negligible therefore while on the one hand our approach strictly requires ho in the range of 10 14 mol l 1 to fully model e coli inactivation on the other hand lower ho levels would produce insignificant inactivation that is of limited interest for modeling moreover to obtain ho 10 14 mol l 1 that is also outside our modeling range one needs toxic nitrate concentration values that are not relevant to sodis additionally it must be mentioned that in actual waters photoinduced ros such as hydroxyl radical or singlet oxygen are able to react with other components in the aqueous media alvear daza et al 2018 gutiérrez zapata et al 2017 hence due the competition effects in such context the ros induced rate constant of exponential inactivation could also be lower than predicted by the modeling 4 conclusions the photoinduced e coli inactivation has both lag and exponential decay phases and a quantitative description of the system cannot be achieved by using competition kinetics alone which only helps quantify the exponential phase we showed that the lag time is mostly influenced by irradiation endogenous inactivation and ho exogenous inactivation while 1o2 and triplet states only affect the exponential phase the contribution of ho to the lag time l was phenomenologically well fitted with an exponential function that correlates l with the steady state ho unfortunately this phenomenological equation works just in the 10 14 mol l 1 ho range where it was obtained but we got evidence that only these steady state concentration values are significant to sodis indeed apex modeling of the exogenous photo inactivation of e coli suggests that lower ho would produce insignificant cell death thus ho in such conditions would hardly affect either the lag or the exponential phase on the other hand much higher ho values are not significant to sodis because they require excessively high nitrate levels that would be toxic for humans therefore despite its limitations our approach achieved the full modeling of exogenous photo inactivation where it has chances to be significant the next problem to be tackled in future works should be the full modeling of endogenous bacterial inactivation with particular emphasis on the lag phase different strains and different microorganisms might have dissimilar responses to extracellular damages thus for the extracellular photosensitized inactivation the differences among strains and microorganisms would be reflected by the corresponding values of reaction rate constants related to the exponential decay after the lag phase in turn for internal inactivation promoted by uvb or uva light on some bacteria exhibiting strong antioxidant capacity e g presence of high number of catalases it could be expected a longer lag phase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

dimethoate and malathion were chosen as model compounds to investigate transformation containing phosphate phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate in ad system tcep and tdcpp appear to be the most

crucial multi element fingerprinting of chemicals via compound specific stable isotope analysis csia was applied to trace the degradation mechanisms making use of isotope fractionation concepts meyer et al 2009 penning et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 several studies on csia to trace abiotic hydrolysis of ops have been reported wu et al 2018a 2017 2014 a recent study on natural attenuation of parathion by hydrolysis at a contaminated field site in denmark using csia was described wu et al 2018b indicating that the isotope fractionation pattern has potential to characterize and monitor hydrolysis in field studies moreover application of csia for investigating the biotransformation of hexachlorocyclohexanes in biogas slurry has been recently published lian et al 2018 to our best knowledge this is the first report that elucidates biotransformation of ops in biogas reactors making use of isotope fractionation to characterize the bond cleavage of the initial degradation reactions steps this study intends to evaluate the degradation mechanism of phosphate phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate derivatives in ad using biogas slurries from a pilot scale biogas plant as a model system in case of effective transformation phytoremediation peuke and rennenberg 2005 combined with ad can also be considered as a potential strategy for environmental cleanup lian et al 2018 the specific objectives of

operated with an organic loading rate of 3 5 gvsl 1day 1 and hydraulic retention time of 47 days utilizing maize silage and cattle manure as main substrates the slurry was sieved 1 cm before using for biodegradation assays 2 3 ops biodegradation assays with biogas slurry for assessing biodegradation of ops in ad system the original slurry was used the cell free supernatant was assigned for study on enzymatic hydrolysis of ops in order to obtain the cell free fraction slurry from biogas reactor was centrifuged at 16 100 g 4 c for 20 min to remove solid particles and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter merck millipore the slurry was autoclaved 121 c 30 min three times in bottles for sterilized control experiments thus four sets of experiments were conducted simultaneously i original slurry directly taken from the biogas plant was used to detect the capability of microbes for ops degradation ii cell free slurry after centrifugation and filtration see above was utilized to analyze the hydrolytic activity of extracellular enzymes iii sterilized slurry was used for assuming that cells were killed and enzyme activity were inactivated by elevated temperature typical for sterilization iv chemical hydrolysis experiments of op with tris hcl buffer at ph 7 4 was conducted as an abiotic control original slurry were initially tested to transform parathion and parathion methyl but the reaction was too rapid to analyze the associated isotope fractionation therefore a 50 fold dilution of original slurry was used after a series of dilution experiments in order to reduce the rate of reaction for obtaining first order rate constants and fractionation factors for the original slurry assays and cell free slurry assays of parathion and parathion methyl 1 ml original slurry or 1 ml cell free supernatant was directly added into the prepared bottles and diluted for tcep and tdcpp degradation experiment slurry after 25 fold dilution was taken the degradation rates of dimethoate and malathion were obtained after 5 fold dilution the cell free and sterilized slurry were conducted with the same dilution as the original slurry experiments for all tested ops all experiments were performed at 37 c in 120 ml serum bottles containing 50 ml of 10 mm tris hcl buffer and adjusted to ph 7 4 with 6 n hcl the bottles with 70 ml headspace were flushed with n2 co2 80 20 v v for at least 15 min to maintain anoxic condition and crimped with teflon coated butyl rubber septa afterwards the corresponding slurries were added into bottles in the anaerobic box according to different fold dilutions for each op the mixtures were incubated at 37 c for 1 h before adding the stock solutions of ops stock solutions of ops dissolved in acetone were added into serum bottles respectively to achieve the intended initial concentrations as described in supporting information si section s1 table s1 2 4 extraction parallel batch bottles were sacrificed at different time intervals for each op compound the reactions were stopped with 6 n hcl to inactivate the enzymes by adjusting ph to 5 for parathion and parathion methyl assays to avoid further hydrolysis at acid condition and below ph 4 for other experiments control experiments were treated identically subsequently 2 ml of dichloromethane dcm containing dichlorvos as an internal standard was added to extract residual ops and the metabolites all bottles were shaken at 180 rpm for 2 h and the organic phase with dcm was separated and transferred into screwed vials with a glass syringe for cleanup of organic phase the method was the same as previous study lian et al 2018 but elute solvent was dcm see section s2 2 in si extracts were stored at 20 c until further analysis 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 concentration an agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies germany equipped with a flame ionization detector fid was used to determine the concentration

increased by 10 c min 1 to 160 c followed by 5 c min 1 to 220 c and by 15 c min 1 to 280 c and held for 2 min isotherm wu et al 2018a the temperatures of injector and detector were set to 180 c and

biotransformation of the six typical ops in biogas slurry the first irreversible degradation step was deduced based on metabolite analysis scheme 1 and scheme s2 si and isotope fractionation the degradation curves could be described by the first order reaction fig 2 and fig s2 si suggesting that rayleigh concept can be used to quantify the 2h and 13c isotope fractionations the isotope fractionation pattern provides further evidence for the first bond cleavage reaction for the interpretation of ops transformation pathway 3 1 degradation of phosphate esters in biogas slurry tcep and tdcpp were studied as representatives of phosphate esters the degradation with original slurry after 25 fold dilution was conducted for acquiring the isotope fractionation tcep and tdcpp were transformed to ca 70 with rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 3 1 0 5 and 2 6 0 4 in original slurry compared to lower rates of 0 8 0 1 and 2 4 0 3 in cell free slurry respectively bis 2 chloroethyl hydrogen phosphate was tentatively identified in the degradation experiment of tcep and bis 1 3 dichloro 2 propanyl hydrogen phosphate in the degradation experiment of tdcpp suggesting that hydrolysis lead to cleavage of the phosphate ester bond tables s2 and s3 si constant concentrations were found indicating no significant degradation of phosphate esters in the sterilized slurry fig s1 si neither carbon nor hydrogen isotope enrichment was observed table 1 suggesting that probably no h or c bond cleavage was involved in the first irreversible reaction step and hydrolysis is the dominant reaction hydrolysis reactions were found in experiments with phosphate esters and liver microsomes as a side reaction which can occur also spontaneously without activation van den eede et al 2013 combining the information from detected products in experiments of both phosphate esters and the absence of carbon isotope fractionation hydrolysis of p o bond was assumed to be the first irreversible step 3 2 degradation of phosphorothioate in biogas slurry parathion and parathion methyl selected as representatives for phosphorothioate were transformed rapidly in the biogas slurry thus 50 fold dilution was used to slow down reaction in the original slurry for achieving stable isotope fractionation and it gave rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 12 8 1 2 and 10 5 1 0 respectively the degradation of parathion and parathion methyl with the cell free slurry was slower and could be described by rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 2 8 0 3 and 5 3 0 5 respectively the degradation in 50 fold diluted sterilized slurry gave rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 2 1 0 2 and 3 5 0 3 for parathion and parathion methyl respectively showing that enzymatic activity was preserved after heat treatment amino parathion and amino parathion methyl were detected in biogas slurry degradation experiments both via gc ms figs s4 s5 si and ft icr ms analysis tables s4 s5 fig s8 and s15 s16 si indicating reduction of the nitro group o ethyl o 4

nitrophenol with increasing intensity over time in the degradation experiments with parathion methyl suggests hydrolysis reaction the δ13c values of parathion methyl were enriched from 32 9 0 3 to 28 5 0 4 with εc of 3 6 0 4 in original slurry experiment upon about 75 degradation carbon isotope enrichment from 31 4 0 1 to 18 6 0 5 with εc of 8 6 1 4 was found in experiments with cell free supernatant after 80 transformation accordingly the δ2h isotope composition of parathion methyl in original slurry changed from 126 4 0 5 to 111 1 1 6 and yielded a εh of 5 1 in the experiment with cell free supernatant the 2h isotope composition of parathion methyl shifted from 122 5 1 4 to 115 1 3 7 and yielded a εh of 10 3 fig 1 and fig 3 during biodegradation of parathion slight carbon enrichment was discovered with a change from 27 0 0 2 to 25 6 0 4 yielding a εc of 0 7 0 2 in original slurry similarly the δ13c values shifted from 29 2 0 4 to 26 7 0 6 and resulted in a εc of 2 5 0 5 in cell free slurry upon 80 degradation a strong 2h enrichment in original slurry from 139 1 2 1 to 92 5 5 6 gave a εh of 33 5 in the cell free supernatant an enrichment from 132 1 2 8 to 84 4 3 8 with a εh of 61 10 during the biodegradation of parathion was observed figs 1 and 3 3 3 degradation of phosphorodithioates in biogas slurry dimethoate and malathion as the representatives for phosphorodithioates were rapidly degraded in the slurry and a 5 fold dilution was selected for isotope fractionation experiments to slow down the reaction with this dilution dimethoate and malathion were transformed up to around 80 after 40 h with rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 39 6 7 9 and 50 5 5 3 in original slurry 33 3 5 5 and 35 5 6 7 in the cell free slurry respectively the degradation rate constant of dimetoate in the sterilized slurry was 14 8 3 5 10 3 h 1 fig s2 si no degradation of malation was detected in sterilized slurry fig s1 si in experiment with dimethoate o o s trimethyl phosphorodithioate was detected by gc ms fig s6 si o o dimethyl s 2 methylamino 2 oxoethyl dithiophosphate o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate and o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorothioate were observed by ft icr ms table s6 si in the experiments with malathion diethyl succinate and diethyl 2e 2 butenedioate were found using gc ms fig s7 si the ft icr ms detected exact masses corresponding to diethyl 2 hydroxy methoxy phosphorothioyl sulfanyl succinate o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate and o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorothioate as metabolites table s7 si the δ13c of dimethoate slightly enriched from 39 1 0 3 to 37 4 0 2 and yielded a εc of 0 6 0 1 upon 79 degradation in original slurry enrichment from 39 2 0 1 to 37 2 0 1 upon 75 degradation was detected in cell free slurry yielding a εc of 0 9 0 1 figs s1 and s3 si the carbon isotope fractionation indicated that a carbon bond cleavage was involved in the first irreversible rate limiting reaction step no 2h fractionation could be detected suggesting that no h bond cleavage was involved the δ13c values of malathion were enriched from 26 5 0 5 to 14 9 0 4 after 88 transformation in the original slurry and from 25 7 0 5 to 15 2 0 4 after 77 degradation in the cell free slurry resulting in εc values of 5 5 0 1 and 7 2 0 5 respectively figs s1 and s3 si the transformation of malathion in biogas slurry was not associated with detectable hydrogen isotope fractionation similar to phosphate esters malathion did not degrade in sterilized slurry 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of transformation mechanisms the transformation of ops is suggested to be predominated by biodegradation compared to abiotic degradation processes in natural environment zhang and bennett 2005 in this study biodegradation of ops was governed by hydrolysis and reduction reactions as predicted in anaerobic aquatic system druzina and stegu 2007 the anaerobic digestion reactor showed a high potential for hydrolytic reactions and the hydrolysis was remarkably faster than expected for chemical hydrolysis we intended to study the structure activity relationship on degradation of ops in ad at neutral condition the half life times of ops in ad system decreased in the order of original slurry cell free slurry sterilized slurry fig 2 and figs s2 and si the results showed a high capability for hydrolysis in cell free slurry via exoenzymes which may be abundant in the ad reactor hydrolases are key enzymes in the ad system gasch et al 2013 and our results showed that they can degrade ops 4 1 1 degradation of phosphate esters no 2h and 13c isotope fractionation of phosphate esters was found similar to alkaline hydrolysis this suggested that hydrolysis at p o bond was the rate limiting reaction step which was consistent with the detection of metabolites the isotope fractionation indicated an enzymatic hydrolysis with p o bond cleavage in biogas slurry probably by an esterase using an sn2 mechanism scheme s2 si the potential to monitor hydrolysis of phosphate esters employing 2h and 13c isotope fractionation was low as neither c nor h bond was cleaved the advantage of isotope fingerprint is that it can give hint on the reaction deduced from the enrichment factor when the intermediate is not easy to determine or is further degraded 4 1 2 degradation of phosphorothioates the transformation kinetic of both phosphorothioates decreased in the experiment with living cells enzyme extracts and heat treated autoclaved slurry showing a robust capability for degradation the proposed transformation mechanisms for parathion and parathion methyl are summarized below see scheme 1 i biotic hydrolysis via esterase caused by p o cleavage wanamaker et al 2013 which is not expected to lead to isotope fractionation of 2h and 13c thus the contribution of this reaction could not be directly evaluated via isotope fractionation ii the hydrolysis of a c o bond cleaving the alkyl side chain via sn2 reaction leading to 13c fractionation and no 2h fractionation wanamaker et al 2013 wu et al 2018a iii the reduction reaction of no2 to nh2 which will not lead to 2h or 13c fractionation but took place as we observed the reduction of the nitro group iv the dehydrogenation leading to c h cleavage at the side chain of parathion which infers a radical reaction in the rate limiting reaction step likely caused by dehydrogenase the pronounced 2h and low 13c isotope fractionation in the experiments of original slurry and cell free slurry suggested this dominant reaction other than hydrolysis table 1 the contribution of dehydrogenation reaction was lower taking the fractionation pattern of parathion methyl into account showing larger 13c εc 8 6 1 4 and lower 2h εh 10 3 isotope fractionation compared to parathion the extent of 13c isotope fractionation may suggest that hydrolysis reaction with c o bond cleavage was the rate limiting step for parathion methyl in summary parallel reactions can catalyze the transformation of phosphorothioates in ad systems showing a functional redundancy and implying a robust capability to transform and possibly detoxify phosphorothioates 4 1 3 degradation of phosphorodithioates the degradation kinetic of dimethoate showed a similar pattern as phosphorothioates with decreasing rate constants comparing original slurry cell free slurry and heat treated autoclaved slurry the latter still showed a robust capability for degradation in contrast the heat treated autoclaved slurry lost capability to degrade malathion the metabolites of dimethioate and malathion in ad system gave the hint on i hydrolysis with c o cleavage scheme s2 si ii hydrolysis with c s cleavage iii enzymatic hydrolysis leading to p s cleavage of phosphorodithioate the detected carbon isotope effect was consistent with metabolites formed by c o or c s bond cleavage in the rate limiting reaction step the carbon isotope effect of dimethoate was much smaller compared to malathion implying that the contribution of a c bond cleavage was higher in the original and cell free slurry experiment with malathion the hydrolysis mechanism of phosphorodithioates in ad was distinguished from neutral chemical hydrolysis as indicated by the different extent of isotope fractionation the p s bond cleavage is not expected to yield a primary 2h or 13c kie isotope effect and the contribution of these types of bond cleavage could not be evaluated in this work 4 2 diagnostic potential of two dimensional isotope fractionation 4 2 1 carbon isotope fractionation for degradation of phosphorothioate in biogas slurry an increase in εc values for both compounds was obtained from original slurry to cell free slurry and sterilized slurry table 1 suggesting different contribution of the particular reactions the 13c isotope fractionation was probably dominated by c o bond cleavage and the slightly depleted carbon isotope fractionation could be assumed due to the contribution of p o cleavage by phosphotriesterases pte or reduction of the nitrogen group munnecke 1976 serdar and gibson 1985 the εc value in sterilized slurry with parathion methyl 10 3 0 1 was close to chemical neutral hydrolysis at ph 7 9 9 0 7 indicating a dominant mechanism of c o bond cleavage the εc of parathion in sterilized slurry ph 7 4 4 3 0 4 was lower than chemical hydrolysis under neutral conditions at ph 7 6 0 0 2 wu et al 2018a implying distinct mechanism of the relative thermostable enzymatic activity brock 1985 the same phenomenon was observed for phosphorodithioates an increase in εc values for both compounds was obtained from original slurry to cell free slurry and sterilized slurry table 1 with more contribution of p s cleavage induced via enzymatic hydrolysis in active slurry the various carbon isotope fractionation patterns suggest that possible several modes of hydrolytic reaction are at work implying a functional redundancy of hydrolysis it indicates a robust degradation and possibly detoxification of phosphorodithioates in ad systems 4 2 2 hydrogen isotope fractionation hydrogen isotope fractionations were found during the transformations of phosphorothioates significant hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion was discovered in biogas slurry system table 1 weaker hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion methyl than parathion was observed however the abiotic hydrolysis of parathion and parathion methyl at ph 7 0 showed no hydrogen isotope fractionation wu et al 2018a the results suggested that parathion degradation was associated with a significant hydrogen isotope fractionation in biogas slurry caused by the dehydrogenation induced via dehydrogenase it is assumed that dehydrogenation occurred at the sub terminal carbon of the side chain of parathion c h giving significant hydrogen fractionation table s4 si owing to the stable terminal carbon hydrogen bond of the methyl group in parathion methyl it is unlikely to be attacked by dehydrogenase leading to c h bond cleavage we supposed that the smaller εh of 5 and 10 in parathion methyl were induced via secondary hydrogen isotope effect caused by adjacent bond cleavage elsner et al 2007 since the atom was not directly involved in substitution attack it possessed much smaller value than the primary hydrogen isotope effect cleland 2003 hennig et al 2006 rickert and klinman 1999 4 2 3 two dimensional isotope analysis the relationship between carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation λ can be used to distinguish the mechanism of biotic and abiotic degradation more accurately and this technique has been adopted in several studies fischer et al 2009 palau et al 2017 woods et al 2018 the substantial differences between biotic transformation and chemical hydrolysis can be visualized in the dual isotope plots fig 4 and fig s17 si distinct dual isotope pattern of parathion is depicted in fig 4 a it showed weak carbon isotope fractionation with c o bond cleavage diluted by p o cleavage and significant strong hydrogen isotope fractionation with c h bond cleavage during transformation of parathion in biogas slurry the opposite pattern was discovered for chemical hydrolysis under neutral condition showing strong carbon isotope fractionation with c o bond cleavage and lack of hydrogen isotope fractionation similarly the chemical hydrolysis of parathion methyl conducted in neutral condition was associated with significant carbon isotope enrichment and no hydrogen isotope fractionation whereas strong carbon isotope fractionation via c o bond cleavage and slight hydrogen isotope fractionation were observed in biotransformation of parathion methyl fig 4 b the λ values of parathion in biogas slurry λoriginal 31 11 λcell free 20 2 showed distinct pattern compared to chemical hydrolysis λ 0 1 0 1 as no hydrogen fractionation in abiotic hydrolysis reaction same trend was observed in parathion methyl the value of chemical hydrolysis λ 0 2 0 1 was lower than in biogas slurry λoriginal 2 1 λcell free 1 1 in general fractionation patterns of parathion and parathion methyl are concordant with the assumed degradation pathways which are shown in scheme 1 hence taking into account of the dual isotope fractionation pattern it helps to further elucidate the proposed biotransformation pathway with the related functional enzymes and microbes in biogas slurry interestingly the anaerobic degradation of parathion using isolated strain from soil was not associated with 2h or 13c isotope fractionation which was assumed by reduction of the nitro groups and hydrolysis of the p o bond wu et al 2018b a low secondary hydrogen isotope effect and no significant primary carbon isotope effect was detected during reduction of nitro group of nitrobenzene hofstetter et al 2008 thus the pronounced 2h and 13c fractionation indicated that reduction of nitro group was not the dominant reaction and a cleavage of a c h bond lead to the primary isotope effect of 2h and 13c in the ad system this implies that different transformation pathways under anaerobic conditions are possible and more systematic work is needed to understand the anaerobic degradation 4 3 proposed reactions in biogas slurry 4 3 1 enzymatic and abiotic hydrolysis in our study parathion was biologically transformed approximately 300 times faster than chemical hydrolysis similar phenomenon was also found in a mixed bacterial culture growing on parathion and parathion methyl they were hydrolyzed 2 450 times faster than conventional chemical hydrolysis munnecke 1976 hence it was assumed to be caused by enzymatic hydrolysis which can lead to p o s cleavage at p position or c o s cleavage at c position with nucleophilic attack via pte serdar and gibson 1985 zhang and bennett 2005 ptes are a group of op compounds degrading enzymes which are found in microorganisms animals and plants the esterase as one of the hydrolases is the key enzyme in the first phase of biogas production gasch et al 2013 moreover the non specific esterase activity is suggested as indicator of bacterial heterotrophic activity in fermentation process since the high esterase activity accompanies with increasing conversion rate of substrate to methane lebuhn et al 2015 thus it is assumed that transformation of ops could be caused by the sn2 nucleophilic substitution reaction during p o s or c o s bond cleavage in ad system 4 3 2 dehydrogenation significant hydrogen isotope fractionation is most likely a result of a c h cleavage at alkyl side chain catalyzed by a dehydrogenase during biotic transformation of parathion dehydrogenation was discovered in clostridium desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a bacteroides sp via dehydrogenase in anaerobic pathway dwyer and tiedje 1986 kocholaty and hoogerheide 1938 zhang and bennett 2005 aliphatic hydrocarbons and alkyl groups of aromatic hydrocarbons are activated by dehydrogenase reactions under anoxic conditions musat et al 2016 the large diversity of bacteria in ad system qiao et al 2013 weiland 2010 suggested that certain strains may be capable of dehydrogenation such as clostridium sp moreover several studies had already reported that microbes in biogas plants possess dehydrogenase lebuhn et al 2008 maus et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014 and dual c h isotope analysis could be used to show their activity in degradation moreover the tentative identification of diethyl 2e 2 butenedioate fig s7 si as the metabolite of malathion gave also a hint for the dehydrogenation in biogas slurry 4 3 3 reduction of the nitro group amino parathion and amino parathion methyl were found in biogas slurry system which gave direct evidence for reduction mechanism this reaction will not contribute to carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation the reductive transformation of parathion and parathion methyl by bacillus sp was also investigated in a former study yang et al 2007 5 conclusion op can be transformed by different reaction modes in the ad system the varying isotope fractionation pattern illustrated coexistence of different modes of hydrolytic activities implying the functional redundancies of enzymes in biogas slurry and suggesting that ad systems provide robust degradation capacity for op transformation the cell free experiments showed variety of enzymatic activities which were partly bound to enzymes resident to higher temperature as tested in heat sterilized experiment very interesting is that the different modes of hydrolytic activities in ad are capable to degrade ops efficiently consequently in ad condition most ops can be degraded rapidly and biogas process could be a promising remediation measure for the biomass from contaminated field sites or organic rich waste materials thus this study promotes the investigation on the fate of ops in the environment providing a new remediation method for the contaminated biomass and illustrating different pathways of

treatment for ops contaminated biomass or contaminated organic waste material graphical abstract image 1 keywords organophosphorus compounds enzymatic hydrolysis biogas reactor two dimensional compound specific stable isotope analysis isotope fractionation reaction mechanism 1 introduction synthetic organophosphorus compounds ops have been produced for various purposes most of them are used as pesticides plasticizers air fuel ingredients and chemical warfare agents singh and walker 2006 ops constitute the largest group of insecticides accounting for an estimated 34 of world wide sales compared with other types of insecticides such as carbamate and organochlorine compounds chanda et al 2006 karami mohajeri and abdollahi 2010 biomass may be contaminated with residual op pesticides battersby and wilson 1989 kupper et al 2008 and the waste material from crops or organic wastes containing ops pang et al 2018 could be well used for biogas production the efficiency and robustness of degradation need to be assessed for the development of biotechnological strategies on treating organic waste in biogas producing anaerobic digestion ad systems thus the monitoring and characterization of ops degradation in ad system is an important aspect for developing treatment concepts knowledge on degradation mechanisms might be used to optimize the reduction of residual concentration in digestate till now degradation of ops has been investigated in natural water systems druzina and stegu 2007 soils singh et al 2005 sediments graetz et al 1970 and bioreactors li et al 2008 the fates of ops in environment comprise both biotic transformation via microorganisms and abiotic processes the hydrolysis is assumed as the most important step for detoxification of ops singh and walker 2006 theriot and grunden 2011 the biotic and chemical hydrolysis of ops proceeds probably simultaneously in ad ops contain three main core structures based on the oxygen or sulfur atom position phosphate phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate sogorb and vilanova 2002 in this study six typical ops tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcpp parathion parathion methyl dimethoate and malathion were chosen as model compounds to investigate transformation containing phosphate phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate in ad system tcep and tdcpp appear to be the most recalcitrant and are ubiquitous flame retardants in the environment ding et al 2015 reemtsma et al 2008 degradations of parathion and parathion methyl were observed in anoxic soils via reduction and

aspergillus niger zhy256 isolated from sewage and the soil of highly contaminated cotton field was reported liu et al 2001 biodegradation of malathion was found in estuarine waters lacorte et al 1995 as well as with acinetobacter baumannii afa isolated from domestic sewage in egypt azmy et al 2015 hydrolysis was found to be an important biodegradation pathway of ops under aerobic and anaerobic conditions singh 2009 singh and walker 2006 theriot and grunden 2011 to improve degradation rate and promote investigation on the fate of ops the identification of degradation mechanism in ad is crucial multi element fingerprinting of chemicals via compound specific stable isotope analysis csia was applied to trace the degradation mechanisms making use of isotope fractionation concepts meyer et al 2009 penning et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 several studies on csia to trace abiotic hydrolysis of ops have been reported wu et al 2018a 2017 2014 a recent study on natural attenuation of parathion by hydrolysis at a contaminated field site in denmark using csia was described wu et al 2018b indicating that the isotope fractionation pattern has potential to characterize and monitor hydrolysis in field studies moreover application of csia for investigating the biotransformation of hexachlorocyclohexanes in biogas slurry has been recently published lian et al 2018 to our best knowledge this is the first report that elucidates biotransformation of ops in biogas reactors making use of isotope fractionation to characterize the bond cleavage of the initial degradation reactions steps this study intends to evaluate the degradation mechanism of phosphate phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate derivatives in ad using biogas slurries from a pilot scale biogas plant as a model system in case of effective transformation phytoremediation peuke and rennenberg 2005 combined with ad can also be considered as a potential strategy for environmental cleanup lian et al 2018 the specific objectives of this study were to i assess biodegradation of ops in the original biogas slurry in order to evaluate the capability of microbes for ops elimination ii monitor enzymatic hydrolytic activity in cell

operated with an organic loading rate of 3 5 gvsl 1day 1 and hydraulic retention time of 47 days utilizing maize silage and cattle manure as main substrates the slurry was sieved 1 cm before using for biodegradation assays 2 3 ops biodegradation assays with biogas slurry for assessing biodegradation of ops in ad system the original slurry was used the cell free supernatant was assigned for study on enzymatic hydrolysis of ops in order to obtain the cell free fraction slurry from biogas reactor was centrifuged at 16 100 g 4 c for 20 min to remove solid particles and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter merck millipore the slurry was autoclaved 121 c 30 min three times in bottles for sterilized control experiments thus four sets of experiments were conducted simultaneously i original slurry directly taken from the biogas plant was used to detect the capability of microbes for ops degradation ii cell free slurry after centrifugation and filtration see above was utilized to analyze the hydrolytic activity of extracellular enzymes iii sterilized slurry was used for assuming that cells were killed and enzyme activity were inactivated by elevated temperature typical for sterilization iv chemical hydrolysis experiments of op with tris hcl buffer at ph 7 4 was conducted as an abiotic control original slurry were initially tested to transform parathion and parathion methyl but the reaction was too rapid to analyze the associated isotope fractionation therefore a 50 fold dilution of original slurry was used after a series of dilution experiments in order to reduce the rate of reaction for obtaining first order rate constants and fractionation factors for the original slurry assays and cell free slurry assays of parathion and parathion methyl 1 ml original slurry or 1 ml cell free supernatant was directly added into the prepared bottles and diluted for tcep and tdcpp degradation experiment slurry after 25 fold dilution was taken the degradation rates of dimethoate and malathion were obtained after 5 fold dilution the cell free and sterilized slurry were conducted with the same dilution as the original slurry experiments for all tested ops all experiments were performed at 37 c in 120 ml serum bottles containing 50 ml of 10 mm tris hcl buffer and adjusted to ph 7 4 with 6 n hcl the bottles with 70 ml headspace were flushed with n2 co2 80 20 v v for at least 15 min to maintain anoxic condition and crimped with teflon coated butyl rubber septa afterwards the corresponding slurries were added into bottles in the anaerobic box according to different fold dilutions for each op the mixtures were incubated at 37 c for 1 h before adding the stock solutions of ops stock solutions of ops dissolved in acetone were added into serum bottles respectively to achieve the intended initial concentrations as described in supporting information si section s1 table s1 2 4 extraction parallel batch bottles were sacrificed at different time intervals for each op compound the reactions were stopped with 6 n hcl to inactivate the enzymes by adjusting ph to 5 for parathion and parathion methyl assays to avoid further hydrolysis at acid condition and below ph 4 for other experiments control experiments were treated identically subsequently 2 ml of dichloromethane dcm containing dichlorvos as an internal standard was added to extract residual ops and the metabolites all bottles were shaken at 180 rpm for 2 h and the organic phase with dcm was separated and transferred into screwed vials with a glass syringe for cleanup of organic phase the method was the same as previous study lian et al 2018 but elute solvent was dcm see section s2 2 in si extracts were stored at 20 c until further analysis 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 concentration an agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies germany equipped with a flame ionization detector fid was used to determine the concentration

biotransformation of the six typical ops in biogas slurry the first irreversible degradation step was deduced based on metabolite analysis scheme 1 and scheme s2 si and isotope fractionation the degradation curves could be described by the first order reaction fig 2 and fig s2 si suggesting that rayleigh concept can be used to quantify the 2h and 13c isotope fractionations the isotope fractionation pattern provides further evidence for the first bond cleavage reaction for the interpretation of ops transformation pathway 3 1 degradation of phosphate esters in biogas slurry tcep and tdcpp were studied as representatives of phosphate esters the degradation with original slurry after 25 fold dilution was conducted for acquiring the isotope fractionation tcep and tdcpp were transformed to ca 70 with rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 3 1 0 5 and 2 6 0 4 in original slurry compared to lower rates of 0 8 0 1 and 2 4 0 3 in cell free slurry respectively bis 2 chloroethyl hydrogen phosphate was tentatively identified in the degradation experiment of tcep and bis 1 3 dichloro 2 propanyl hydrogen phosphate in the degradation experiment of tdcpp suggesting that hydrolysis lead to cleavage of the phosphate ester bond tables s2 and s3 si constant concentrations were found indicating no significant degradation of phosphate esters in the sterilized slurry fig s1 si neither carbon nor hydrogen isotope enrichment was observed table 1 suggesting that probably no h or c bond cleavage was involved in the first irreversible reaction step and hydrolysis is the dominant reaction hydrolysis reactions were found in experiments with phosphate esters and liver microsomes as a side reaction which can occur also spontaneously without activation van den eede et al 2013 combining the information from detected products in experiments of both phosphate esters and the absence of carbon isotope fractionation hydrolysis of p o bond was assumed to be the first irreversible step 3 2 degradation of phosphorothioate in biogas slurry parathion and parathion methyl selected as representatives for phosphorothioate were transformed rapidly in the biogas slurry thus 50 fold dilution was used to slow down reaction in the original slurry for achieving stable isotope fractionation and it gave rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 12 8 1 2 and 10 5 1 0 respectively the degradation of parathion and parathion methyl with the cell free slurry was slower and could be described by rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 2 8 0 3 and 5 3 0 5 respectively the degradation in 50 fold diluted sterilized slurry gave rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 2 1 0 2 and 3 5 0 3 for parathion and parathion methyl respectively showing that enzymatic activity was preserved after heat treatment amino parathion and amino parathion methyl were detected in biogas slurry degradation experiments both via gc ms figs s4 s5 si and ft icr ms analysis tables s4 s5 fig s8 and s15 s16 si indicating reduction of the nitro group o ethyl o 4

nitrophenol with increasing intensity over time in the degradation experiments with parathion methyl suggests hydrolysis reaction the δ13c values of parathion methyl were enriched from 32 9 0 3 to 28 5 0 4 with εc of 3 6 0 4 in original slurry experiment upon about 75 degradation carbon isotope enrichment from 31 4 0 1 to 18 6 0 5 with εc of 8 6 1 4 was found in experiments with cell free supernatant after 80 transformation accordingly the δ2h isotope composition of parathion methyl in original slurry changed from 126 4 0 5 to 111 1 1 6 and yielded a εh of 5 1 in the experiment with cell free supernatant the 2h isotope composition of parathion methyl shifted from 122 5 1 4 to 115 1 3 7 and yielded a εh of 10 3 fig 1 and fig 3 during biodegradation of parathion slight carbon enrichment was discovered with a change from 27 0 0 2 to 25 6 0 4 yielding a εc of 0 7 0 2 in original slurry similarly the δ13c values shifted from 29 2 0 4 to 26 7 0 6 and resulted in a εc of 2 5 0 5 in cell free slurry upon 80 degradation a strong 2h enrichment in original slurry from 139 1 2 1 to 92 5 5 6 gave a εh of 33 5 in the cell free supernatant an enrichment from 132 1 2 8 to 84 4 3 8 with a εh of 61 10 during the biodegradation of parathion was observed figs 1 and 3 3 3 degradation of phosphorodithioates in biogas slurry dimethoate and malathion as the representatives for phosphorodithioates were rapidly degraded in the slurry and a 5 fold dilution was selected for isotope fractionation experiments to slow down the reaction with this dilution dimethoate and malathion were transformed up to around 80 after 40 h with rate constants 10 3 h 1 of 39 6 7 9 and 50 5 5 3 in original slurry 33 3 5 5 and 35 5 6 7 in the cell free slurry respectively the degradation rate constant of dimetoate in the sterilized slurry was 14 8 3 5 10 3 h 1 fig s2 si no degradation of malation was detected in sterilized slurry fig s1 si in experiment with dimethoate o o s trimethyl phosphorodithioate was detected by gc ms fig s6 si o o dimethyl s 2 methylamino 2 oxoethyl dithiophosphate o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate and o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorothioate were observed by ft icr ms table s6 si in the experiments with malathion diethyl succinate and diethyl 2e 2 butenedioate were found using gc ms fig s7 si the ft icr ms detected exact masses corresponding to diethyl 2 hydroxy methoxy phosphorothioyl sulfanyl succinate o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate and o o dimethyl hydrogen phosphorothioate as metabolites table s7 si the δ13c of dimethoate slightly enriched from 39 1 0 3 to 37 4 0 2 and yielded a εc of 0 6 0 1 upon 79 degradation in original slurry enrichment from 39 2 0 1 to 37 2 0 1 upon 75 degradation was detected in cell free slurry yielding a εc of 0 9 0 1 figs s1 and s3 si the carbon isotope fractionation indicated that a carbon bond cleavage was involved in the first irreversible rate limiting reaction step no 2h fractionation could be detected suggesting that no h bond cleavage was involved the δ13c values of malathion were enriched from 26 5 0 5 to 14 9 0 4 after 88 transformation in the original slurry and from 25 7 0 5 to 15 2 0 4 after 77 degradation in the cell free slurry resulting in εc values of 5 5 0 1 and 7 2 0 5 respectively figs s1 and s3 si the transformation of malathion in biogas slurry was not associated with detectable hydrogen isotope fractionation similar to phosphate esters malathion did not degrade in sterilized slurry 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of transformation mechanisms the transformation of ops is suggested to be predominated by biodegradation compared to abiotic degradation processes in natural environment zhang and bennett 2005 in this study biodegradation of ops was governed by hydrolysis and reduction reactions as predicted in anaerobic aquatic system druzina and stegu 2007 the anaerobic digestion reactor showed a high potential for hydrolytic reactions and the hydrolysis was remarkably faster than expected for chemical hydrolysis we intended to study the structure activity relationship on degradation of ops in ad at neutral condition the half life times of ops in ad system decreased in the order of original slurry cell free slurry sterilized slurry fig 2 and figs s2 and si the results showed a high capability for hydrolysis in cell free slurry via exoenzymes which may be abundant in the ad reactor hydrolases are key enzymes in the ad system gasch et al 2013 and our results showed that they can degrade ops 4 1 1 degradation of phosphate esters no 2h and 13c isotope fractionation of phosphate esters was found similar to alkaline hydrolysis this suggested that hydrolysis at p o bond was the rate limiting reaction step which was consistent with the detection of metabolites the isotope fractionation indicated an enzymatic hydrolysis with p o bond cleavage in biogas slurry probably by an esterase using an sn2 mechanism scheme s2 si the potential to monitor hydrolysis of phosphate esters employing 2h and 13c isotope fractionation was low as neither c nor h bond was cleaved the advantage of isotope fingerprint is that it can give hint on the reaction deduced from the enrichment factor when the intermediate is not easy to determine or is further degraded 4 1 2 degradation of phosphorothioates the transformation kinetic of both phosphorothioates decreased in the experiment with living cells enzyme extracts and heat treated autoclaved slurry showing a robust capability for degradation the proposed transformation mechanisms for parathion and parathion methyl are summarized below see scheme 1 i biotic hydrolysis via esterase caused by p o cleavage wanamaker et al 2013 which is not expected to lead to isotope fractionation of 2h and 13c thus the contribution of this reaction could not be directly evaluated via isotope fractionation ii the hydrolysis of a c o bond cleaving the alkyl side chain via sn2 reaction leading to 13c fractionation and no 2h fractionation wanamaker et al 2013 wu et al 2018a iii the reduction reaction of no2 to nh2 which will not lead to 2h or 13c fractionation but took place as we observed the reduction of the nitro group iv the dehydrogenation leading to c h cleavage at the side chain of parathion which infers a radical reaction in the rate limiting reaction step likely caused by dehydrogenase the pronounced 2h and low 13c isotope fractionation in the experiments of original slurry and cell free slurry suggested this dominant reaction other than hydrolysis table 1 the contribution of dehydrogenation reaction was lower taking the fractionation pattern of parathion methyl into account showing larger 13c εc 8 6 1 4 and lower 2h εh 10 3 isotope fractionation compared to parathion the extent of 13c isotope fractionation may suggest that hydrolysis reaction with c o bond cleavage was the rate limiting step for parathion methyl in summary parallel reactions can catalyze the transformation of phosphorothioates in ad systems showing a functional redundancy and implying a robust capability to transform and possibly detoxify phosphorothioates 4 1 3 degradation of phosphorodithioates the degradation kinetic of dimethoate showed a similar pattern as phosphorothioates with decreasing rate constants comparing original slurry cell free slurry and heat treated autoclaved slurry the latter still showed a robust capability for degradation in contrast the heat treated autoclaved slurry lost capability to degrade malathion the metabolites of dimethioate and malathion in ad system gave the hint on i hydrolysis with c o cleavage scheme s2 si ii hydrolysis with c s cleavage iii enzymatic hydrolysis leading to p s cleavage of phosphorodithioate the detected carbon isotope effect was consistent with metabolites formed by c o or c s bond cleavage in the rate limiting reaction step the carbon isotope effect of dimethoate was much smaller compared to malathion implying that the contribution of a c bond cleavage was higher in the original and cell free slurry experiment with malathion the hydrolysis mechanism of phosphorodithioates in ad was distinguished from neutral chemical hydrolysis as indicated by the different extent of isotope fractionation the p s bond cleavage is not expected to yield a primary 2h or 13c kie isotope effect and the contribution of these types of bond cleavage could not be evaluated in this work 4 2 diagnostic potential of two dimensional isotope fractionation 4 2 1 carbon isotope fractionation for degradation of phosphorothioate in biogas slurry an increase in εc values for both compounds was obtained from original slurry to cell free slurry and sterilized slurry table 1 suggesting different contribution of the particular reactions the 13c isotope fractionation was probably dominated by c o bond cleavage and the slightly depleted carbon isotope fractionation could be assumed due to the contribution of p o cleavage by phosphotriesterases pte or reduction of the nitrogen group munnecke 1976 serdar and gibson 1985 the εc value in sterilized slurry with parathion methyl 10 3 0 1 was close to chemical neutral hydrolysis at ph 7 9 9 0 7 indicating a dominant mechanism of c o bond cleavage the εc of parathion in sterilized slurry ph 7 4 4 3 0 4 was lower than chemical hydrolysis under neutral conditions at ph 7 6 0 0 2 wu et al 2018a implying distinct mechanism of the relative thermostable enzymatic activity brock 1985 the same phenomenon was observed for phosphorodithioates an increase in εc values for both compounds was obtained from original slurry to cell free slurry and sterilized slurry table 1 with more contribution of p s cleavage induced via enzymatic hydrolysis in active slurry the various carbon isotope fractionation patterns suggest that possible several modes of hydrolytic reaction are at work implying a functional redundancy of hydrolysis it indicates a robust degradation and possibly detoxification of phosphorodithioates in ad systems 4 2 2 hydrogen isotope fractionation hydrogen isotope fractionations were found during the transformations of phosphorothioates significant hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion was discovered in biogas slurry system table 1 weaker hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion methyl than parathion was observed however the abiotic hydrolysis of parathion and parathion methyl at ph 7 0 showed no hydrogen isotope fractionation wu et al 2018a the results suggested that parathion degradation was associated with a significant hydrogen isotope fractionation in biogas slurry caused by the dehydrogenation induced via dehydrogenase it is assumed that dehydrogenation occurred at the sub terminal carbon of the side chain of parathion c h giving significant hydrogen fractionation table s4 si owing to the stable terminal carbon hydrogen bond of the methyl group in parathion methyl it is unlikely to be attacked by dehydrogenase leading to c h bond cleavage we supposed that the smaller εh of 5 and 10 in parathion methyl were induced via secondary hydrogen isotope effect caused by adjacent bond cleavage elsner et al 2007 since the atom was not directly involved in substitution attack it possessed much smaller value than the primary hydrogen isotope effect cleland 2003 hennig et al 2006 rickert and klinman 1999 4 2 3 two dimensional isotope analysis the relationship between carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation λ can be used to distinguish the mechanism of biotic and abiotic degradation more accurately and this technique has been adopted in several studies fischer et al 2009 palau et al 2017 woods et al 2018 the substantial differences between biotic transformation and chemical hydrolysis can be visualized in the dual isotope plots fig 4 and fig s17 si distinct dual isotope pattern of parathion is depicted in fig 4 a it showed weak carbon isotope fractionation with c o bond cleavage diluted by p o cleavage and significant strong hydrogen isotope fractionation with c h bond cleavage during transformation of parathion in biogas slurry the opposite pattern was discovered for chemical hydrolysis under neutral condition showing strong carbon isotope fractionation with c o bond cleavage and lack of hydrogen isotope fractionation similarly the chemical hydrolysis of parathion methyl conducted in neutral condition was associated with significant carbon isotope enrichment and no hydrogen isotope fractionation whereas strong carbon isotope fractionation via c o bond cleavage and slight hydrogen isotope fractionation were observed in biotransformation of parathion methyl fig 4 b the λ values of parathion in biogas slurry λoriginal 31 11 λcell free 20 2 showed distinct pattern compared to chemical hydrolysis λ 0 1 0 1 as no hydrogen fractionation in abiotic hydrolysis reaction same trend was observed in parathion methyl the value of chemical hydrolysis λ 0 2 0 1 was lower than in biogas slurry λoriginal 2 1 λcell free 1 1 in general fractionation patterns of parathion and parathion methyl are concordant with the assumed degradation pathways which are shown in scheme 1 hence taking into account of the dual isotope fractionation pattern it helps to further elucidate the proposed biotransformation pathway with the related functional enzymes and microbes in biogas slurry interestingly the anaerobic degradation of parathion using isolated strain from soil was not associated with 2h or 13c isotope fractionation which was assumed by reduction of the nitro groups and hydrolysis of the p o bond wu et al 2018b a low secondary hydrogen isotope effect and no significant primary carbon isotope effect was detected during reduction of nitro group of nitrobenzene hofstetter et al 2008 thus the pronounced 2h and 13c fractionation indicated that reduction of nitro group was not the dominant reaction and a cleavage of a c h bond lead to the primary isotope effect of 2h and 13c in the ad system this implies that different transformation pathways under anaerobic conditions are possible and more systematic work is needed to understand the anaerobic degradation 4 3 proposed reactions in biogas slurry 4 3 1 enzymatic and abiotic hydrolysis in our study parathion was biologically transformed approximately 300 times faster than chemical hydrolysis similar phenomenon was also found in a mixed bacterial culture growing on parathion and parathion methyl they were hydrolyzed 2 450 times faster than conventional chemical hydrolysis munnecke 1976 hence it was assumed to be caused by enzymatic hydrolysis which can lead to p o s cleavage at p position or c o s cleavage at c position with nucleophilic attack via pte serdar and gibson 1985 zhang and bennett 2005 ptes are a group of op compounds degrading enzymes which are found in microorganisms animals and plants the esterase as one of the hydrolases is the key enzyme in the first phase of biogas production gasch et al 2013 moreover the non specific esterase activity is suggested as indicator of bacterial heterotrophic activity in fermentation process since the high esterase activity accompanies with increasing conversion rate of substrate to methane lebuhn et al 2015 thus it is assumed that transformation of ops could be caused by the sn2 nucleophilic substitution reaction during p o s or c o s bond cleavage in ad system 4 3 2 dehydrogenation significant hydrogen isotope fractionation is most likely a result of a c h cleavage at alkyl side chain catalyzed by a dehydrogenase during biotic transformation of parathion dehydrogenation was discovered in clostridium desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a bacteroides sp via dehydrogenase in anaerobic pathway dwyer and tiedje 1986 kocholaty and hoogerheide 1938 zhang and bennett 2005 aliphatic hydrocarbons and alkyl groups of aromatic hydrocarbons are activated by dehydrogenase reactions under anoxic conditions musat et al 2016 the large diversity of bacteria in ad system qiao et al 2013 weiland 2010 suggested that certain strains may be capable of dehydrogenation such as clostridium sp moreover several studies had already reported that microbes in biogas plants possess dehydrogenase lebuhn et al 2008 maus et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014 and dual c h isotope analysis could be used to show their activity in degradation moreover the tentative identification of diethyl 2e 2 butenedioate fig s7 si as the metabolite of malathion gave also a hint for the dehydrogenation in biogas slurry 4 3 3 reduction of the nitro group amino parathion and amino parathion methyl were found in biogas slurry system which gave direct evidence for reduction mechanism this reaction will not contribute to carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation the reductive transformation of parathion and parathion methyl by bacillus sp was also investigated in a former study yang et al 2007 5 conclusion op can be transformed by different reaction modes in the ad system the varying isotope fractionation pattern illustrated coexistence of different modes of hydrolytic activities implying the functional redundancies of enzymes in biogas slurry and suggesting that ad systems provide robust degradation capacity for op transformation the cell free experiments showed variety of enzymatic activities which were partly bound to enzymes resident to higher temperature as tested in heat sterilized experiment very interesting is that the different modes of hydrolytic activities in ad are capable to degrade ops efficiently consequently in ad condition most ops can be degraded rapidly and biogas process could be a promising remediation measure for the biomass from contaminated field sites or organic rich

18612,mobility of radionuclides originating from geological repositories in the subsurface has been shown to be facilitated by clay colloids in brackish water however colloids may flocculate and act to immobilize radionuclides associated with them furthermore little research has been conducted on radionuclide interactions with carbonate rocks here the impact of bentonite colloid presence on the transport of a cocktail of u vi cs ce and re through fractured chalk was investigated flow through experiments were conducted with and without bentonite colloids present as a mixture of bentonite and ni altered montmorillonite colloids ce was used as an analogue for reactive actinides in the iii and vi redox states and re was considered an analogue for tc filtered brackish groundwater ionic strength 170 mm pumped from a fractured chalk aquitard in the northern negev desert of israel was used as a solution matrix rhenium transport was identical to that of the conservative tracer uranine the sorption coefficient kd of u vi cs and re calculated from batch experiments with crushed chalk proved to be a good predictor of mass recovery in transport experiments conducted without bentonite colloids a meaningful kd value for ce could not be calculated due to its precipitation as a ce carbonate colloids transport of both u vi and cs was indifferent to the presence of bentonite colloids however the addition of bentonite in the injection solution effectively immobilized ce decreasing its recovery from 17 41 to 0 8 1 4 this indicates that radionuclides which interact with clay colloids that undergo flocculation and deposition may effectively be immobilized in brackish aquifers the results of this study have implications for the prediction of potential mobility of radionuclides in safety assessments for future geological repositories to be located in fractured carbonate rocks in general and in brackish groundwater in particular graphical abstract image 1 keywords bentonite

designed to store high level waste are being designed and implemented in many countries alonso et al 2006 möri et al 2003 in many cases rock formations investigated as potential sites for repositories contain extensive fracture networks e g dittrich and reimus 2016 missana et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 fractures have been shown to be strong conduits for water and pollutants in the subsurface dittrich and reimus 2015 tang and weisbrod 2010 zvikelsky et al 2008 allowing for greater potential mobility of any leaked radionuclides for this reason many studies have investigated the mobility of various radionuclides through fractures dittrich and reimus 2016 höltä et al 1997 wolfsberg et al 2017 zavarin et al 2013 however geochemical parameters employed vary greatly between studies depending on the particular disposal site of interest one of the main mechanisms commonly associated with increased mobility of radionuclides in fractures is colloidal transport alonso et al 2006 kersting et al 1999 missana et al 2018 möri et al 2003 wolfsberg et al 2017 zavarin et al 2013 colloids consist of solid matter of diameters ranging from a few nm to approximately a few microns siegel and bryan 2003 stumm 1977 and can be composed of organic or inorganic matter this increased mobility has been attributed to colloidal size exclusion from the surrounding pore spaces mondal and sleep 2012 thereby limiting diffusion of colloid bound radionuclides into the rock matrix an additional mechanism is charge exclusion in which a negatively charged colloid is repelled from the negatively charged rock fracture surface and forced into the center of a flow path bradford et al 2003 where fluid flow velocity is greater sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 in order for colloid presence to increase radionuclide mobility the colloids must be stable in suspension the radionuclides must sorb to the colloid surface and sorption should be approaching irreversibility möri et al 2003 ryan and elimelech 1996 schäfer et al 2012 even under high ionic strength is conditions in which colloids would ordinarily be expected to flocculate and be immobilized colloids have been found to be mobile in some instances bennacer et al 2017 magal et al 2011 saiers and hornberger 1999 under such conditions radionuclides remaining sorbed to mobile colloid surfaces could be transported intrinsic colloids are colloids formed through the precipitation of solid phases composed of a radionuclide and a ligand generally co3 2 or oh runde 2000 schäfer et al 2012 these precipitated solids may act as colloids that undergo transport in a similar manner to their mineral or organic counterparts depending on their stability under the geochemical conditions along the flow path cerium an analogue for reactive actinides in the iii and iv redox states has been shown to precipitate readily with carbonate to form the ce co3 3 8h2o s amorphous solid klein bendavid et al 2019 which may undergo colloidal transport similar to carrier colloids tran et al 2015 it is well known that the potential mobility of both colloids and radionuclides is a function of geochemical conditions in the subsurface grolimund and borkovec 2005 saiers and hornberger 1999 um and papelis 2002 in many studies on colloid facilitated transport water matrices of low is are used to represent groundwater tang and weisbrod 2010 tran et al 2015 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 at the grimsel test site in switzerland for instance groundwater in granitic subsurfaces is of low is 1 2 mm möri et al 2003 which has been shown to provide ideal conditions for colloid facilitated transport additionally at the nevada national security site formerly the nevada test site the low is groundwater 3 0 mm and colloids generated through anthropogenic activities lead to a high potential for colloid mobilized radionuclides um and papelis 2002 however this is not necessarily useful for predicting potential mobility of radionuclides in environments of greater is such as those present in the negev desert of israel nativ et al 1997 in arid and some coastal environments the brackish nature of aquifers may result in very different interactions speciation and behavior of radionuclides as compared to aquifers of lower is acosta et al 2011 rout et al 2015 furthermore little is known about the potential mobility of actinides in fractured carbonate rocks froidevaux et al 2010 tran et al 2018 while a few studies have been conducted in fractured chalk tran et al 2016 2015 and fractured dolomite zavarin et al 2013 2005 suggesting that some actinides are mobilized through complexation or precipitation with dissolved carbonates more research is necessary on radionuclides of different geochemical properties it is therefore imperative to investigate transport of radionuclides under relevant geochemical conditions prior to carrying out any plans for geological repositories in close proximity to brackish aquifers in this study u vi cs re and ce have been chosen for investigation due to their varying geochemical properties natural u vi and stable cs are considered analogous in this study to their more radioactive counterparts rhenium is considered a good analogue for tc due to its similar electronic configuration hodge et al 1996 kim et al 2004 cerium has also been previously investigated as an analogue for reactive actinides in the iii and iv redox states such as am and pu which form complexes with carbonates larabi gruet et al 2007 nedel et al 2010 tran et al 2016 radionuclides released to the environment are most commonly released with other radionuclides gutierrez and fuentes 1993 it is therefore important to investigate their behavior in the presence of other radionuclides in this study u vi cs re and ce were investigated as a cocktail allowing for the comparison of the transport of radionuclides of various geochemical properties under identical flow conditions this study investigates the transport of each of these metals through natural chalk fractures with brackish water is 170 mm and compares their mobility to that under lower salinity conditions batch sorption studies and flow through transport experiments were used to characterize their sorption and transport behavior in addition the impact and stability of bentonite colloids on radionuclide transport was investigated this study provides insight into the migration potential of various radionuclides in brackish aquifers such as those found in the northern negev desert of israel some coastal areas in which seawater intrusion is leading to salinization of the groundwater and other arid and semi arid zones in which salinization is taking place 2 materials and methods 2 1 solutions and colloids groundwater gw pumped from the northwestern negev desert was used as a solution matrix for all batch and transport experiments groundwater was pumped from an observation well located in the fractured eocene chalk formation additional details in the supplementary information si to eliminate any natural particulate matter that may compete for sorption of the metals the water underwent ultra filtration using a hemoflow dialysis membrane f10hps fresenius medical care major ion concentrations were then analyzed using icp oes 720 es varian and ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex total organic content was also measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 s analytik jena chemical parameters of the gw solution are given in table 1 salts of u vi cs ce and re were obtained from sigma aldrich including uo2 no3 2 csoh 1h2o cecl3 7h2o and kreo4 stock solutions of approximately 1000 mg l were prepared by dissolving each salt in milli pore water in high density polyethylene bottles and acidifying each to 5 hno3 to ensure no sorption to bottle walls a 1 1 mixture of bentonite colloids b3378 sigma aldrich and synthetic ni altered montmorillonite colloids were used for all sorption and transport experiments we use the term bentonite throughout the manuscript to refer to this 1 1 mixture as the bentonite from aldrich we used is 99 montmorillonite in composition the ni altered montmorillonite colloids used in these experiments have similar sorption properties to febex bentonite and were developed to help track colloid movement at low concentrations where measurement of al may be more difficult due detection limit issues huber et al 2015 procedures for preparation of ni altered montmorillonite colloids can be found in reinholdt et al 2013 colloids were first washed to ensure they were in equilibrium with the groundwater as is described in the si the concentration of the final stock solution was measured by gravimetric analysis and was used for all subsequent batch and transport experiments the particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering dls 90plus brookhaven instruments 2 2 geochemical speciation modelling speciation of each of the four metals u vi cs ce and re in gw was calculated using the visual minteq code gustafsson 2016 and the code s thermo database which includes data from nist critical stability constants database and utilizes data from dong and brooks 2006 for the calculation of the ca2 uo2 co3 aqueous complex formation and stability the database was also updated to include the solubility product of the ce carbonate precipitate ce2 co3 3 8h2o s spahiu and bruno 1995 according to the equation 1 ce 2 co 3 3 8 h 2 o s 2 ce 3 3 co 3 2 8 h 2 o logk 35 1 the saturation index of solid phases was calculated over a 6 9 ph range concentrations of each metal used were equivalent to those measured in the injection solutions in experiment 3 table 2 2 3 batch experiments to determine the sorption capacity of the colloid suspension and crushed chalk material for each of the metal tracers batch experiments were performed a cocktail containing a mixture of u vi cs ce and re was introduced into a test tube containing either 10 g l crushed chalk or 1 g l bentonite suspension and the solution was stirred on an orbital stirrer for one week this is equivalent to the amount of time that was allowed for the injection solutions used in transport experiments to reach equilibrium as described in the next section after equilibration 1 5 ml aliquots of each sample were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h 50 nm particle size cutoff the four trace element concentrations in the supernatant were then analyzed by icp ms nexion perkinelmer analytical details in si the solid to solution ratios were chosen such that sorption of each metal to each surface could be detected by icp ms the sorption coefficient kd for each metal was calculated for each metal according to eq 2 2 k d s o r c i c f c f v m where ci is the initial concentration cf is the final concentration in solution after centrifugation v is the volume of the solution and m is the mass of solid the metal concentrations employed in the equilibration experiments were the same as those used in the injection solutions for the transport experiments table 2 additional samples containing only solids chalk or bentonite in gw and only metals in gw were prepared to ensure that no background metals were leached from the solids and to check for precipitation of each metal with dissolved salts as uranine dye was employed as a conservative tracer in transport experiments similar batch samples to those described were also prepared in the presence of uranine to check for uranine s influence on metal sorption all samples were run in duplicate 2 4 transport experiments flow though transport experiments using a naturally fractured chalk rock core were performed to investigate the mobility of metals in the presence and absence of colloids a photo diagram of the flow through system is provided in the si fig s2 the procedures follow tran et al 2016 with alterations that are summarized below 2 4 1 hydraulic measurements prior to starting the transport experiments the fracture s apparent hydraulic aperture 2b cm was calculated by measuring the discharge of the fracture at varying hydraulic heads according to the cubic law snow 1968 3 2 b 3 q 12 μ ρ g w d l d x where q is the fluid discharge ml min μ is the dynamic viscosity cm2 s ρ is the fluid density g cm3 g is the gravitational constant cm2 s w is the fracture width cm and dl dx is the hydraulic gradient the obtained value was then used to calculate the fracture volume fv ml 4 l w 2 b f v where l is the fracture length cm this measurement was performed once prior to all transport experiments and a second time following the last transport experiment to ensure that no measurable mineral precipitation fracture wall dissolution or deposition of colloidal matter lead to a change in the hydraulic properties of the fracture 2 4 2 flow through experiments each tracer solution was prepared in gw and stirred on an orbital stirrer for one week prior to injection table 2 metal concentrations in the tracer injection solution were chosen based on a combination of predicted sorption behaviors in the chalk from preliminary batch experiments and known icp ms detection limits for each element all tracer solutions contained 2 5 mg l of uranine and were naturally buffered by the gw to within 0 05 ph units of ph 7 60 in experiments with the bentonite colloids a colloid stock was added such that each tracer solution contained 100 mg l colloids at injection at the start of each experiment the inlet cell of the flow through system was saturated with the tracer solution the solution was then pumped through the fracture using a low flow peristaltic pump minipuls 3 gilson at a rate of 0 3 ml min until an equivalent of one system pore volume spv had passed through the system the spv was defined as the fv eq 4 plus the volume of the outlet cell and tubing the only exception was in experiment 2 in which a discharge of 0 5 ml min was used in order to investigate the influence of increased shear forces and diffusion and under different residence times after the initial injection the pumping was briefly stopped 2 min to allow the inlet cell to be saturated with fresh tracer free gw pumping was then resumed and tracer free gw was injected until the end of the experiment samples were collected with a fraction collector spectra chrom cf 1 spectrum chromatography at 15 min intervals at the end of each experiment the bulk and aqueous metal concentrations of each sample were analyzed to analyze the bulk concentration one ml of each sample was immediately acidified with 0 3 ml concentrated hno3 in a microcentrifuge tube and allowed to stir overnight this ensured the full dissolution of any precipitates which had formed and leached all sorbed metals from the colloid surfaces each sample was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h cutoff 50 nm to remove the remaining undissolved silicates and the final sample was diluted to 0 1 m hno3 for icp ms analysis for the aqueous concentrations a 1 5 ml alioquot of each bulk sample was first centrifuged similarly to the bulk samples to remove all particulate matter care was taken to shake and homogenize each bulk sample prior to taking each aliquot one ml of each supernatant was then diluted in 9 ml 0 1 m hno3 for analysis further details of analytical procedures can be found in the si it was assumed that the difference between the bulk and aqueous concentrations of each metal is the colloidal fraction the mass recovery of each element was calculated by subtracting the background concentration from all measurements and integrating the concentrations from bulk samples over the experiment time 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater composition full chemical parameters for gw are given in table 1 the gw used in these experiments has a low total organic carbon toc content of 3 48 mg l organic compounds have been shown to stabilize radionuclide bearing inorganic colloids mccarthy 1998 tang and weisbrod 2010 walshe et al 2010 wang et al 2014 however at this low toc concentration it is unlikely to play a major role in clay colloid stability 3 2 geochemical speciation cerium and u vi are known to form complexes with other dissolved ions in solution burow et al 2017 dong and brooks 2006 tran et al 2018 2015 chemical speciation of ce and u vi as a function of ph is shown in fig 1 over the range of ph of gw 6 9 the ce solid ce2 co3 3 8h2o is above the saturation index indicating that it will readily precipitate with bicarbonate in solution the u vi on the other hand is present as a stable ca uo2 co3 ternary complex in solution and is not expected to precipitate according to thermodynamic analysis the dominating u vi species is ca2uo2 co3 3 aq a neutral species which accounts for approximately 80 of the uranyl species followed by cauo2 co3 3 2 20 the neutral species is also calculated to be the most thermodynamically stable one under conditions of similar ph but lower is 5 mm where this species accounts for 95 of the uranyl ion complexation in solution elzinga et al 2004 cesium does not readily form aqueous complexes in solution rather it strongly sorbs to mineral surfaces through cation exchange cornell 1993 galamboš et al 2010 seaman et al 2001 rhenium was added to all experiments as perrhenate reo4 this form of re has been shown to act as a conservative tracer ex samper et al 1997 turin et al 2002 zavarin et al 2005 as it does not react readily with ions in solution inorganic minerals or organic substances hodge et al 1996 3 3 batch experiments sorption coefficients were calculated for each element for both bentonite and crushed chalk suspensions no significant impact of uranine presence was noted for sorption of each element table s1 as expected re sorption remained negligible kd 1 ml g and proved to be conservative cerium yielded artificially high sorption coefficients for bentonite and crushed chalk respectively fig 2 these values are due to ce precipitation with hco3 fig 1a which accounts for ce removal from solution cesium sorption kd remained between 40 and 50 ml g for both bentonite and crushed chalk suspensions uranium sorption kd was around 160 ml g on the bentonite colloids but this number was less than 10 ml g for chalk suspensions these results are comparable to those reported for cs and u vi sorption to a 1 g l suspension of bentonite in artificial groundwater of similar composition and is to that investigated here tran et al 2018 in comparison at lower is both elements have been shown to exhibit a kd of several orders of magnitude greater to bentonite missana et al 2014 tang and weisbrod 2010 tran et al 2018 though cs is not known to sorb strongly to calcite it can sorb to the non carbonate minerals contained within the chalk rock previous analysis of a chalk sample taken from the same rock from which the core was drilled revealed that quartz opal ct clinoptilolite smectite and palygorskite minerals together account for up to 20 of the chalk volume weisbrod et al 1999 the cs ion has been shown to sorb strongly to smectite durrant et al 2018 missana et al 2014 and clinoptilolite cortés martínez et al 2010 the smectite and clinoptilolite which together account for approximately 9 of the chalk matrix weisbrod et al 1999 likely play a dominant role in controlling cs transport in chalk 3 4 transport experiments 3 4 1 hydraulic measurements hydraulic measurements indicated that the total fracture volume was 10 8 ml as the outlet cell and tubing has previously reported to be approximately 20 ml in volume zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 and the tubing volume was estimated to contain 10 ml the spv was defined as 40 8 ml the consistency in hydraulic parameters throughout experiments was confirmed in two ways 1 a second measurement of the fracture s hydraulic aperture performed following the completion of all transport experiments was consistent with that measured prior to experiments and 2 the breakthrough curves of the uranine in the four experiments conducted with reactive tracers at similar flow rates exhibited nearly perfect overlap fig s3 indicating that the breakthrough curves for the other reactive tracers are indeed comparable 3 4 2 transport experiments without bentonite colloids in all transport experiments conducted the conservative tracers uranine and re exhibited very similar breakthrough behavior cesium was nearly immobile throughout the experiment fig 3 and less than 1 of the injected mass was recovered from the fracture in all cases table 3 this is probably attributable to cs sorption to the minor smectite and clinoptilolite components in the chalk as previously discussed in a similar study tang and weisbrod 2010 investigated the transport of cs under low is conditions in fractured chalk the study reported that 28 of the injected colloidal cs and 27 of the injected aqueous cs was recovered on average from experiments in which a 500 mg l montmorillonite colloid suspension was injected together with the cs this significantly greater recovery can be accounted for by the high initial cs concentrations employed in that study 220 μm vs 10 μm in the present study suggesting that the greater dissolved species recovery was due to saturation of available exchange sites within the fracture additionally a greater discharge was employed in the previous study 1 ml min vs 0 3 ml min in the present study which lead to shorter residence times in the fracture and may not have allowed cs to fully reach equilibrium with the fracture surface or diffuse into the matrix our results suggest that even under moderate is cs is not expected to be significantly mobile in chalk fractured rocks uranium exhibits retarded transport as an aqueous species fig 3 the concentration continues to increase until approximately four spvs have passed then declines only slightly until the end of the experiment the mass recovery ranged between 39 and 67 for experiments without colloids the combination of u vi sorption onto the fracture surface followed by partial desorption leads to a highly retarded breakthrough curve and a long tail similar u vi behavior has been reported by dittrich and reimus 2015 at ph 6 9 in crushed granodiorite who attributed the long tail to slow desorption processes in gw nearly all of the u vi is predicted to be complexed as either cauo2 co3 2 2 aq or as the ca2uo2 co3 3 aq ternary species fig 1 while the negatively charged former species would not be predicted to sorb to the chalk fracture surface the latter is neutral and is therefore not actively repelled from the chalk surface through charge exclusion it can be concluded therefore that uranyl complexed as the neutral ternary species comes into contact with the fracture surface and forms surface complexes with the caco3 within the rock itself this is the species that has been shown to dominate surface complexation in luminescence studies of u vi sorption to calcite elzinga et al 2004 and is therefore assumed here to be responsible for u vi retardation cerium is the only element that exhibited fractionated transport as both a colloidal and aqueous species despite the fact that bentonite colloids were not added to these experiments the ce appeared to be transported mostly as an intrinsic colloidal species fig 3 as can be seen by the large difference in the total and aqueous breakthrough curves furthermore the ce exhibited early arrival arrival at 0 32 spv defined here as c c0 0 02 in comparison to the re spv 0 77 early arrival has previously been attributed to colloid facilitated transport missana et al 2008 tang and weisbrod 2010 tran et al 2015 2016 as the zeta potential for ce carbonate precipitates has been shown to have a relatively low absolute value 10 2 mv tran et al 2015 charge exclusion is not responsible for this observed acceleration rather this is accounted for by size exclusion of the ce intrinsic colloids from diffusion into the pore space of the chalk matrix in gray chalk in the negev 99 of pore throat diameters are less than 0 4 μm bloomfield and nygaard 2003 much smaller than the ca 3 μm precipitate colloid particle diameters measured here therefore ce intrinsic colloids would not be expected to diffuse into the pore space of the chalk size exclusion has also been explored by zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 and weisbrod et al 2013 who found that the mobility of colloids of 1 2 μm diameter was higher than that of smaller particles in similar fractured rocks the recovery of each metal from the fracture in the absence of colloids plotted against its kd to crushed chalk obtained from batch experiments yields a high correlative linear relationship r2 0 99 fig 4 in this plot ce is not included as it is impossible to calculate a meaningful kd for ce under these carbonate rich conditions leading to its fast precipitation as previously discussed this relationship implies that for this particular system in the absence of clay colloids kd measurements from batch experiments can be used to predict the overall mobility of reactive tracers in single fractures wang et al 2009 compared kd obtained from batch experiments to kd obtained from fitted models of breakthrough curves of cs through crushed granite and showed that this assumption is valid given that high 0 25 solid to solution ratios are used in batch experiments 3 4 3 transport experiments with bentonite colloids two replicate experiments were conducted with clay colloids table 2 in both experiments the uranine and re migrated similarly to the experiments in which no colloids were added confirming both tracers conservative behavior in both bentonite colloid experiments al concentrations remained below the limit of quantification si section 4 throughout the experiment it was concluded that the clay colloid mixture was nearly immobile within the fracture due to the brackish water yielding unfavorable conditions for stability however it is possible to compare the behavior of each of the reactive tracers to experiments conducted in the absence of colloids to determine the effect of colloid presence on reactive transport the recovery of u vi did not change significantly with the addition of clay colloids to the injection solution nor did the maximum relative concentration reached during the experiment fig 5 little u iv sorption to the colloids was noted prior to injection table 2 the aqueous u vi breakthrough curve overlaps with that of the bulk u fig s4 indicating that u vi is mainly mobile as an aqueous species this is supported by comparing experiments with and without colloids fig 6 in which u vi exhibits nearly identical behavior this can be explained by the formation of ternary species that prevent the sorption of u vi to fracture surfaces and clay colloids allowing for its increased mobility this result is consistent with other studies conducted at moderate is for instance in the presence of the iron oxy hydroxide colloid akaganeite colloidal transport was negligible at is 4 2 10 3 m while u vi remained mobile ge et al 2018 in contrast the authors showed that at lower is 4 2 10 5 m where colloids are mobile colloidal presence inhibits u vi transport colloid presence did not influence the mobility of cs in the fractures in both replicate experiments in the injection solutions of experiments 5 and 6 less than 5 of the cs was initially sorbed to the colloids table 2 furthermore similar cs recoveries of 0 03 0 29 in the absence of clay colloids and 0 27 0 31 in the presence of clay colloids were observed table 3 the aqueous species breakthrough curve overlaps closely with the bulk concentration breakthrough curve fig s4 and that cs breakthrough curves exhibit similar behavior with and without colloids fig 6 these three facts together suggest that the addition of clay colloids did not lead to any change in cs mobility this is in contrast to tang and weisbrod 2010 who found that colloidal transport accounted for at least half of the observed recovery of cs in solution however the lower is employed in their study allowed for more stable and mobile colloids and greater cs sorption prior to injection probably accounting for the greater cs mobility to further investigate how the geochemical properties of each tracer affect transport the discharge was increased from 0 3 to 1 1 ml min at 12 5 spv for additional 3 spv during experiment 6 which is seen as dotted lines in figs 5 and 6 while this discharge increase had no observable effect on re and only a very slight effect on ce and u transport a more pronounced effect was observed for cs as nearly all of the cs was present in the fracture in aqueous form 99 table 2 this increase in mobility is not attributable to resuspension of colloid associated cs rather the increase in flow rate decreased the residence time allowed for cs to sorb to the fracture surface resulting in a spike in cs concentration in the outlet and demonstrating the effect of cs sorption kinetics further analysis and discussion is provided in the si section 5 the most discernable difference between experiments conducted in the absence and presence of clay colloids is that of ce mobility and recovery in experiments conducted with no clay colloids ce recoveries were 17 41 with early breakthroughs suggesting colloidal ce was precipitated and mobilized when the clay colloid suspension was added the recovery dropped to 0 8 1 4 in fig 5 ce is presented on a secondary y axis where it is apparent that there is no true breakthrough of ce at any point during the initial part of the experiment the relative concentration of ce becomes negligible upon the addition of bentonite colloids fig 6b a reasonable interpretation for the lack of ce mobility in the presence of bentonite colloids is the formation of large heteroaggregates of ce intrinsic colloids with clay colloids in the injection solution because the clay colloids are immobile under the brackish conditions their presence prevents the movement of the ce intrinsic colloids into and through the fracture reducing their overall recovery 3 5 effect of ionic strength on colloid facilitated transport it is interesting to note the differences between the behavior of ce in the current study and earlier work conducted in low is artificial rain water arw 2 2 mm in a comparable fractured chalk core of similar dimensions tran et al 2015 2016 at lower is ce mobility increased significantly by the addition of 500 mg l bentonite colloids where recovery increased from 7 12 to 14 27 upon the addition of the clay colloid suspension table 4 this increase was attributed to the formation of stable heterocolloids in which precipitated ce intrinsic colloids migrated together with stable bentonite colloids because similar clay colloids are unstable under the brackish conditions investigated in the current study 170 mm the addition of these colloids to the injection solution had the opposite effect decreasing ce recovery from 17 41 to 0 8 1 4 table 4 under low is colloid facilitated transport is well documented mccarthy 1998 missana et al 2008 ryan and elimelech 1996 while at high is colloid mobility decreases dramatically bennacer et al 2017 ge et al 2018 kelly et al 1999 mondal and sleep 2012 and therefore colloid facilitated transport is not anticipated to play a role similar cases in which high ionic strength have been shown to decrease mobility have previously been shown in the case of bacteriophage transport associated with kaolinite colloids walshe et al 2010 and u vi transport with akaganeite colloids ge et al 2018 in gw clay colloid suspensions are not stable but ce intrinsic colloids are still able to form associations with the clay colloid surfaces heteroaggregates of this sort have previously been described in tran et al 2016 and were shown to facilitate ce transport in low is arw however their formation in brackish water proves to be a barrier to ce transport and therefore other analogous carbonate solids may also be impacted by mineral colloidal presence under similar conditions 4 conclusions the current study shows that in arid environments where brackish groundwater resulting from dissolution and evaporation is common clay colloids would not be expected to facilitate radionuclide transport in certain cases such as that of ce the opposite could occur the presence of clay colloids may serve as a barrier to radionuclide transport our results showed that when bentonite colloids were absent the crushed chalk batch sorption coefficients kd of re u vi and cs correlated linearly with the recovery of each element from the chalk fracture under these circumstances kd values can be used in transport predictions in the absence of colloids the kd of ce could not be calculated due to its precipitation with hco3 which accounted for the majority of ce removal from solution in batch experiments at moderate is ca 170 mm the flocculation of clay colloids had little influence on cs and u vi migration through fractured chalk aquifers for cs this was the result of its high sorption to the chalk fracture wall and low initial sorption to the colloid surfaces cesium recovery was ultimately quite low 0 23 0 13 in all experiments regardless of clay colloid presence in the case of u vi the uranyl ion was stabilized in solution through the formation of the ca2uo2 co3 3 aq complex preventing its sorption to both colloid and fracture wall surfaces and leading to greater recoveries 23 67 than the other reactive metals bentonite colloid presence had a marked impact on precipitable carbonate solids formed by trivalent ce serving to inhibit its mobility through the fracture this was attributed to precipitate colloids forming associations with the clay colloids in the injection solution which are subsequently deposited onto the fracture surface preventing their further migration when bentonite colloids were added to the injection solution ce recovery strongly decreased from 17 41 to 0 8 1 4 this may have implications for the mobility of iii and iv actinides such as am and pu which may precipitate and or associate with mineral colloids under brackish

18612,mobility of radionuclides originating from geological repositories in the subsurface has been shown to be facilitated by clay colloids in brackish water however colloids may flocculate and act to immobilize radionuclides associated with them furthermore little research has been conducted on radionuclide interactions with carbonate rocks here the impact of bentonite colloid presence on the transport of a cocktail of u vi cs ce and re through fractured chalk was investigated flow through experiments were conducted with and without bentonite colloids present as a mixture of bentonite and ni altered montmorillonite colloids ce was used as an analogue for reactive actinides in the iii and vi redox states and re was considered an analogue for tc filtered brackish groundwater ionic strength 170 mm pumped from a fractured chalk aquitard in the northern negev desert of israel was used as a solution matrix rhenium transport was identical to that of the conservative tracer uranine the sorption coefficient kd of u vi cs and re calculated from batch experiments with crushed chalk proved to be a good predictor of mass recovery in transport experiments conducted without bentonite colloids a meaningful kd value for ce could not be calculated due to its precipitation as a ce carbonate colloids transport of both u vi and cs was indifferent to the presence of bentonite colloids however the addition of bentonite in the injection solution effectively immobilized ce decreasing its recovery from 17 41 to 0 8 1 4 this indicates that radionuclides which interact with clay colloids that undergo flocculation and deposition may effectively be immobilized in brackish aquifers the results of this study have implications for the prediction of potential mobility of radionuclides in safety assessments for future geological repositories to be located in fractured carbonate rocks in general and in brackish groundwater in particular graphical abstract image 1 keywords bentonite

contain extensive fracture networks e g dittrich and reimus 2016 missana et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 fractures have been shown to be strong conduits for water and pollutants in the subsurface dittrich and reimus 2015 tang and weisbrod 2010 zvikelsky et al 2008 allowing for greater potential mobility of any leaked radionuclides for this reason many studies have investigated the mobility of various radionuclides through fractures dittrich and reimus 2016 höltä et al 1997 wolfsberg et al 2017 zavarin et al 2013 however geochemical parameters employed vary greatly between studies depending on the particular disposal site of interest one of the main mechanisms commonly associated with increased mobility of radionuclides in fractures is colloidal transport alonso et al 2006 kersting et al 1999 missana et al 2018 möri et al 2003 wolfsberg et al 2017 zavarin et al 2013 colloids consist of solid matter of diameters ranging from a few nm to approximately a few microns siegel and bryan 2003 stumm 1977 and can be composed of organic or inorganic matter this increased mobility has been attributed to colloidal size exclusion from the surrounding pore spaces mondal and sleep 2012 thereby limiting diffusion of colloid bound radionuclides into the rock matrix an additional mechanism is charge exclusion in which a negatively charged colloid is repelled from the negatively charged rock fracture surface and forced into the center of a flow path bradford et al 2003 where fluid flow velocity is greater sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 in order for colloid presence to increase radionuclide mobility the colloids must be stable in suspension the radionuclides must sorb to the colloid surface and sorption should be approaching irreversibility möri et al 2003 ryan and elimelech 1996 schäfer et al 2012 even under high ionic strength is conditions in which colloids would ordinarily be expected to flocculate and be immobilized colloids have been found to be mobile in some instances bennacer et al 2017 magal et al 2011 saiers and hornberger 1999 under such conditions radionuclides remaining sorbed to mobile colloid surfaces could be transported intrinsic colloids are colloids formed through the precipitation of solid phases composed of a radionuclide and a ligand generally co3 2 or oh runde 2000 schäfer et al 2012 these precipitated solids may act as colloids that undergo transport in a similar manner to their mineral or organic counterparts depending on their stability under the geochemical conditions along the flow path cerium an analogue for reactive actinides in the iii and iv redox states has been shown to precipitate readily with carbonate to form the ce co3 3 8h2o s amorphous solid klein bendavid et al 2019 which may undergo colloidal transport similar to carrier colloids tran et al 2015 it is well known that the potential mobility of both colloids and radionuclides is a function of geochemical conditions in the subsurface grolimund and borkovec 2005 saiers and hornberger 1999 um and papelis 2002 in many studies on colloid facilitated transport water matrices of low is are used to represent groundwater tang and weisbrod 2010 tran et al 2015 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 at the grimsel test site in switzerland for instance groundwater in granitic subsurfaces is of low is 1 2 mm möri et al 2003 which has been shown to provide ideal conditions for colloid facilitated transport additionally at the nevada national security site formerly the nevada test site the low is groundwater 3 0 mm and colloids generated through anthropogenic activities lead to a high potential for colloid mobilized radionuclides um and papelis 2002 however this is not necessarily useful for predicting potential mobility of radionuclides in environments of greater is such as those present in the negev desert of israel nativ et al 1997 in arid and some coastal environments the brackish nature of aquifers may result in very different interactions speciation and behavior of radionuclides as compared to aquifers of lower is acosta et al 2011 rout et al 2015 furthermore little is known about the potential mobility of actinides in fractured carbonate rocks froidevaux et al 2010 tran et al 2018 while a few studies have been conducted in fractured chalk tran et al 2016 2015 and fractured dolomite zavarin et al 2013 2005 suggesting that some actinides are mobilized through complexation or precipitation with dissolved carbonates more research is necessary on radionuclides of different geochemical properties it is therefore imperative to investigate transport of radionuclides under relevant geochemical conditions prior to carrying out any plans for geological repositories in close proximity to brackish aquifers in this study u vi cs re and ce have been chosen for investigation due to their varying geochemical properties natural u vi and stable cs are considered analogous in this study to their more radioactive counterparts rhenium is considered a good analogue for tc due to its similar electronic configuration hodge et al 1996 kim et al 2004 cerium has also been previously investigated as an analogue for reactive actinides in the iii and iv redox states such as am and pu which form complexes with carbonates larabi gruet et al 2007 nedel et al 2010 tran et al 2016 radionuclides released to the environment are most commonly released with other radionuclides gutierrez and fuentes 1993 it is therefore important to investigate their behavior in the presence of other radionuclides in this study u vi cs re and ce were investigated as a cocktail allowing for the comparison of the transport of radionuclides of various geochemical properties under identical flow conditions this study investigates the transport of each of these metals through natural chalk fractures with brackish water is 170 mm and compares their mobility to that under lower salinity conditions batch sorption studies and flow through transport experiments were used to characterize their sorption and transport behavior in addition the impact and stability of bentonite colloids on radionuclide transport was investigated this study provides insight into the migration potential of various radionuclides in brackish aquifers such as those found in the northern negev desert of israel some coastal areas in which seawater intrusion is leading to salinization of the groundwater and other arid and semi arid zones in which salinization is taking place 2 materials and methods 2 1 solutions and colloids groundwater gw pumped from the northwestern negev desert was used as a solution matrix for all batch and transport experiments groundwater was pumped from an observation well located in the fractured eocene chalk formation additional details in the supplementary information si to eliminate any natural particulate matter that may compete for sorption of the metals the water underwent ultra filtration using a hemoflow dialysis membrane f10hps fresenius medical care major ion concentrations were then analyzed using icp oes 720 es varian and ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex total organic content was also measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 s analytik jena chemical parameters of the gw solution are given in table 1 salts of u vi cs ce and re were obtained from sigma aldrich including uo2 no3 2 csoh 1h2o cecl3 7h2o and kreo4 stock solutions of approximately 1000 mg l were prepared by dissolving each salt in milli pore water in high density polyethylene bottles and acidifying each to 5 hno3 to ensure no sorption to bottle walls a 1 1 mixture of bentonite colloids b3378 sigma aldrich and synthetic ni altered montmorillonite colloids were used for all sorption and transport experiments we use the term bentonite throughout the manuscript to refer to this 1 1 mixture as the bentonite from aldrich we used is 99 montmorillonite in composition the ni altered montmorillonite colloids used in these experiments have similar sorption properties to febex bentonite and were developed to help track colloid movement at low concentrations where measurement of al may be more difficult due detection limit issues huber et al 2015 procedures for preparation of ni altered montmorillonite colloids can be found in reinholdt et al 2013 colloids were first washed to ensure they were in equilibrium with the groundwater as is described in the si the concentration of the final stock solution was measured by gravimetric analysis and was used for all subsequent batch and transport experiments the particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering dls 90plus brookhaven instruments 2 2 geochemical speciation modelling speciation of each of the four metals u vi cs ce and re in gw was calculated using the visual minteq code gustafsson 2016 and the code s thermo database which includes data from nist critical stability constants database and utilizes data from dong and brooks 2006 for the calculation of the ca2 uo2 co3 aqueous complex formation and stability the database was also updated to include the solubility product of the ce carbonate precipitate ce2 co3 3 8h2o s spahiu and bruno 1995 according to the equation 1 ce 2 co 3 3 8 h 2 o s 2 ce 3 3 co 3 2 8 h 2 o logk 35 1 the saturation index of solid phases was calculated over a 6 9 ph range concentrations of each metal used were equivalent to those measured in the injection solutions in experiment 3 table 2 2 3 batch experiments to determine the sorption capacity of the colloid suspension and crushed chalk material for each of the metal tracers batch experiments were performed a cocktail containing a mixture of u vi cs ce and re was introduced into a test tube containing either 10 g l crushed chalk or 1 g l bentonite suspension and the solution was stirred on an orbital stirrer for one week this is equivalent to the amount of time that was allowed for the injection solutions used in transport experiments to reach equilibrium as described in the next section after equilibration 1 5 ml aliquots of each sample were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h 50 nm particle size cutoff the four trace element concentrations in the supernatant were then analyzed by icp ms nexion perkinelmer analytical details in si the solid to solution ratios were chosen such that sorption of each metal to each surface could be detected by icp ms the sorption coefficient kd for each metal was calculated for each metal according to eq 2 2 k d s o r c i c f c f v m where ci is the initial concentration cf is the final concentration in solution after centrifugation v is the volume of the solution and m is the mass of solid the metal concentrations employed in the equilibration experiments were the same as those used in the injection solutions for the transport experiments table 2 additional samples containing only solids chalk or bentonite in gw and only metals in gw were prepared to ensure that no background metals were leached from the solids and to check for precipitation of each metal with dissolved salts as uranine dye was employed as a conservative tracer in transport experiments similar batch samples to those described were also prepared in the presence of uranine to check for uranine s influence on metal sorption all samples were run in duplicate 2 4 transport experiments flow though transport experiments using a naturally fractured chalk rock core were performed to investigate the mobility of metals in the presence and absence of colloids a photo diagram of the flow through system is provided in the si fig s2 the procedures follow tran et al 2016 with alterations that are summarized below 2 4 1 hydraulic measurements prior to starting the transport experiments the fracture s apparent hydraulic aperture 2b cm was calculated by measuring the discharge of the fracture at varying hydraulic heads according to the cubic law snow 1968 3 2 b 3 q 12 μ ρ g w d l d x where q is the fluid discharge ml min μ is the dynamic viscosity cm2 s ρ is the fluid density g cm3 g is the gravitational constant cm2 s w is the fracture width cm and dl dx is the hydraulic gradient the obtained value was then used to calculate the fracture volume fv ml 4 l w 2 b f v where l is the fracture length cm this measurement was performed once prior to all transport experiments and a second time following the last transport experiment to ensure that no measurable mineral precipitation fracture wall dissolution or deposition of colloidal matter lead to a change in the hydraulic properties of the fracture 2 4 2 flow through experiments each tracer solution was prepared in gw and stirred on an orbital stirrer for one week prior to injection table 2 metal concentrations in the tracer injection solution were chosen based on a combination of predicted sorption behaviors in the chalk from preliminary batch experiments and known icp ms detection limits for each element all tracer solutions contained 2 5 mg l of uranine and were naturally buffered by the gw to within 0 05 ph units of ph 7 60 in experiments with the bentonite colloids a colloid stock was added such that each tracer solution contained 100 mg l colloids at injection at the start of each experiment the inlet cell of the flow through system was saturated with the tracer solution the solution was then pumped through the fracture using a low flow peristaltic pump minipuls 3 gilson at a rate of 0 3 ml min until an equivalent of one system pore volume spv had passed through the system the spv was defined as the fv eq 4 plus the volume of the outlet cell and tubing the only exception was in experiment 2 in which a discharge of 0 5 ml min was used in order to investigate the influence of increased shear forces and diffusion and under different residence times after the initial injection the pumping was briefly stopped 2 min to allow the inlet cell to be saturated with fresh tracer free gw pumping was then resumed and tracer free gw was injected until the end of the experiment samples were collected with a fraction collector spectra chrom cf 1 spectrum chromatography at 15 min intervals at the end of each experiment the bulk and aqueous metal concentrations of each sample were analyzed to analyze the bulk concentration one ml of each sample was immediately acidified with 0 3 ml concentrated hno3 in a microcentrifuge tube and allowed to stir overnight this ensured the full dissolution of any precipitates which had formed and leached all sorbed metals from the colloid surfaces each sample was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h cutoff 50 nm to remove the remaining undissolved silicates and the final sample was diluted to 0 1 m hno3 for icp ms analysis for the aqueous concentrations a 1 5 ml alioquot of each bulk sample was first centrifuged similarly to the bulk samples to remove all particulate matter care was taken to shake and homogenize each bulk sample prior to taking each aliquot one ml of each supernatant was then diluted in 9 ml 0 1 m hno3 for analysis further details of analytical procedures can be found in the si it was assumed that the difference between the bulk and aqueous concentrations of each metal is the colloidal fraction the mass recovery of each element was calculated by subtracting the background concentration from all measurements and integrating the concentrations from bulk samples over the experiment time 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater composition full chemical parameters for gw are given in table 1 the gw used in these experiments has a low total organic carbon toc content of 3 48 mg l organic compounds have been shown to stabilize radionuclide bearing inorganic colloids mccarthy 1998 tang and weisbrod 2010 walshe et al 2010 wang et al 2014 however at this low toc concentration it is unlikely to play a major role in clay colloid stability 3 2 geochemical speciation cerium and u vi are known to form complexes with other dissolved ions in solution burow et al 2017 dong and brooks 2006 tran et al 2018 2015 chemical speciation of ce and u vi as a function of ph is shown in fig 1 over the range of ph of gw 6 9 the ce solid ce2 co3 3 8h2o is above the saturation index indicating that it will readily precipitate with bicarbonate in solution the u vi on the other hand is present as a stable ca uo2 co3 ternary complex in solution and is not expected to precipitate according to thermodynamic analysis the dominating u vi species is ca2uo2 co3 3 aq a neutral species which accounts for approximately 80 of the uranyl species followed by cauo2 co3 3 2 20 the neutral species is also calculated to be the most thermodynamically stable one under conditions of similar ph but lower is 5 mm where this species accounts for 95 of the uranyl ion complexation in solution elzinga et al 2004 cesium does not readily form aqueous complexes in solution rather it strongly sorbs to mineral surfaces through cation exchange cornell 1993 galamboš et al 2010 seaman et al 2001 rhenium was added to all experiments as perrhenate reo4 this form of re has been shown to act as a conservative tracer ex samper et al 1997 turin et al 2002 zavarin et al 2005 as it does not react readily with ions in solution inorganic minerals or organic substances hodge et al 1996 3 3 batch experiments sorption coefficients were calculated for each element for both bentonite and crushed chalk suspensions no significant impact of uranine presence was noted for sorption of each element table s1 as expected re sorption remained negligible kd 1 ml g and proved to be conservative cerium yielded artificially high sorption coefficients for bentonite and crushed chalk respectively fig 2 these values are due to ce precipitation with hco3 fig 1a which accounts for ce removal from solution cesium sorption kd remained between 40 and 50 ml g for both bentonite and crushed chalk suspensions uranium sorption kd was around 160 ml g on the bentonite colloids but this number was less than 10 ml g for chalk suspensions these results are comparable to those reported for cs and u vi sorption to a 1 g l suspension of bentonite in artificial groundwater of similar composition and is to that investigated here tran et al 2018 in comparison at lower is both elements have been shown to exhibit a kd of several orders of magnitude greater to bentonite missana et al 2014 tang and weisbrod 2010 tran et al 2018 though cs is not known to sorb strongly to calcite it can sorb to the non carbonate minerals contained within the chalk rock previous analysis of a chalk sample taken from the same rock from which the core was drilled revealed that quartz opal ct clinoptilolite smectite and palygorskite minerals together account for up to 20 of the chalk volume weisbrod et al 1999 the cs ion has been shown to sorb strongly to smectite durrant et al 2018 missana et al 2014 and clinoptilolite cortés martínez et al 2010 the smectite and clinoptilolite which together account for approximately 9 of the chalk matrix weisbrod et al 1999 likely play a dominant role in controlling cs transport in chalk 3 4 transport experiments 3 4 1 hydraulic measurements hydraulic measurements indicated that the total fracture volume was 10 8 ml as the outlet cell and tubing has previously reported to be approximately 20 ml in volume zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 and the tubing volume was estimated to contain 10 ml the spv was defined as 40 8 ml the consistency in hydraulic parameters throughout experiments was confirmed in two ways 1 a second measurement of the fracture s hydraulic aperture performed following the completion of all transport experiments was consistent with that measured prior to experiments and 2 the breakthrough curves of the uranine in the four experiments conducted with reactive tracers at similar flow rates exhibited nearly perfect overlap fig s3 indicating that the breakthrough curves for the other reactive tracers are indeed comparable 3 4 2 transport experiments without bentonite colloids in all transport experiments conducted the conservative tracers uranine and re exhibited very similar breakthrough behavior cesium was nearly immobile throughout the experiment fig 3 and less than 1 of the injected mass was recovered from the fracture in all cases table 3 this is probably attributable to cs sorption to the minor smectite and clinoptilolite components in the chalk as previously discussed in a similar study tang and weisbrod 2010 investigated the transport of cs under low is conditions in fractured chalk the study reported that 28 of the injected colloidal cs and 27 of the injected aqueous cs was recovered on average from experiments in which a 500 mg l montmorillonite colloid suspension was injected together with the cs this significantly greater recovery can be accounted for by the high initial cs concentrations employed in that study 220 μm vs 10 μm in the present study suggesting that the greater dissolved species recovery was due to saturation of available exchange sites within the fracture additionally a greater discharge was employed in the previous study 1 ml min vs 0 3 ml min in the present study which lead to shorter residence times in the fracture and may not have allowed cs to fully reach equilibrium with the fracture surface or diffuse into the matrix our results suggest that even under moderate is cs is not expected to be significantly mobile in chalk fractured rocks uranium exhibits retarded transport as an aqueous species fig 3 the concentration continues to increase until approximately four spvs have passed then declines only slightly until the end of the experiment the mass recovery ranged between 39 and 67 for experiments without colloids the combination of u vi sorption onto the fracture surface followed by partial desorption leads to a highly retarded breakthrough curve and a long tail similar u vi behavior has been reported by dittrich and reimus 2015 at ph 6 9 in crushed granodiorite who attributed the long tail to slow desorption processes in gw nearly all of the u vi is predicted to be complexed as either cauo2 co3 2 2 aq or as the ca2uo2 co3 3 aq ternary species fig 1 while the negatively charged former species would not be predicted to sorb to the chalk fracture surface the latter is neutral and is therefore not actively repelled from the chalk surface through charge exclusion it can be concluded therefore that uranyl complexed as the neutral ternary species comes into contact with the fracture surface and forms surface complexes with the caco3 within the rock itself this is the species that has been shown to dominate surface complexation in luminescence studies of u vi sorption to calcite elzinga et al 2004 and is therefore assumed here to be responsible for u vi retardation cerium is the only element that exhibited fractionated transport as both a colloidal and aqueous species despite the fact that bentonite colloids were not added to these experiments the ce appeared to be transported mostly as an intrinsic colloidal species fig 3 as can be seen by the large difference in the total and aqueous breakthrough curves furthermore the ce exhibited early arrival arrival at 0 32 spv defined here as c c0 0 02 in comparison to the re spv 0 77 early arrival has previously been attributed to colloid facilitated transport missana et al 2008 tang and weisbrod 2010 tran et al 2015 2016 as the zeta potential for ce carbonate precipitates has been shown to have a relatively low absolute value 10 2 mv tran et al 2015 charge exclusion is not responsible for this observed acceleration rather this is accounted for by size exclusion of the ce intrinsic colloids from diffusion into the pore space of the chalk matrix in gray chalk in the negev 99 of pore throat diameters are less than 0 4 μm bloomfield and nygaard 2003 much smaller than the ca 3 μm precipitate colloid particle diameters measured here therefore ce intrinsic colloids would not be expected to diffuse into the pore space of the chalk size exclusion has also been explored by zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 and weisbrod et al 2013 who found that the mobility of colloids of 1 2 μm diameter was higher than that of smaller particles in similar fractured rocks the recovery of each metal from the fracture in the absence of colloids plotted against its kd to crushed chalk obtained from batch experiments yields a high correlative linear relationship r2 0 99 fig 4 in this plot ce is not included as it is impossible to calculate a meaningful kd for ce under these carbonate rich conditions leading to its fast precipitation as previously discussed this relationship implies that for this particular system in the absence of clay colloids kd measurements from batch experiments can be used to predict the overall mobility of reactive tracers in single fractures wang et al 2009 compared kd obtained from batch experiments to kd obtained from fitted models of breakthrough curves of cs through crushed granite and showed that this assumption is valid given that high 0 25 solid to solution ratios are used in batch experiments 3 4 3 transport experiments with bentonite colloids two replicate experiments were conducted with clay colloids table 2 in both experiments the uranine and re migrated similarly to the experiments in which no colloids were added confirming both tracers conservative behavior in both bentonite colloid experiments al concentrations remained below the limit of quantification si section 4 throughout the experiment it was concluded that the clay colloid mixture was nearly immobile within the fracture due to the brackish water yielding unfavorable conditions for stability however it is possible to compare the behavior of each of the reactive tracers to experiments conducted in the absence of colloids to determine the effect of colloid presence on reactive transport the recovery of u vi did not change significantly with the addition of clay colloids to the injection solution nor did the maximum relative concentration reached during the experiment fig 5 little u iv sorption to the colloids was noted prior to injection table 2 the aqueous u vi breakthrough curve overlaps with that of the bulk u fig s4 indicating that u vi is mainly mobile as an aqueous species this is supported by comparing experiments with and without colloids fig 6 in which u vi exhibits nearly identical behavior this can be explained by the formation of ternary species that prevent the sorption of u vi to fracture surfaces and clay colloids allowing for its increased mobility this result is consistent with other studies conducted at moderate is for instance in the presence of the iron oxy hydroxide colloid akaganeite colloidal transport was negligible at is 4 2 10 3 m while u vi remained mobile ge et al 2018 in contrast the authors showed that at lower is 4 2 10 5 m where colloids are mobile colloidal presence inhibits u vi transport colloid presence did not influence the mobility of cs in the fractures in both replicate experiments in the injection solutions of experiments 5 and 6 less than 5 of the cs was initially sorbed to the colloids table 2 furthermore similar cs recoveries of 0 03 0 29 in the absence of clay colloids and 0 27 0 31 in the presence of clay colloids were observed table 3 the aqueous species breakthrough curve overlaps closely with the bulk concentration breakthrough curve fig s4 and that cs breakthrough curves exhibit similar behavior with and without colloids fig 6 these three facts together suggest that the addition of clay colloids did not lead to any change in cs mobility this is in contrast to tang and weisbrod 2010 who found that colloidal transport accounted for at least half of the observed recovery of cs in solution however the lower is employed in their study allowed for more stable and mobile colloids and greater cs sorption prior to injection probably accounting for the greater cs mobility to further investigate how the geochemical properties of each tracer affect transport the discharge was increased from 0 3 to 1 1 ml min at 12 5 spv for additional 3 spv during experiment 6 which is seen as dotted lines in figs 5 and 6 while this discharge increase had no observable effect on re and only a very slight effect on ce and u transport a more pronounced effect was observed for cs as nearly all of the cs was present in the fracture in aqueous form 99 table 2 this increase in mobility is not attributable to resuspension of colloid associated cs rather the increase in flow rate decreased the residence time allowed for cs to sorb to the fracture surface resulting in a spike in cs concentration in the outlet and demonstrating the effect of cs sorption kinetics further analysis and discussion is provided in the si section 5 the most discernable difference between experiments conducted in the absence and presence of clay colloids is that of ce mobility and recovery in experiments conducted with no clay colloids ce recoveries were 17 41 with early breakthroughs suggesting colloidal ce was precipitated and mobilized when the clay colloid suspension was added the recovery dropped to 0 8 1 4 in fig 5 ce is presented on a secondary y axis where it is apparent that there is no true breakthrough of ce at any point during the initial part of the experiment the relative concentration of ce becomes negligible upon the addition of bentonite colloids fig 6b a reasonable interpretation for the lack of ce mobility in the presence of bentonite colloids is the formation of large heteroaggregates of ce intrinsic colloids with clay colloids in the injection solution because the clay colloids are immobile under the brackish conditions their presence prevents the movement of the ce intrinsic colloids into and through the fracture reducing their overall recovery 3 5 effect of ionic strength on colloid facilitated transport it is interesting to note the differences between the behavior of ce in the current study and earlier work conducted in low is artificial rain water arw 2 2 mm in a comparable fractured chalk core of similar dimensions tran et al 2015 2016 at lower is ce mobility increased significantly by the addition of 500 mg l bentonite colloids where recovery increased from 7 12 to 14 27 upon the addition of the clay colloid suspension table 4 this increase was attributed to the formation of stable heterocolloids in which precipitated ce intrinsic colloids migrated together with stable bentonite colloids because similar clay colloids are unstable under the brackish conditions investigated in the current study 170 mm the addition of these colloids to the injection solution had the opposite effect decreasing ce recovery from 17 41 to 0 8 1 4 table 4 under low is colloid facilitated transport is well documented mccarthy 1998 missana et al 2008 ryan and elimelech 1996 while at high is colloid mobility decreases dramatically bennacer et al 2017 ge et al 2018 kelly et al 1999 mondal and sleep 2012 and therefore colloid facilitated transport is not anticipated to play a role similar cases in which high ionic strength have been shown to decrease mobility have previously been shown in the case of bacteriophage transport associated with kaolinite colloids walshe et al 2010 and u vi transport with akaganeite colloids ge et al 2018 in gw clay colloid suspensions are not stable but ce intrinsic colloids are still able to form associations with the clay colloid surfaces heteroaggregates of this sort have previously been described in tran et al 2016 and were shown to facilitate ce transport in low is arw however their formation in brackish water proves to be a barrier to ce transport and therefore other analogous carbonate solids may also be impacted by mineral colloidal presence under similar conditions 4 conclusions the current study shows that in arid environments where brackish groundwater resulting from dissolution and evaporation is common clay colloids would not be expected to facilitate radionuclide transport in certain cases such as that of ce the opposite could occur the presence of clay colloids may serve as a barrier to radionuclide transport our results showed that when bentonite colloids were absent the crushed chalk batch sorption coefficients kd of re u vi and cs correlated linearly with the recovery of each element from the chalk fracture under these circumstances kd values can be used in transport predictions in the absence of colloids the kd of ce could not be calculated due to its precipitation with hco3 which accounted for the majority of ce removal from solution in batch experiments at moderate is ca 170 mm the flocculation of clay colloids had little influence on cs and u vi migration through fractured chalk aquifers for cs this was the result of its high sorption to the chalk fracture wall and low initial sorption to the colloid surfaces cesium recovery was ultimately quite low 0 23 0 13 in all experiments regardless of clay colloid presence in the case of u vi the uranyl ion was stabilized in solution through the formation of the ca2uo2 co3 3 aq complex preventing its sorption to both colloid and fracture wall surfaces and leading to greater recoveries 23 67 than the other reactive metals bentonite colloid presence had a marked impact on precipitable carbonate solids formed by trivalent ce serving to inhibit its mobility through the fracture this was attributed to precipitate colloids forming associations with the clay colloids in the injection solution which are subsequently deposited onto the fracture surface preventing their further migration when bentonite colloids were added to the injection solution ce recovery strongly decreased from 17 41 to 0 8 1 4 this may have implications for the mobility of iii and iv actinides such as am and pu which may precipitate and or associate with mineral colloids under brackish

18613,one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a process has attracted more and more attention due to the low investment cost but the instability in treating low strength wastewater in this study for producing a novel composite carrier that could provide high ammonia microenvironment in low strength wastewater the zeolites and floating materials were combined in the spherical shell and distributed evenly by the spherical polyhedron and a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with the composite carriers and ordinary carriers without zeolites as control group was operated for nearly 120 days the pn a process were realized in 53 days and the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached around 85 at influent ammonium concentration of 50 mg l finally analysis of 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that the composite carriers showed significant promotion on the proliferation of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and enrichment of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob accounting for 19 14 and 41 65 on the surface respectively moreover the existence of relative higher abundance of ammonia on the composite carrier surface was validated by the metabolite biomarker of glutamate and especially spermidine the metabolomics analysis and 16s rrna function prediction showed that the protein synthesis pathway was obviously upregulated on the composite carriers surface compared with that on the ordinary carriers surface the higher abundance of glutamate and putrescine indicated that the composite carrier could stimulate the metabolism and growth of bacteria the present study provided a functional carrier to realize the transformation of activated sludge system into pn a system treating low strength wastewater which is significant to the application of the process in mainstream graphical abstract image 1 keywords low strength wastewater partial nitritation anammox novel composite carrier bacterial distribution metabolic discrepancies 1 introduction in recent years the partial nitritation anammox pn a process shifted gradually from two stage to one stage in treatment of high strength ammonium wastewaters due to the lower investment costs lackner et al 2014 meanwhile the inherent advantages of pn a technology encourage the exploration of its application in treatment of wastewater with low nitrogen concentrations such as mainstream wastewater li et al 2017 however it still remains challenging especially for sustaining partial nitritation pn which is essential for anmmox in municipal wastewater with low ammonia concentration 30 50 mg l xu et al 2015 in addition the extremely slow growth rate of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob limits its application hendrickx et al 2012 therefore the stable operation of pn and retention of anmmox bacteria inside the reactor are the main challenges for realizing the practical application of pn a in treatment of mainstream wastewater pn as the core for sustainable pn a system is the biggest challenge in the treatment of municipal wastewater because the inhibition of free ammonia on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is no longer effective in low strength wastewater xu et al 2015 thus create a relative high ammonia microenvironment for bacteria in the low ammonia condition would probably promote the metabolism of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and inhibit nob activity it is well known that natural zeolites are applied worldwide as the selective ionic exchangers capable of absorbing ammonium from wastewater fernández et al 2008 meanwhile the natural zeolites could also act as a slow nitrogen releaser when the ammonium concentration is low in cultivation medium markou et al 2014 moreover the high ammonia oxygen ratio could be maintained around the zeolites which could inhibit nob activity limiting the transformation of nitrite to nitrate miladinovic and weatherley 2008 successful pn a requires a balanced activity among the aob anaob and nob in this way create a carrier to provide relative high ammonia microenvironment for accumulation of aob against nob in low strength wastewater is significant coincidentally the characteristics of zeolites may play an important role in the balance among the three main autotrophic bacteria involved yet the zeolites were mainly used in the fixed bed filters due to the greater density that limits the application meanwhile the transformation of oxygen and substrate was also usually limited miladinovic and weatherley 2008 therefore the design and fabrication of a composite carrier combined with zeolites to be used in moving bed reactor is a practical strategy for producing the composite carrier we distributed the zeolites and floating foam at the right proportion and position in a spherical shell of polypropylene at last the composite carrier could suspend in reactor and maintain stable in vertical direction in this way the composite carriers with relative high ammonia microenvironment were manufactured in present study actually nutrients are abundant or scarce has a significant impact on bacterial metabolism and growth polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 previous study had revealed that high ammonium low oxygen conditions could be formed around zeolite which are favorable for aob growth miladinovic and weatherley 2008 thus the composite carriers with zeolites could probably promote the metabolism of aob and limit the activity of nob moreover based on the results of this study the metabolism of bacteria on the surface of composite carriers self made had distinct discrepancy compared with that on the surface of ordinary carriers as control group thus the novel composite carrier composed of zeolites and polypropylene were designed and fabricated to realize the stable operation of one stage pn a system treating low strength wastewater in this study a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with the composite carriers and ordinary carriers as control group was operated for about 120 days meanwhile 16s rrna transcript sequencing and metabolomics were utilized to investigate the responses of microbial community structure and bacteria metabolic activity on the different carrier surface this study provided a novel method for the practical application of pn a system in treating mainstream municipal wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 composite carrier design the composite carrier diameter 35 mm specific surface area 800 m2 m3 specific gravity 0 98 mainly consisted of four parts spherical shell spherical polyhedron zeolite particles particle size 4 6 mm specific gravity 1 95 and floating material specific gravity 0 10 spherical shell and spherical polyhedron fig 1 b were made of polypropylene that were widely used to manufacture microbial carriers in wastewater treatment gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 gu et al 2018 spherical shell is reticulate structure that could be favorable for the transformation of substrate and oxygen the zeolites and floating materials were distributed evenly in spherical polyhedron at the volume ratio of 1 1 so that the composite carriers could suspend in reactor and the density of upper hemisphere was greater than that of the lower hemisphere based on changing the quantity of zeolite particles and floating material thus the upper and lower surface of composite carriers could maintain stability which was beneficial to the stability of biofilm on the surface 2 2 startup and operation of the pn a reactor the sequencing batch reactor sbr fig 1a with 8 l volume was operated for nearly 120 days consisted of three phases based on controlling the parameters the detailed operational parameters were shown in table s1 phase i day 0 day 34 nitrite accumulation period the strategy of aerobic starvation do 3 5 mg l no substrate supply was used to enhance microbial attachment on the carrier surface and further promote the startup of nitritation process during day 8 day 16 phase ii day 35 day 53 anammox startup period the simultaneously reducing hydraulic residence time hrt and aeration rate were conducted to realize the startup of anammox process phase iii day 54 day 116 tn removal efficiency increase period regulating aeration rate was the main strategy in this phase the seed sludge was inoculated from the aerobic tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant with the initial mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 3000 mg l the a2 o process was applied in the wastewater treatment plant to remove nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater containing at 50 mg n l 236 mg l nh4 2so4 11 3 mg l kh2po4 126 mg l mgso4 7h2o 75 6 mg l cacl2 2h2o and trace element solution 25 μg l edta 5 μg l feso4 0 4 μg l znso4 7h2o 0 2 μg l cocl 6h2o 1 μg l

kept in the range of 7 8 without control the composite carriers filling ratio was 40 and ordinary carriers diameter 35 mm specific surface area 800 m2 m3 specific gravity 0 93 were added as control group each sbr cycle consisted of four steps 7 min feeding 4 l synthetic wastewater 113 223 min aeration and mixing 3 30 min settling and 7 min effluent discharge sludge was washed out from reactor through reducing the settling time from 30 min to 3 min it was worth noting that the operational conditions load variation and aeration rate of the reactor would not influence the bacteria attachment on both the composite carrier and ordinary carrier surface samples of influent and effluent were collected every day to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss according to standard methods apha 1995 at the end of reactor operation consortia samples were collected from the surface of composited carriers and ordinary carriers respectively in reactor these samples were used to determine extracellular polymeric substance eps contents mlvss nitrogen conversion rate bacterial community and metabolomics

products were extracted from the whole consortia according the procedure described in previous study walker et al 2014 guo et al 2018 feng et al 2018 10 ml sludge samples was centrifuged at special condition 4 c 6000 g for 3 min washed 3 times using pbs and quenched in liquid nitrogen immediately metabolite samples were resuspended in 1 5 ml ultrapure water 4 c and then immediately sonicated

using high performance liquid hromatography with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms all tests were conducted in triplicate untargeted metabolomic analysis was realized using q exactive orbitrap thermo ca 1 ml supernatant was loaded on a normal phase chromatography column and then the sample was eluted to an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acn containing 10 mm ammonium formate as the eluent the data in the mass range 70 1050 m z were acquired by data dependent msms acquisition the full scan and fragment spectra were collected at a resolution of 70 000 and 17 500 respectively the source parameters were as follows spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 320 c heater temperature 300 c sheath gas flow rate 35 and auxiliary gas flow rate 10 metabolite identification was based on a tracefinder search with a home built database containing 740 compounds the means and standard were calculated using microsoft excel 2016 for data analysis metabolic pathways was analyzed using the tool of metaboanalyst www metaboanalyst ca principal component analysis pca plot were generated by r studio analysis of variance anova was conducted using software spss 20 0 to analyze the differences between various samples the differences between samples with an adjusted p 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 performance of the pn a reactor the reactor was operated for nearly 120 days and was divided into three phases fig 2 phase i day 0 day 34 nitrite accumulation period phase ii day 35 day 53 anammox startup period phase iii day 54 day 116 tn removal efficiency increase period the dissolved oxygen do concentration corresponding to different aeration rate of each phase and detailed operational parameters were shown in table s1 in phase i the ammonia oxidizing efficiency aoe reached 100 and almost all nh4 n was oxidized to no3 n which showed that the nitrification activity of system recovered completely in 7 days as observed the aoe was stabilized at 100 during the first 5 days but the nar was below 5 the aoe was below 40 during day 17 day 26 when do concentration was below 0 2 mg l but the nar increased gradually to 90 after aerobic starvation in day 8 day 16 then the aoe increased to 50 60 gradually by increasing the do concentration to 0 5 mg l in the next 8 days the nar maintained at above 85 and the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio was around 1 0 in phase ii the strategy of simultaneous reducing do concentration to below 0 2 mg l and hrt to 4 h from 8 h was taken to maintain the partial nitrite process and start the anammox process by providing high ammonia and low do condition as shown in fig 2 the aoe and tn removal efficiency increased to 50 and 40 respectively meanwhile the nar reduced to zero gradually although the operation parameters remained unchanged the nitrogen conversion rate increased from below 25 g n m3 d to above 125 g n m3 d fig s1 it was worth noting that effluent no2 n concentration maintained at 0 mg l but no3 n concentration slightly increased at the end of phase ii and no carbon source supplied during the whole operation process so it could be revealed that the tn was mainly removed by the anammox process instead of denitrification in phase iii the do concentration was increased from 0 5 mg l to 1 8 mg l gradually in the first 30 days as a result the aoe and tn removal efficiency increased to above 90 and 80 respectively meanwhile the nitrogen conversion rate increased to above 250 g n m3 d as shown in fig s1 due to the surplus no2 n concentration of 2 0 mg l and the generated no3 n concentration of 4 6 mg l the nar maintained at around 40 it was well known that higher do concentration would result in the higher aoe however when the do concentration was increased to around 2 0 mg l on day 85 day 100 the aoe reduced from above 95 to below 85 the results showed that higher do probably affected anammox process resulted in the ammonia removal rate arr based on anammox process reducing and the tn removal efficiency reducing further thus the strategy of simultaneous reduce do and increase hrt was taken during day 102 day 116 after the do concentration was reduced from around 2 0 mg l to 1 0 mg l hrt was increased from 4 to 8 h the effluent no3 n concentration increased to above 10 mg l sharply then the do concentration was reduced to below 0 5 mg l further arr and tn removal efficiency stabilized at above 90 and 80 respectively and nitrogen conversion rate maintained at around 130 g n m3 d due to the increase of hrt finally the no3 n concentrations in phase ii and the first 10 days in phase iii were higher than the values resulting from the stoichiometry of the anammox process this result showed that some of the no3 n was produced by the full nitrification process however it was worth noting that the no3 n concentration fluctuated slightly as the arr and tn removal efficiency increased in phase iii which presented that the increase of anammox performance resulted in the reducing of full nitrification process in this system after day 80 the ratio of nitrate generation ammonia removal in the system was much close to the theoretical value of 0 26 which revealed that there was very little full nitrification process in the system at last the high performance operation of pn a process treating low wastewater were realized in less than 120 days inoculating activated sludge as the seed sludge in the reactor in present study the mbbr with ordinary carriers sample 1 as control group and composite carriers sample 2 was operated for nearly120 days to explore the efficiency of composite carrier on pn a system at the end of operation ordinary carriers and composite carriers were carried out from the reactor respectively the eps mlvss nitrogen conversion rate bacterial community structure functional bacterium distribution and microbial metabolites were analyzed to investigate the key role of composite carriers on pn a system treating low strength wastewater 3 2 performance of different carriers eps pn ps ratio mlss mlvss ratio of mlvss mlss and nitrogen conversion rate of ordinary carrier 1 and composite carrier 2 were determined and calculated at the end of the reactor operation as shown in fig 3 the pn contents of 1 and 2 were 258 05 4 90 mg g total protein and 316 56 6 6 mg g total protein respectively the results showed that the pn contents in 2 sample was obviously higher than that in 1 sample p 0 01 by two tail t test however the ps contents of 1 and 2 were 27 35 1 78 mg g total protein and 26 91 2 10 mg g total protein respectively which were not remarkable variation therefore as the tendency as the pn contents the 2 ratio of pn ps was beyond the ratio of 1 significantly p 0 01 by two tail t test the mlss and mlvss of 2 were also obviously higher than those of 1 as shown in fig 3c p 0 01 by two tail t test the details of batch assay were presented in text s1 of supporting information and the results showed that compared with 1 sample the nitrogen conversion rate of 2 was significantly higher p 0 01 by two tail t test 3 3 active community structure on different carriers surface in order to investigate the community discrepancy on the surface of ordinary carrier and composite carrier 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted the sequencing depth of 39042 and 65666 reads were achieved on 1 sample and 2 sample respectively rarefaction curves fig s2 indicated that the sampling of bacterial richness was complete and all samples were compared at an equivalent sequencing depth and the entire coverage index of 0 99 0 999489 of 1 sample and 0 999951 of 2 sample suggested that the coverage degree of the miseq sequencing was high as shown in fig 4 a proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the two dominant bacterial phyla accounting for about 40 in both samples respectively however the third dominant phyla were bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in 1 and 2 samples respectively fig 4b presented the genus level abundance of the two samples nitrosomonas and candidatus jettenia were the two dominant genus accounting for 16 06 and 39 17 in 1 and 19 14 and 41 65 in 2 respectively and they are mainly belong to aob and anaob in pn a system gilbert et al 2014 obviously both the two genus were higher in 2 sample than in 1 sample which showed the composite carriers could promote the growth and accumulation of aob and anaob moreover the abundance discrepancy of saprospiraceae genus 6 17 in 1 and 1 57 in 2 belongs to bacteroidetes phylum and anaerolineaceae genus 1 03 in 1 and 3 95 in 2 belongs to chloroflexi phylum probably caused the difference in the third dominant phylum of the two samples 3 4 metabolic profile of bacteria consortia on different carriers surface to reveal the role of composite carriers on the bacterial metabolic activities a metabolic profiling technique has been adopted approximately 320 mass gc ms spectral peaks were detected in each samples in which more than 200 metabolites changed significantly due to the different carriers assessed by the method of one way anova fig 5 a and metabolite based class separation was clearly presented in the pca score plot fig 5b the results showed that obvious variation of metabolic pools was observed in each sample in response to the different carriers moreover the marked alterations of metabolic pools in the two samples were also exhibited in the volcano plot p 0 05 fold change 1 5 fig 5c meanwhile metabolic pathway activities were calculated based on the data using metaboanalyst online programming xia and wishart 2016 the results were shown in fig 5d three pathways were influenced significantly due to the discrimination of the two sets of samples pathway impact 0 6 and log p value 5 obviously all the three pathways of d alanine metabolism beta alanine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism were closed to amino acid metabolism thus the pathway details of amino acids biosynthesis were analyzed by using the kyoto encycolopedia of gene and genomes kegg databases in this study alanine ala glycine gly serine ser aspartate aspte asparagine aspne glutamine glune threonine thr proline pro valine val arginine arg leucine leu lysine lys isoleucine iso methionine met histidine his tyrosine tyr phenylalanine phe and tryptophan trp 18 species of amino acids were detected table 1 all these amino acids were lower significantly in 2 sample compared with those in 1 sample table 1 and fig s3 p 0 01 except gly and glune p 0 05 by two tail t test the discrepancies amino acids between the two samples indicated that composite carrier could probably promote more amino acids being synthesized into proteins which was consistent with the higher pn content in 2 sample fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 composite carrier facilitated the aob and anaob enrichment the main challenge of pn a mainstream application relate to low nitrogen in the influent and long term process stability was to overcome the proliferation of nob gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 kouba et al 2017 at the low nitrogen condition nob can grow faster than aob and the inhibition by free ammonia is ineffective hellinga et al 1998 kouba et al 2014 actually the overproliferation of nob was the main bottleneck in the pn a reactor mbbr treating low strength wastewater even at the warm temperature 25 30 c because biofilms can sustain microorganisms with very different growth kinetics due to the undefined srt and their distinct substrate gradients lackner et al 2014 thus a novel carrier could facilitate aob and anaob enrichment but limit the nob growth is significant and necessary in this condition to illustrate the above mentioned function of the composite carriers in this study we contrasted the secretions and metabolites related bacterial aggregation and bacteria community related nitrogen removal process between ordinary carriers 1 as control group and composite carriers 2 the eps matrix plays a core role in determining the bacterial aggregation capacity hou et al 2015 the electronegative and hydrophobicity of pn could promote and stabilize the aggregate structure and biofilm formation laspidou and rittmann 2002 jia et al 2017 moreover the sludge hydrophobicity and bio flocculation are positively correlated to the pn ps ratio liao et al 2001 zhang et al 2015 in this study the pn content and pn ps ratio in 2 sample were obviously higher than those in 1 sample fig 3 which showed that the sludge on the composite carriers surface had a relatively high aggregation and biofilm formation capacity hydrophobic phospholipids could also affect the bacterial aggregation capacity flemming and wingender 2010 phosphoethanolamine pe and phosphocholine pc are the major components of phospholipids in most bacterial membranes sohlenkamp and geiger 2016 moreover pc and pe can biosynthesized the dominant compositions of phospholipids phosphatidylcholine ptc and phosphatidylethanolamine pte respectively gibellini and smith 2010 thus the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway was analyzed through kegg database as shown in fig s4 up regulated pc in 1 sample presented the more active metabolism and catabolism pathway of pc the pc become the dominant head group of ammoxosome membrane contributed the lower pn content zhao et al 2018 most importantly the active metabolism of pte could increase the aggregation zhao et al 2018 and the up regulated pe in 2 sample showed the more active pte metabolism it probably presented that the bacteria on composite carriers surface had higher aggregation capacity however the most important thing was if the more target functional bacteria aob and anaob aggregated on the composite carriers surface thus 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis was applied to reveal the relative abundance of bacteria community on different carriers surface the target functional bacteria aob nitrosomonas and anaob candidatus jettenia were dominant in the pn a system table s2 importantly the abundance of aob and anaob were higher on composite carrier surface than those on ordinary carrier surface but nob was very few the functional bacteria were most likely to attach to the surface of composite carriers but nob was easy to washout from the reactor the composite carriers accounted for a filling ratio of 40 and there were only a few ordinary carriers as the contrast group in the reactor moreover the mlvss on the surface of composite carrier was obviously higher than that on the surface of ordinary carrier fig 3c and compared with the ordinary carrier the nitrogen conversion rate of composite carrier was also significantly higher fig 3d so the higher abundance of functional bacteria aob and anaob in the reactor was mainly facilitated by the composite carriers and nob was limited additionally the seed sludge was inoculated from the aerobic tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant a2 o process so it was activated sludge system in the initial period however the functional bacteria aob and anaob were dominated in the system accounting for 55 60 finally in the other word the transformation of activated sludge system to pn a system treating low strength wastewater was realized by adding the composite carrier 4 2 composite carrier increased bacterium metabolic activity metabolomics technology has applied as an important method to analyze functional status and variation of microbial metabolite patterns which could reflect the activity of different metabolic pathway marcobal et al 2013 as mentioned in 3 3 the abundance of functional bacteria aob and anaob were obviously higher on composite carrier surface than those on ordinary carriers surface in order to investigate the key role of composite carriers on the functional bacteria sludge samples on the surface of composite carriers and ordinary carriers as control group were taken to detect metabolomics respectively the pathways concerned with amino acid metabolism such as alanine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism presented significant effect for the discrimination of the two sets of samples the details of these pathways were shown in fig 6 a in which the synthetic pathway of glutamate and putrescine was obviously up regulated in conditions of high external ammonia concentrations glutamate is the direct ammonia product via glutamate dehydrogenase which subsequently serve as a primary precursor in multiple biosynthesis pathways nagatani et al 1971 karrer and warren 1974 and it is usually synthesized more in actively growing cells lu et al 2016b moreover putrescine plays a key role in cell division and is a widely distributed cellular polyamine whose biosynthesis often increases when conditions favor a higher growth rate tabor and tabor 1985 tkachenko et al 2001 schneider et al 2013 the abundance of glutamate and putrescine in 2 samples was significantly higher than those in 1 samples as shown in fig 6a and table s3 which showed that the composite carriers could facilitate the growth rate and activity of bacteria as mentioned in 3 2 pn contents in 2 sample were obviously higher than that in 1 sample which revealed that composite carriers could promote the synthesis of extracellular proteins to further investigate the influence mechanism of composite carriers on the protein synthesis the biosynthesis pathway of amino acids was explored in this study the lower abundance of 18 essential amino acids in 2 sample compared with those in 1 sample fig s3 presented that a higher amino acids consumption occurred in 2 sample it indirectly revealed that more amino acids attributed to the synthesis of protein which could be presented in the pathway of amino acids biosynthesis fig 6b recently 16s function prediction has been used to investigate microbial metabolic in many field lu et al 2016a wong et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 tang et al 2018 the information obtained by cog and kegg function prediction by i sanger was shown in fig s6 it was known that rna processing and modification amino acid transport and metabolism nucleotide transport and metabolism purine metabolism pyrimidine metabolism aminoacyl trna biosynthesis were the function pathways concerned with protein synthesis compared with 1 sample these function pathways were upregulated obviously in 2 sample which also indicated that the composite carriers could promote the activity of protein synthesis 4 3 mechanism of composite carrier on promoting the stability of mainstream pn a one of the challenges of the implementation of mainstream pn a process is the overcome proliferation of nob due to the inefficient limitation of free ammonia in low nitrogen concentrations condition hellinga et al 1998 kouba et al 2014 moreover the decrease of net biomass production due to the low nitrogen concentrations of the influent also negatively affect the application of pn a system laureni et al 2015 morales et al 2015 therefore the method to provide a relative high ammonia microenvironment in low nitrogen concentrations and maintain high biomass concentrations would be useful for the practical application of the process in fact biofilm based on carriers has been proved to maintain the stable operation of pn a process in one stage system gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 however the carriers used to start reactors were all inoculated with already established biofilm originating from reactor treating high nitrogen concentrations wastewater in the investigations mentioned above the startup of mainstream pn a process inoculated active sludge treating low strength wastewater was few reported importantly the composite carriers could provide relatively high ammonia microenvironment in low strength wastewater still no proposed by adding composite carrier the startup and stable operation of pn a process treating low strength wastewater was realized in sbr in this study in fact sbr applied in many researches and the operational conditions of the reactor in this study would not influence the bacteria attachment on both the composite carrier and ordinary carrier surface thus the composite carrier played the key role in the pn a system the biofilm structure bacterium distribution and related bacterial metabolic pathways on the composite carrier surface were investigated to further explain the mechanism of composite carrier on promoting the stability of mainstream pn a system natural zeolite is one ion exchanger with a high affinity for ammonium ion due to its high porosity and large specific surface area semmens et al 1981 athanasiadis and helmreich 2005 in fact zeolite was not only used as sorption medium of ammonium but also was suggested to be used as ammonium releaser when the ammonium concentrations in conditions was low fachini and vasconcelos 2006 markou et al 2014 to resolve the instability of pn resulting from the low ammonium concentration of mainstream wastewater the composite carriers consisted with zeolites and polypropylene were designed and fabricated in present study when the ammonium concentration was high in water during the feeding process ammonium ions would be adsorbed by zeolite when the ammonium concentration in water was low due to the utilization of aob the ammonium ions would be desorbed by zeolite meanwhile the aob next to zeolite would utilize the ammonium as substrate during this process the high ammonium and low oxygen condition around the zeolites could inhibit nob activity further limiting the transformation of nitrite to nitrate miladinovic and weatherley 2008 in this way the startup and stability of pn and the efficient interception of anaob in low strength wastewater were realized the composite carriers surface were sampled at the end of the reactor operation to observed the structure and morphology of the biofilm using sem as shown in fig s7 the shape of the bacterium on the outer was mainly straight rods and inlayer was mainly cauliflower previous study has revealed that the shape of nitrosomonas belong to aob is straight rods ge et al 2015 and it was known that the cauliflower appearance was testified to be the characteristics of anaob enrichment trigo et al 2006 wang et al 2011 lin and wang 2017 moreover aob and anaob were the dominant bacterium on the composite carriers surface and nitrosomonas was the dominant genu of aob thus aob and anaob distributed the outer and inner respectively on the surface of composite carriers were confirmed by the results above the bottom feed was used for the influent so the ammonia concentration was higher surrounding the carriers at the beginning of each cycle the relative high ammonia microenvironment could be formed on the surface of composite carriers the ammonia oxidized process based on aob could formed anoxic even anaerobic microenvironment simultaneously moreover the nitrite produced by aob was utilized easily by anaob due to the favorable position the existence of microenvironment was conducive for the attachment of anaob on the composite carrier surface the low aerobic condition on composite carriers surface and the low nitrite concentration in wastewater could inhibit the activity of attached and suspended nob respectively the nob with poor activity would be washout with the effluent meanwhile the functional bacteria aob and anaob were maintained on the carrier surface in this way the stability of the bacterial composition in the system could be realized therefore the startup and stability of pn and the interception of anaob in low strength wastewater were realized by using the composite carriers in this study as mentioned above the microenvironment of higher ammonia on the surface was the key role of the composite carriers so the ammonia substrate abundance on the surface of ordinary carriers as control group and composite carriers were contrasted in the following parts for instance in wastewater treatment process through detecting the metabolomics of bacterial consortium involved and then the metabolites sensitive to operational conditions could be identified as potential biomarkers lu et al 2016b in order to investigate the positive role of composite carriers in pn a process treating low strength wastewater metabolites were analyzed at the end of the reactor operation instead of the ammonium concentration in microenvironment due to the difficult monitoring in situ previous research has revealed that under high external ammonia concentrations conditions glutamate is the direct ammonia assimilation product via glutamate dehydrogenase nagatani et al 1971 compared with 1 sample the abundance of glutamate was upregulated obviously in 2 sample table s3 which showed that ammonium concentrations in the microenvironment of composite carrier surface was relatively higher moreover spermidine as a metabolite biomarker could be used to indicate the ammonia is sufficient or not which was upregulated when the ammonia concentration is high lu et al 2016b it was worth noting that compared with 1 sample the spermidine of 2 sample was upregulated more than 10 times which presented that the ammonia substrate abundance surrounding the composite carrier surface was obviously higher than that surrounding ordinary carriers as control group surface thus the composite carriers designed and applied in this study could indeed realize the startup and stable operation of mainstream pn a process treating low strength wastewater by improving the ammonia substrate abundance in the microenvironment of carrier surface 5 conclusions the startup and stable operation of a mbbr with the self designed composite carriers were realized in pn a process treating low strength wastewater the zeolites and floating materials were distributed evenly in the spherical shell through embedding a spherical polyhedron to produce the composite carriers compared with ordinary carriers without zeolites as control group the surface of composite carriers had higher abundance of aob and anaob the higher ammonia microenvironment on the surface of the composite carriers was validated in situ by the biomarker of glutamate and especially spermidine composite carriers enhanced the aggregation capacity of bacteria by increasing the proteins secretion and the activity of glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway pathways analysis of alanine metabolism arginine and proline metabolism revealed that the composite carriers could promote the growth rate and activity of bacteria moreover the bacteria on the composite carrier surface having higher activity of proteins synthesis was proved by the results of both metabolic pathway analysis of amino acids and 16s rrna function prediction the composite carriers provided a useful strategy to start and operate the mainstream pn a process in practical application acknowledgements the authors

18613,one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a process has attracted more and more attention due to the low investment cost but the instability in treating low strength wastewater in this study for producing a novel composite carrier that could provide high ammonia microenvironment in low strength wastewater the zeolites and floating materials were combined in the spherical shell and distributed evenly by the spherical polyhedron and a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with the composite carriers and ordinary carriers without zeolites as control group was operated for nearly 120 days the pn a process were realized in 53 days and the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached around 85 at influent ammonium concentration of 50 mg l finally analysis of 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that the composite carriers showed significant promotion on the proliferation of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and enrichment of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob accounting for 19 14 and 41 65 on the surface respectively moreover the existence of relative higher abundance of ammonia on the composite carrier surface was validated by the metabolite biomarker of glutamate and especially spermidine the metabolomics analysis and 16s rrna function prediction showed that the protein synthesis pathway was obviously upregulated on the composite carriers surface compared with that on the ordinary carriers surface the higher abundance of glutamate and putrescine indicated that the composite carrier could stimulate the metabolism and growth of bacteria the present study provided a functional carrier to realize the transformation of activated sludge system into pn a system treating low strength wastewater which is significant to the application of the process in mainstream graphical abstract image 1 keywords low strength wastewater partial nitritation anammox novel composite carrier bacterial distribution metabolic discrepancies 1 introduction in recent years the partial nitritation anammox pn a process shifted gradually from two stage to one stage in treatment of high strength ammonium wastewaters due to the lower investment costs lackner et al 2014 meanwhile the inherent advantages of pn a technology encourage the exploration of its application in treatment of wastewater with low nitrogen concentrations such as mainstream wastewater li et al 2017 however it still remains challenging especially for sustaining partial nitritation pn which is essential for anmmox in municipal wastewater with low ammonia concentration 30 50 mg l xu et al 2015 in addition the extremely slow growth rate of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob limits its application hendrickx et al 2012 therefore the stable operation of pn and retention of anmmox bacteria inside the reactor are the main challenges for realizing the practical application of pn a in treatment of mainstream wastewater pn as the core for sustainable pn a system is the biggest challenge in the treatment of municipal wastewater because the inhibition of free ammonia on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is no longer effective in low strength wastewater xu et al 2015 thus create a relative high ammonia microenvironment for bacteria in the low ammonia condition would probably promote the metabolism of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and inhibit nob activity it is well known that natural zeolites are applied worldwide as the selective ionic exchangers capable of absorbing ammonium from wastewater fernández et al 2008 meanwhile the natural zeolites could also act as a slow nitrogen releaser when the ammonium concentration is low in cultivation medium markou et al 2014 moreover the high ammonia oxygen ratio could be maintained around the zeolites which could inhibit nob activity limiting the transformation of nitrite to nitrate miladinovic and weatherley 2008 successful pn a requires a balanced activity among the aob anaob and nob in this way create a carrier to provide relative high ammonia microenvironment for accumulation of aob against nob in low strength wastewater is significant coincidentally the characteristics of zeolites may play an important role in the balance among the three main autotrophic bacteria involved yet the zeolites were mainly used in the fixed bed filters due to the greater density that limits the application meanwhile the transformation of oxygen and substrate was also usually limited miladinovic and weatherley 2008 therefore the design and fabrication of a composite carrier combined with zeolites to be used in moving bed reactor is a practical strategy for producing the composite carrier we distributed the zeolites and floating foam at the right proportion and position in a spherical shell of polypropylene at last the composite carrier could suspend in reactor and maintain stable in vertical direction in this way the composite carriers with relative high ammonia microenvironment were manufactured in present study actually nutrients are abundant or scarce has a significant impact on bacterial metabolism and growth polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 previous study had revealed that high ammonium low oxygen conditions could be formed around zeolite which are favorable for aob growth miladinovic and weatherley 2008 thus the composite carriers with zeolites could probably promote the metabolism of aob and limit the activity of nob moreover based on the results of this study the metabolism of bacteria on the surface of composite carriers self made had distinct discrepancy compared with that on the surface of ordinary carriers as control group thus the novel composite carrier composed of zeolites and polypropylene were designed and fabricated to realize the stable operation of one stage pn a system treating low strength wastewater in this study a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with the composite carriers and ordinary carriers as control group was operated for about 120 days meanwhile 16s rrna transcript sequencing and metabolomics were utilized to investigate the responses of microbial community structure and bacteria metabolic activity on the different carrier surface this study provided a novel method for the practical application of pn a system in treating mainstream municipal wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 composite carrier design the composite carrier diameter 35 mm specific surface area 800 m2 m3 specific gravity 0 98 mainly consisted of four parts spherical shell spherical polyhedron zeolite particles particle size 4 6 mm specific gravity 1 95 and floating material specific gravity 0 10 spherical shell and spherical polyhedron fig 1 b were made of polypropylene that were widely used to manufacture microbial carriers in wastewater treatment gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 gu et al 2018 spherical shell is reticulate structure that could be favorable for the transformation of substrate and oxygen the zeolites and floating materials were distributed evenly in spherical polyhedron at the volume ratio of 1 1 so that the composite carriers could suspend in reactor and the density of upper hemisphere was greater than that of the lower hemisphere based on changing the quantity of zeolite particles and floating material thus the upper and lower surface of composite carriers could maintain stability which was beneficial to the stability of biofilm on the surface 2 2 startup and operation of the pn a reactor the sequencing batch reactor sbr fig 1a with 8 l volume was operated for nearly 120 days consisted of three phases based on controlling the parameters the detailed operational parameters were shown in table s1 phase i day 0 day 34 nitrite accumulation period the strategy of aerobic starvation do 3 5 mg l no substrate supply was used to enhance microbial attachment on the carrier surface and further promote the startup of nitritation process during day 8 day 16 phase ii day 35 day 53 anammox startup period the simultaneously reducing hydraulic residence time hrt and aeration rate were conducted to realize the startup of anammox process phase iii day 54 day 116 tn removal efficiency increase period regulating aeration rate was the main strategy in this phase the seed sludge was inoculated from the aerobic tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant with the initial mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 3000 mg l the a2 o process was applied in the wastewater treatment plant to remove nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater containing at 50 mg n l 236 mg l nh4 2so4 11 3 mg l kh2po4 126 mg l mgso4 7h2o 75 6 mg l cacl2 2h2o and trace element solution 25 μg l edta 5 μg l feso4 0 4 μg l znso4 7h2o 0 2 μg l cocl 6h2o 1 μg l

kept in the range of 7 8 without control the composite carriers filling ratio was 40 and ordinary carriers diameter 35 mm specific surface area 800 m2 m3 specific gravity 0 93 were added as control group each sbr cycle consisted of four steps 7 min feeding 4 l synthetic wastewater 113 223 min aeration and mixing 3 30 min settling and 7 min effluent discharge sludge was washed out from reactor through reducing the settling time from 30 min to 3 min it was worth noting that the operational conditions load variation and aeration rate of the reactor would not influence the bacteria attachment on both the composite carrier and ordinary carrier surface samples of influent and effluent were collected every day to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss according to standard methods apha 1995 at the end of reactor operation consortia samples were collected from the surface of composited carriers and ordinary carriers respectively in reactor these samples were used to determine extracellular polymeric substance eps contents mlvss nitrogen conversion rate bacterial community and metabolomics

products were extracted from the whole consortia according the procedure described in previous study walker et al 2014 guo et al 2018 feng et al 2018 10 ml sludge samples was centrifuged at special condition 4 c 6000 g for 3 min washed 3 times using pbs and quenched in liquid nitrogen immediately metabolite samples were resuspended in 1 5 ml ultrapure water 4 c and then immediately sonicated

using high performance liquid hromatography with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms all tests were conducted in triplicate untargeted metabolomic analysis was realized using q exactive orbitrap thermo ca 1 ml supernatant was loaded on a normal phase chromatography column and then the sample was eluted to an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acn containing 10 mm ammonium formate as the eluent the data in the mass range 70 1050 m z were acquired by data dependent msms acquisition the full scan and fragment spectra were collected at a resolution of 70 000 and 17 500 respectively the source parameters were as follows spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 320 c heater temperature 300 c sheath gas flow rate 35 and auxiliary gas flow rate 10 metabolite identification was based on a tracefinder search with a home built database containing 740 compounds the means and standard were calculated using microsoft excel 2016 for data analysis metabolic pathways was analyzed using the tool of metaboanalyst www metaboanalyst ca principal component analysis pca plot were generated by r studio analysis of variance anova was conducted using software spss 20 0 to analyze the differences between various samples the differences between samples with an adjusted p 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 performance of the pn a reactor the reactor was operated for nearly 120 days and was divided into three phases fig 2 phase i day 0 day 34 nitrite accumulation period phase ii day 35 day 53 anammox startup period phase iii day 54 day 116 tn removal efficiency increase period the dissolved oxygen do concentration corresponding to different aeration rate of each phase and detailed operational parameters were shown in table s1 in phase i the ammonia oxidizing efficiency aoe reached 100 and almost all nh4 n was oxidized to no3 n which showed that the nitrification activity of system recovered completely in 7 days as observed the aoe was stabilized at 100 during the first 5 days but the nar was below 5 the aoe was below 40 during day 17 day 26 when do concentration was below 0 2 mg l but the nar increased gradually to 90 after aerobic starvation in day 8 day 16 then the aoe increased to 50 60 gradually by increasing the do concentration to 0 5 mg l in the next 8 days the nar maintained at above 85 and the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio was around 1 0 in phase ii the strategy of simultaneous reducing do concentration to below 0 2 mg l and hrt to 4 h from 8 h was taken to maintain the partial nitrite process and start the anammox process by providing high ammonia and low do condition as shown in fig 2 the aoe and tn removal efficiency increased to 50 and 40 respectively meanwhile the nar reduced to zero gradually although the operation parameters remained unchanged the nitrogen conversion rate increased from below 25 g n m3 d to above 125 g n m3 d fig s1 it was worth noting that effluent no2 n concentration maintained at 0 mg l but no3 n concentration slightly increased at the end of phase ii and no carbon source supplied during the whole operation process so it could be revealed that the tn was mainly removed by the anammox process instead of denitrification in phase iii the do concentration was increased from 0 5 mg l to 1 8 mg l gradually in the first 30 days as a result the aoe and tn removal efficiency increased to above 90 and 80 respectively meanwhile the nitrogen conversion rate increased to above 250 g n m3 d as shown in fig s1 due to the surplus no2 n concentration of 2 0 mg l and the generated no3 n concentration of 4 6 mg l the nar maintained at around 40 it was well known that higher do concentration would result in the higher aoe however when the do concentration was increased to around 2 0 mg l on day 85 day 100 the aoe reduced from above 95 to below 85 the results showed that higher do probably affected anammox process resulted in the ammonia removal rate arr based on anammox process reducing and the tn removal efficiency reducing further thus the strategy of simultaneous reduce do and increase hrt was taken during day 102 day 116 after the do concentration was reduced from around 2 0 mg l to 1 0 mg l hrt was increased from 4 to 8 h the effluent no3 n concentration increased to above 10 mg l sharply then the do concentration was reduced to below 0 5 mg l further arr and tn removal efficiency stabilized at above 90 and 80 respectively and nitrogen conversion rate maintained at around 130 g n m3 d due to the increase of hrt finally the no3 n concentrations in phase ii and the first 10 days in phase iii were higher than the values resulting from the stoichiometry of the anammox process this result showed that some of the no3 n was produced by the full nitrification process however it was worth noting that the no3 n concentration fluctuated slightly as the arr and tn removal efficiency increased in phase iii which presented that the increase of anammox performance resulted in the reducing of full nitrification process in this system after day 80 the ratio of nitrate generation ammonia removal in the system was much close to the theoretical value of 0 26 which revealed that there was very little full nitrification process in the system at last the high performance operation of pn a process treating low wastewater were realized in less than 120 days inoculating activated sludge as the seed sludge in the reactor in present study the mbbr with ordinary carriers sample 1 as control group and composite carriers sample 2 was operated for nearly120 days to explore the efficiency of composite carrier on pn a system at the end of operation ordinary carriers and composite carriers were carried out from the reactor respectively the eps mlvss nitrogen conversion rate bacterial community structure functional bacterium distribution and microbial metabolites were analyzed to investigate the key role of composite carriers on pn a system treating low strength wastewater 3 2 performance of different carriers eps pn ps ratio mlss mlvss ratio of mlvss mlss and nitrogen conversion rate of ordinary carrier 1 and composite carrier 2 were determined and calculated at the end of the reactor operation as shown in fig 3 the pn contents of 1 and 2 were 258 05 4 90 mg g total protein and 316 56 6 6 mg g total protein respectively the results showed that the pn contents in 2 sample was obviously higher than that in 1 sample p 0 01 by two tail t test however the ps contents of 1 and 2 were 27 35 1 78 mg g total protein and 26 91 2 10 mg g total protein respectively which were not remarkable variation therefore as the tendency as the pn contents the 2 ratio of pn ps was beyond the ratio of 1 significantly p 0 01 by two tail t test the mlss and mlvss of 2 were also obviously higher than those of 1 as shown in fig 3c p 0 01 by two tail t test the details of batch assay were presented in text s1 of supporting information and the results showed that compared with 1 sample the nitrogen conversion rate of 2 was significantly higher p 0 01 by two tail t test 3 3 active community structure on different carriers surface in order to investigate the community discrepancy on the surface of ordinary carrier and composite carrier 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted the sequencing depth of 39042 and 65666 reads were achieved on 1 sample and 2 sample respectively rarefaction curves fig s2 indicated that the sampling of bacterial richness was complete and all samples were compared at an equivalent sequencing depth and the entire coverage index of 0 99 0 999489 of 1 sample and 0 999951 of 2 sample suggested that the coverage degree of the miseq sequencing was high as shown in fig 4 a proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the two dominant bacterial phyla accounting for about 40 in both samples respectively however the third dominant phyla were bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in 1 and 2 samples respectively fig 4b presented the genus level abundance of the two samples nitrosomonas and candidatus jettenia were the two dominant genus accounting for 16 06 and 39 17 in 1 and 19 14 and 41 65 in 2 respectively and they are mainly belong to aob and anaob in pn a system gilbert et al 2014 obviously both the two genus were higher in 2 sample than in 1 sample which showed the composite carriers could promote the growth and accumulation of aob and anaob moreover the abundance discrepancy of saprospiraceae genus 6 17 in 1 and 1 57 in 2 belongs to bacteroidetes phylum and anaerolineaceae genus 1 03 in 1 and 3 95 in 2 belongs to chloroflexi phylum probably caused the difference in the third dominant phylum of the two samples 3 4 metabolic profile of bacteria consortia on different carriers surface to reveal the role of composite carriers on the bacterial metabolic activities a metabolic profiling technique has been adopted approximately 320 mass gc ms spectral peaks were detected in each samples in which more than 200 metabolites changed significantly due to the different carriers assessed by the method of one way anova fig 5 a and metabolite based class separation was clearly presented in the pca score plot fig 5b the results showed that obvious variation of metabolic pools was observed in each sample in response to the different carriers moreover the marked alterations of metabolic pools in the two samples were also exhibited in the volcano plot p 0 05 fold change 1 5 fig 5c meanwhile metabolic pathway activities were calculated based on the data using metaboanalyst online programming xia and wishart 2016 the results were shown in fig 5d three pathways were influenced significantly due to the discrimination of the two sets of samples pathway impact 0 6 and log p value 5 obviously all the three pathways of d alanine metabolism beta alanine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism were closed to amino acid metabolism thus the pathway details of amino acids biosynthesis were analyzed by using the kyoto encycolopedia of gene and genomes kegg databases in this study alanine ala glycine gly serine ser aspartate aspte asparagine aspne glutamine glune threonine thr proline pro valine val arginine arg leucine leu lysine lys isoleucine iso methionine met histidine his tyrosine tyr phenylalanine phe and tryptophan trp 18 species of amino acids were detected table 1 all these amino acids were lower significantly in 2 sample compared with those in 1 sample table 1 and fig s3 p 0 01 except gly and glune p 0 05 by two tail t test the discrepancies amino acids between the two samples indicated that composite carrier could probably promote more amino acids being synthesized into proteins which was consistent with the higher pn content in 2 sample fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 composite carrier facilitated the aob and anaob enrichment the main challenge of pn a mainstream application relate to low nitrogen in the influent and long term process stability was to overcome the proliferation of nob gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 kouba et al 2017 at the low nitrogen condition nob can grow faster than aob and the inhibition by free ammonia is ineffective hellinga et al 1998 kouba et al 2014 actually the overproliferation of nob was the main bottleneck in the pn a reactor mbbr treating low strength wastewater even at the warm temperature 25 30 c because biofilms can sustain microorganisms with very different growth kinetics due to the undefined srt and their distinct substrate gradients lackner et al 2014 thus a novel carrier could facilitate aob and anaob enrichment but limit the nob growth is significant and necessary in this condition to illustrate the above mentioned function of the composite carriers in this study we contrasted the secretions and metabolites related bacterial aggregation and bacteria community related nitrogen removal process between ordinary carriers 1 as control group and composite carriers 2 the eps matrix plays a core role in determining the bacterial aggregation capacity hou et al 2015 the electronegative and hydrophobicity of pn could promote and stabilize the aggregate structure and biofilm formation laspidou and rittmann 2002 jia et al 2017 moreover the sludge hydrophobicity and bio flocculation are positively correlated to the pn ps ratio liao et al 2001 zhang et al 2015 in this study the pn content and pn ps ratio in 2 sample were obviously higher than those in 1 sample fig 3 which showed that the sludge on the composite carriers surface had a relatively high aggregation and biofilm formation capacity hydrophobic phospholipids could also affect the bacterial aggregation capacity flemming and wingender 2010 phosphoethanolamine pe and phosphocholine pc are the major components of phospholipids in most bacterial membranes sohlenkamp and geiger 2016 moreover pc and pe can biosynthesized the dominant compositions of phospholipids phosphatidylcholine ptc and phosphatidylethanolamine pte respectively gibellini and smith 2010 thus the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway was analyzed through kegg database as shown in fig s4 up regulated pc in 1 sample presented the more active metabolism and catabolism pathway of pc the pc become the dominant head group of ammoxosome membrane contributed the lower pn content zhao et al 2018 most importantly the active metabolism of pte could increase the aggregation zhao et al 2018 and the up regulated pe in 2 sample showed the more active pte metabolism it probably presented that the bacteria on composite carriers surface had higher aggregation capacity however the most important thing was if the more target functional bacteria aob and anaob aggregated on the composite carriers surface thus 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis was applied to reveal the relative abundance of bacteria community on different carriers surface the target functional bacteria aob nitrosomonas and anaob candidatus jettenia were dominant in the pn a system table s2 importantly the abundance of aob and anaob were higher on composite carrier surface than those on ordinary carrier surface but nob was very few the functional bacteria were most likely to attach to the surface of composite carriers but nob was easy to washout from the reactor the composite carriers accounted for a filling ratio of 40 and there were only a few ordinary carriers as the contrast group in the reactor moreover the mlvss on the surface of composite carrier was obviously higher than that on the surface of ordinary carrier fig 3c and compared with the ordinary carrier the nitrogen conversion rate of composite carrier was also significantly higher fig 3d so the higher abundance of functional bacteria aob and anaob in the reactor was mainly facilitated by the composite carriers and nob was limited additionally the seed sludge was inoculated from the aerobic tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant a2 o process so it was activated sludge system in the initial period however the functional bacteria aob and anaob were dominated in the system accounting for 55 60 finally in the other word the transformation of activated sludge system to pn a system treating low strength wastewater was realized by adding the composite carrier 4 2 composite carrier increased bacterium metabolic activity metabolomics technology has applied as an important method to analyze functional status and variation of microbial metabolite patterns which could reflect the activity of different metabolic pathway marcobal et al 2013 as mentioned in 3 3 the abundance of functional bacteria aob and anaob were obviously higher on composite carrier surface than those on ordinary carriers surface in order to investigate the key role of composite carriers on the functional bacteria sludge samples on the surface of composite carriers and ordinary carriers as control group were taken to detect metabolomics respectively the pathways concerned with amino acid metabolism such as alanine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism presented significant effect for the discrimination of the two sets of samples the details of these pathways were shown in fig 6 a in which the synthetic pathway of glutamate and putrescine was obviously up regulated in conditions of high external ammonia concentrations glutamate is the direct ammonia product via glutamate dehydrogenase which subsequently serve as a primary precursor in multiple biosynthesis pathways nagatani et al 1971 karrer and warren 1974 and it is usually synthesized more in actively growing cells lu et al 2016b moreover putrescine plays a key role in cell division and is a widely distributed cellular polyamine whose biosynthesis often increases when conditions favor a higher growth rate tabor and tabor 1985 tkachenko et al 2001 schneider et al 2013 the abundance of glutamate and putrescine in 2 samples was significantly higher than those in 1 samples as shown in fig 6a and table s3 which showed that the composite carriers could facilitate the growth rate and activity of bacteria as mentioned in 3 2 pn contents in 2 sample were obviously higher than that in 1 sample which revealed that composite carriers could promote the synthesis of extracellular proteins to further investigate the influence mechanism of composite carriers on the protein synthesis the biosynthesis pathway of amino acids was explored in this study the lower abundance of 18 essential amino acids in 2 sample compared with those in 1 sample fig s3 presented that a higher amino acids consumption occurred in 2 sample it indirectly revealed that more amino acids attributed to the synthesis of protein which could be presented in the pathway of amino acids biosynthesis fig 6b recently 16s function prediction has been used to investigate microbial metabolic in many field lu et al 2016a wong et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 tang et al 2018 the information obtained by cog and kegg function prediction by i sanger was shown in fig s6 it was known that rna processing and modification amino acid transport and metabolism nucleotide transport and metabolism purine metabolism pyrimidine metabolism aminoacyl trna biosynthesis were the function pathways concerned with protein synthesis compared with 1 sample these function pathways were upregulated obviously in 2 sample which also indicated that the composite carriers could promote the activity of protein synthesis 4 3 mechanism of composite carrier on promoting the stability of mainstream pn a one of the challenges of the implementation of mainstream pn a process is the overcome proliferation of nob due to the inefficient limitation of free ammonia in low nitrogen concentrations condition hellinga et al 1998 kouba et al 2014 moreover the decrease of net biomass production due to the low nitrogen concentrations of the influent also negatively affect the application of pn a system laureni et al 2015 morales et al 2015 therefore the method to provide a relative high ammonia microenvironment in low nitrogen concentrations and maintain high biomass concentrations would be useful for the practical application of the process in fact biofilm based on carriers has been proved to maintain the stable operation of pn a process in one stage system gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 however the carriers used to start reactors were all inoculated with already established biofilm originating from reactor treating high nitrogen concentrations wastewater in the investigations mentioned above the startup of mainstream pn a process inoculated active sludge treating low strength wastewater was few reported importantly the composite carriers could provide relatively high ammonia microenvironment in low strength wastewater still no proposed by adding composite carrier the startup and stable operation of pn a process treating low strength wastewater was realized in sbr in this study in fact sbr applied in many researches and the operational conditions of the reactor in this study would not influence the bacteria attachment on both the composite carrier and ordinary carrier surface thus the composite carrier played the key role in the pn a system the biofilm structure bacterium distribution and related bacterial metabolic pathways on the composite carrier surface were investigated to further explain the mechanism of composite carrier on promoting the stability of mainstream pn a system natural zeolite is one ion exchanger with a high affinity for ammonium ion due to its high porosity and large specific surface area semmens et al 1981 athanasiadis and helmreich 2005 in fact zeolite was not only used as sorption medium of ammonium but also was suggested to be used as ammonium releaser when the ammonium concentrations in conditions was low fachini and vasconcelos 2006 markou et al 2014 to resolve the instability of pn resulting from the low ammonium concentration of mainstream wastewater the composite carriers consisted with zeolites and polypropylene were designed and fabricated in present study when the ammonium concentration was high in water during the feeding process ammonium ions would be adsorbed by zeolite when the ammonium concentration in water was low due to the utilization of aob the ammonium ions would be desorbed by zeolite meanwhile the aob next to zeolite would utilize the ammonium as substrate during this process the high ammonium and low oxygen condition around the zeolites could inhibit nob activity further limiting the transformation of nitrite to nitrate miladinovic and weatherley 2008 in this way the startup and stability of pn and the efficient interception of anaob in low strength wastewater were realized the composite carriers surface were sampled at the end of the reactor operation to observed the structure and morphology of the biofilm using sem as shown in fig s7 the shape of the bacterium on the outer was mainly straight rods and inlayer was mainly cauliflower previous study has revealed that the shape of nitrosomonas belong to aob is straight rods ge et al 2015 and it was known that the cauliflower appearance was testified to be the characteristics of anaob enrichment trigo et al 2006 wang et al 2011 lin and wang 2017 moreover aob and anaob were the dominant bacterium on the composite carriers surface and nitrosomonas was the dominant genu of aob thus aob and anaob distributed the outer and inner respectively on the surface of composite carriers were confirmed by the results above the bottom feed was used for the influent so the ammonia concentration was higher surrounding the carriers at the beginning of each cycle the relative high ammonia microenvironment could be formed on the surface of composite carriers the ammonia oxidized process based on aob could formed anoxic even anaerobic microenvironment simultaneously moreover the nitrite produced by aob was utilized easily by anaob due to the favorable position the existence of microenvironment was conducive for the attachment of anaob on the composite carrier surface the low aerobic condition on composite carriers surface and the low nitrite concentration in wastewater could inhibit the activity of attached and suspended nob respectively the nob with poor activity would be washout with the effluent meanwhile the functional bacteria aob and anaob were maintained on the carrier surface in this way the stability of the bacterial composition in the system could be realized therefore the startup and stability of pn and the interception of anaob in low strength wastewater were realized by using the composite carriers in this study as mentioned above the microenvironment of higher ammonia on the surface was the key role of the composite carriers so the ammonia substrate abundance on the surface of ordinary carriers as control group and composite carriers were contrasted in the following parts for instance in wastewater treatment process through detecting the metabolomics of bacterial consortium involved and then the metabolites sensitive to operational conditions could be identified as potential biomarkers lu et al 2016b in order to investigate the positive role of composite carriers in pn a process treating low strength wastewater metabolites were analyzed at the end of the reactor operation instead of the ammonium concentration in microenvironment due to the difficult monitoring in situ previous research has revealed that under high external ammonia concentrations conditions glutamate is the direct ammonia assimilation product via glutamate dehydrogenase nagatani et al 1971 compared with 1 sample the abundance of glutamate was upregulated obviously in 2 sample table s3 which showed that ammonium concentrations in the microenvironment of composite carrier surface was relatively higher moreover spermidine as a metabolite biomarker could be used to indicate the ammonia is sufficient or not which was upregulated when the ammonia concentration is high lu et al 2016b it was worth noting that compared with 1 sample the spermidine of 2 sample was upregulated more than 10 times which presented that the ammonia substrate abundance surrounding the composite carrier surface was obviously higher than that surrounding ordinary carriers as control group surface thus the composite carriers designed and applied in this study could indeed realize the startup and stable operation of mainstream pn a process treating low strength wastewater by improving the ammonia substrate abundance in the microenvironment of carrier surface 5 conclusions the startup and stable operation of a mbbr with the self designed composite carriers were realized in pn a process treating low strength wastewater the zeolites and floating materials were distributed evenly in the spherical shell through embedding a spherical polyhedron to produce the composite carriers compared with ordinary carriers without zeolites as control group the surface of composite carriers had higher abundance of aob and anaob the higher ammonia microenvironment on the surface of the composite carriers was validated in situ by the biomarker of glutamate and especially spermidine composite carriers enhanced the aggregation capacity of bacteria by increasing the proteins secretion and the activity of glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway pathways analysis of alanine metabolism arginine and proline metabolism revealed that the composite carriers could promote the growth rate and activity of bacteria moreover the bacteria on the composite carrier surface having higher activity of proteins synthesis was proved by the results of both metabolic pathway analysis of amino acids and 16s rrna function prediction the composite carriers provided a useful strategy to start and operate the mainstream pn a process in practical application acknowledgements the authors

18614,phosphate due to its somatotrophic effect on organisms can cause severe eutrophication with excessive content in water conventional methods for phosphate detection which are based on complicated instruments are time consuming here we report a luminescent lanthanide functionalized coordination polymer eu buc 14 by doping eu3 cations to buc 14 nanocrystals this eu3 functionalized hybrid eu buc 14 presents excellent luminescence features of eu3 ion that originated from efficient energy transfer from the ligand the detection results show that eu buc 14 is a highly efficient luminescent probe for phosphate detection in aqueous solutions exhibiting high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0 88 μm and a short response time of within 5 min more significantly eu buc 14 has a high specificity for po4 3 over fifteen other pollutant anions and eleven metal cations the sensing mechanism is proposed via an in depth analysis of the interaction between po4 3 and eu3 simultaneously it displays high adsorption ability toward po4 3 57 9 mg p g making it an outstanding multifunctional material and the adsorption process plays an important role in preconcentration of po4 3 which can lead to a quick fluorescent response with high quenching efficiency the practicality of eu buc 14 was also validated by sensing po4 3 in real environment water samples graphical abstract image 1 keywords luminescence detection phosphate lanthanide functionalized coordination polymer 1 introduction phosphate plays a critical role in transduction energy storage and gene construction in biological systems caffrey and gunnlaugsson 2014 banerjee et al 2013 and usually used as fertilizers for food production along with the large quantity use in modern agriculture and industry phosphate is inevitably released to aqueous environment excessive phosphate in water can cause severe environmental pollution such as eutrophication over 0 2 mg l and cause aquatic plants to bloom which can deplete the dissolved oxygen level release toxic algal toxins into the water environment and lead to the decay and death of vegetation and aquatic life lin et al 2018 thus many countries and organizations have established regulations to use phosphate as a convenient indicator or tracer of organic pollution in water bodies the detection requirement of po4 3 discharge criteria in water environment is reported to be around 0 2 10 mg p per l 6 4 10 6 to 3 2 10 4 mol l cheng et al 2010 yang et al 2015 therefore the detection of phosphate is of great significance for controlling and guarding against the occurrence of organic pollution in water environment up to now the standard method recommended for detecting phosphate in water environment is still a colorimetric method based on the formation of a phosphomolybdate blue complex developed by murphy and riley 1962 this method is influenced by silicate interference because the very broad adsorption band of silicomolybdate blue complex 790 nm can overlap the adsorption band of phosphomolybdate blue complex 710 nm wu and tong 2018 moreover the procedures of the method are time consuming and complicated in recent years several methods for phosphate detection have been developed including spectrophotometry li et al 2010 chromatography colina and gardiner 1999 electrochemical method lee et al 2009 and enzymatic biosensors rahman et al 2006 however most of the methods prove to be inappropriate for routine analysis in practical applications because of the expensive apparatus and the time consuming and complicated preparation procedures by contrast fluorometry with favourable advantages such as high sensitivity easy fabrication and short response time as well as requiring no sample preparation or specific pre treatment has attracted increasing attention in detecting phosphate yang et al 2011b zhao et al 2011 bai et al 2013 coordination polymers cps which assemble organic structs and inorganic nodes into periodic frameworks exhibit diverse easily tailored structures and exposed active sites yaghi et al 2003 kitagawa et al 2004 these characteristics have captured growing attention with their various potential applications in gas storage rosi et al 2003 catalysis wang et al 2014 separation li et al 2012 and chemical sensing chen et al 2010 wang et al 2016 it has been demonstrated that the guest molecules adsorbed on cps can induce changes of fluorescence responsive signals thus realizing selective identification of target analytes based on the characteristic emission change cui et al 2012 to date large numbers of cps based sensors have been developed for sensing various targets such as antibiotics wang et al 2016 benzene series pollutants qin et al 2017 and metal cations wang et al 2017 especially lanthanide coordination polymers ln cps have been envisioned as promising candidates in fluorometric sensing lustig et al 2017 due to their long luminescence emission time high quantum yields and sharp emission lines the weak luminescent intensity of lanthanide ions can be enhanced through the antenna effect in ln cps when uv or near uv radiation is absorbed by the organic ligand in cps the energy from the ligand can be transferred to lanthanide ions resulting in strong characteristic luminescence of lanthanide ions cui et al 2012 choppin and peterman 1998 additionally the interactions such as coordination bonds π π interaction and hydrogen bonding between cps and guests can improve the sensing sensitivity sun and yan 2018 however the coordination number and the various coordination sphere of lanthanide ions pose a great challenge to the design and preparation of ideal ln cps and high content of lanthanide ions in ln cps is possibly conducive to concentration quenching of lanthanide based fluorescence lian and yan 2016 in addition there are many deficiencies that can strongly limit their application in environmental waters for example most of phosphate sensors are limited in organic solvents schmidtchen and berger 1997 and some commercial in situ fluorescent sensors are excessively expensive usually above 20 000 lin et al 2018 therefore in spite of the challenges mentioned above further development of cost effective phosphate detection sensors with simple operation and high sensitivity performance in aqueous media is still needed the possibility for post synthetic modification psm provides us with an opportunity to introduce lanthanide ions to cps with a suitable concentration to form unique luminescent sensors for chemical sensing since lanthanide ions such as eu3 exhibit high affinity to the oxygen donor atoms especially those originating from phosphate samy et al 2010 as shown herein we successively developed a luminescent eu drop ln cp sensor eu buc 14 for detecting po4 3 in aqueous environments the design rationale and sensing process are illustrated in scheme 1 due to the sensitization effect of the ligand on eu3 strong fluorescence emission can be obtained after the addition of po4 3 anions the energy transfer process from ligand to eu3 cations can be partially interrupted by the strong interaction between po4 3 anions and eu3 cations resulting in the luminescence of eu buc 14 being quickly quenched and eventually realizing the detection process zhao et al 2011 samy et al 2010 as expected eu buc 14 exhibits characteristics of eu3 emissions and shows rapid 5 min selective and sensitive response to po4 3 with the detection limit of 0 88 μm obvious fluorescence change is visible to the naked eye in the detection process under a uv lamp making it more practical moreover eu buc 14 exhibits a pleasurable adsorption capacity of 57 9 mg p g toward po4 3 at room temperature the adsorption process can lead to a quick fluorescent response in the detection process by preconcentrating po4 3 additionally eu buc 14 can be successfully applied to the detection of po4 3 in real environment samples 2

synthesis method and conditions provided in our previous work zhang et al 2015 0 0685 g cdcl2 2 5h2o 0 3 mmol 0 7415 g h24mo7n6o24 4h2o 0 6 mmol and 0 0280 g 4 ap 0 3 mmol with molar ratio of 1 2 1 were dissolved in 20 ml deionized water and sealed in a 25 ml teflon lined stainless steel parr bomb heated at 443 k for 72 h after cooling to room temperature white block like crystals of buc 14 were then obtained filtered washed with deionized water and ethanol three times sequentially and finally dried at 60 c for 6 h 2 4 preparation of eu buc 14 eu buc 14 was prepared by dispersing freshly prepared buc 14 100 mg into 10 ml ethanol solution of eucl3 6h2o 1 mmol after stirring the mixture at 60 c for 24 h the solid was separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water three times to remove the excess eu3 the resulting solid was dried in vacuum at 60 c overnight 2 5 luminescence investigation the luminescence performance of both buc 14 and eu buc 14 on solid state was investigated in addition the luminescence stability was investigated by immersing 3 mg of eu buc 14 in 5 ml deionized aqueous solution for 3 days and the luminescence spectra were recorded in every 12 h the mixed solution was stirred at a constant rate 200 r min during experiment to maintain its homogeneity the luminescence stability in aqueous with different ph was also studied by immersing 3 mg powder eu buc 14 in 5 ml aqueous solutions with ph values from 4 0 to 8 0 respectively 2 6 phosphate anion sensing properties in order to study the response kinetics 2 mg eu buc 14 powder was immersed in 3 ml na3po4 100 μm aqueous solution at room temperature and the fluorescent intensity was measured at different time to investigate the detection ability of eu buc 14 toward po4 3 anion in aqueous media 2 mg eu buc 14 was mixed with 3 ml different concentrations of po4 3 anion after incubating for 5 min at room temperature the fluorescence responses were measured the interference effect of co existing ions to po4 3 anions detection was further explored 2 mg eu buc 14 was added in 3 ml different kinds of nazm aqueous solution 100 μm mz f cl br no3 no2 so4 2 so3 2 hso3 hso4 co3 2 chcoo cho2 s2o3 2 s2o8 2 c2o4 2 the fluorescent intensities of above mixture solution with or without 100 μm po4 3 were separately measured after 5 min at room temperature considering metal cations may replace eu3 and result in the fluorescence quenching the interferences of metals ions including k na mg2 ca2 cu2 zn2 co2 ni2 cd2 fe2 and al3 were detected with their corresponding chloride salts 100 μm all data presented in the results are the averaged values of three parallel experiments the performance of eu buc 14 for phosphate detection in real environmental water samples was further evaluated source water was collected from qingcaosha raw water in shanghai river water and tap water were collected from the campus of tongji university shanghai those samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size membrane sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china to remove suspended particles and source water and river water were used after a digestion procedure with potassium persulfate the spike and recovery method were further carried out with tap water in this study 2 7 adsorption performance towards po4 3 adsorption experiments for po4 3 with eu buc 14 were performed in a 150 ml conical flask 10 mg eu buc 14 was added to 100 ml simulated po4 3 aqueous solution at a concentration of 10 mg p l the suspension was stirred with thermostatic magnetic blender at a constant speed of 300 r min at room temperature 2 ml sample was drawn at an interval of five or 10 min with a 0 45 μm syringe filter sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and the concentration of p in the clear suspensions was determined by using the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method apha 2005 the amount of p uptake was calculated according to eq 1 1 q c 0 c e v m where q is the amount of p adsorbed by eu buc 14 mg g c 0 and c e are the initial and final concentrations of p mg l respectively v is the volume of solution l and m is the adsorbent weight g 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of buc 14 and eu buc 14 the xrd pattern fig 1 a of the as synthesized buc 14 is very consistent with that simulated from single crystal structure zhang et al 2015 which validated the successful synthesis of buc 14 as we previously reported buc 14 contains one discrete β octamolybdate anion mo8o26 4 and four discrete protonated 4 aminpyridinium ions in each unit fig s1 and each 4 aminpyridinium ions is further linked to mo8o26 4 to construct a 3d framework via strong hydrogen bonds n h o in the structure of buc 14 each 4 aminpyridinium is protonated at a nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring and four amino groups nh2 are non bonded the bonds observed at 3454 and 3266 cm 1 fig 1 b in ftir spectra represent the non coordinating nh2 functions the peaks between 1700 and 1000 cm 1 were associated with c c and c n bonds in 4 hap and the bands in 600 1000 cm 1 were attributed to υ mo o and υ mo o mo in β octamolybdate in addition buc 14 had an overall negative surface charge from ph 2 to ph 10 zhang et al 2015 the reactive nature of the uncoordinated amino groups as well as the electrostatic interactions between negative charge in mo8o26 4 and the positive charges eu3 in this study encourage us to introduce eu3 cations to buc 14 via post synthetic modification psm the functionalized buc 14 with eu3 was prepared by immersing buc 14 into the ethanol solution of europium chloride the xrd data fig 1 a of eu buc 14 matches well with buc 14 indicating that the crystalline integrity was not destroyed after modification the sem images fig s2 demonstrate that the crystals of buc 14 and eu buc 14 are almost uniform with a rock like appearance except for extra particles on the surface of eu buc 14 this is attributed to the adsorption of eu3 on buc 14 more importantly eu3 can be observed in the elemental mapping fig 2 g of eu buc 14 even after adsorbing po4 3 which suggests that eu3 was successfully loaded on buc 14 compared with buc 14 the band intensity of nh2 in eu buc 14 in ftir spectra fig 1 a decreased indicating the successful coordination of eu3 and nitrogen in amidogen of buc 14 the xps analysis of both buc 14 and eu buc 14 was further carried out to confirm the interaction between buc 14 and eu3 in fig 3 a the prominent spectra signal at 1134 2 ev confirms the presence of eu3 3d in eu buc 14 the o 1s spectra fig 3 b of buc 14 and eu buc 14 are extremely identical however the n 1s spectra fig 3 c of buc 14 shows an appreciable shift to a higher binding energy of eu buc 14 the shift ca 0 5 ev reflects a decrease in the electron density of n atoms resulting from the electron donating effect from nh2 to eu3 cations lian and yan 2016 yang et al 2009 in fig 3 d the peaks at 232 48 ev mo 3d3 2 and 235 53 ev mo 3d5 2 are assigned to orbital of mo6 in the crystal lattice li et al 2016 song et al 2018 after eu3 was introduced both mo 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 shift to a higher energy indicating the existence of the electrostatic interactions between the electron acceptor of eu3 and electron donor of mo8o26 4 based on the feasibility to form coordination bonds between eu3 and n atoms lian and yan 2016 as well as the strong electrostatic interaction between mo8o26 4 and eu3 eu3 is more likely to be chelated by the amidogen and mo8o26 4 3 2 luminescence properties of eu buc 14 luminescence studies on both buc 14 and eu buc 14 at solid state were performed at room temperature there is a broad fluorescence emission of buc 14 centred at 470 nm upon excitation at 312 nm which aroused from π π transitions of the ligands 4 hap fig 4 blue line after incorporating eu3 cations eu buc 14 λex 312 nm exhibits sharp characteristic emissions of eu3 at 594 617 652 and 700 nm fig 4 red line due to the 5d0 7fj j 1 2 3 4 transitions of eu3 he and yan 2013 xu and yan 2016 respectively which indicates that eu buc 14 is successfully formed the strongest emission on the emission spectrum of eu buc 14 is originated from 5d0 7f2 transition with red light indicating that eu3 ions occupy the site with non inversion symmetry this can also be confirmed by the emergence of emission peak at 594 nm for the 5d0 7f1 transition only occurs when eu3 site is in low symmetry liu et al 2013 furthermore the emission spectra of eu buc 14 excited at different wavelengths were tested and presented in fig s3 in which the intensity of the emission peak at 470 nm gradually decreases and the emission peak at 612 nm shows an inverse tendency this result demonstrates that energy can be efficiently transferred from ligands to eu3 ions and thus sensitizing eu3 ions to generate luminescence qin et al 2017 liu et al 2004 furthermore the lifetime and efficiency of the luminescence process were measured table s1 the long lifetime 141 7 μs and appreciable quantum yield 16 5 of eu3 in eu buc 14 also prove the efficient energy transfer from ligand to eu3 indicating that eu buc 14 can be an excellent candidate for luminescent sensors when eu buc 14 in aqueous solution is illuminated by uv strong red light emission is visible to the naked eye which is assigned to the characteristic emissions of eu3 fig 6 a inset as shown in fig s4 the luminescence intensity of eu buc 14 immersed in water remains almost unchanged after 3 days indicating desirable fluorescence stability in the aqueous environment furthermore the characteristic emission of eu3 at 617 nm shows favourable luminescence stability with the solution in a wide ph range from 4 to 8 fig s5 the strong luminescence signal and good luminescence stability indicate that eu buc 14 can be a good candidate as fluorescence sensors in aqueous solutions 3 3 fluorescence sensing of phosphate luminescence response of eu buc 14 toward po4 3 anions in aqueous solution was investigated the effect of contact time on fluorescence sensing and the fluorescence intensity of eu buc 14 were measured with 3 ml po4 3 solution 100 μm at different times as illustrated in fig 5 the emission intensity of eu buc 14 at 617 nm quickly decreases in 1 min and then gradually reaches fluorescence equilibrium in less than 5 min which indicates that eu buc 14 has rapid fluorescence response to po4 3 thus all the sensing properties of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 in this work were measured after 5 min to ensure the fluorescence reached equilibrium to determine the sensitivity of eu buc 14 as a luminescent probe for the detection of po4 3 eu buc 14 solid sample was immersed in aqueous solutions with different concentrations of po4 3 3 ml 5 150 μm for 5 min then the luminescence intensity of each solution was tested under 312 nm excitation as shown in fig 6 a the emission intensity at 617 nm gradually decreases with the concentration of po4 3 rising from 5 μm to 150 μm and the fluorescence quenching reached nearly 90 of the po4 3 concentration of 150 μm which can be visually represented in fig 6 a inset fig 6 b shows that the quenching effect can be rationalized by stern volmer zhao et al 2011 eq 2 with a good linear correlation in the concentration in the range of 5 150 μm 2 i 0 i 1 k sv m where i 0 and i are the luminescence emission intensities of eu buc 14 and eu buc 14 po4 3 suspensions respectively m represents the molar concentration of po4 3 μm and k sv is the stern volmer constant m 1 the k sv value of eu buc 14 for po4 3 was calculated as 4 87 104 m 1 demonstrating the high quenching efficiency of po4 3 on the emission of eu buc 14 zhao et al 2011 xu et al 2015 the detection limit 3σ k sv was calculated to be 0 88 μm σ is the standard deviation from three repeated fluorescence measurements of blank solutions which is far below the detection requirement 6 4 10 6 3 2 10 4 mol l of po4 3 discharge criteria in water environment cheng et al 2010 yang et al 2015 moreover the sensitivity of this fluorescent sensing platform was quite competitive compared to other similar fluorescent detection methods xu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 as summarized in table 1 3 4 selectivity selectivity is a critical index for sensor applications to study the selectivity of the eu buc 14 sensor to po4 3 fifteen other common pollutant anions in environmental waters including f cl br no3 no2 so4 2 so3 2 hso3 hso4 co3 2 chcoo cho2 s2o3 2 s2o8 2 and c2o4 2 were separately tested the suspension was prepared by immersing 2 mg eu buc 14 solid sample in 3 ml aqueous solution with the above mentioned anions presented 100 μm and the emission peak at 617 nm was recorded in fig 7 a most anions show a negligible effect on the luminescence of eu buc 14 while po4 3 exhibits a drastic quenching effect on the luminescence emission which demonstrates the high selectivity of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 since pollutant anions often coexist in environmental waters the selectivity was further investigated by luminescence test of eu buc 14 with mixed anions containing po4 3 100 μm and one of the fifteen anions 100 μm the results in fig 7 b demonstrate that the eu buc 14 luminescent intensity of the solution with mixed anions changed very slightly compared to the solution only with po4 3 in addition the interferences of metal ions towards the fluorescence detection were also tested as illustrated in fig 8 a the fluorescent response of eu buc 14 toward po4 3 anions in aqueous solutions and various individual metal cations including k na mg2 ca2 cu2 zn2 co2 ni2 cd2 fe2 and al3 reveal that only the presence of po4 3 can achieve significant quenching effect and the fluorescence quenching was still observed when po4 3 and other metal cations co existed fig 8 b this further confirms the high selectivity of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 in water environment which encourages us to use it in real environmental waters for po4 3 detection 3 5 adsorption performance the removal of po4 3 from wastewater is also important in water treatment reported results show that cps can be used as good adsorbents for the removal of phosphate in water xie et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 thus we further probed the adsorption performance of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 from simulated wastewater in this work the adsorption amount was determined based on eq 1 in section 2 7 the results in fig s6 show that the adsorption amount q of po4 3 by eu buc 14 increases rapidly in 5 min then slowly reaches the maximum adsorption capacity q max 57 9 mg p g after 40 min the q max value is comparable and even higher than those in other materials reported so far and the contact time to reach equilibrium is shorter than most of reported materials as far as we know which was summarized in table s2 chouyyok et al 2010 ge et al 2013 huang et al 2014 kuzawa et al 2006 liu et al 2008 namasivayam and prathap 2005 shin et al 2004 song et al 2011 sowmya and meenakshi 2014 xie et al 2014 yang et al 2011a zhang et al 2009 furthermore superior adsorption performance of eu buc 14 plays an important role in the preconcentration of po4 3 which makes po4 3 contact with eu buc 14 more sufficient thus reaching a high quenching efficiency in short time the practical application of eu buc 14 2 mg for phosphate removal was conducted based on the river water 500 ml from the campus of tongji university phosphate concentration was determined by using the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method after a digestion procedure with potassium persulfate the initial concentration of the river water was determined as 0 23 mg l results in fig s7 show that eu buc 14 can remove 68 of phosphate in 10 min and reach the equilibrium in 40 min with a removal rate of 79 and an adsorption amount of 49 36 mg g meanwhile the residual phosphate concentration was 0 052 mg l which is lower than the concentration that can cause eutrophication lin et al 2018 3 6 mechanism of eu buc 14 for po4 3 detection the changes in fluorescence of lanthanide coordination polymers with ions mainly arise in the following ways i the crystal structure being destroyed by ions lian and yan 2016 wong et al 2006 ii the energy transfer process influenced by the interaction between ions and organic ligands yi et al 2015 and iii the energy transfer process influenced by the interaction between ions and lanthanide ions lian and yan 2016 based on xrd tests we investigated the structure of eu buc 14 after detecting po4 3 as shown in fig 1 a the xrd patterns of eu buc 14 after detecting po4 3 are consistent with buc 14 thus ruling out the collapse of crystal structures xps data before and after detection of po4 3 showed that there is an appreciable shift eu 3d3 2 ca 1 74 ev eu 3d5 2 ca 1 14 ev in binding energy fig 3 e which may be caused by the interaction between po4 3 and eu3 chandra rao and mandal 2018 the interactions can reduce the antenna effect from the ligand to eu3 and partially interrupts the energy transfer process hence resulting in a decrease of fluorescence intensity to further elucidate the mechanism the luminescence lifetime of eu buc 14 in po4 3 solution was recorded table s1 compared to the lifetime of eu3 in eu buc 14 without po4 3 presented the lifetime of eu3 5d0 7f2 in eu buc 14 with po4 3 in aqueous solution was greatly shortened this phenomenon also indicates that po4 3 has obvious effect on energy transfer between the ligand and eu3 which originates from the coordination between po4 3 and eu3 moreover adsorption tests reveal that eu buc 14 has superior adsorption performance towards po4 3 that is during the sensing process eu buc 14 firstly adsorbs part of po4 3 putting this po4 3 in a more intimate contact with eu buc 14 and thus leading to a quick fluorescent response we have verified this above speculation by element mapping of eu buc 14 after adsorbing po4 3 in which the distribution of p fig 2 h is obviously highly consistent with eu fig 2 g in addition the fluorescence signal of eu buc 14 could not be recovered after it was quenched in po4 3 solution due to the interaction between the po4 3 and eu3 martínez máñez and sancenón 2003 qin and yan 2018 3 7 sensing phosphate in environmental water samples the practical application of po4 3 detection with eu buc 14 was tested in source water and river water 2 mg eu buc 14 was mixed with 3 ml water samples and the fluorescence responses were measured after incubating for 5 min at room temperature the concentration of p in those environmental samples were also determined by using the standard method molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method to make a comparation table 3 reveals both the relative standard deviation of phosphate detection in source water and river water are less than 4 the concentration of phosphate in source water and river water was measured to 1 27 μm and 7 39 μm respectively which is higher than the concentration measured by the standard method 1 48 μm for source water 8 10 μm for river water but in an acceptable range furthermore the detection of po4 3 in tap water was carried out by the standard addition method to validate the reliability of the proposed fluorescent sensing method in practical applications the aqueous samples with different concentrations of po4 3 were prepared with tap water as presented in section 2 6 then each sample was mixed with 2 mg eu buc 14 at room temperature the luminescent intensity for each sample was measured after 5 min and the results were summarized in table 2 the relative standard deviation rsd of the spiked samples is around 2 and the recovery ranges from 97 to 106 additionally the fluorescence background at 540 nm in water samples under uv illumination is negligible which further confirmed that the detection method based on eu buc 14 is robust for sensing po4 3 in water samples 4 conclusions in summary in this work we have developed a luminescent sensor eu buc 14 based on buc 14 via psm method for highly sensitive selective and rapid detection of trace amount of po4 3 in aqueous solution fluorescence spectra indicate that eu buc 14 has strong characteristic emission band of eu3 which generates from the efficient energy transfer from ligands in buc 14 this sensor is able to detect po4 3 anions with a short response time 5 min and low detection limit 0 88 μm which is far below the threshold of phosphate concentration that causes eutrophication over 0 2 mg l the different affinities of common pollutant ions for eu buc 14 give it excellent selectivity for sensing po4 3 in aqueous solutions with fifteen other anions and eleven other metal cations in particular the change in fluorescent signal stimulated by uv light is so strong that it is visible to the naked eyes making the sensor more convenient and giving a clearly observable response during detection in addition eu buc 14 exhibits an adsorption capacity of 57 9 mg g toward po4 3 at room temperature which can pre concentrate po4 3 anions and thus facilitating the sensing process to reach a high quenching efficiency in short time the detection mechanism proposed with the interaction between po4 3 and eu buc 14 weakens the energy transfer from ligand to eu3 cations thus resulting in fluorescence quenching this fluorescent sensor has been further demonstrated to be capable of detecting po4 3 in real environmental water samples which highlights its potential in practical applications therefore this work not only provides a reliable and simple method for phosphate detection in water with a high sensitivity selectivity and rapid response but also provides a new insight into the design of ln cps for simultaneous detection and removal of phosphate in water conflicts of interest there are no

18614,phosphate due to its somatotrophic effect on organisms can cause severe eutrophication with excessive content in water conventional methods for phosphate detection which are based on complicated instruments are time consuming here we report a luminescent lanthanide functionalized coordination polymer eu buc 14 by doping eu3 cations to buc 14 nanocrystals this eu3 functionalized hybrid eu buc 14 presents excellent luminescence features of eu3 ion that originated from efficient energy transfer from the ligand the detection results show that eu buc 14 is a highly efficient luminescent probe for phosphate detection in aqueous solutions exhibiting high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0 88 μm and a short response time of within 5 min more significantly eu buc 14 has a high specificity for po4 3 over fifteen other pollutant anions and eleven metal cations the sensing mechanism is proposed via an in depth analysis of the interaction between po4 3 and eu3 simultaneously it displays high adsorption ability toward po4 3 57 9 mg p g making it an outstanding multifunctional material and the adsorption process plays an important role in preconcentration of po4 3 which can lead to a quick fluorescent response with high quenching efficiency the practicality of eu buc 14 was also validated by sensing po4 3 in real environment water samples graphical abstract image 1 keywords luminescence detection phosphate lanthanide functionalized coordination polymer 1 introduction phosphate plays a critical role in transduction energy storage and gene construction in biological systems caffrey and gunnlaugsson 2014 banerjee et al 2013 and usually used as fertilizers for food production along with the large quantity use in modern agriculture and industry phosphate is inevitably released to aqueous environment excessive phosphate in water can cause severe environmental pollution such as eutrophication over 0 2 mg l and cause aquatic plants to bloom which can deplete the dissolved oxygen level release toxic algal toxins into the water environment and lead to the decay and death of vegetation and aquatic life lin et al 2018 thus many countries and organizations have established regulations to use phosphate as a convenient indicator or tracer of organic pollution in water bodies the detection requirement of po4 3 discharge criteria in water environment is reported to be around 0 2 10 mg p per l 6 4 10 6 to 3 2 10 4 mol l cheng et al 2010 yang et al 2015 therefore the detection of phosphate is of great significance for controlling and guarding against the occurrence of organic pollution in water environment up to now the standard method recommended for detecting phosphate in water environment is still a colorimetric method based on the formation of a phosphomolybdate blue complex developed by murphy and riley 1962 this method is influenced by silicate interference because the very broad adsorption band of silicomolybdate blue complex 790 nm can overlap the adsorption band of phosphomolybdate blue complex 710 nm wu and tong 2018 moreover the procedures of the method are time consuming and complicated in recent years several methods for phosphate detection have been developed including spectrophotometry li et al 2010 chromatography colina and gardiner 1999 electrochemical method lee et al 2009 and enzymatic biosensors rahman et al 2006 however most of the methods prove to be inappropriate for routine analysis in practical applications because of the expensive apparatus and the time consuming and complicated preparation procedures by contrast fluorometry with favourable advantages such as high sensitivity easy fabrication and short response time as well as requiring no sample preparation or specific pre treatment has attracted increasing attention in detecting phosphate yang et al 2011b zhao et al 2011 bai et al 2013 coordination polymers cps which assemble organic structs and inorganic nodes into periodic frameworks exhibit diverse easily tailored structures and exposed active sites yaghi et al 2003 kitagawa et al 2004 these characteristics have captured growing attention with their various potential applications in gas storage rosi et al 2003 catalysis wang et al 2014 separation li et al 2012 and chemical sensing chen et al 2010 wang et al 2016 it has been demonstrated that the guest molecules adsorbed on cps can induce changes of fluorescence responsive signals thus realizing selective identification of target analytes based on the characteristic emission change cui et al 2012 to date large numbers of cps based sensors have been developed for sensing various targets such as antibiotics wang et al 2016 benzene series pollutants qin et al 2017 and metal cations wang et al 2017 especially lanthanide coordination polymers ln cps have been envisioned as promising candidates in fluorometric sensing lustig et al 2017 due to their long luminescence emission time high quantum yields and sharp emission lines the weak luminescent intensity of lanthanide ions can be enhanced through the antenna effect in ln cps when uv or near uv radiation is absorbed by the organic ligand in cps the energy from the ligand can be transferred to lanthanide ions resulting in strong characteristic luminescence of lanthanide ions cui et al 2012 choppin and peterman 1998 additionally the interactions such as coordination bonds π π interaction and hydrogen bonding between cps and guests can improve the sensing sensitivity sun and yan 2018 however the coordination number and the various coordination sphere of lanthanide ions pose a great challenge to the design and preparation of ideal ln cps and high content of lanthanide ions in ln cps is possibly conducive to concentration quenching of lanthanide based fluorescence lian and yan 2016 in addition there are many deficiencies that can strongly limit their application in environmental waters for example most of phosphate sensors are limited in organic solvents schmidtchen and berger 1997 and some commercial in situ fluorescent sensors are excessively expensive usually above 20 000 lin et al 2018 therefore in spite of the challenges mentioned above further development of cost effective phosphate detection sensors with simple operation and high sensitivity performance in aqueous media is still needed the possibility for post synthetic modification psm provides us with an opportunity to introduce lanthanide ions to cps with a suitable concentration to form unique luminescent sensors for chemical sensing since lanthanide ions such as eu3 exhibit high affinity to the oxygen donor atoms especially those originating from phosphate samy et al 2010 as shown herein we successively developed a luminescent eu drop ln cp sensor eu buc 14 for detecting po4 3 in aqueous environments the design rationale and sensing process are illustrated in scheme 1 due to the sensitization effect of the ligand on eu3 strong fluorescence emission can be obtained after the addition of po4 3 anions the energy transfer process from ligand to eu3 cations can be partially interrupted by the strong interaction between po4 3 anions and eu3 cations resulting in the luminescence of eu buc 14 being quickly quenched and eventually realizing the detection process zhao et al 2011 samy et al 2010 as expected eu buc 14 exhibits characteristics of eu3 emissions and shows rapid 5 min selective and sensitive response to po4 3 with the detection limit of 0 88 μm obvious fluorescence change is visible to the naked eye in the detection process under a uv lamp making it more practical moreover eu buc 14 exhibits a pleasurable adsorption capacity of 57 9 mg p g toward po4 3 at room temperature the adsorption process can lead to a quick fluorescent response in the detection process by preconcentrating po4 3 additionally eu buc 14 can be successfully applied to the detection of po4 3 in real environment samples 2

were dissolved in 20 ml deionized water and sealed in a 25 ml teflon lined stainless steel parr bomb heated at 443 k for 72 h after cooling to room temperature white block like crystals of buc 14 were then obtained filtered washed with deionized water and ethanol three times sequentially and finally dried at 60 c for 6 h 2 4 preparation of eu buc 14 eu buc 14 was prepared by dispersing freshly prepared buc 14 100 mg into 10 ml ethanol solution of eucl3 6h2o 1 mmol after stirring the mixture at 60 c for 24 h the solid was separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water three times to remove the excess eu3 the resulting solid was dried in vacuum at 60 c overnight 2 5 luminescence investigation the luminescence performance of both buc 14 and eu buc 14 on solid state was investigated in addition the luminescence stability was investigated by immersing 3 mg of eu buc 14 in 5 ml deionized aqueous solution for 3 days and the luminescence spectra were recorded in every 12 h the mixed solution was stirred at a constant rate 200 r min during experiment to maintain its homogeneity the luminescence stability in aqueous with different ph was also studied by immersing 3 mg

existing ions to po4 3 anions detection was further explored 2 mg eu buc 14 was added in 3 ml different kinds of nazm aqueous solution 100 μm mz f cl br no3 no2 so4 2 so3 2 hso3 hso4 co3 2 chcoo cho2 s2o3 2 s2o8 2 c2o4 2 the fluorescent intensities of above mixture solution with or without 100 μm po4 3 were separately measured after 5 min at room temperature considering metal cations may replace eu3 and result in the fluorescence quenching the interferences of metals ions including k na mg2 ca2 cu2 zn2 co2 ni2 cd2 fe2 and al3 were detected with their corresponding chloride salts 100 μm all data presented in the results are the averaged values of three parallel experiments the performance of eu buc 14 for phosphate detection in real environmental water samples was further evaluated source water was collected from qingcaosha raw water in shanghai river water and tap water were collected from the campus of tongji university shanghai those samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size membrane sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china to remove suspended particles and source water and river water were used after a digestion procedure with potassium persulfate the spike and recovery method were further carried out with tap water in this study 2 7 adsorption performance towards po4 3 adsorption experiments for po4 3 with eu buc 14 were performed in a 150 ml conical flask 10 mg eu buc 14 was added to 100 ml simulated po4 3 aqueous solution at a concentration of 10 mg p l the suspension was stirred with thermostatic magnetic blender at a constant speed of 300 r min at room temperature 2 ml sample was drawn at an interval of five or 10 min with a 0 45 μm syringe filter sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and the concentration of p in the clear suspensions was determined by using the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method apha 2005 the amount of p uptake was calculated according to eq 1 1 q c 0 c e v m where q is the amount of p adsorbed by eu buc 14 mg g c 0 and c e are the initial and final concentrations of p mg l respectively v is the volume of solution l and m is the adsorbent weight g 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of buc 14 and eu buc 14 the xrd pattern fig 1 a of the as synthesized buc 14 is very consistent with that simulated from single crystal structure zhang et al 2015 which validated the successful synthesis of buc 14 as we previously reported buc 14 contains one discrete β octamolybdate anion mo8o26 4 and four discrete protonated 4 aminpyridinium ions in each unit fig s1 and each 4 aminpyridinium ions is further linked to mo8o26 4 to construct a 3d framework via strong hydrogen bonds n h o in the structure of buc 14 each 4 aminpyridinium is protonated at a nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring and four amino groups nh2 are non bonded the bonds observed at 3454 and 3266 cm 1 fig 1 b in ftir spectra represent the non coordinating nh2 functions the peaks between 1700 and 1000 cm 1 were associated with c c and c n bonds in 4 hap and the bands in 600 1000 cm 1 were attributed to υ mo o and υ mo o mo in β octamolybdate in addition buc 14 had an overall negative surface charge from ph 2 to ph 10 zhang et al 2015 the reactive nature of the uncoordinated amino groups as well as the electrostatic interactions between negative charge in mo8o26 4 and the positive charges eu3 in this study encourage us to introduce eu3 cations to buc 14 via post synthetic modification psm the functionalized buc 14 with eu3 was prepared by immersing buc 14 into the ethanol solution of europium chloride the xrd data fig 1 a of eu buc 14 matches well with buc 14 indicating that the crystalline integrity was not destroyed after modification the sem images fig s2 demonstrate that the crystals of buc 14 and eu buc 14 are almost uniform with a rock like appearance except for extra particles on the surface of eu buc 14 this is attributed to the adsorption of eu3 on buc 14 more importantly eu3 can be observed in the elemental mapping fig 2 g of eu buc 14 even after adsorbing po4 3 which suggests that eu3 was successfully loaded on buc 14 compared with buc 14 the band intensity of nh2 in eu buc 14 in ftir spectra fig 1 a decreased indicating the successful coordination of eu3 and nitrogen in amidogen of buc 14 the xps analysis of both buc 14 and eu buc 14 was further carried out to confirm the interaction between buc 14 and eu3 in fig 3 a the prominent spectra signal at 1134 2 ev confirms the presence of eu3 3d in eu buc 14 the o 1s spectra fig 3 b of buc 14 and eu buc 14 are extremely identical however the n 1s spectra fig 3 c of buc 14 shows an appreciable shift to a higher binding energy of eu buc 14 the shift ca 0 5 ev reflects a decrease in the electron density of n atoms resulting from the electron donating effect from nh2 to eu3 cations lian and yan 2016 yang et al 2009 in fig 3 d the peaks at 232 48 ev mo 3d3 2 and 235 53 ev mo 3d5 2 are assigned to orbital of mo6 in the crystal lattice li et al 2016 song et al 2018 after eu3 was introduced both mo 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 shift to a higher energy indicating the existence of the electrostatic interactions between the electron acceptor of eu3 and electron donor of mo8o26 4 based on the feasibility to form coordination bonds between eu3 and n atoms lian and yan 2016 as well as the strong electrostatic interaction between mo8o26 4 and eu3 eu3 is more likely to be chelated by the amidogen and mo8o26 4 3 2 luminescence properties of eu buc 14 luminescence studies on both buc 14 and eu buc 14 at solid state were performed at room temperature there is a broad fluorescence emission of buc 14 centred at 470 nm upon excitation at 312 nm which aroused from π π transitions of the ligands 4 hap fig 4 blue line after incorporating eu3 cations eu buc 14 λex 312 nm exhibits sharp characteristic emissions of eu3 at 594 617 652 and 700 nm fig 4 red line due to the 5d0 7fj j 1 2 3 4 transitions of eu3 he and yan 2013 xu and yan 2016 respectively which indicates that eu buc 14 is successfully formed the strongest emission on the emission spectrum of eu buc 14 is originated from 5d0 7f2 transition with red light indicating that eu3 ions occupy the site with non inversion symmetry this can also be confirmed by the emergence of emission peak at 594 nm for the 5d0 7f1 transition only occurs when eu3 site is in low symmetry liu et al 2013 furthermore the emission spectra of eu buc 14 excited at different wavelengths were tested and presented in fig s3 in which the intensity of the emission peak at 470 nm gradually decreases and the emission peak at 612 nm shows an inverse tendency this result demonstrates that energy can be efficiently transferred from ligands to eu3 ions and thus sensitizing eu3 ions to generate luminescence qin et al 2017 liu et al 2004 furthermore the lifetime and efficiency of the luminescence process were measured table s1 the long lifetime 141 7 μs and appreciable quantum yield 16 5 of eu3 in eu buc 14 also prove the efficient energy transfer from ligand to eu3 indicating that eu buc 14 can be an excellent candidate for luminescent sensors when eu buc 14 in aqueous solution is illuminated by uv strong red light emission is visible to the naked eye which is assigned to the characteristic emissions of eu3 fig 6 a inset as shown in fig s4 the luminescence intensity of eu buc 14 immersed in water remains almost unchanged after 3 days indicating desirable fluorescence stability in the aqueous environment furthermore the characteristic emission of eu3 at 617 nm shows favourable luminescence stability with the solution in a wide ph range from 4 to 8 fig s5 the strong luminescence signal and good luminescence stability indicate that eu buc 14 can be a good candidate as fluorescence sensors in aqueous solutions 3 3 fluorescence sensing of phosphate luminescence response of eu buc 14 toward po4 3 anions in aqueous solution was investigated the effect of contact time on fluorescence sensing and the fluorescence intensity of eu buc 14 were measured with 3 ml po4 3 solution 100 μm at different times as illustrated in fig 5 the emission intensity of eu buc 14 at 617 nm quickly decreases in 1 min and then gradually reaches fluorescence equilibrium in less than 5 min which indicates that eu buc 14 has rapid fluorescence response to po4 3 thus all the sensing properties of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 in this work were measured after 5 min to ensure the fluorescence reached equilibrium to determine the sensitivity of eu buc 14 as a luminescent probe for the detection of po4 3 eu buc 14 solid sample was immersed in aqueous solutions with different concentrations of po4 3 3 ml 5 150 μm for 5 min then the luminescence intensity of each solution was tested under 312 nm excitation as shown in fig 6 a the emission intensity at 617 nm gradually decreases with the concentration of po4 3 rising from 5 μm to 150 μm and the fluorescence quenching reached nearly 90 of the po4 3 concentration of 150 μm which can be visually represented in fig 6 a inset fig 6 b shows that the quenching effect can be rationalized by stern volmer zhao et al 2011 eq 2 with a good linear correlation in the concentration in the range of 5 150 μm 2 i 0 i 1 k sv m where i 0 and i are the luminescence emission intensities of eu buc 14 and eu buc 14 po4 3 suspensions respectively m represents the molar concentration of po4 3 μm and k sv is the stern volmer constant m 1 the k sv value of eu buc 14 for po4 3 was calculated as 4 87 104 m 1 demonstrating the high quenching efficiency of po4 3 on the emission of eu buc 14 zhao et al 2011 xu et al 2015 the detection limit 3σ k sv was calculated to be 0 88 μm σ is the standard deviation from three repeated fluorescence measurements of blank solutions which is far below the detection requirement 6 4 10 6 3 2 10 4 mol l of po4 3 discharge criteria in water environment cheng et al 2010 yang et al 2015 moreover the sensitivity of this fluorescent sensing platform was quite competitive compared to other similar fluorescent detection methods xu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 as summarized in table 1 3 4 selectivity selectivity is a critical index for sensor applications to study the selectivity of the eu buc 14 sensor to po4 3 fifteen other common pollutant anions in environmental waters including f cl br no3 no2 so4 2 so3 2 hso3 hso4 co3 2 chcoo cho2 s2o3 2 s2o8 2 and c2o4 2 were separately tested the suspension was prepared by immersing 2 mg eu buc 14 solid sample in 3 ml aqueous solution with the above mentioned anions presented 100 μm and the emission peak at 617 nm was recorded in fig 7 a most anions show a negligible effect on the luminescence of eu buc 14 while po4 3 exhibits a drastic quenching effect on the luminescence emission which demonstrates the high selectivity of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 since pollutant anions often coexist in environmental waters the selectivity was further investigated by luminescence test of eu buc 14 with mixed anions containing po4 3 100 μm and one of the fifteen anions 100 μm the results in fig 7 b demonstrate that the eu buc 14 luminescent intensity of the solution with mixed anions changed very slightly compared to the solution only with po4 3 in addition the interferences of metal ions towards the fluorescence detection were also tested as illustrated in fig 8 a the fluorescent response of eu buc 14 toward po4 3 anions in aqueous solutions and various individual metal cations including k na mg2 ca2 cu2 zn2 co2 ni2 cd2 fe2 and al3 reveal that only the presence of po4 3 can achieve significant quenching effect and the fluorescence quenching was still observed when po4 3 and other metal cations co existed fig 8 b this further confirms the high selectivity of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 in water environment which encourages us to use it in real environmental waters for po4 3 detection 3 5 adsorption performance the removal of po4 3 from wastewater is also important in water treatment reported results show that cps can be used as good adsorbents for the removal of phosphate in water xie et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 thus we further probed the adsorption performance of eu buc 14 towards po4 3 from simulated wastewater in this work the adsorption amount was determined based on eq 1 in section 2 7 the results in fig s6 show that the adsorption amount q of po4 3 by eu buc 14 increases rapidly in 5 min then slowly reaches the maximum adsorption capacity q max 57 9 mg p g after 40 min the q max value is comparable and even higher than those in other materials reported so far and the contact time to reach equilibrium is shorter than most of reported materials as far as we know which was summarized in table s2 chouyyok et al 2010 ge et al 2013 huang et al 2014 kuzawa et al 2006 liu et al 2008 namasivayam and prathap 2005 shin et al 2004 song et al 2011 sowmya and meenakshi 2014 xie et al 2014 yang et al 2011a zhang et al 2009 furthermore superior adsorption performance of eu buc 14 plays an important role in the preconcentration of po4 3 which makes po4 3 contact with eu buc 14 more sufficient thus reaching a high quenching efficiency in short time the practical application of eu buc 14 2 mg for phosphate removal was conducted based on the river water 500 ml from the campus of tongji university phosphate concentration was determined by using the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method after a digestion procedure with potassium persulfate the initial concentration of the river water was determined as 0 23 mg l results in fig s7 show that eu buc 14 can remove 68 of phosphate in 10 min and reach the equilibrium in 40 min with a removal rate of 79 and an adsorption amount of 49 36 mg g meanwhile the residual phosphate concentration was 0 052 mg l which is lower than the concentration that can cause eutrophication lin et al 2018 3 6 mechanism of eu buc 14 for po4 3 detection the changes in fluorescence of lanthanide coordination polymers with ions mainly arise in the following ways i the crystal structure being destroyed by ions lian and yan 2016 wong et al 2006 ii the energy transfer process influenced by the interaction between ions and organic ligands yi et al 2015 and iii the energy transfer process influenced by the interaction between ions and lanthanide ions lian and yan 2016 based on xrd tests we investigated the structure of eu buc 14 after detecting po4 3 as shown in fig 1 a the xrd patterns of eu buc 14 after detecting po4 3 are consistent with buc 14 thus ruling out the collapse of crystal structures xps data before and after detection of po4 3 showed that there is an appreciable shift eu 3d3 2 ca 1 74 ev eu 3d5 2 ca 1 14 ev in binding energy fig 3 e which may be caused by the interaction between po4 3 and eu3 chandra rao and mandal 2018 the interactions can reduce the antenna effect from the ligand to eu3 and partially interrupts the energy transfer process hence resulting in a decrease of fluorescence intensity to further elucidate the mechanism the luminescence lifetime of eu buc 14 in po4 3 solution was recorded table s1 compared to the lifetime of eu3 in eu buc 14 without po4 3 presented the lifetime of eu3 5d0 7f2 in eu buc 14 with po4 3 in aqueous solution was greatly shortened this phenomenon also indicates that po4 3 has obvious effect on energy transfer between the ligand and eu3 which originates from the coordination between po4 3 and eu3 moreover adsorption tests reveal that eu buc 14 has superior adsorption performance towards po4 3 that is during the sensing process eu buc 14 firstly adsorbs part of po4 3 putting this po4 3 in a more intimate contact with eu buc 14 and thus leading to a quick fluorescent response we have verified this above speculation by element mapping of eu buc 14 after adsorbing po4 3 in which the distribution of p fig 2 h is obviously highly consistent with eu fig 2 g in addition the fluorescence signal of eu buc 14 could not be recovered after it was quenched in po4 3 solution due to the interaction between the po4 3 and eu3 martínez máñez and sancenón 2003 qin and yan 2018 3 7 sensing phosphate in environmental water samples the practical application of po4 3 detection with eu buc 14 was tested in source water and river water 2 mg eu buc 14 was mixed with 3 ml water samples and the fluorescence responses were measured after incubating for 5 min at room temperature the concentration of p in those environmental samples were also determined by using the standard method molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method to make a comparation table 3 reveals both the relative standard deviation of phosphate detection in source water and river water are less than 4 the concentration of phosphate in source water and river water was measured to 1 27 μm and 7 39 μm respectively which is higher than the concentration measured by the standard method 1 48 μm for source water 8 10 μm for river water but in an acceptable range furthermore the detection of po4 3 in tap water was carried out by the standard addition method to validate the reliability of the proposed fluorescent sensing method in practical applications the aqueous samples with different concentrations of po4 3 were prepared with tap water as presented in section 2 6 then each sample was mixed with 2 mg eu buc 14 at room temperature the luminescent intensity for each sample was measured after 5 min and the results were summarized in table 2 the relative standard deviation rsd of the spiked samples is around 2 and the recovery ranges from 97 to 106 additionally the fluorescence background at 540 nm in water samples under uv illumination is negligible which further confirmed that the detection method based on eu buc 14 is robust for sensing po4 3 in water samples 4 conclusions in summary in this work we have developed a luminescent sensor eu buc 14 based on buc 14 via psm method for highly sensitive selective and rapid detection of trace amount of po4 3 in aqueous solution fluorescence spectra indicate that eu buc 14 has strong characteristic emission band of eu3 which generates from the efficient energy transfer from ligands in buc 14 this sensor is able to detect po4 3 anions with a short response time 5 min and low detection limit 0 88 μm which is far below the threshold of phosphate concentration that causes eutrophication over 0 2 mg l the different affinities of common pollutant ions for eu buc 14 give it excellent selectivity for sensing po4 3 in aqueous solutions with fifteen other anions and eleven other metal cations in particular the change in fluorescent signal stimulated by uv light is so strong that it is visible to the naked eyes making the sensor more convenient and giving a clearly observable response during detection in addition eu buc 14 exhibits an adsorption capacity of 57 9 mg g toward po4 3 at room temperature which can pre concentrate po4 3 anions and thus facilitating the sensing process to reach a high quenching efficiency in short time the detection mechanism proposed with the interaction between po4 3 and eu buc 14 weakens the energy transfer from ligand to eu3 cations thus resulting in fluorescence quenching this fluorescent sensor has been further demonstrated to be capable of detecting po4 3 in real environmental water samples which highlights its potential in practical applications therefore this work not only provides a reliable and simple method for phosphate detection in water with a high sensitivity selectivity and rapid response but also provides a new insight into the design of ln cps for simultaneous detection and removal of phosphate in water conflicts of interest there are no
