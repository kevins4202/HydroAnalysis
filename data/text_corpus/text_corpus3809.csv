19045,the biological degradation of many trace organic compounds has been reported to be strongly redox dependent the traditional characterization of redox conditions using the succession of inorganic electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen and nitrate falls short in accurately describing the critical transition state between oxic and suboxic conditions novel monitoring strategies using intrinsic redox tracers might be suitable to close that gap this study investigated the potential use of the successive biological transformation of the iodinated contrast medium iopromide as an intrinsic tracer of prevailing redox conditions in biofiltration systems iopromide degradation in biofiltration systems was monitored by quantifying twelve known biological transformation products formed under oxic conditions a novel dimensionless parameter tiop was introduced as a measure for the successive transformation of iopromide a strong correlation between the consumption of dissolved oxygen and iopromide transformation emphasized the importance of general microbial activity on iopromide degradation however results disproved a direct correlation between oxic 1 mg l o2 and suboxic 1 mg l o2 conditions and the degree of iopromide transformation results indicated that besides redox conditions also the availability of biodegradable organic substrate affects the degree of iopromide transformation similar behavior was found for the compounds gabapentin and benzotriazole while the oxic degradation of metoprolol remained stable under varying substrate conditions keywords

pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals and personal care products at low concentrations in various water bodies referred to as trace organic compounds torcs has been subject to numerous studies in the field of water research ternes 2007 benotti et al 2009 dong et al 2015 since their removal during conventional treatment is often limited effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered major point sources for the entry of torcs into the aquatic environment treatment processes like activated carbon adsorption or ozonation have been shown to serve as effective barriers for an improved removal or transformation of many of these compounds huber et al 2003 jekel et al 2013 recent studies also emphasize the potential of advanced transformation in biofiltration processes under optimized operational conditions regnery et al 2016 müller et al 2017 hellauer et al 2018 the transformation of torcs in biological systems has been shown to strongly depend on predominant redox conditions wiese et al 2011 regnery et al 2015 while few compounds were reported to be preferably degradable under reducing conditions wiese et al 2011 könig et al 2016 ghattas et al 2017 many studies have shown an improved removal of various moderately biodegradable torcs when oxic conditions prevail massmann et al 2008 baumgarten et al 2011 regnery et al 2015 regnery et al 2015 demonstrated the sensitivity of biological torc removal in biologically active porous media systems to slight changes in redox conditions where rate constants decreased significantly from oxic to suboxic and anoxic conditions traditional characterization of redox conditions in natural systems is based on monitoring the ecological succession of the inorganic electron acceptors dissolved oxygen nitrate sulfate manganese and iron mcmahon and chapelle 2008 while using this categorization allows to broadly characterize redox zonation in aquifer systems it might not be sensitive enough to accurately describe the transition state between oxic and suboxic conditions or prevalent conditions at the pore scale where biotransformation occurs in addition the determination of low dissolved oxygen concentrations is often challenging since oxygen free sampling is difficult muntau et al 2016 novel monitoring concepts might be more suitable to predict redox sensitive biodegradation of torcs in biofiltration systems iopromide a tri iodinated benzoic acid derivate used as a x ray contrast agent can be detected in many water bodies affected by the discharge of municipal wwtp effluents putschew et al 2000 ternes and hirsch 2000 kormos et al 2011 xu et al 2017 biological transformation of iopromide during conventional activated sludge treatment and in managed aquifer recharge systems such as riverbank filtration and soil aquifer treatment was observed in many studies schittko et al 2004 batt et al 2006 ternes et al 2007 schulz et al 2008 kormos et al 2011 muntau et al 2016 redeker et al 2018 transformation of iodinated x ray contrast agents typically does not result in mineralization of the parent compounds but involves the formation of numerous iodinated transformation products kalsch 1999 schulz et al 2008 kormos et al 2010 2011 only under anaerobic conditions deiodination was observed drewes et al 2001 schittko et al 2004 redeker et al 2018 schulz et al 2008 proposed a transformation pathway for the biological degradation of iopromide under oxic conditions identifying a total of 12 different iodinated transformation products tps fig 1 kormos et al 2011 categorized these 12 iopromide tps in three phases according to their appearance during complete transformation using controlled batch experiments iopromide tps of phase i tp 805 a tp 805 b tp 819 include tps which are formed in the beginning of the transformation degradation of phase i tps leads to the formation of phase ii intermediates tp 817 a tp 731 a tp 731 b tp 729 a tp 787 a which eventually are further transformed into more persistent phase iii tps tp 701 a tp 701 b tp 759 tp 643 further degradation of the final phase iii tp 643 under oxic conditions was not observed schulz et al 2008 muntau et al 2016 proposed monitoring the succeeding stages of tps during the oxic biodegradation of iopromide as defined by schulz et al 2008 and kormos et al 2011 as an approach for an in situ characterization of prevalent redox conditions during short term soil aquifer treatment following up on findings from scholz et al 2008 and muntau et al 2016 this study attempted to investigate the potential of using intermediates of the biological transformation of iopromide under oxic conditions for a more precise characterization of operational redox conditions in technical biofiltration systems applied as advanced biological treatment steps subsequent to conventional wastewater treatment in addition the influence of other operational and environmental parameters such as empty bed contact time and substrate availability on the step wise transformation of iopromide was investigated by introducing a novel dimensionless parameter tiop as a measure for the successive iopromide transformation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup biofiltration column studies were conducted using an experimental setup at pilot scale using filter columns as described by müller et al 2017 sequential biofiltration sbf trains were comprised of an anthracite column as first and a sand column as second stage filter oxygen was resupplied to the first stage filter effluent using an intermediate aeration basin fed with compressed air an additional anthracite filter was operated as a single stage biofilter fully nitrified tertiary effluent from the wwtp garching germany was fed to the filter trains using peristaltic pumps two backwashable filter columns a1 and a2 filter bed length l 1 m inner diameter id 0 15 m were filled with anthracite everzit n type ii evers gmbh germany grain sizes 1 4 2 5 mm and three columns s1 s2 s3 l 0 95 m id 0 10 m were operated using sand as filter material euroquarz gmbh germany grain sizes 0 2 1 0 mm sand filters were initially inoculated with 5 aquifer material from a riverbank filtration site to accelerate the establishment of biological activity in second stage filters in the beginning of the operation filter columns were operated for over 22 months under varying operational conditions prior to conducting the experiments presented in this study to assure the presence of sufficient iopromide in the tertiary effluent in line dosing of an aqueous stock solution 3 mg l was used to adjust a concentration of 30 μg l in the influent water using high precision peristaltic pumps although iopromide concentrations of more than 10 μg l in tertiary effluents were reported ternes and hirsch 2000 a concentration of 30 μg l must be considered exceptionally high spiking of iopromide however was inevitable to allow for the sufficient abundance of iopromide tps other investigated torcs were not spiked to the system but were present in the tertiary effluent 2 2 operational conditions investigations were carried out during two experimental campaigns elevated iopromide concentrations were adjusted four weeks before the start of the experimental campaigns to allow for system adaptation prior to sampling empty bed contact times ebcts in the column systems were held constant for over six months before the start of the first experimental campaign during the first experimental campaign three sbf systems were operated sbf systems consisted of a first filter stage a1 operated at an ebct of 90 min and 3 second stage filters operated in parallel at ebcts of 200 1 000 and 2 000 min s1 s2 s3 in addition column a2 was used as a single stage conventional biofilter as a reference to sbf system a1 s1 and operated at the same total ebct of 290 min during the second experimental campaign two sbf systems a1 s1 a1 s3 were used and operated at unchanged ebcts compared to the first experimental campaign to manipulate prevailing redox conditions in column s3 a hydrogen peroxide solution was added to the column influent via a high precision peristaltic pump thus assuming stoichiometric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to dissolved oxygen do with a ratio of 2 1 an additional 5 mg l do were supplied dilution due to dosing of hydrogen peroxide was less than 2 and considered negligible previous studies demonstrated that in the absence of uv irradiation no degradation of torcs or dissolved organic matter compounds due to chemical degradation caused by hydrogen peroxide alone occurred kitis and kaplan 2007 miklos et al 2018 detailed information on the system setup used during both experimental campaigns is given in the supplementary information figure si 1 2 3 sample collection and analysis liquid samples for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 torcs and iopromide tps were

concentrations for both experimental campaigns can be found in tables si 1 and si 2 2 3 2 analysis of iopromide transformation products all chemicals were lc ms grade labelled and analytical standards were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh or toronto research chemicals inc iopromide tps were isolated from batch experiments via semi preparative hplc schulz et al 2008 calibration samples were prepared in milli q water with an internal standard concentration of 10 μg l and an analyte concentration range from 0 1 to 100 μg l 1 ml of filtered column samples were spiked with internal standard iopromide d3 to 10 μg l recoveries were determined in spiked samples with concentrations of 10 and 100 μg l the analysis of iopromide and its tps was carried out by direct injection of 50 μl sample

followed definitions proposed by regnery et al 2015 and mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and were based on the measurement of do and nitrate columns characterized by effluent do concentrations above 1 mg l are defined as oxic do concentrations below 1 mg l with limited nitrate reduction 0 5 mg n l are defined as suboxic anoxic conditions are characterized by nitrate reduction exceeding 0 5 mg n l 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of redox conditions based on the conventional redox parameters dissolved oxygen and nitrate redox conditions during the first experimental campaign were revealed as oxic in most operated columns except for column s3 which was characterized by elevated do consumption and predominantly suboxic redox conditions anoxic redox conditions indicated by substantial reduction of nitrate were not observed data not shown do profiles in sbf systems a1 s1 and a1 s2 fig 2 c b exhibited rapid do consumption in first stage filter a1 δdo 4 1 0 2 mg l after reaeration limited and slower consumption was observed in second stage filters s1 and s2 δdo 2 1 0 1 and 4 7 0 3 mg l respectively despite substantially higher ebcts compared to column a1 for column s3 do concentrations below 1 mg l were found after an ebct of 715 min while complete do depletion δdo 8 0 0 2 mg l was observed after an ebct of 1500 min do concentrations 0 1 mg l fig 2 d single stage biofilter a2 ebct 290 min was characterized by elevated do consumption compared to filter a1 ebct 90 min while redox conditions in the column could still be characterized as oxic with do concentrations of 1 2 0 2 mg l in the filter effluent fig 2 a no difference was found in total do consumption in sbf system a1 s1 and reference column a2 δdo 6 2 0 2 and 6 2 0 4 mg l the second experimental campaign was characterized by substantially increased do consumption in the investigated column systems a1 s1 and a1 s3 fig 2e and f similar to the first experimental campaign reduction of nitrate was not observed average do concentrations indicated suboxic conditions at an ebct of 72 min in column a1 while a total do consumption of 7 7 0 2 mg l was observed columns s1 and s3 exhibited entirely oxic redox conditions while an increase of do consumption was found for column s1 δdo 3 4 0 1 mg l compared to the first sampling campaign assuming complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide a total of 8 9 1 9 mg l do were consumed in column s3 see section 2 1 it can be assumed that the addition of hydrogen peroxide prevented the establishment of suboxic zones in the deeper layers of column s3 3 2 removal of organic bulk parameters consumption of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc in the column systems was indicated by increasing do consumption and successive removal of the organic bulk parameters doc and uva254 concentrations of ammonia in the tertiary effluent below the limit of detection 0 015 mg nh4 n l and stable nitrate concentrations excluded nitrification as a relevant cause for do consumption data not shown profile sampling suggested high microbial activity in the top 10 cm of second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 indicated by disproportionate consumption of doc do fig 2 c b d and uva254 figure si 2 c b d though pronounced biological activity in the upper filter layers was also found for columns a1 and a2 a rather homogeneous consumption was observed in the deeper layers of filters a1 and a2 indicating the presence and degradation of bdoc in the entire column system it is assumed that frequent backwashing events in columns a1 and a2 are causing some degree of mixing of the filter material preventing distinct stratification of biological activity as observed in filters s1 s2 and s3 during the first experimental campaign the tertiary effluent was characterized by doc concentrations of 5 8 0 4 mg l n 5 and uva254 values of 10 5 0 2 1 m n 4 treatment by anthracite filters a1 and a2 resulted in removal of doc δdoc 1 2 0 1 and 1 4 0 3 mg l and uva254 δuva254 0 9 0 1 and 1 2 0 1 1 m figure si 3 slightly higher removal in column a2 can be explained by the threefold higher ebct compared to column a1 the comparison of reference column a2 with sbf system a1 s1 reveals slightly higher removal of doc and uva254 in the latter 1 6 0 4 mg l 1 4 0 1 1 m however no substantial difference in removal was observed which is supported by the comparable do consumption observed in both systems see section 3 1 higher ebcts in second stage filters of sbf systems a1 s2 and a1 s3 were found to increase the consumption of doc δdoc 2 0 0 3 and 2 2 0 5 mg l and uva254 δuva254 1 9 0 3 and 1 9 0 3 1 m figure si 3 despite additional bdoc removal in second stage filters especially at higher ebcts in s2 and s3 first stage filter a1 proved to allow for an effective removal of bdoc considering the comparably short ebct to calculate a simplified do mass balance a stoichiometric ratio of 1 mol o2 mole c is assumed 2 7 mg do mg doc for complete mineralization of doc do mass balances revealed elevated do consumption in all columns which could only partially be traced back to doc consumption thus elevated values were found for anthracite filters a1 and a2 3 9 0 6 and 5 0 0 8 mg do mg doc respectively n 5 and for sand filters s1 s2 and s3 4 1 1 4 6 1 1 8 and 8 1 3 4 mg do mg doc respectively n 5 the reason for the substantially elevated do consumption especially in columns s2 and s3 remained unclear feed water characteristics of the second experimental campaign varied strongly from those observed during the first sampling campaign with doc concentrations of 9 0 0 9 mg l n 4 and a uva254 of 15 8 0 8 1 m n 5 consequently removal of bdoc in a1 increased substantially compared to the first experimental campaign indicated by elevated consumption of doc and uva254 δdoc 3 4 1 2 mg l δuva254 2 2 0 1 1 m figure si 3 despite the high removal in column a1 increased consumption was also found in columns s1 and s3 resulting in higher overall bdoc consumption in systems a1 s1 δdoc 4 7 1 4 mg l δuva254 3 1 0 1 1 m and a1 s3 δdoc 5 2 1 4 mg l δuva254 4 4 0 4 1 m figure si 3 compared to the first experimental campaign do mass balances for columns a1 and s1 show higher accordance with the stoichiometric ratio 2 5 0 9 and 2 6 0 5 mg do mg doc respectively n 4 accounting for the additional do supply due to the dosing of hydrogen peroxide the do consumption in column s3 5 0 0 7 mg do mg doc n 4 was higher than the stoichiometric value differences in feed water characteristics during the first and second experimental campaign are underlined by changes in the specific uv absorbance suva during treatment figure si 3 slightly higher average suva values in tertiary effluent during the first experimental campaign 2 0 0 1 l mg m speak to a higher aromaticity of dissolved organic matter compared to the second experimental campaign 1 8 0 2 l mg m both n 4 only slight changes in suva were observed after treatment in sbf system a1 s1 during the first experimental campaign 2 3 0 3 l mg m whereas comparatively stronger changes were found during the second experimental campaign 3 1 0 3 l mg m pointing to preferred removal of aliphatic compounds 3 3 removal of trace organic chemicals torc removal during the first experimental campaign was investigated by monitoring a list of 54 indicator substances tables si 1 out of these 50 were present in the tertiary effluent with concentrations above 3 5 loq at least in three out of five sampling campaigns high persistence indicated by removal below 25 in all systems was found for 24 out of these 50 compounds which will not be further discussed a total of 26 compounds were considered susceptible to biodegradation indicated by removal above 25 in at least one of the investigated systems in general sorption must be considered a potential cause for the removal of compounds in granular media filters however studies on the degradation of torcs in biological filtration systems using anthracite and sand as filter materials reported negligible abiotic removal for most compounds bertelkamp et al 2014 rattier et al 2014 also results from a previous study using the experimental setup at hand did not point to sorption as a relevant cause for torc removal müller et al 2017 several studies however reported a strong affinity of triclosan to sorb onto soil and sediments especially when higher amounts of soil organic matter are present wu et al 2009 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2010 onesios and bouwer 2012 although elevated amounts of organic matter are not expected in the technical sand and anthracite used in the biofiltration columns a contribution of sorption to the removal of triclosan cannot be ruled out the removal of compounds in the reference column a2 and in sbf system a1 s1 operated at the same overall ebct of 290 min fig 3 confirms an improved degradation of some biodegradable substances during sbf e g benzotriazole gabapentin lactam gabapentin diphenhydramine metoprolol and mecoprop supporting results from a previous study müller et al 2017 however for several biodegradable compounds no substantial difference in removal efficiency was found between both systems e g acesulfame bezafibrate potentially higher removal of compounds during sbf is attributed to different operational conditions extensive degradation of bdoc aligned by do consumption in a single stage filter potentially leads to rapid do depletion resulting in suboxic or even anoxic zones while sbf systems allow for rather oligotrophic conditions and higher do concentrations in second stage filters the first experimental campaign however was characterized by the presence of low amounts of bdoc in the tertiary effluent used as feed water despite substantially higher do concentrations in sbf system a1 s1 redox conditions in a2 could still be characterized as oxic see section 3 1 thus the positive effect of the sbf approach on redox conditions might have been of minor importance during the first sampling campaign improved removal of some compounds in system a1 s1 might be explained by a potentially different microbial community in second stage filter s1 which adapted to stable oligotrophic conditions and was not disturbed by backwashing events improved removal of moderately degradable compounds under oligotrophic conditions by an adapted microbial community has been reported by several studies for similar systems li et al 2012 2013 2014 alidina et al 2014 the effect of increased ebcts on the removal of torcs in second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 revealed compound specific differences an improved removal at higher ebcts in second stage filters indicated the importance of kinetic effects for the degradation of some compounds e g metoprolol and telmisartan fig 3 other compounds exhibited rapid degradation and little to no differences were found by extending the retention time e g azithromycin this also accounts for compounds approaching threshold values above the loq such as benzotriazole here increased ebcts did not yield an improved removal during the second experimental campaign 11 compounds were monitored which were also analyzed during the first campaign out of these 11 compounds 8 were considered for further discussion excluding substances which exhibited high persistence or very low and unsteady concentrations in the tertiary effluent according to the procedure described above tables si 2 summarizes details on all compounds measured during the second experimental campaign of this study a comparison of the removal of 8 biodegradable compounds in systems a1 s1 and a1 s3 measured during both experimental campaigns revealed comparable and even slightly increased overall removal efficiencies during the second experimental campaign in system a1 s1 run at the same operational settings as before the manipulation of redox conditions in the second stage filter of system a1 s3 revealed no clear effect on torc removal although oxic conditions prevailed throughout the whole length of second stage column s3 no substantial changes in torc removal were observed see figure si 5 given the generally higher amounts of bdoc present during the second campaign however it is assumed that without the addition of hydrogen peroxide redox conditions in column s3 would have turned suboxic which potentially might have affected the removal of redox sensitive torcs the analysis of compounds in the first stage filter a1 exhibited higher removal during the second experimental campaign for most compounds in the case of benzotriazole removal in filter a1 increased from 26 during the first to 70 during the second experimental campaign despite substantially higher presence of bdoc during the second experimental campaign see section 3 2 the removal of some biodegradable torcs was comparable or even higher compared to the first campaign 3 4 transformation of iopromide this study attempts to link the transformation of iopromide and the occurrence of its tps in biofiltration systems to operational parameters such as ebct and operational conditions such as prevailing local redox conditions and substrate availability transformation of iopromide in the operated biofiltration systems was found to closely follow the pathway proposed by schulz et al 2008 fig 1 indicated by a molar mass balance closed up to 90 17 more detailed information on molar concentrations and recoveries for all sampling ports can be found in figures si 6 si 7 and tables si 6 while all identified tps were detected at different stages during the sampling campaigns with concentrations above the loq abundances of individual tps varied greatly assuming the determination of all relevant tps during the transformation of iopromide in the pathway proposed by schulz et al 2008 and an almost closed mass balance molar concentrations of iopromide and individual tps will be given as relative abundances in proportion to the sum of molar concentrations of iopromide and its 12 tps found in every sample following an approach proposed by engelhardt et al 2014 the relative abundance for a specific tp tp k is defined as 1 r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e t p k c t p k s a m p l e m o l k 0 12 c t p k s a m p l e m o l 100 here the concentration of iopromide in a sample is referred to as c tp 0 sample the transformation pathway of iopromide followed a similar pattern in all investigated column systems regarding the successive formation of tps the comparison of the iopromide transformation observed in this study and by schulz et al 2008 revealed differences in the abundances of several phase ii and phase iii tps schulz et al 2008 reported tp 731 a and tp 731 b to be major phase ii representatives whereas no substantial formation of both products was found during this study also major formation of phase iii representatives tp 701 b and tp 643 as found by schulz et al 2008 was not observed during this study fig 4 tables si 6 different experimental setups used in both studies might have caused the different tp abundances while experiments were conducted in biofiltration columns in this study at low iopromide concentrations schulz et al 2008 conducted batch experiments with soil from a wastewater irrigation site and substantially higher iopromide concentrations 1 g l rapid transformation of iopromide and its intermediates was observed in all column systems during both experimental campaigns investigations of iopromide transformation in the conventional single stage filter a2 and sbf system a1 s1 during the first experimental campaign revealed no distinct differences in the overall performance fig 4 despite a seemingly faster degradation of iopromide during the first stage filter a1 compared to filter a2 similar relative abundances were found for iopromide and its tps in the effluents of both systems after an overall ebct of 290 min during the second stage column s1 changes in gradients after the first 10 cm indicate slower transformation in the deeper layers of the column findings from columns s2 and s3 figure si 8 support the assumption of elevated transformation in the top layers of second stage filters in column s2 the upper 10 30 cm dominated the formation of phase ii and phase iii tps while slower but noticeable transformation was observed until the column outlet mainly due to transformation of remaining phase i tps column s3 exhibited an even more pronounced concentration of transformation reactions in the upper layers of the column here the passage through the first 10 cm resulted in a drastically changed distribution of iopromide intermediates with relative abundances of iopromide and phase i tps decreasing from over 70 to 10 and phase iii tps 759 and 701 a increasing from less than 10 to over 60 further transformation in the deeper filter layers was restricted to transformation of remaining phase i tps and phase ii tp 817 stable relative abundances of formed phase iii tps 759 and 701 a became noticeable in both columns s2 and s3 besides their persistence to further degradation also their formation seemed hindered in deeper filter layers and their relative abundances appeared to mostly depend on the formation during the passage through the top filter layers results from sbf systems a1 s1 and a1 s3 operated during the second experimental campaign revealed increased and more rapid iopromide transformation relative abundances of iopromide and phase i tps 19 phase ii tps 42 and phase iii tps 39 in the effluent of first stage filter a1 indicated a more advanced transformation compared to those observed during the first experimental campaign 72 21 and 6 respectively despite the presence of partly suboxic conditions in deeper filter layers due to substantially higher transformation already in column a1 the contribution of second stage columns s1 and s3 to the overall transformation is smaller than during the first experimental campaign however additional transformation was also observed here especially in column s3 as noted during the first experimental campaign major transformation occurred in top layers of columns s1 and s3 figure si 8 also after complete transformation of iopromide and phase i tps in s3 the distribution of phase ii and phase iii tps remained stable and rather similar to the one observed during the first sampling campaign except for second stage filter s3 during the first and deeper layers of first stage filter a1 during the second experimental campaign oxic conditions were present in all operated columns while no additional transformation of iopromide intermediates was observed in the deeper and suboxic layers of column s3 during the first experiment the same was observed in column s2 which was characterized by entirely oxic conditions in addition the manipulation of redox conditions to entirely oxic conditions in column s3 by adding hydrogen peroxide during the second experimental campaign also did not trigger additional transformation in deeper column layers more advanced transformation during the second experimental campaign as noted in system a1 s3 was also observed in system a1 s1 which was operated at the same operational conditions as during the first campaign redox conditions in the deeper zones of second stage filters seemed to have little impact on the overall transformation of iopromide no conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of suboxic or anoxic conditions in the top layers of the columns which were found to largely contribute to the overall transformation 3 5 transformation of iopromide and select torcs as a function of different operational parameters similar trends for do consumption and iopromide transformation were observed fig 4 figure si 8 as do consumption in the filtration systems is attributed to aerobic respiration during bdoc degradation it can be regarded as a proxy for microbial activity further investigations targeted potential correlations between iopromide transformation and parameters indicating microbial activity such as do consumption and the ebct the dimensionless parameter tiop was introduced to assess the degree of iopromide transformation in a sample based on the relative abundance of investigated iopromide tps to account for the transformation stage of a specific tp k dimensionless factors f k ranging from 0 to 6 were defined factors f k reflect the theoretical number of transformation steps necessary during the formation of a specific tp k from iopromide according to the pathway proposed by schulz et al 2008 while degradation steps within the proposed pathway are comprehensible the existence of instable intermediates cannot be ruled out such intermediates with potentially short half lifes or present only at very low concentrations are not accounted for in the proposed scheme the assignment of factors to specific tps according to the degree of transformation is illustrated in fig 1 tiop is defined as 2 t iop k 0 12 relative abundance t p k 100 f k potential tiop values range from a minimum of 0 when only iopromide is present in a sample to a maximum of 6 indicating complete transformation of iopromide and its tps into the final tp 643 for which no further biological transformation has been observed in previous studies schulz et al 2008 the results presented in fig 5 a illustrate iopromide transformation as tiop as a function of ebct in all operated systems during both experimental campaigns when compared to results obtained for relative abundances of different tps fig 4 tiop values appear suitable to illustrate successive iopromide transformation rapid iopromide transformation within the first 100 min is followed by declining transformation approaching maximum tiop values of 4 5 5 in column s3 samples an increased tiop gradient in column a1 during the second experimental campaign reflects faster transformation compared to the first experimental campaign also increased transformation in top layers of filters s1 s2 and s3 is mirrored in the tiop values tiop values from column a1 and the upper layers of second stage columns s1 s2 and s3 during the first experimental campaign suggest a linear correlation of tiop values and ebct in zones with elevated microbial activity positive correlations between tiop values and δdo also indicate an influence of the presence of sufficient bdoc and microbial activity on iopromide transformation until maximum tiop values of 4 5 5 are reached fig 5b after reaching this threshold level additional do consumption did not result in further increasing tiop values despite substantial differences in bdoc removal gradients of tiop δdo curves show high accordance during both experimental campaigns no noticeable difference was observed in sbf systems a1 s1 and single stage filter a2 underlining that sbf did not yield an improved transformation of iopromide when operated at the same ebct given the strong correlation between tiop and do consumption however higher transformation in an sbf system could be expected if higher amounts of bdoc were present causing oxygen depleted conditions to prevail in filter a2 and limit the overall bdoc consumption to investigate whether the strong linear correlation between the tiop and do consumption also applies to the initial transformation of iopromide and other compounds the removal of iopromide gabapentin metoprolol and benzotriazole was plotted as a function of δdo fig 6 the dashed lines indicate changes of tiop from fig 5b for comparison vast removal of gabapentin was observed in the systems during the first and second experimental campaign the removal of iopromide and gabapentin as a function of δdo was characterized by steep initial gradients indicating rapid transformation especially in anthracite filters a1 and a2 while almost complete transformation was observed for iopromide a threshold removal of around 90 was approached at higher δdo values for gabapentin uniform curve shapes indicated similar degradation mechanisms in the first and second filter stage higher removal of iopromide and gabapentin in filter a1 was found during the second experimental campaign suggesting beneficial effects of elevated bdoc concentrations on the removal a linear correlation between metoprolol removal and do consumption in anthracite filters a1 and a2 was found during the first and second experimental campaign increased removal of metoprolol in upper layers of second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 was indicated by an offset which was not observed for the initial transformation of iopromide and gabapentin or for the tiop metoprolol degradation was found to steadily increase in second stage filters with increasing ebcts during the first campaign whereas stagnating removal was observed during the second campaign in column s3 without achieving complete transformation of the parent compound differing slopes were found for metoprolol removal as a function of δdo in both campaigns while the overall removal in filters a1 and s1 was rather similar the transformation pattern for metoprolol as a function of δdo suggests an independence of general microbial activity indicated by do consumption in second stage columns s1 s2 and s3 increased removal in the upper layers of second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 was also observed for benzotriazole during the first experimental campaign here the increase in removal efficiency was even more pronounced benzotriazole removal in filter a1 was substantially higher during the second campaign with only minor contribution of second stage filter s1 to the overall removal suggesting the presence of increased amounts of bdoc had a beneficial effect on benzotriazole degradation in filter a1 less additional removal of benzotriazole in second stage filters s1 and s3 is likely due to the increased degradation in filter a1 with removal values close to those also observed as threshold removal values during the first experimental campaign the uniform shape of the curves for the tiop and the removal of iopromide and gabapentin as a function of δdo with no noticeable differences between filters a1 and a2 and filters s1 s2 and s3 suggests that both iopromide transformation over several transformation levels and gabapentin degradation depend on microbial activity which is directly related to do consumption removal of metoprolol and benzotriazole as a function of δdo revealed a different pattern especially during the first experimental campaign here changes in curve shapes implied that besides do consumption also other factors affected the degradation of these compounds this might be interpreted as a hint towards different removal mechanisms during the biodegradation of certain compounds while an elevated do consumption related to higher bdoc consumption during the second experimental campaign seems to have enhanced the transformation of iopromide gabapentin and benzotriazole no such dependence was found for metoprolol results obtained during this study demonstrate the complexity of mechanisms involved in the biotransformation of individual chemicals while transformation efficiencies for iopromide gabapentin and benzotriazole could be linked to do consumption no such effect was observed for the removal of metoprolol different transformation efficiencies for the compounds iopromide gabapentin metoprolol and benzotriazole are considered due to differences in the capability of the enzymatic system present to carry out the initial compound dependent transformation steps a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the initial transformation is needed to better understand the differences observed for the individual compounds hints on potential mechanisms involved in the degradation of individual compounds might be drawn from studies focused on the experimental identification of transformation products and from pathway prediction tools such as the eawag biodegradation biocatalysis database pathway prediction system eawag bbd pps ellis et al 2008 schulz et al 2008 proposed the oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups as initial transformation step in the oxic degradation of iopromide pathway prediction using the eawag bbd pps prediction supports these findings rules bt0001 and bt0003 henning et al 2018 reported gabapentin lactam to be the quantitatively most relevant transformation product of gabapentin under oxic conditions the transformation was described to involve an intramolecular amidation step huntscha et al 2014 reported hydroxyaromatic structures to be major transformation products formed during the initial transformation of benzotriazole the steps involved in the formation of the main transformation products found for gabapentin and metoprolol by henning et al 2018 and huntscha et al 2014 could not be retraced using the eawag bbd pps rubirola et al 2014 identified metoprolol acid as the dominant transformation product from the oxic degradation of metoprolol according to the eawag bbd pps the formation of metoprolol acid is initiated by the hydration of an ether group rule bt0023 in a side chain of the molecule followed by the oxidation of the formed primary alcohol and a carboxylation step rules bt0001 and bt0003 studies on the identification of biological transformation products and metabolic pathway prediction illustrate the variety of potential mechanisms contributing to the initial transformation of the investigated compounds iopromide gabapentin metoprolol and benzotriazole the variety of mechanisms involved in the initial transformation might have caused the different transformation patterns observed for the investigated compounds the reasons for the different transformation efficiencies and the dependence on factors such as the presence of bdoc however demand further investigation 4 conclusions this study aimed at investigating the potential of using the abundance of specific transformation products from the successive biological degradation of the x ray contrast medium iopromide to allow for a more sensitive characterization of redox conditions in oxic to suboxic biofiltration systems results presented in this study do not support a direct correlation between oxic and suboxic conditions and the degree of iopromide transformation or the abundance of specific iopromide transformation products a stagnation of the transformation process in the biofiltration systems was found to occur also under oxic conditions ruling out redox conditions to be the only dominant factor during the degradation a strong correlation between iopromide transformation and do consumption suggested co metabolic processes in the presence of sufficient bdoc as responsible for the biological degradation of iopromide differences in the dependence of the initial biological transformation of the compounds gabapentin benzotriazole and metoprolol on the do consumption pointed to compound specific degradation

19045,the biological degradation of many trace organic compounds has been reported to be strongly redox dependent the traditional characterization of redox conditions using the succession of inorganic electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen and nitrate falls short in accurately describing the critical transition state between oxic and suboxic conditions novel monitoring strategies using intrinsic redox tracers might be suitable to close that gap this study investigated the potential use of the successive biological transformation of the iodinated contrast medium iopromide as an intrinsic tracer of prevailing redox conditions in biofiltration systems iopromide degradation in biofiltration systems was monitored by quantifying twelve known biological transformation products formed under oxic conditions a novel dimensionless parameter tiop was introduced as a measure for the successive transformation of iopromide a strong correlation between the consumption of dissolved oxygen and iopromide transformation emphasized the importance of general microbial activity on iopromide degradation however results disproved a direct correlation between oxic 1 mg l o2 and suboxic 1 mg l o2 conditions and the degree of iopromide transformation results indicated that besides redox conditions also the availability of biodegradable organic substrate affects the degree of iopromide transformation similar behavior was found for the compounds gabapentin and benzotriazole while the oxic degradation of metoprolol remained stable under varying substrate conditions keywords

pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals and personal care products at low concentrations in various water bodies referred to as trace organic compounds torcs has been subject to numerous studies in the field of water research ternes 2007 benotti et al 2009 dong et al 2015 since their removal during conventional treatment is often limited effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered major point sources for the entry of torcs into the aquatic environment treatment processes like activated carbon adsorption or ozonation have been shown to serve as effective barriers for an improved removal or transformation of many of these compounds huber et al 2003 jekel et al 2013 recent studies also emphasize the potential of advanced transformation in biofiltration processes under optimized operational conditions regnery et al 2016 müller et al 2017 hellauer et al 2018 the transformation of torcs in biological systems has been shown to strongly depend on predominant redox conditions wiese et al 2011 regnery et al 2015 while few compounds were reported to be preferably degradable under reducing conditions wiese et al 2011 könig et al 2016 ghattas et al 2017 many studies have shown an improved removal of various moderately biodegradable torcs when oxic conditions prevail massmann et al 2008 baumgarten et al 2011 regnery et al 2015 regnery et al 2015 demonstrated the sensitivity of biological torc removal in biologically active porous media systems to slight changes in redox conditions where rate constants decreased significantly from oxic to suboxic and anoxic conditions traditional characterization of redox conditions in natural systems is based on monitoring the ecological succession of the inorganic electron acceptors dissolved oxygen nitrate sulfate manganese and iron mcmahon and chapelle 2008 while using this categorization allows to broadly characterize redox zonation in aquifer systems it might not be sensitive enough to accurately describe the transition state between oxic and suboxic conditions or prevalent conditions at the pore scale where biotransformation occurs in addition the determination of low dissolved oxygen concentrations is often challenging since oxygen free sampling is difficult muntau et al 2016 novel monitoring concepts might be more suitable to predict redox sensitive biodegradation of torcs in biofiltration systems iopromide a tri iodinated benzoic acid derivate used as a x ray contrast agent can be detected in many water bodies affected by the discharge of municipal wwtp effluents putschew et al 2000 ternes and hirsch 2000 kormos et al 2011 xu et al 2017 biological transformation of iopromide during conventional activated sludge treatment and in managed aquifer recharge systems such as riverbank

et al 2016 proposed monitoring the succeeding stages of tps during the oxic biodegradation of iopromide as defined by schulz et al 2008 and kormos et al 2011 as an approach for an in situ characterization of prevalent redox conditions during short term soil aquifer treatment following up on findings from scholz et al 2008 and muntau et al 2016 this study attempted to investigate the potential of using intermediates of the biological transformation of iopromide under oxic conditions for a more precise characterization of operational redox conditions in technical biofiltration systems applied as advanced biological treatment steps subsequent to conventional wastewater treatment in addition the influence of other operational and environmental parameters such as empty bed contact time and substrate availability on the step wise transformation of iopromide was investigated by introducing a novel dimensionless parameter tiop as a measure for the successive iopromide transformation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup biofiltration column studies were conducted using an experimental setup at pilot scale using filter columns as described by müller et al 2017 sequential biofiltration sbf trains were comprised of an anthracite column as first and a sand column as second stage filter oxygen was resupplied to the first stage filter effluent using an intermediate aeration basin fed with compressed air an additional anthracite filter was operated as a single stage biofilter fully nitrified tertiary effluent from the wwtp garching germany was fed to the filter trains using peristaltic pumps two backwashable filter columns a1 and a2 filter bed length l 1 m inner diameter id 0 15 m were filled with anthracite everzit n type ii evers gmbh germany grain sizes 1 4 2 5 mm and three columns s1 s2 s3 l 0 95 m id 0 10 m were operated using sand as filter material euroquarz gmbh germany grain sizes 0 2 1 0 mm sand filters were initially inoculated with 5 aquifer material from a riverbank filtration site to accelerate the establishment of biological activity in second stage filters in the beginning of the operation filter columns were operated for over 22 months under varying operational conditions prior to conducting the experiments presented in this study to assure the presence of sufficient iopromide in the tertiary effluent in line dosing of an aqueous stock solution 3 mg l was used to adjust a concentration of 30 μg l in the influent water using high precision peristaltic pumps although iopromide concentrations of more than 10 μg l in tertiary effluents were reported ternes and hirsch 2000 a concentration of 30 μg l must be considered exceptionally high spiking of iopromide however was inevitable to allow for the sufficient abundance of iopromide tps other investigated torcs were not spiked to the system but were present in the tertiary effluent 2 2 operational conditions investigations were carried out during two experimental campaigns elevated iopromide concentrations were adjusted four weeks before the start of the experimental campaigns to allow for system adaptation prior to sampling empty bed contact times ebcts in the column systems were held constant for over six months before the start of the first experimental campaign during the first experimental campaign three sbf systems were operated sbf systems consisted of a first filter stage a1 operated at an ebct of 90 min and 3 second stage filters operated in parallel at ebcts of 200 1 000 and 2 000 min s1 s2 s3 in addition column a2 was used as a single stage conventional biofilter as a reference to sbf system a1 s1 and operated at the same total ebct of 290 min during the second experimental campaign two sbf systems a1 s1 a1 s3 were used and operated at unchanged ebcts compared to the first experimental campaign to manipulate prevailing redox conditions in column s3 a hydrogen peroxide solution was added to the column influent via a high precision peristaltic pump thus assuming stoichiometric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to dissolved oxygen do with a ratio of 2 1 an additional 5 mg l do were supplied dilution due to dosing of hydrogen peroxide was less than 2 and considered negligible previous studies demonstrated that in the absence of uv irradiation no degradation of torcs or dissolved organic matter compounds due to chemical degradation caused by hydrogen peroxide alone occurred kitis and kaplan 2007 miklos et al 2018 detailed information on the system setup used during both experimental campaigns is given in the

followed definitions proposed by regnery et al 2015 and mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and were based on the measurement of do and nitrate columns characterized by effluent do concentrations above 1 mg l are defined as oxic do concentrations below 1 mg l with limited nitrate reduction 0 5 mg n l are defined as suboxic anoxic conditions are characterized by nitrate reduction exceeding 0 5 mg n l 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of redox conditions based on the conventional redox parameters dissolved oxygen and nitrate redox conditions during the first experimental campaign were revealed as oxic in most operated columns except for column s3 which was characterized by elevated do consumption and predominantly suboxic redox conditions anoxic redox conditions indicated by substantial reduction of nitrate were not observed data not shown do profiles in sbf systems a1 s1 and a1 s2 fig 2 c b exhibited rapid do consumption in first stage filter a1 δdo 4 1 0 2 mg l after reaeration limited and slower consumption was observed in second stage filters s1 and s2 δdo 2 1 0 1 and 4 7 0 3 mg l respectively despite substantially higher ebcts compared to column a1 for column s3 do concentrations below 1 mg l were found after an ebct of 715 min while complete do depletion δdo 8 0 0 2 mg l was observed after an ebct of 1500 min do concentrations 0 1 mg l fig 2 d single stage biofilter a2 ebct 290 min was characterized by elevated do consumption compared to filter a1 ebct 90 min while redox conditions in the column could still be characterized as oxic with do concentrations of 1 2 0 2 mg l in the filter effluent fig 2 a no difference was found in total do consumption in sbf system a1 s1 and reference column a2 δdo 6 2 0 2 and 6 2 0 4 mg l the second experimental campaign was characterized by substantially increased do consumption in the investigated column systems a1 s1 and a1 s3 fig 2e and f similar to the first experimental campaign reduction of nitrate was not observed average do concentrations indicated suboxic conditions at an ebct of 72 min in column a1 while a total do consumption of 7 7 0 2 mg l was observed columns s1 and s3 exhibited entirely oxic redox conditions while an increase of do consumption was found for column s1 δdo 3 4 0 1 mg l compared to the first sampling campaign assuming complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide a total of 8 9 1 9 mg l do were consumed in column s3 see section 2 1 it can be assumed that the addition of hydrogen peroxide prevented the establishment of suboxic zones in the deeper layers of column s3 3 2 removal of organic bulk parameters consumption of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc in the column systems was indicated by increasing do consumption and successive removal of the organic bulk parameters doc and uva254 concentrations of ammonia in the tertiary effluent below the limit of detection 0 015 mg nh4 n l and stable nitrate concentrations excluded nitrification as a relevant cause for do consumption data not shown profile sampling suggested high microbial activity in the top 10 cm of second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 indicated by disproportionate consumption of doc do fig 2 c b d and uva254 figure si 2 c b d though pronounced biological activity in the upper filter layers was also found for columns a1 and a2 a rather homogeneous consumption was observed in the deeper layers of filters a1 and a2 indicating the presence and degradation of bdoc in the entire column system it is assumed that frequent backwashing events in columns a1 and a2 are causing some degree of mixing of the filter material preventing distinct stratification of biological activity as observed in filters s1 s2 and s3 during the first experimental campaign the tertiary effluent was characterized by doc concentrations of 5 8 0 4 mg l n 5 and uva254 values of 10 5 0 2 1 m n 4 treatment by anthracite filters a1 and a2 resulted in removal of doc δdoc 1 2 0 1 and 1 4 0 3 mg l and uva254 δuva254 0 9 0 1 and 1 2 0 1 1 m figure si 3 slightly higher removal in column a2 can be explained by the threefold higher ebct compared to column a1 the comparison of reference column a2 with sbf system a1 s1 reveals slightly higher removal of doc and uva254 in the latter 1 6 0 4 mg l 1 4 0 1 1 m however no substantial difference in removal was observed which is supported by the comparable do consumption observed in both systems see section 3 1 higher ebcts in second stage filters of sbf systems a1 s2 and a1 s3 were found to increase the consumption of doc δdoc 2 0 0 3 and 2 2 0 5 mg l and uva254 δuva254 1 9 0 3 and 1 9 0 3 1 m figure si 3 despite additional bdoc removal in second stage filters especially at higher ebcts in s2 and s3 first stage filter a1 proved to allow for an effective removal of bdoc considering the comparably short ebct to calculate a simplified do mass balance a stoichiometric ratio of 1 mol o2 mole c is assumed 2 7 mg do mg doc for complete mineralization of doc do mass balances revealed elevated do consumption in all columns which could only partially be traced back to doc consumption thus elevated values were found for anthracite filters a1 and a2 3 9 0 6 and 5 0 0 8 mg do mg doc respectively n 5 and for sand filters s1 s2 and s3 4 1 1 4 6 1 1 8 and 8 1 3 4 mg do mg doc respectively n 5 the reason for the substantially elevated do consumption especially in columns s2 and s3 remained unclear feed water characteristics of the second experimental campaign varied strongly from those observed during the first sampling campaign with doc concentrations of 9 0 0 9 mg l n 4 and a uva254 of 15 8 0 8 1 m n 5 consequently removal of bdoc in a1 increased substantially compared to the first experimental campaign indicated by elevated consumption of doc and uva254 δdoc 3 4 1 2 mg l δuva254 2 2 0 1 1 m figure si 3 despite the high removal in column a1 increased consumption was also found in columns s1 and s3 resulting in higher overall bdoc consumption in systems a1 s1 δdoc 4 7 1 4 mg l δuva254 3 1 0 1 1 m and a1 s3 δdoc 5 2 1 4 mg l δuva254 4 4 0 4 1 m figure si 3 compared to the first experimental campaign do mass balances for columns a1 and s1 show higher accordance with the stoichiometric ratio 2 5 0 9 and 2 6 0 5 mg do mg doc respectively n 4 accounting for the additional do supply due to the dosing of hydrogen peroxide the do consumption in column s3 5 0 0 7 mg do mg doc n 4 was higher than the stoichiometric value differences in feed water characteristics during the first and second experimental campaign are underlined by changes in the specific uv absorbance suva during treatment figure si 3 slightly higher average suva values in tertiary effluent during the first experimental campaign 2 0 0 1 l mg m speak to a higher aromaticity of dissolved organic matter compared to the second experimental campaign 1 8 0 2 l mg m both n 4 only slight changes in suva were observed after treatment in sbf system a1 s1 during the first experimental campaign 2 3 0 3 l mg m whereas comparatively stronger changes were found during the second experimental campaign 3 1 0 3 l mg m pointing to preferred removal of aliphatic compounds 3 3 removal of trace organic chemicals torc removal during the first experimental campaign was investigated by monitoring a list of 54 indicator substances tables si 1 out of these 50 were present in the tertiary effluent with concentrations above 3 5 loq at least in three out of five sampling campaigns high persistence indicated by removal below 25 in all systems was found for 24 out of these 50 compounds which will not be further discussed a total of 26 compounds were considered susceptible to biodegradation indicated by removal above 25 in at least one of the investigated systems in general sorption must be considered a potential cause for the removal of compounds in granular media filters however studies on the degradation of torcs in biological filtration systems using anthracite and sand as filter materials reported negligible abiotic removal for most compounds bertelkamp et al 2014 rattier et al 2014 also results from a previous study using the experimental setup at hand did not point to sorption as a relevant cause for torc removal müller et al 2017 several studies however reported a strong affinity of triclosan to sorb onto soil and sediments especially when higher amounts of soil organic matter are present wu et al 2009 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2010 onesios and bouwer 2012 although elevated amounts of organic matter are not expected in the technical sand and anthracite used in the biofiltration columns a contribution of sorption to the removal of triclosan cannot be ruled out the removal of compounds in the reference column a2 and in sbf system a1 s1 operated at the same overall ebct of 290 min fig 3 confirms an improved degradation of some biodegradable substances during sbf e g benzotriazole gabapentin lactam gabapentin diphenhydramine metoprolol and mecoprop supporting results from a previous study müller et al 2017 however for several biodegradable compounds no substantial difference in removal efficiency was found between both systems e g acesulfame bezafibrate potentially higher removal of compounds during sbf is attributed to different operational conditions extensive degradation of bdoc aligned by do consumption in a single stage filter potentially leads to rapid do depletion resulting in suboxic or even anoxic zones while sbf systems allow for rather oligotrophic conditions and higher do concentrations in second stage filters the first experimental campaign however was characterized by the presence of low amounts of bdoc in the tertiary effluent used as feed water despite substantially higher do concentrations in sbf system a1 s1 redox conditions in a2 could still be characterized as oxic see section 3 1 thus the positive effect of the sbf approach on redox conditions might have been of minor importance during the first sampling campaign improved removal of some compounds in system a1 s1 might be explained by a potentially different microbial community in second stage filter s1 which adapted to stable oligotrophic conditions and was not disturbed by backwashing events improved removal of moderately degradable compounds under oligotrophic conditions by an adapted microbial community has been reported by several studies for similar systems li et al 2012 2013 2014 alidina et al 2014 the effect of increased ebcts on the removal of torcs in second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 revealed compound specific differences an improved removal at higher ebcts in second stage filters indicated the importance of kinetic effects for the degradation of some compounds e g metoprolol and telmisartan fig 3 other compounds exhibited rapid degradation and little to no differences were found by extending the retention time e g azithromycin this also accounts for compounds approaching threshold values above the loq such as benzotriazole here increased ebcts did not yield an improved removal during the second experimental campaign 11 compounds were monitored which were also analyzed during the first campaign out of these 11 compounds 8 were considered for further discussion excluding substances which exhibited high persistence or very low and unsteady concentrations in the tertiary effluent according to the procedure described above tables si 2 summarizes details on all compounds measured during the second experimental campaign of this study a comparison of the removal of 8 biodegradable compounds in systems a1 s1 and a1 s3 measured during both experimental campaigns revealed comparable and even slightly increased overall removal efficiencies during the second experimental campaign in system a1 s1 run at the same operational settings as before the manipulation of redox conditions in the second stage filter of system a1 s3 revealed no clear effect on torc removal although oxic conditions prevailed throughout the whole length of second stage column s3 no substantial changes in torc removal were observed see figure si 5 given the generally higher amounts of bdoc present during the second campaign however it is assumed that without the addition of hydrogen peroxide redox conditions in column s3 would have turned suboxic which potentially might have affected the removal of redox sensitive torcs the analysis of compounds in the first stage filter a1 exhibited higher removal during the second experimental campaign for most compounds in the case of benzotriazole removal in filter a1 increased from 26 during the first to 70 during the second experimental campaign despite substantially higher presence of bdoc during the second experimental campaign see section 3 2 the removal of some biodegradable torcs was comparable or even higher compared to the first campaign 3 4 transformation of iopromide this study attempts to link the transformation of iopromide and the occurrence of its tps in biofiltration systems to operational parameters such as ebct and operational conditions such as prevailing local redox conditions and substrate availability transformation of iopromide in the operated biofiltration systems was found to closely follow the pathway proposed by schulz et al 2008 fig 1 indicated by a molar mass balance closed up to 90 17 more detailed information on molar concentrations and recoveries for all sampling ports can be found in figures si 6 si 7 and tables si 6 while all identified tps were detected at different stages during the sampling campaigns with concentrations above the loq abundances of individual tps varied greatly assuming the determination of all relevant tps during the transformation of iopromide in the pathway proposed by schulz et al 2008 and an almost closed mass balance molar concentrations of iopromide and individual tps will be given as relative abundances in proportion to the sum of molar concentrations of iopromide and its 12 tps found in every sample following an approach proposed by engelhardt et al 2014 the relative abundance for a specific tp tp k is defined as 1 r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e t p k c t p k s a m p l e m o l k 0 12 c t p k s a m p l e m o l 100 here the concentration of iopromide in a sample is referred to as c tp 0 sample the transformation pathway of iopromide followed a similar pattern in all investigated column systems regarding the successive formation of tps the comparison of the iopromide transformation observed in this study and by schulz et al 2008 revealed differences in the abundances of several phase ii and phase iii tps schulz et al 2008 reported tp 731 a and tp 731 b to be major phase ii representatives whereas no substantial formation of both products was found during this study also major formation of phase iii representatives tp 701 b and tp 643 as found by schulz et al 2008 was not observed during this study fig 4 tables si 6 different experimental setups used in both studies might have caused the different tp abundances while experiments were conducted in biofiltration columns in this study at low iopromide concentrations schulz et al 2008 conducted batch experiments with soil from a wastewater irrigation site and substantially higher iopromide concentrations 1 g l rapid transformation of iopromide and its intermediates was observed in all column systems during both experimental campaigns investigations of iopromide transformation in the conventional single stage filter a2 and sbf system a1 s1 during the first experimental campaign revealed no distinct differences in the overall performance fig 4 despite a seemingly faster degradation of iopromide during the first stage filter a1 compared to filter a2 similar relative abundances were found for iopromide and its tps in the effluents of both systems after an overall ebct of 290 min during the second stage column s1 changes in gradients after the first 10 cm indicate slower transformation in the deeper layers of the column findings from columns s2 and s3 figure si 8 support the assumption of elevated transformation in the top layers of second stage filters in column s2 the upper 10 30 cm dominated the formation of phase ii and phase iii tps while slower but noticeable transformation was observed until the column outlet mainly due to transformation of remaining phase i tps column s3 exhibited an even more pronounced concentration of transformation reactions in the upper layers of the column here the passage through the first 10 cm resulted in a drastically changed distribution of iopromide intermediates with relative abundances of iopromide and phase i tps decreasing from over 70 to 10 and phase iii tps 759 and 701 a increasing from less than 10 to over 60 further transformation in the deeper filter layers was restricted to transformation of remaining phase i tps and phase ii tp 817 stable relative abundances of formed phase iii tps 759 and 701 a became noticeable in both columns s2 and s3 besides their persistence to further degradation also their formation seemed hindered in deeper filter layers and their relative abundances appeared to mostly depend on the formation during the passage through the top filter layers results from sbf systems a1 s1 and a1 s3 operated during the second experimental campaign revealed increased and more rapid iopromide transformation relative abundances of iopromide and phase i tps 19 phase ii tps 42 and phase iii tps 39 in the effluent of first stage filter a1 indicated a more advanced transformation compared to those observed during the first experimental campaign 72 21 and 6 respectively despite the presence of partly suboxic conditions in deeper filter layers due to substantially higher transformation already in column a1 the contribution of second stage columns s1 and s3 to the overall transformation is smaller than during the first experimental campaign however additional transformation was also observed here especially in column s3 as noted during the first experimental campaign major transformation occurred in top layers of columns s1 and s3 figure si 8 also after complete transformation of iopromide and phase i tps in s3 the distribution of phase ii and phase iii tps remained stable and rather similar to the one observed during the first sampling campaign except for second stage filter s3 during the first and deeper layers of first stage filter a1 during the second experimental campaign oxic conditions were present in all operated columns while no additional transformation of iopromide intermediates was observed in the deeper and suboxic layers of column s3 during the first experiment the same was observed in column s2 which was characterized by entirely oxic conditions in addition the manipulation of redox conditions to entirely oxic conditions in column s3 by adding hydrogen peroxide during the second experimental campaign also did not trigger additional transformation in deeper column layers more advanced transformation during the second experimental campaign as noted in system a1 s3 was also observed in system a1 s1 which was operated at the same operational conditions as during the first campaign redox conditions in the deeper zones of second stage filters seemed to have little impact on the overall transformation of iopromide no conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of suboxic or anoxic conditions in the top layers of the columns which were found to largely contribute to the overall transformation 3 5 transformation of iopromide and select torcs as a function of different operational parameters similar trends for do consumption and iopromide transformation were observed fig 4 figure si 8 as do consumption in the filtration systems is attributed to aerobic respiration during bdoc degradation it can be regarded as a proxy for microbial activity further investigations targeted potential correlations between iopromide transformation and parameters indicating microbial activity such as do consumption and the ebct the dimensionless parameter tiop was introduced to assess the degree of iopromide transformation in a sample based on the relative abundance of investigated iopromide tps to account for the transformation stage of a specific tp k dimensionless factors f k ranging from 0 to 6 were defined factors f k reflect the theoretical number of transformation steps necessary during the formation of a specific tp k from iopromide according to the pathway proposed by schulz et al 2008 while degradation steps within the proposed pathway are comprehensible the existence of instable intermediates cannot be ruled out such intermediates with potentially short half lifes or present only at very low concentrations are not accounted for in the proposed scheme the assignment of factors to specific tps according to the degree of transformation is illustrated in fig 1 tiop is defined as 2 t iop k 0 12 relative abundance t p k 100 f k potential tiop values range from a minimum of 0 when only iopromide is present in a sample to a maximum of 6 indicating complete transformation of iopromide and its tps into the final tp 643 for which no further biological transformation has been observed in previous studies schulz et al 2008 the results presented in fig 5 a illustrate iopromide transformation as tiop as a function of ebct in all operated systems during both experimental campaigns when compared to results obtained for relative abundances of different tps fig 4 tiop values appear suitable to illustrate successive iopromide transformation rapid iopromide transformation within the first 100 min is followed by declining transformation approaching maximum tiop values of 4 5 5 in column s3 samples an increased tiop gradient in column a1 during the second experimental campaign reflects faster transformation compared to the first experimental campaign also increased transformation in top layers of filters s1 s2 and s3 is mirrored in the tiop values tiop values from column a1 and the upper layers of second stage columns s1 s2 and s3 during the first experimental campaign suggest a linear correlation of tiop values and ebct in zones with elevated microbial activity positive correlations between tiop values and δdo also indicate an influence of the presence of sufficient bdoc and microbial activity on iopromide transformation until maximum tiop values of 4 5 5 are reached fig 5b after reaching this threshold level additional do consumption did not result in further increasing tiop values despite substantial differences in bdoc removal gradients of tiop δdo curves show high accordance during both experimental campaigns no noticeable difference was observed in sbf systems a1 s1 and single stage filter a2 underlining that sbf did not yield an improved transformation of iopromide when operated at the same ebct given the strong correlation between tiop and do consumption however higher transformation in an sbf system could be expected if higher amounts of bdoc were present causing oxygen depleted conditions to prevail in filter a2 and limit the overall bdoc consumption to investigate whether the strong linear correlation between the tiop and do consumption also applies to the initial transformation of iopromide and other compounds the removal of iopromide gabapentin metoprolol and benzotriazole was plotted as a function of δdo fig 6 the dashed lines indicate changes of tiop from fig 5b for comparison vast removal of gabapentin was observed in the systems during the first and second experimental campaign the removal of iopromide and gabapentin as a function of δdo was characterized by steep initial gradients indicating rapid transformation especially in anthracite filters a1 and a2 while almost complete transformation was observed for iopromide a threshold removal of around 90 was approached at higher δdo values for gabapentin uniform curve shapes indicated similar degradation mechanisms in the first and second filter stage higher removal of iopromide and gabapentin in filter a1 was found during the second experimental campaign suggesting beneficial effects of elevated bdoc concentrations on the removal a linear correlation between metoprolol removal and do consumption in anthracite filters a1 and a2 was found during the first and second experimental campaign increased removal of metoprolol in upper layers of second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 was indicated by an offset which was not observed for the initial transformation of iopromide and gabapentin or for the tiop metoprolol degradation was found to steadily increase in second stage filters with increasing ebcts during the first campaign whereas stagnating removal was observed during the second campaign in column s3 without achieving complete transformation of the parent compound differing slopes were found for metoprolol removal as a function of δdo in both campaigns while the overall removal in filters a1 and s1 was rather similar the transformation pattern for metoprolol as a function of δdo suggests an independence of general microbial activity indicated by do consumption in second stage columns s1 s2 and s3 increased removal in the upper layers of second stage filters s1 s2 and s3 was also observed for benzotriazole during the first experimental campaign here the increase in removal efficiency was even more pronounced benzotriazole removal in filter a1 was substantially higher during the second campaign with only minor contribution of second stage filter s1 to the overall removal suggesting the presence of increased amounts of bdoc had a beneficial effect on benzotriazole degradation in filter a1 less additional removal of benzotriazole in second stage filters s1 and s3 is likely due to the increased degradation in filter a1 with removal values close to those also observed as threshold removal values during the first experimental campaign the uniform shape of the curves for the tiop and the removal of iopromide and gabapentin as a function of δdo with no noticeable differences between filters a1 and a2 and filters s1 s2 and s3 suggests that both iopromide transformation over several transformation levels and gabapentin degradation depend on microbial activity which is directly related to do consumption removal of metoprolol and benzotriazole as a function of δdo revealed a different pattern especially during the first experimental campaign here changes in curve shapes implied that besides do consumption also other factors affected the degradation of these compounds this might be interpreted as a hint towards different removal mechanisms during the biodegradation of certain compounds while an elevated do consumption related to higher bdoc consumption during the second experimental campaign seems to have enhanced the transformation of iopromide gabapentin and benzotriazole no such dependence was found for metoprolol results obtained during this study demonstrate the complexity of mechanisms involved in the biotransformation of individual chemicals while transformation efficiencies for iopromide gabapentin and benzotriazole could be linked to do consumption no such effect was observed for the removal of metoprolol different transformation efficiencies for the compounds iopromide gabapentin metoprolol and benzotriazole are considered due to differences in the capability of the enzymatic system present to carry out the initial compound dependent transformation steps a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the initial transformation is needed to better understand the differences observed for the individual compounds hints on potential mechanisms involved in the degradation of individual compounds might be drawn from studies focused on the experimental identification of transformation products and from pathway prediction tools such as the eawag biodegradation biocatalysis database pathway prediction system eawag bbd pps ellis et al 2008 schulz et al 2008 proposed the oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups as initial transformation step in the oxic degradation of iopromide pathway prediction using the eawag bbd pps prediction supports these findings rules bt0001 and bt0003 henning et al 2018 reported gabapentin lactam to be the quantitatively most relevant transformation product of gabapentin under oxic conditions the transformation was described to involve an intramolecular amidation step huntscha et al 2014 reported hydroxyaromatic structures to be major transformation products formed during the initial transformation of benzotriazole the steps involved in the formation of the main transformation products found for gabapentin and metoprolol by henning et al 2018 and huntscha et al 2014 could not be retraced using the eawag bbd pps rubirola et al 2014 identified metoprolol acid as the dominant transformation product from the oxic degradation of metoprolol according to the eawag bbd pps the formation of metoprolol acid is initiated by the hydration of an ether group rule bt0023 in a side chain of the molecule followed by the oxidation of the formed primary alcohol and a carboxylation step rules bt0001 and bt0003 studies on the identification of biological transformation products and metabolic pathway prediction illustrate the variety of potential mechanisms contributing to the initial transformation of the investigated compounds iopromide gabapentin metoprolol and benzotriazole the variety of mechanisms involved in the initial transformation might have caused the different transformation patterns observed for the investigated compounds the reasons for the different transformation efficiencies and the dependence on factors such as the presence of bdoc however demand further investigation 4 conclusions this study aimed at investigating the potential of using the abundance of specific transformation products from the successive biological degradation of the x ray contrast medium iopromide to allow for a more sensitive characterization of redox conditions in oxic to suboxic biofiltration systems results presented in this study do not support a direct correlation between oxic and suboxic conditions and the degree of iopromide transformation or the abundance of specific iopromide transformation products a stagnation of the transformation process in the biofiltration systems was found to occur also under oxic conditions ruling out redox conditions to be the only dominant factor during the degradation a strong correlation between iopromide transformation and do consumption suggested co metabolic processes in the presence of sufficient bdoc as responsible for the biological degradation of iopromide differences in the dependence of the initial biological transformation of the compounds gabapentin benzotriazole and metoprolol on the do consumption pointed to compound specific degradation

19046,microbial biofilms can be both cause and cure to a range of emerging societal problems including antimicrobial tolerance water sanitation water scarcity and pollution the identities of extracellular polymeric substances eps responsible for the establishment and function of biofilms are poorly understood the lack of information on the chemical and physical identities of eps limits the potential to rationally engineer biofilm processes and impedes progress within the water and wastewater sector towards a circular economy and resource recovery here a multidisciplinary roadmap for addressing this eps identity crisis is proposed this involves improved eps extraction and characterization methodologies cross referencing between model biofilms and full scale biofilm systems and functional description of isolated eps with in situ techniques e g microscopy coupled with genomics proteomics and glycomics the current extraction and spectrophotometric characterization methods often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells should be critically assessed and more comprehensive methods for recovery and characterization of eps need to be developed graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilms extracellular polymeric substances function analysis biophysics identity 1 introduction often described in a cursory manner as the slime the extracellular polymeric substances eps are key to the formation persistence and physicochemical behavior of microbial biofilms across clinical environmental and industrial settings seviour et al 2012b moreover increased tolerance to antimicrobials is the result of the ability of certain pathogens to produce eps which hence constitutes a global threat to the consequences of multidrug resistance frieri et al 2017 eps also play significant roles in the successful implementation of water reclamation and purification technologies that have arisen to meet increasing demands for water of different purities water scarcity predicted by the united nations to be the biggest global problem in the coming decade land shortage and the water energy nexus eps provide structure for anaerobic and aerobic granular sludges which have emerged over the last thirty years along with activated sludge and fixed biofilm systems i e trickling filters as alternatives for biological treatment of industrial and domestic used waters with lower land and energy footprints bengtsson et al 2018 advances in membrane technologies have made it possible to create drinking water either from sources that were previously considered not available for drinking water production i e brackish water seawater or wastewater le and nunes 2016 or without the addition of chemical disinfectants derlon et al 2012 madaeni 1999 however the hydraulic throughput of these technologies is often limited by membrane fouling which in many instances is due to biofilm growth biofilms therefore feature prominently in many of the challenges facing water technology implementations as the number of antimicrobial resistant strains increases and the range of water reclamation and purification technologies grows so too does the need to control or predict eps production yet despite decades of research we know very little about the molecular composition and function assigned to individual eps components and we are not in a position to control the formation and composition with any meaningful predictable outcome this limits our ability to manage biofilms effectively we need to enhance our efforts to deliver improved analytical methods and unravel biochemical production pathways and most importantly discontinue the use of methods that misrepresent the roles and significance of eps the current practice of dismissing eps or relegating them to merely a perfunctory study as a footnote in process optimization should be abandoned it is essential to identify and reveal how eps composition determines the microscopic and macroscopic behavior of biofilm systems we propose that identifying functional biofilm eps is the critical path to address key questions in biofilm control this will not be possible if we persist with the current practice of applying general superficial and correlative characterizations alone however prior to suggesting a roadmap for achieving an in depth understanding of eps it is first necessary to explain why so little progress has been made in identifying and characterizing extracellular polymers present in biofilms 2 the extracellular matrix the eps of biofilms are a complex mixture of interlaced biological polymers they provide mechanical stability and scaffolds that allow biofilm cells to establish synergistic microconsortia enhance water retention and nutrient sorption provide protection against viruses predation antimicrobials and disinfectants and ultimately act as nutrient recycling yards flemming and wingender 2010 these functions can be provided by a large variety of biopolymers particularly polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids eps compounds originate from different community members and a specific organism can produce different polymers as a function of time or condition moreover eps produced by a given microbial population can persist long after the population producing it has disappeared all of these different components contribute to the function and organization of the matrix additionally many of the biopolymers produced by the cells are processed by extracellular enzymes embedded in the extracellular matrix whitfield et al 2015 it is currently not possible to track the production of specific eps components over time or attribute them to the specific host organism in mixed species biofilm communities nor do we have the means to effectively manipulate eps quantity or composition a better understanding of the eps would derive from metabolic labelling approaches liang et al 2017 for example eps biosynthesis compounds could be tracked to identify the organisms producing them when and where they are released and their fate over time this could be monitored in real time using state of the art laser microscopes and nanoscopes to generate high resolution three dimensional image data sets limitations in our current understanding of the eps however render such methodologies presently beyond our reach structural and functional assignment of key biofilm eps is confounded by their compositional complexity but also by the challenges in processing and isolating eps components the diversity of biofilm eps is described in fig 1 in terms of the number of types of molecules observed across a range of biofilms i e rather than in any single biofilm see box 1 for a description of each eps biofilms and many of the eps described in fig 1 are poorly soluble in aqueous systems unless methods are developed to extract the entire spectrum of biofilm eps our understanding of eps will be skewed by solubility and characterization biases mechanical and chemical methods have been applied for eps extraction from these biofilms with the objective of maximizing extraction yield and minimizing cell lysis ras et al 2011 in most cases these methods have not been verified to assess whether they extract the structural polymers from the biofilms while potentially effective on some biofilms these extraction protocols are often only partially or marginally effective which results in the characterization of eps that are not important for the biofilm structure felz et al 2016 this is particularly the case for stratified and dense aggregates such as fixed biofilms or granular sludge 3 a solution for the insoluble the range of techniques required to extract and solubilize known biopolymers such as the polysaccharides cellulose chitin and alginate examples of neutral cationic and anionic polysaccharides respectively highlights the need for even harsh extraction methods i e non aqueous extreme ph or temperature zhang et al 2017 combinations of mechanical pre treatments grinding ultrasonication homogenizers acidification demineralization enzymatic hydrolyses alkalinization for deproteination or deprotonation novel solvents like ionic liquids and heat treatments are typically invoked in order to extract such polysaccharides kumari and rath 2014 seviour et al 2015b younes and rinaudo 2015 while cytosolic protein extraction is possible through cell lysis the task is far more problematic for structural proteins these are often large julio and cotter 2005 and or have a tendency to fibrillate whereby alkalization or acidification may be required to solubilize them often in conjunction with enzymatic treatments le et al 2016 given the analytical challenges of identifying and characterizing functional eps of biofilm assemblages we should sometimes be prepared to apply methods that damage cells rather than prioritizing cell integrity felz et al 2016 in order to resolve the contributions of a broader range of key extracellular polymers this approach would then include the subsequent step of retrospectively identifying whether extracted polymers are extracellular as accomplished by microscopic techniques neu and lawrence 2014 wagner et al 2009 the target extracellular polymers can be recovered from solution by fractional precipitation e g using anti solvent addition or ph neutralization and purified further by for example electrophoretic or chromatographic techniques seviour et al 2010a complementary biophysical assays can then be undertaken on biofilm and isolates to elucidate function seviour et al 2015a detailed structural and functional characterization of novel relevant extracellular polymers requires significant quantities of a sufficiently pure compound which is a common and often insurmountable hurdle to achieve the ultimate goal of resolving more precisely the identity of key extracellular polymers 4 do the same extracellular polymers provide the same functions across systems despite the complexity and diversity of eps in multi species biofilms we assume that particular roles performed by eps are conserved across biofilms e g gel formation and adhesion lin et al 2013 the more information we acquire on the mechanical biophysical and structural aspects of the extracellular polymers contributing to these functions the easier it will be to identify and monitor their expression this could involve information derived from metaproteomic analysis specific labelling of functional groups in polymers e g by lectins and observation by microscopy neu and kuhlicke 2017 or quantifying polymers with greater accuracy the list of reference polymers is limited to those isolated from a relatively small number of models often clinical organisms e g escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa colvin et al 2012 marvasi et al 2010 these bacteria are uncommon in biofilms found in water treatment biofilms and their polymers are unlikely to be representative of biofilm eps in water treatment systems another approach for understanding whether eps perform common functions across different biofilm system currently neglected in eps research could be to screen interactions between eps and known glycan binding proteins in order to infer function and identity i e glycomics cummings and pierce 2014 lipke 2016 this would create a database for eps comparison identification of new sugar binding proteins for visualization of novel sugars and potentially facilitate the identification and analysis of glycoproteins 5 agreeing on model biofilms for eps characterization full scale biological systems in the water sector are often represented by highly diverse microbial communities saunders et al 2016 we would expect the eps to be similarly complex at a molecular level hence full scale systems may not be the ideal starting point for isolating and characterizing reference polymers we should therefore improve the resolution of characterization of eps from biofilms comprising organisms known to contribute to key water and wastewater biofilm functions such as nitrification enhanced biological phosphate removal floc and filament formation and the anammox process the microbial community composition of model systems can be tracked and compared to full scale systems biomass samples from these model systems should be made broadly available to the water sector and act as a common reference point for initial eps characterization there are a few examples of eps isolated from bacteria found in biofilms related to wastewater treatment including granulan seviour et al 2012a alginate like exopolysaccharide ale lin et al 2010 acid soluble polysugars pronk et al 2017 and glycosylated proteins lin et al 2018 however we still need to understand how widespread these eps are in biofilms as well as identify new extracellular polymers from other key systems to expand our database of identified characterized and relevant eps 6 sequencing approaches for eps characterization the application of next generation dna sequencing methods in conjunction with bioinformatic analyses may allow for the identification of signature extracellular polymers across a vast number of environmental biofilms and to elucidate their regulation metagenome assembled genomes mags representing individual community species can be described relatively inexpensively albertsen et al 2013 and when coupled with long read sequencing technologies such as pacbio and nanopore sequencing closed genomes from mixed communities can be constructed hao et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2017 mags provide blueprints for the proteins enzymes transporter and chaperones that are involved in the biogenesis of all cellular components and eps in the case of proteinaceous eps mags provide the exact recipe for how to synthesize them genetically encoded systems for eps biogenesis can be predicted by bioinformatic approaches such as genome annotation and pathway modeling however eps identified purely through bioinformatics and molecular methods remain theoretical extracellular polymers only hence validation through biophysical and chemical characterization of isolated reference compounds will be required sequencing and molecular techniques can enable recombinant model systems to be designed to produce extracellular proteins for chemical and biophysical characterization where the proposed extracellular proteins are expressed and isolated from bacteria with little or no biofilm production as is the case for common laboratory strains of e coli and b subtilis dueholm et al 2010 such proteins can even be used to generate antibodies that can be applied for in situ analyses furthermore identifying the genetic blueprints for the synthesis of reference polymers would allow us to identify related systems by homology searches dueholm et al 2012 and employ transcriptomics to determine how such genes are regulated in response to environmental factors liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms could confirm that theoretical extracellular proteins are expressed in complex samples cox et al 2014 lc ms ms may also provide information on chemical modifications which could be relevant for their functions however while methods for high throughput protein identification are well established the same advances have not been achieved for extracellular polysaccharide analysis due to the structural diversity of carbohydrates wang et al 2017 zhao and jensen 2009 furthermore the reliability of current methods e g for polysaccharide quantification by colorimetric methods is impaired by other chromogenic compounds i e interference and non representative reference sugars le and stuckey 2016 7 in situ approaches have an important role to play new and combined imaging techniques offer the opportunity to link the production of specific eps components with specific bacterial groups in situ as well as validate whether the isolated polymers are indeed extracellular imaging provides a link between genomic information and how the eps are distributed throughout the biofilm i e with regards to location whereby changes in microbial cells and matrix composition can be monitored over time and together with changes in environmental parameters advanced imaging techniques can be combined with increasingly sophisticated computational analyses to describe microbial behavior quantitatively with greater precision neu et al 2010 laser scanning microscopy coupled with fluorescent staining has proven to be the most flexible approach for imaging biofilm eps neu and lawrence 2014 key fluorescence approaches include selective fluorogenic staining e g toto 1 for dna okshevsky and meyer 2014 nilered for lipids rumin et al 2015 sypro nanoorange and epicocconone for proteins randrianjatovo et al 2015 zubkov et al 1999 lectins for analysis of eps glycoconjugates neu and kuhlicke 2017 and eps specific antibodies e g wo1 for amyloid proteins poul et al 2007 by combining eps microscopy with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish eps production can potentially be linked to specific bacterial taxa bennke et al 2013 tawakoli et al 2017 finally chemical imaging could become a key tool for analyzing complex microbial communities and bridging isolation and in situ characterization studies particularly relevant techniques include ftir imaging raman microscopy nanosims and tof sims as well as synchrotron based imaging such as stxm although some problems still need to be addressed such as correlated imaging suitable mounting and probes and scale of observation covered area and depth gowen et al 2015 lawrence et al 2003 marshall et al 2014 8 can eps recovery help us to move towards a circular economy a better understanding of the eps matrix will lead to improved strategies for both resource recovery and biofilm management in water and wastewater treatment systems the growing interest in renewable resources highlights a focus on the production of eps from waste biomass and their conversion into bioproducts and biomaterials as an appealing route for contributing to a reduced economic dependence on fossil fuels more et al 2016 and enhanced sustainability and economics of wastewater treatment lin et al 2015 eps like polymers hydrocolloids cannot in general be derived from oil based chemicals and hence supply relies solely on natural resources wastewater derived hydrocolloids could be an important new supply route a better understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in eps biosynthesis molecular composition interactions with other materials and structure function relationships would lead to the identification of new applications and markets for eps ensure stable and cost effective production of biopolymers from waste biomass and wastewater and provide a step towards successful development of extracellular polymer based bioproducts 9 improved bioprocess control through eps management the optimum strategy for biofilm control depends largely on whether eps production is beneficial e g granular sludges or detrimental e g membrane bioreactors infections or biofouling for both outcomes altering the mechanical properties of biofilms may improve the process management changing either the eps constituents that are present or how they interact with each other will modify biofilm cohesive strength viscosity or elasticity this can allow for easier removal of biofilms from filters by backwashing or to select for rapid settling of granular sludge in high throughput wastewater processes there are several strategies available to change the mechanical stability of biofilms including the use of enzymes e g lipases hydrolases proteases oxidants e g cl2 chelators e g edta or temperature jones et al 2011 stewart 2014 the current shortcomings in our understanding of eps make these approaches highly empirical and less effective a better understanding of the eps composition configuration and interactions among constituents will inform on more effective and targeted chemical interventions if we understood more about which eps are present what they are doing and how their expression is regulated another strategy targeting biofilm mechanics could be to modulate eps secretion this would allow for biofilms to be engineered to have more desirable properties such as reduced adhesion and increased permeability thus membrane reactor performances are improved eps secretion could be regulated by applying different growth or operating conditions certain growth conditions such as nutrient limitation feast famine or extended solid retention time may increase exopolysaccharide secretion in membrane biofilters excessive exopolysaccharide production reduces biofilm permeability and thus throughput of drinking water desmond et al 2018 supplementing process waters with phosphorus can increase biofilm permeability and reduce membrane head loss lauderdale and brown 2010 in conventional membrane systems however phosphorus limitation may prevent microbial growth and biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 2010 while hydraulic conditions are known to influence biofilm morphology fish et al 2017 van loosdrecht et al 1995 the exact relationship between reactor hydraulics and eps production has not yet been elucidated a better understanding the genomic regulation of eps formation and the factors that influence it could yield a real breakthrough this might allow for advanced control of mixed microbial communities with respect to eps as is currently under development for pure cultures ha and o toole 2015 establishing the means to control biofilm eps is thus crucial for improved management of our water resources and to stave off the emergence of multi drug resistant pathogens before we can benefit from better control and engineering of biofilm based systems in water treatment identify alternative antimicrobial therapies and recover eps as a bioresource we need to go beyond describing the eps in terms of the exopolymer classes present and identify exactly which molecules contribute to specific biofilm functions this involves an integrated multidisciplinary approach on biofilms and molecular isolates summarized in fig 2 improved eps extraction methods advanced imaging chemical characterization and genetic and biophysical analyses need to be applied to biofilms and eps isolates alike 10 conclusions a better understanding of the eps will increase the breadth of strategies available for controlling biofilms in water wastewater and medical systems alike which are currently unreliable empirical and binary at best a variety of complementary approaches is required to overcome extraction and analysis biases as well as knowledge constraints regarding for example exopolymer references in databases required developments include extraction methods targeting full solubilization of key structural and functional eps with a preparedness to use harsh methods if necessary contingent on using methods to verify the intra or extra cellular origin of the analyzed molecules chemical characterization methods to identify the exact molecular structure in situ methods for verifying the identity distribution and function of the eps biophysical imaging with

19046,microbial biofilms can be both cause and cure to a range of emerging societal problems including antimicrobial tolerance water sanitation water scarcity and pollution the identities of extracellular polymeric substances eps responsible for the establishment and function of biofilms are poorly understood the lack of information on the chemical and physical identities of eps limits the potential to rationally engineer biofilm processes and impedes progress within the water and wastewater sector towards a circular economy and resource recovery here a multidisciplinary roadmap for addressing this eps identity crisis is proposed this involves improved eps extraction and characterization methodologies cross referencing between model biofilms and full scale biofilm systems and functional description of isolated eps with in situ techniques e g microscopy coupled with genomics proteomics and glycomics the current extraction and spectrophotometric characterization methods often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells should be critically assessed and more comprehensive methods for recovery and characterization of eps need to be developed graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilms extracellular polymeric substances function analysis biophysics identity 1 introduction often described in a cursory manner as the slime the extracellular polymeric substances eps are key to the formation persistence and physicochemical behavior of microbial biofilms across clinical environmental and industrial settings seviour et al 2012b moreover increased tolerance to antimicrobials is the result of the ability of certain pathogens to produce eps which hence constitutes a global threat to the consequences of multidrug resistance frieri et al 2017 eps also play significant roles in the successful implementation of water reclamation and purification technologies that have arisen to meet increasing demands for water of different purities water scarcity predicted by the united nations to be the biggest global problem in the coming decade land shortage and the water energy nexus eps provide structure for anaerobic and aerobic granular sludges which have emerged over the last thirty years along with activated sludge and fixed biofilm systems i e trickling filters as alternatives for biological treatment of industrial and domestic used waters with lower land and energy footprints bengtsson et al 2018 advances in membrane technologies have made it possible to create drinking water either from sources that were previously considered not available for drinking water production i e brackish water seawater or wastewater le and nunes 2016 or without the addition of chemical disinfectants derlon et al 2012 madaeni 1999 however the hydraulic throughput of these technologies is often limited by membrane fouling which in many instances is due to biofilm growth biofilms therefore feature prominently in many of the challenges facing water technology implementations as the number of antimicrobial resistant strains increases and the range of water reclamation and purification technologies grows so too does the need to control or predict eps production yet despite decades of research we know very little about the molecular composition and function assigned to individual eps components and we are not in a position to control the formation and composition with any meaningful predictable outcome this limits our ability to manage biofilms effectively we need to enhance our efforts to deliver improved analytical methods and unravel biochemical production pathways and most importantly discontinue the use of methods that misrepresent the roles and significance of eps the current practice of dismissing eps or relegating them to merely a perfunctory study as a footnote in process optimization should be abandoned it is essential to identify and reveal how eps composition determines the microscopic and macroscopic behavior of biofilm systems we propose that identifying functional biofilm eps is the critical path to address key questions in biofilm control this will not be possible if we persist with the current practice of applying general superficial and correlative characterizations alone however prior to suggesting a roadmap for achieving an in depth understanding of eps it is first necessary to explain why so little progress has been made in identifying and characterizing extracellular polymers present in biofilms 2 the extracellular matrix the eps of biofilms are a complex mixture of interlaced biological polymers they provide mechanical stability and scaffolds that allow biofilm cells to establish synergistic microconsortia enhance water retention and nutrient sorption provide protection against viruses predation antimicrobials and disinfectants and ultimately act as nutrient recycling yards flemming and wingender 2010 these functions can be provided by a large variety of biopolymers particularly polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids eps compounds originate from different community members and a specific organism can produce different polymers as a function of time or condition moreover eps produced by a given microbial population can persist long after the population producing it has disappeared all of these different components contribute to the function and organization of the matrix additionally many of the biopolymers produced by the cells are processed by extracellular enzymes embedded in the extracellular matrix whitfield et al 2015 it is currently not possible to track the production of specific eps components over time or attribute them to the specific host organism in mixed species biofilm communities nor do we have the means to effectively manipulate eps quantity or composition a better understanding of the eps would derive from metabolic labelling approaches liang et al 2017 for example eps biosynthesis compounds could be tracked to identify the organisms producing them when and where they are released and their fate over time this could be monitored in real time using state of the art laser microscopes and nanoscopes to generate high resolution three dimensional image data sets limitations in our current understanding of the eps however render such methodologies presently beyond our reach structural and functional assignment of key biofilm eps is confounded by their compositional complexity but also by the challenges in processing and isolating eps components the diversity of biofilm eps is described in fig 1 in terms of the number of types of molecules observed across a range of biofilms i e rather than in any single biofilm see box 1 for a description of each eps biofilms and many of the eps described in fig 1 are poorly soluble in aqueous systems unless methods are developed to extract the entire spectrum of biofilm eps our understanding of eps will be skewed by solubility and characterization biases mechanical and chemical methods have been applied for eps extraction from these biofilms with the objective of maximizing extraction yield and minimizing cell lysis ras et al 2011 in most cases these methods have not been verified to assess whether they extract the structural polymers from the biofilms while potentially effective on some biofilms these extraction protocols are often only partially or marginally effective which results in the characterization of eps that are not important for the biofilm structure felz et al 2016 this is particularly the case for stratified and dense aggregates such as fixed biofilms or granular sludge 3 a solution for the insoluble the range of techniques required to extract and solubilize known biopolymers such as the polysaccharides cellulose chitin and alginate examples of neutral cationic and anionic polysaccharides respectively highlights the need for even harsh extraction methods i e non aqueous extreme ph or temperature zhang et al 2017 combinations of mechanical pre treatments grinding ultrasonication homogenizers acidification demineralization enzymatic hydrolyses alkalinization for deproteination or deprotonation novel solvents like ionic liquids and heat treatments are typically invoked in order to extract such polysaccharides kumari and rath 2014 seviour et al 2015b younes and rinaudo 2015 while cytosolic protein extraction is possible through cell lysis the task is far more problematic for structural proteins these are often large julio and cotter 2005 and or have a tendency to fibrillate whereby alkalization or acidification may be required to solubilize them often in conjunction with enzymatic treatments le et al 2016 given the analytical challenges of identifying and characterizing functional eps of biofilm assemblages we should sometimes be prepared to apply methods that damage cells rather than prioritizing cell integrity felz et al 2016 in order to resolve the contributions of a broader range of key extracellular polymers this approach would then include the subsequent step of retrospectively identifying whether extracted polymers are extracellular as accomplished by microscopic techniques neu and lawrence 2014 wagner et al 2009 the target extracellular polymers can be recovered from solution by fractional precipitation e g using anti solvent addition or ph neutralization and purified further by for example electrophoretic or chromatographic techniques seviour et al 2010a complementary biophysical assays can then be undertaken on biofilm and isolates to elucidate function seviour et al 2015a detailed structural and functional characterization of novel relevant extracellular polymers requires significant quantities of a sufficiently pure compound which is a common and often insurmountable hurdle to achieve the ultimate goal of resolving more precisely the identity of key extracellular polymers 4 do the same extracellular polymers provide the same functions across systems despite the complexity and diversity of eps in multi species biofilms we assume that particular roles performed by eps are conserved across biofilms e g gel formation and adhesion lin et al 2013 the more information we acquire on the mechanical biophysical and structural aspects of the extracellular polymers contributing to these functions the easier it will be to identify and monitor their expression this could involve information derived from metaproteomic analysis specific labelling of functional groups in polymers e g by lectins and observation by microscopy neu and kuhlicke 2017 or quantifying polymers with greater accuracy the list of reference polymers is limited to those isolated from a relatively small number of models often clinical organisms e g escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa colvin et al 2012 marvasi et al 2010 these bacteria are uncommon in biofilms found in water treatment biofilms and their polymers are unlikely to be representative of biofilm eps in water treatment systems another approach for understanding whether eps perform common functions across different biofilm system currently neglected in eps research could be to screen interactions between eps and known glycan binding proteins in order to infer function and identity i e glycomics cummings and pierce 2014 lipke 2016 this would create a database for eps comparison identification of new sugar binding proteins for visualization of novel sugars and potentially facilitate the identification and analysis of glycoproteins 5 agreeing on model biofilms for eps characterization full scale biological systems in the water sector are often represented by highly diverse microbial communities saunders et al 2016 we would expect the eps to be similarly complex at a molecular level hence full scale systems may not be the ideal starting point for isolating and characterizing reference polymers we should therefore improve the resolution of characterization of eps from biofilms comprising organisms known to contribute to key water and wastewater biofilm functions such as nitrification enhanced biological phosphate removal floc and filament formation and the anammox process the microbial community composition of model systems can be tracked and compared to full scale systems biomass samples from these model systems should be made broadly available to the water sector and act as a common reference point for initial eps characterization there are a few examples of eps isolated from bacteria found in biofilms related to wastewater treatment including granulan seviour et al 2012a alginate like exopolysaccharide ale lin et al 2010 acid soluble polysugars pronk et al 2017 and glycosylated proteins lin et al 2018 however we still need to understand how widespread these eps are in biofilms as well as identify new extracellular polymers from other key systems to expand our database of identified characterized and relevant eps 6 sequencing approaches for eps characterization the application of next generation dna sequencing methods in conjunction with bioinformatic analyses may allow for the identification of signature extracellular polymers across a vast number of environmental biofilms and to elucidate their regulation metagenome assembled genomes mags representing individual community species can be described relatively inexpensively albertsen et al 2013 and when coupled with long read sequencing technologies such as pacbio and nanopore sequencing closed genomes from mixed communities can be constructed hao et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2017 mags provide blueprints for the proteins enzymes transporter and chaperones that are involved in the biogenesis of all cellular components and eps in the case of proteinaceous eps mags provide the exact recipe for how to synthesize them genetically encoded systems for eps biogenesis can be predicted by bioinformatic approaches such as genome annotation and pathway modeling however eps identified purely through bioinformatics and molecular methods remain theoretical extracellular polymers only hence validation through biophysical and chemical characterization of isolated reference compounds will be required sequencing and molecular techniques can enable recombinant model systems to be designed to produce extracellular proteins for chemical and biophysical characterization where the proposed extracellular proteins are expressed and isolated from bacteria with little or no biofilm production as is the case for common laboratory strains of e coli and b subtilis dueholm et al 2010 such proteins can even be used to generate antibodies that can be applied for in situ analyses furthermore identifying the genetic blueprints for the synthesis of reference polymers would allow us to identify related systems by homology searches dueholm et al 2012 and employ transcriptomics to determine how such genes are regulated in response to environmental factors liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms could confirm that theoretical extracellular proteins are expressed in complex samples cox et al 2014 lc ms ms may also provide information on chemical modifications which could be relevant for their functions however while methods for high throughput protein identification are well established the same advances have not been achieved for extracellular polysaccharide analysis due to the structural diversity of carbohydrates wang et al 2017 zhao and jensen 2009 furthermore the reliability of current methods e g for polysaccharide quantification by colorimetric methods is impaired by other chromogenic compounds i e interference and non representative reference sugars le and stuckey 2016 7 in situ approaches have an important role to play new and combined imaging techniques offer the opportunity to link the production of specific eps components with specific bacterial groups in situ as well as validate whether the isolated polymers are indeed extracellular imaging provides a link between genomic information and how the eps are distributed throughout the biofilm i e with regards to location whereby changes in microbial cells and matrix composition can be monitored over time and together with changes in environmental parameters advanced imaging techniques can be combined with increasingly sophisticated computational analyses to describe microbial behavior quantitatively with greater precision neu et al 2010 laser scanning microscopy coupled with fluorescent staining has proven to be the most flexible approach for imaging biofilm eps neu and lawrence 2014 key fluorescence approaches include selective fluorogenic staining e g toto 1 for dna okshevsky and meyer 2014 nilered for lipids rumin et al 2015 sypro nanoorange and epicocconone for proteins randrianjatovo et al 2015 zubkov et al 1999 lectins for analysis of eps glycoconjugates neu and kuhlicke 2017 and eps specific antibodies e g wo1 for amyloid proteins poul et al 2007 by combining eps microscopy with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish eps production can potentially be linked to specific bacterial taxa bennke et al 2013 tawakoli et al 2017 finally chemical imaging could become a key tool for analyzing complex microbial communities and bridging isolation and in situ characterization studies particularly relevant techniques include ftir imaging raman microscopy nanosims and tof sims as well as synchrotron based imaging such as stxm although some problems still need to be addressed such as correlated imaging suitable mounting and probes and scale of observation covered area and depth gowen et al 2015 lawrence et al 2003 marshall et al 2014 8 can eps recovery help us to move towards a circular economy a better understanding of the eps matrix will lead to improved strategies for both resource recovery and biofilm management in water and wastewater treatment systems the growing interest in renewable resources highlights a focus on the production of eps from waste biomass and their conversion into bioproducts and biomaterials as an appealing route for contributing to a reduced economic dependence on fossil fuels more et al 2016 and enhanced sustainability and economics of wastewater treatment lin et al 2015 eps like polymers hydrocolloids cannot in general be derived from oil based chemicals and hence supply relies solely on natural resources wastewater derived hydrocolloids could be an important new supply route a better understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in eps biosynthesis molecular composition interactions with other materials and structure function relationships would lead to the identification of new applications and markets for eps ensure stable and cost effective production of biopolymers from waste biomass and wastewater and provide a step towards successful development of extracellular polymer based bioproducts 9 improved bioprocess control through eps management the optimum strategy for biofilm control depends largely on whether eps production is beneficial e g granular sludges or detrimental e g membrane bioreactors infections or biofouling for both outcomes altering the mechanical properties of biofilms may improve the process management changing either the eps constituents that are present or how they interact with each other will modify biofilm cohesive strength viscosity or elasticity this can allow for easier removal of biofilms from filters by backwashing or to select for rapid settling of granular sludge in high throughput wastewater processes there are several strategies available to change the mechanical stability of biofilms including the use of enzymes e g lipases hydrolases proteases oxidants e g cl2 chelators e g edta or temperature jones et al 2011 stewart 2014 the current shortcomings in our understanding of eps make these approaches highly empirical and less effective a better understanding of the eps composition configuration and interactions among constituents will inform on more effective and targeted chemical interventions if we understood more about which eps are present what they are doing and how their expression is regulated another strategy targeting biofilm mechanics could be to modulate eps secretion this would allow for biofilms to be engineered to have more desirable properties such as reduced adhesion and increased permeability thus membrane reactor performances are improved eps secretion could be regulated by applying different growth or operating conditions certain growth conditions such as nutrient limitation feast famine or extended solid retention time may increase exopolysaccharide secretion in membrane biofilters excessive exopolysaccharide production reduces biofilm permeability and thus throughput of drinking water desmond et al 2018 supplementing process waters with phosphorus can increase biofilm permeability and reduce membrane head loss lauderdale and brown 2010 in conventional membrane systems however phosphorus limitation may prevent microbial growth and biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 2010 while hydraulic conditions are known to influence biofilm morphology fish et al 2017 van loosdrecht et al 1995 the exact relationship between reactor hydraulics and eps production has not yet been elucidated a better understanding the genomic regulation of eps formation and the factors that influence it could yield a real breakthrough this might allow for advanced control of mixed microbial communities with respect to eps as is currently under development for pure cultures ha and o toole 2015 establishing the means to control biofilm eps is thus crucial for improved management of our water resources and to stave off the emergence of multi drug resistant pathogens before we can benefit from better control and engineering of biofilm based systems in water treatment identify alternative antimicrobial therapies and recover eps as a bioresource we need to go beyond describing the eps in terms of the exopolymer classes present and identify exactly which molecules contribute to specific biofilm functions this involves an integrated multidisciplinary approach on biofilms and molecular isolates summarized in fig 2 improved eps extraction methods advanced imaging chemical characterization and genetic and biophysical analyses need to be applied to biofilms and eps isolates alike 10 conclusions a better understanding of the eps will increase the breadth of strategies available for controlling biofilms in water wastewater and medical systems alike which are currently unreliable empirical and binary at best a variety of complementary approaches is required to overcome extraction and analysis biases as well as knowledge constraints regarding for example exopolymer references in databases required developments include extraction methods targeting full solubilization of key structural and functional eps with a preparedness to use harsh methods if necessary contingent on using methods to verify the intra or extra cellular origin of the analyzed molecules chemical characterization methods to identify the exact molecular structure in situ methods for verifying the identity distribution and function of the eps biophysical imaging with

19047,ensuring safe and effective water treatment distribution and reuse requires robust methods for characterizing and monitoring waterborne microbes methods widely used today can be limited by low sensitivity high labor and time requirements susceptibility to interference from inhibitory compounds and difficulties in distinguishing between viable and non viable cells flow cytometry fcm has recently gained attention as an alternative approach that can overcome many of these challenges this article critically and systematically reviews for the first time recent literature on applications of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse in the review we identify and examine nearly 300 studies published from 2000 to 2018 that illustrate the benefits and challenges of using fcm for assessing source water quality and impacts of treatment plant discharge on receiving waters wastewater treatment drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution we then discuss options for combining fcm with other indicators of water quality and address several topics that cut across nearly all applications reviewed finally we identify priority areas in which more work is needed to realize the full potential of this approach these include optimizing protocols for fcm based analysis of waterborne viruses optimizing protocols for specifically detecting target pathogens automating sample handling and preparation to enable real time fcm developing computational tools to assist data analysis and improving standards for instrumentation methods and reporting requirements we conclude that while more work is needed to realize the full potential of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse substantial progress has been made over the past two decades there is now a sufficiently large body of research documenting successful applications of fcm that the approach could reasonably and realistically see widespread adoption as a routine method for water quality

wastewater treatment wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction ensuring safe and effective water treatment distribution and reuse requires robust methods for characterizing and monitoring waterborne microbes including both pathogenic and nonpathogenic protozoa bacteria and viruses methods for assessing pathogenic microbes are needed to protect human health although it is difficult to precisely quantify the prevalence and impacts of waterborne disease pathogens in drinking water have been estimated to cause between 4 and 33 million cases of gastrointestinal illness alone in the united states every year byappanahalli et al 2006 messner et al 2006 at an annual cost of at least 1 billion collier et al 2012 methods for assessing nonpathogenic microbes can help detect meaningful changes in water quality and can help determine the effectiveness or failure of water treatment processes methods for assessing nonpathogenic microbes can also facilitate optimization of water treatment e g by enabling better understanding of microbes involved in activated sludge processes unfortunately current methods used widely to characterize and monitor microbial water quality are imperfect physiochemical parameters such as turbidity are sometimes correlated with microbial contamination but the relationships are scenario specific and hence of limited value allen et al 2008 culture based methods are relatively simple and low cost but limited by low sensitivity and high labor and time requirements ramírez castillo et al 2015 for instance standard methods for culturing bacteria typically take between 24 and 48 h to produce results culturing viruses can take even longer from days to weeks fong and lipp 2005 such high time requirements are particularly problematic for direct potable reuse dpr where highly treated wastewater is fed directly into drinking water systems this engenders concerns that contaminated water could be distributed and consumed before a microbial hazard is noted verhille 2013 in addition waterborne pathogens of concern such as escherichia coli e coli helicobacter pylori h pylori and vibrio cholerae v cholerae frequently exist in a viable but non cultivable vbnc state meaning that culture based methods may yield false negatives ramírez castillo et al 2015 molecular methods include a variety of techniques including polymerase chain reaction pcr oligonucleotide dna microarrays and pyrosequencing these techniques are generally faster and more sensitive than culture based methods can be highly target specific and can provide additional phylogenetic information about pathogens of interest however some molecular methods are particularly susceptible to interference from inhibitory compounds found in environmental samples such as humic acids and metals olivieri et al 2016 ramírez castillo et al 2015 molecular methods such as pcr may also be unable or have only limited ability to distinguish between viable and non viable organisms limiting their value in assessing the efficacy of disinfection processes although further development of molecular methods is likely the limitations of such methods are significant at present flow cytometry fcm offers an alternative approach fcm was first developed in the mid 1900s but initial uses were limited due to relatively high size thresholds for particle detection non specific binding of fluorescent stains and poor sensitivity and computational capacity wang et al 2010b over the past several decades availability of cheaper more powerful instrumentation coupled with the emergence of new analysis techniques has enabled numerous new uses of fcm including uses in water quality assessment scholars have surveyed applications of fcm for aquatic and environmental microbiology bergquist et al 2009 wang et al 2010b discussed types of information obtainable from fcm that may be relevant for analysis of aquatic systems hammes and egli 2010 and reviewed the value of fcm for studying microbial populations and communities müller and nebe von caron 2010 more recently fcm has been identified as a potentially valuable tool for virus enumeration in water reuse rockey et al 2018 we build on previous work by examining how fcm can support and indeed has already been used to support safe effective water treatment distribution and reuse the article is structured as follows section 2 briefly explains how fcm works and how it is already being used to characterize and monitor waterborne microbes sections 3 and 4 systematically review recent literature on fcm research and applications related to source and receiving water quality wastewater treatment drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution sections 5 7 provide critical analysis based on insights from the review section 5 identifies options for combining fcm with other water quality indicators to enhance analysis section 6 addresses three topics sample preparation sample staining and interpretation of viability data that cut across nearly all applications of fcm reviewed section 7 articulates research needs that must be met to realize the full potential of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse 2 background 2 1 principles of fcm flow cytometry fcm refers to analysis of suspended particles based on how they scatter light and or fluoresce when passing through a laser beam such particles include bacteria protozoa viruses cell fragments inorganic debris and so on fig 1 illustrates the basic components of a flow cytometer in brief the instrument draws sample into a focusing chamber that forces suspended particles to align in single file the focused stream is passed through one or more interrogation points at which a laser or other monochromatic light beam individually strikes each particle detectors measure the extent to which each particle scatters light in the forward and side directions and send these measurements to a computer for display and processing fcm data is typically presented as histograms or two dimensional dot plots that visualize the intensity and frequency of signals received on different parameters in general forward scatter fsc signals are related to particle size while side scatter ssc signals are related to particle complexity and granularity fluorescence is also an integral part of flow cytometry fluorescence occurs when certain molecules emit light following excitation by a beam of a compatible wavelength most cells have some natural autofluorescence that can be beneficially exploited for analysis but may also obscure fluorescent signals of interest in most cases autofluorescence alone is not sufficient to conclusively distinguish specific particle populations and or examine parameters of interest it is therefore standard practice for researchers to apply one or more fluorescent stains prior to fcm section 6 2 correctly interpreting fcm data requires researchers to keep many factors in mind some of the most important follow first scatter only indicates relative not absolute particle size and complexity since the intensity of scatter signals depends on factors such as laser wavelength collection angle surface roughness and refractive index of the particle and sheath fluid a particle that generates an fsc signal double that of another particle is not necessarily twice as big second most particles are irregularly shaped meaning that signal intensity depends on the orientation of a particle when it reaches the interrogation point shapiro 2003 third particles may clump together and register to the instrument as a single larger scatter or fluorescent signal fourth particle diameter can affect analysis strategies large diameter particles preferentially scatter light in the forward direction while small diameter particles do not small diameter particles will scatter light weakly and inconsistently generating small amounts of scatter that can be challenging to distinguish from noise finally all particles in a sample including intact cells fragmented cells and inorganic debris scatter light making it difficult to uniquely identify targets from scatter alone 2 2 status of fcm in water quality assessment fcm data can yield a wealth of information about the microbial characteristics of water samples as discussed in hammes and egli 2010 absolute cell counting also known as total cell counting or tcc is one of the most straightforward and common uses of fcm although it may be challenging to obtain reliable counts for environmental samples containing large amounts of non cell particles scatter and fluorescence data indicate cell characteristics such as relative size complexity and nucleic acid content and thus can serve as a unique cytometric fingerprint of the microbial community present in a water sample koch et al 2014 fluorescent stains can be used as indicators of cellular parameters such as membrane integrity and enzymatic activity which in turn can provide deeper insight into the kinetics and efficacy of water treatment processes finally fcm can be used to specifically identify target cells when present in a high enough concentration and when the target can be stained by a fluorescent marker this final function can directly detect microorganisms of concern can detect indicator populations known to be correlated with a target population or as a method for tracking process performance hammes and egli 2010 fcm is now generally accepted as a valuable tool for detection enumeration and characterization of waterborne microbial populations however it is not yet widely used in applied settings e g for ensuring compliance with water quality regulations a notable exception is switzerland in 2012 switzerland s federal office of public health foph published official methods in the swiss food book schweizerisches lebensmittelbuch or slmb a collection of standards to ensure the safety of food and beverages for human consumption for using fcm to obtain total microbial cell counts and determine the ratios of high and low nucleic acid cells in fresh water federal office of public health 2012 the method was recommended for analyzing water in drinking water treatment plants dwtps drinking water distribution systems dwdss and household plumbing among other areas although the slmb was recently discontinued a similar resource is forthcoming from the swiss gas and water association a revised version of the foph s fcm method are currently being developed for inclusion in this resource in the interim the method is still recommended by the swiss government for analysis of drinking water kötzsch et al 2012 while to our knowledge no other federal or state government has formally endorsed fcm for water quality assessment a growing number of utilities and regulatory bodies are exploring the benefits of the approach in california for instance a 2016 report commissioned by the state water resources control board identified fcm as a rapid potentially automatable method for characterizing water samples olivieri et al 2016 scottish water the statutory corporation that provides water and sewage services to the bulk of scotland s population is actively collaborating with cranfield university to develop fcm techniques for full scale dwtps and dwdss scottish water 2014 northumbrian water group a major water supplier in england is working to validate fcm with the ultimate objective of having fcm approved by the united kingdom drinking water inspectorate as an alternative to culture based methods for obtaining total and intact cell counts marsh 2017 as instrumentation improves and protocols become standardized it is likely that fcm for water quality assessment will continue to catch on with practitioners as well as researchers 3 review scope and methods the review process was informed by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis prisma guidelines moher et al 2009 primary research on the use of fcm related to any aspect of drinking water sourcing treatment and distribution and or on any aspect of wastewater treatment and discharge was eligible for inclusion in this review also eligible were studies on optimizing fcm sample preparation and data analysis as long as such studies explicitly defined applications related to water treatment distribution and or reuse studies focusing solely on marine samples were excluded the review was limited to research published in english language peer reviewed journal articles and books from academic publishers only articles and books published between january 2000 and march 2018 were considered both to keep the number of candidate references to a feasible level and because it is only relatively recently that fcm has been considered a practically viable method for water quality assessment in part due to technological advances that have rendered fcm instrumentation better and cheaper the literature search relied on three bibliographic databases web of science pubmed and the university of california library catalog the latter representing the largest university research library in the world was particularly valuable in ensuring as comprehensive a search as possible the search proceeded as follows first each of the databases was queried with the boolean subject search flow cytomet and bacteria or virus or protozoa and drinking water or wastewater or recycled water or groundwater or surface water or activated sludge or biological reactor or potable reuse or nonpotable reuse or source water and monitor or analyz or evaluat this search was intended to capture references focused on using fcm for water quality assessment in particular for studying waterborne microbes the specific query was selected by the authors after running a number of preliminary searches to identify terms that returned the greatest number of relevant results the search resulted in a total of 1375 references 651 from web of science 504 from pubmed and 220 from the university of california library catalog second duplicate references were eliminated leaving 827 references third unique references were screened for relevance to the review eligibility criteria and the citations of each relevant reference were hand scanned to identify additional candidate references for the review full texts of candidates were obtained and confirmed for relevance as well a total of 281 references were ultimately included in the systematic review 145 references describe specific applications of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse section 4 41 references address complementary topics sections 5 7 and 95 references cover both specific applications and complementary topics fig 2 summarizes the systematic review process 4 applications of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse this section reviews applications of fcm for studying 1 source water quality and impacts of treatment plant discharge on receiving waters 2 wastewater treatment 3 drinking water treatment and 4 drinking water distribution fig 3 breaks down these references by application category note that some references are included in more than one category for convenience we use the term microbial water quality assessment to refer generally to characterization and monitoring of waterborne microbes we note however that no single parameter can provide a complete picture of microbial water quality for instance two samples exhibiting the same tcc could contain different levels of pathogenic bacteria on the other hand two samples devoid of pathogenic bacteria could exhibit different tccs potentially indicating different levels of biological stability 4 1 source waters and receiving waters assessing microbial quality of natural waters e g lakes rivers streams and aquifers is important at the beginning and end of water treatment processes upstream of treatment processes source water quality has considerable influence on the performance of water treatment distribution and reuse processes high quality inputs make it easier to realize high quality products downstream it is necessary to monitor water bodies receiving effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps in order to ensure that the plants are successfully removing microbial hazards that pose human and environmental health risks fcm has been used to analyze microbial quality of various source waters some studies explore the potential of fcm for detecting specific pathogens in source waters and or separating out such pathogens for further analysis these studies include tanaka et al 2000 weir et al 2000 riffard et al 2001 lindquist et al 2001a b chung et al 2004 shapiro et al 2010 and keserue et al 2011 2012b in addition vital et al 2007a 2008 2012b used fcm to investigate growth of v cholerae and e coli o157 under different freshwater conditions tanaka et al 2000 found fcm to be valuable for studying organisms likely to be present in vbnc states in the environment as such organisms are impossible to quantify accurately using plate based methods they further noted that fcm is particularly useful for environmental samples containing a low ratio of target cells to total cells since it is time and labor intensive to analyze these samples via manual count methods such as epifluorescence microscopy efm riffard et al 2001 caution that the presence of debris and autochthonous i e native microflora may interfere with direct application of fcm to natural samples they suggest integrating immunomagnetic separation or similar sample processing to isolate target cells prior to fcm analysis time and labor requirements associated with such processing would present a challenge for certain fcm applications such as online i e real time water quality assessment to facilitate dpr fcm has also been used to characterize microbes in source waters more generally mailloux and fuller 2003 wang et al 2009 anneser et al 2010 leys et al 2010 roudnew et al 2012 2013 2014 smith et al 2012 2015 wilhartitz et al 2013 besmer et al 2016 2017a and page et al 2017 used fcm to examine microbial water quality in groundwater systems stopa and mastromanolis 2001 yang et al 2015a baumgartner et al 2016 and elhadidy et al 2016 used fcm to examine microbial water quality in surface water objectives of these groundwater and surface water studies included characterizing how microbial water quality varies in space time and in response to perturbations like borehole purging aquifer recharge and precipitation events the majority of such studies assess microbial water quality through quantification of bacterial tcc and icc leys et al 2010 roudnew et al 2012 2013 2014 smith et al 2012 2015 and wilhartitz et al 2013 additionally enumerate populations of virus like particles vlps characterized by relatively small size and lower nucleic acid content compared to bacteria some studies go beyond simple enumeration to achieve deeper insight into microbial quality of source waters besmer et al 2016 2017a applied automated fcm to better characterize real time fluctuations in microbial dynamics of source waters wang et al 2009 besmer et al 2016 and elhadidy et al 2016 each distinguished subpopulations representing low nucleic acid lna and high nucleic acid hna bacteria in particular wang et al 2009 used fluorescence activated cell sorting facs a type of fcm in which the cytometer sorts and saves any cells exhibiting scatter and fluorescence properties prespecified by the instrument operator to enrich lna bacteria from source freshwater for further cultivation and examination others have combined fcm with other techniques e g phylogenetic analysis determination of assimilable organic content etc that can provide complementary or confirmatory information section 5 finally fcm has been used to assess how discharge from water treatment plants impacts environmental waters bricheux et al 2013 yang et al 2015b harry et al 2016 and vivas et al 2017 used fcm to assess environmental toxicity of effluent from wwtps e g by tracking changes in the number and viability of microbes in the receiving waterbody yuan et al 2016 did the same for drinking water treatment residue keserue et al 2012b stained with fluorescent antibodies before using fcm to specifically detect c parvum and giardia lamblia in a canal receiving wwtp discharge these researchers generally concluded that fcm is a useful cultivation free approach for such applications the biggest challenge noted was that it may be difficult to apply fcm directly to environmental waters containing and or receiving high particle loads since large particles and particle clumps can clog fluidics and or result in multiple particles passing through an interrogation point simultaneously adequate sample preparation section 6 1 can help reduce the likelihood of clogging or particle coincidence when applying fcm to turbid samples 4 2 wastewater treatment wastewater treatment wwt is the first stage of water reuse wwt processes include preliminary treatment screening to remove large pieces of trash primary treatment settling and skimming to remove suspended solids and floatable contaminants secondary treatment passage through activated sludge reactors and clarifiers to remove organic matter and other contaminants and in some cases tertiary treatment e g disinfection and nutrient removal this section discusses studies involving applications of fcm specific to wwt most such studies focus on characterizing the microbial communities involved in activated sludge processes and or on assessing the viability of activated sludge bacteria as discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 other applications of fcm in wwt are reviewed in section 4 2 3 4 2 1 microbial community characterization many studies have used fcm to help characterize microbial communities in wwt by employing various staining and sorting techniques some rely on facs to sort target cells for further analysis as forster et al 2003 explains isolating certain microbial species and subpopulations assists researchers in identifying keystone microbial species essential to particular wwt processes specific studies using facs to examine specific microbial species and subpopulations involved in wwt include those conducted by hung et al 2002 kawaharasaki et al 2002 zilles et al 2002a b miyauchi et al 2007 günther et al 2009 2012 schroeder et al 2009 kim et al 2010 and mehlig et al 2013 each of these studies focused on polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos used for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr kim et al 2010 initially had trouble with paos forming aggregates that impeded facs but were ultimately able to achieve accurate sorting by using fsc and ssc to exclude events that did not fit a single cell profile mcilroy et al 2008 combined facs with fluorescent in situ hybridization fish a set of techniques involving the use of fluorescent probes that bind specifically to target specific nucleic acid sequences on chromosomes to isolate glycogen accumulating organisms gao from an ebpr system mota et al 2012 did the same to isolate nitrite reducing bacteria from activated sludge irie et al 2016 was able to isolate target accumulibacter and nitrospira microcolonies from activated sludge by facs using only scatter data other studies targeted specific microbial strains or classes using non facs fcm forster et al 2002 used the nucleic acid stain hexidium iodide hi to differentiate gram positive and gram negative bacterial populations in samples taken from multiple stages of a wwtp they found that fcm based measurements of hi fluorescence were able to distinguish gram positive and gram negative bacteria as successfully as traditional microscopy tay et al 2002 used fcm and fish to enumerate cells of bacteroides spp in microbial granules taken from an activated sludge blanket similarly xia et al 2010 used fcm and fish to enumerate potential nitrifiers and denitrifiers in a lab scale suspended carrier biofilm reactor zheng et al 2010 2011 followed a similar process to identify microbial species responsible for filamentous fungal bulking in activated sludge a complication that leads to poor sludge settling during clarification and to investigate how different conditions affect such species brown et al 2014 tested different approaches for using fcm to quantify viruses in activated sludge as is also true for environmental waters researchers agreed on the importance of careful sample preparation section 6 1 for successful fcm analysis of wastewater samples characterized by high particle loads and or high levels of particle aggregation if preparation is adequate the advantages of fcm over conventional methods can be considerable forster et al 2003 observed that fcm allowed analysis of several thousand bacterial events in seconds while traditional gram staining requires growth and subsequent testing which can take days or weeks brown et al 2014 highlighted the high counting efficiency ease of preparation and rapidity of fcm analysis relative to other approaches for studying viruses in activated sludge 4 2 2 viability assessment viability assessment is one of the most common procedures in microbiology it is particularly important when it comes to determining the infectivity risk of pathogenic microorganisms in dpr and other water treatment and reuse scenarios membrane integrity a proxy for bacterial viability can be assessed through fcm by combining a cell permeant nucleic acid stain with a cell impermeant nucleic acid stain as discussed further in section 6 3 the syto and sybr stain families are the most common cell permeant stains 1 1 this article uses the shorthand syto sybr to refer to application of one or more stains in these families while propidium iodide pi is the most common cell impermeant stain falcioni et al 2005 described a step by step protocol for this staining approach and subsequent fcm analysis in wwt studies applying the approach to activated sludge include andreottola et al 2002a b ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010a abzazou et al 2015 lin et al 2016 and collado et al 2017 ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010a and collado et al 2017 also performed additional staining with fluorescein esters and fluorescein derivatives in order to use fcm analysis to identify enzymatically active bacteria moreover ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010a and abzazou et al 2015 explicitly concluded that fcm is a promising method for rapid examination of microbial viability in wastewater samples collado et al 2017 found fcm to be valuable for enumerating vbnc bacteria however they cautioned that fcm may not be sensitive enough for analysis of microbial species important to wwt processes but present at low proportion in activated sludge such as nitrifiers which often account for less than 10 of total bacterial cells in activated sludge reactors viability assays have also been used to assess the response of activated sludge bacteria to specific conditions compounds and processes in the first category specific conditions foladori et al 2015c used fcm to examine viability of bacterial cells exposed to aerobic and anaerobic conditions and wu et al 2015 stained activated sludge samples with pi as well as with the protein annexin v conjugated to the fluorescent protein allophycocyanin to assess viability of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria present under starvation conditions wu et al 2015 further stained with pyronin y to quantify the presence of synthesizing rna as an indicator of metabolic activity in the second category specific compounds liu et al 2013d used the same staining approach annexin v allophycocyanin as wu et al 2015 with fcm to demonstrate that adding ca2 had a significant positive effect on restoring a damaged anammox consortium foladori et al 2014 compared fcm to other approaches for investigating the physiological status of bacteria after toxicant addition they found that fcm based information on physiological effects of toxicants complements toxicity indicators obtained from tests that act on different cellular targets such as respirometry combarros et al 2016a b used fcm to evaluate the toxicity of titanium dioxide tio2 and graphene oxide both increasingly prevalent in advanced manufacturing on pseudomonas putida a bacterial strain often predominant in activated sludge processes foladori et al 2014 and combarros et al 2016a b also applied additional stains with fluorescein esters and fluorescein derivatives for fcm based assessment of toxicant effects on bacterial activity in the third category specific processes foladori et al 2007 2010b prorot et al 2008 2011 and meng et al 2015 used fcm to investigate the impact of sludge reduction processes on bacterial viability prorot et al 2008 2011 focused on thermal treatment meng et al 2015 focused on ozonation foladori et al 2007 focused on sonication and foladori et al 2010b compared the effects of four techniques to reduce excess sludge volume ultrasonication high pressure homogenization thermal treatment and ozonation rossi et al 2007 cunningham and lin 2010 czekalski et al 2016 di et al 2016 and lee et al 2016 used fcm to study wastewater disinfection pang et al 2014 used fcm to examine changes in bacterial viability during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge they found that by coupling fcm with three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy it was possible to completely characterize cell integrity and soluble organics in waste activated sludge in 10 of the time required for conventional methods pang et al 2014 further concluded that fcm based viability and fsc data provided a useful basis for inferring how bacterial flocs disaggregate during degradation of waste activated sludge yankey et al 2012 stained with syto 9 and pi combined with fcm to evaluate the success of thermal treatment on inactivating e coli isolated from sewage sludge 4 2 3 other applications other documented uses of fcm in wastewater analysis are highly diverse underscoring the flexibility of fcm as a tool for studying validating and monitoring wwt processes mezzanotte et al 2004 li et al 2007 manti et al 2008 muela et al 2011 ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2016b used fcm to investigate changes in wastewater quality at multiple stages and over time in full scale wwtps all quantified changes in bacterial tcc and icc with ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2016b also using fcm to examine virus removal muela et al 2011 compared fcm results to numerous other and microbiological parameters they concluded that microbiological parameters are essential to monitoring wwtp performance that quantification of active bacteria is an important microbiological indicator to track and that fcm is a useful tool for tracking it malaeb et al 2013 arends et al 2014 foladori et al 2015a di et al 2016 and bai et al 2017 each used fcm to assess the performance of relatively novel approaches to wwt respectively a microbial fuel cell membrane bioreactor constructed wetlands in combination with bioelectrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide constructed wetlands alone vermifiltration for sludge reduction and the introduction of plants into activated sludge reactors additional applications include assessment of wastewater toxicity shrivastava et al 2017 plasmid conjugation and horizontal genetic transfer in activated sludge pei and gunsch 2009 small particle removal in wwt eisenmann et al 2001 ivanov et al 2004 and the extent to which extraction of extracellular polymeric substances from an activated sludge reactor for further study affects bacterial viability in the reactor guo et al 2014 4 3 drinking water treatment for some water reuse applications standard wastewater treatment may be sufficient to achieve water quality targets for others such as dpr it is necessary to incorporate additional dwt processes including filtration and disinfection for pathogen removal this section discusses the use of fcm in both such applications as well as in assessing the broader effectiveness of dwt trains over multiple stages 4 3 1 filtration one group of studies on fcm applications in dwt focused on evaluating performance of filtration units this group can be subdivided into two categories studies concerning packed bed filtration and studies concerning membrane filtration the first category includes studies conducted by persson et al 2005 velten et al 2007 magic knezev et al 2014 casentini et al 2016 frossard et al 2016 and vignola et al 2018 persson et al 2005 examined the performance of granular activated carbon gac and expanded clay beds they used fcm scatter and fluorescence data to quantify percent reduction of autofluorescent microalgae and total particles from untreated surface water as well as percent reduction of fluorescent microspheres and salmonella typhimurium bacteriophages added in challenge tests velten et al 2007 combined fcm with adenosine tri phosphate atp analysis to investigate biofilm formation during gac start up magic knezev et al 2014 obtained fcm based tccs upstream and downstream of three sand filtration systems in order to determine the efficacy of filtration on improving microbial water quality vignola et al 2018 did the same to study the effect of biofilms in quartz sand and gac packed beds frossard et al 2016 used fcm to enumerate bacteria in sludge removed from a sand filter at a dwt plant and casentini et al 2016 applied fcm to examine microbial transport dynamics in a field scale filter that used zero valent iron for arsenic removal these studies demonstrate the value of fcm in confirming filter performance in water treatment and reuse applications the second category includes studies on microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis ro wang et al 2007 used fcm to quantify the fractions of various bacterial populations in natural freshwater able to pass through 0 1 0 2 and 0 45 μm pore size microfilters they found a significant fraction of natural freshwater bacterial communities is able to pass through such microfilters with bacterial shape being a major determinant of likelihood of passage this suggests that dwtps relying heavily on microfilters to achieve treatment goals may need to more carefully monitor filtrate to ensure that target bacteria are being excluded and adequate microbial water quality is being achieved wang et al 2008 later applied fcm to quantify total particle removal and changes in the lna hna ratio in groundwater passed through industrial scale microfiltration cartridges yu et al 2014 used fcm to study microbes that cause fouling of ultrafiltration membranes in dwt in particular they employed dual staining to assess the extent to which addition of naclo compromised bacterial membrane integrity since damaged cells are less able to form flocs that cause fouling mimoso et al 2015 performed online fcm section 7 3 to monitor changes in tcc and the lna hna ratio in water passed through a gravity driven ultrafiltration membrane liu et al 2017a applied fcm to examine cell breakage and membrane fouling in ultrafiltration treatment of cyanobacteria laden surface water habimana et al 2014 performed similar experiments to study biofilm formation on nanofiltration membranes used in the polishing stage of dwt finally dixon et al 2012 and huang et al 2015 used fcm to study ro dixon et al 2012 applied fcm to rapidly detect biofouling of ro membranes used in desalination while huang et al 2015 relied on fcm to quantify virus removal by ro in an advanced water reuse facility both concluded that fcm alone was insufficient for these applications dixon et al 2012 observed that it is difficult to separate changes in tcc caused by membrane biofouling from changes caused by membrane failure and or fluctuations in influent quality huang et al 2015 found that fcm can reliably quantify virus concentration changes in water reclamation processes however both dixon et al 2012 and huang et al 2015 suggested combining fcm with other tests including measurement of bacterial regrowth potential brp measurement of total organic carbon toc and dynamic light scattering dls to provide a more complete picture of ro performance 4 3 2 disinfection the majority of studies using fcm to examine individual dwt processes focus on disinfection disinfection is especially important process in dpr where the lack of an environmental buffer that is a lake river aquifer or other water body to which water is detained prior to entering a dwtp renders effective tertiary treatment critical disinfection studies can be grouped into several sub categories the first category comprises studies that examine the effect of disinfection for inactivating one or more specific waterborne pathogens usually though not exclusively in pure culture most studies combined pi with a syto or sybr stain to assess disinfection impacts on cellular membrane integrity this method was employed by widmer et al 2002 to study the effect of ozonation on giardia lamblia cysts by howard and inglis 2003 to study the effect of free chlorine on burkholderia pseudomallei by hwang et al 2006a b to study the effect of copper and silver on l pneumophila and pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa by giao et al 2009 to study the effect of chlorine on l pneumophila by bosshard et al 2009 to study the effect of solar disinfection on salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri by joyce et al 2011 to study the effect of sonication on e coli and klebsiella pneumonia by ssemakalu et al 2012 to study the effect of solar radiation on multiple strains of vibrio cholerae by carré et al 2013 to study the effect of tio2 on staphylococcus aureus s aureus and p aeruginosa by helmi et al 2015 to study the effect of chlorine on enterococcus faecalis by andreozzi et al 2016 to study the potential of two specialized classes of molecules polyamidoamine dendrimers and polyamino phenolic ligands to remove l pneumophila and by nie et al 2016 to study the effect of chlorine chloramine and ultraviolet uv radiation on s aureus nie et al observed that uv disinfection inactivates cells without affecting membrane integrity making uv induced viability losses more difficult to detect through fcm some studies use alternative fcm based methods to examine the effect of disinfection on specific pathogens for instance tang et al 2005 used fluorescent microspheres to model the inactivation of c parvum oocysts by ozonation noting that loss in microsphere fluorescence intensity has been previously demonstrated to serve as a good surrogate for loss of c parvum viability heaselgrave and kilvington 2011 used scatter data autofluorescence data and pi staining to assess the impact of solar disinfection on viability of giardia entamoeba invadens and c parvum the second category comprises studies that examine the effect of disinfection on cellular integrity of microcystis aeruginosa microcystis since microcystis and other cyanobacteria commonly found in drinking water release toxic metabolites when lysed the combination of syto sybr and pi staining does not work as well for assessing viability of microalgae as it does for assessing viability of other cell types because pi red fluorescence interferes with autofluorescence of photosynthetic pigments that can be used to detect microalgae hyka et al 2013 instead nearly all studies examining microcystis viability stain with sytox green another cell impermeant nucleic acid stain this method was used by daly et al 2007 and fan et al 2016 to study the effect of chlorine on microcystis by ho et al 2010 to study the effect of chloramine by fan et al 2013a b to compare the effects of copper sulphate chlorine potassium permanganate hydrogen peroxide and ozone by zhou et al 2014 to study the effects of potassium ferrate vi and by qi et al 2016 to study the effect of kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the only major challenge identified in applying fcm for microcystis viability analysis came from fan et al 2016 fan et al 2016 observed that because fcm is not well suited to analysis of particles larger than about 50 μm applying fcm to environmental samples requires some sort of dispersion method e g syringe aspiration dispersion to break up microcystis colonies commonly found in non lab settings the sytox green staining method was also used by liu et al 2017a who used fcm to examine microcystis cell breakage caused by ultrafiltration and by liu et al 2015a who compared fcm to other indicators potassium release and dissolved organic carbon release of microcystis cell breakage the latter study found that relative to the other indicators considered fcm has the broadest application scope and the fewest influencing factors making it a superior choice the third category comprises studies that use fcm to characterize the effects of disinfection on microbial communities rather than specific microbial species in drinking water most of these studies examine how disinfection reduces tcc and icc for natural microbial consortia and or for pure cultures of indicator non pathogenic bacteria using the combination of syto sybr and pi staining this approach was used by cunningham et al 2008 to study the effects of chlorine iodine and silver by wang et al 2010a to compare the effects of chemically and electrochemically dosed chlorine by ramseier et al 2011 to compare the effects of ozone chlorine chlorine dioxide monochloramine ferrate vi and permanganate by kaur et al 2013 to study the effects of ultraviolet radiation and multiple concentrations of tio2 by rezaeinejad and ivanov 2013 liu et al 2015b and nescerecka et al 2016b to study the effects of chlorine by berney et al 2006 and bigoni et al 2014 to study the effects of solar disinfection by mikula et al 2014 to study the effects of phthalocyanines photosensitive molecules that produce strong oxidizing agents with cytotoxic effects by lohwacharin et al 2015 to study the effects of residual ozone and chlorine on bacterial growth in biological activated carbon filters by kong et al 2016 to study the effect of uv radiation and chlorine on bacillus subtilis and by deng et al 2017 to study the effect of a graphene sponge decorated with copper nanoparticles some disinfection studies do not fit into any of the aforementioned categories hammes et al 2007 relied on scatter and autofluorescence data to study how ozonation disrupts algae they specifically examined scenedesmus vacuolatus as a representative for other types of algae commonly found in drinking water two studies laingam et al 2012 yang et al 2014 used fcm to evaluate the toxicity of disinfection byproducts produced from chlorination or chloramination of drinking water they both found that some of these byproducts were toxic to mammalian cells this suggests that chemical disinfection should be carried out with caution particularly when treating waters destined for direct human consumption in two other studies bazri et al 2012 and bazri and mohseni 2013 tested and described an approach for using fcm to assess the assimilable organic carbon aoc content of water following uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 disinfection finally yoon et al 2017 used fcm to help assess the efficiency of chlorine uv and uv h2o2 disinfection in inactivating plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance genes args by damaging arg amplicons yoon et al noted that while chlorine disinfection causes significant membrane damage detectable through fcm uv and uv h2o2 disinfection does not one challenge associated with fcm based assessment of disinfection efficacy is that membrane integrity stains do not always clearly distinguish between live and dead populations see section 6 3 a second is that disinfection processes that damage dna such as chlorination have also been shown to affect binding of membrane integrity stains to nucleic acids phe et al 2004 2007 these challenges can be addressed by using other stains to provide a more complete picture of whether and how disinfection is succeeding for example berney et al 2006 evaluated the effects of solar disinfection by applying fcm after staining with ethidium bromide eb to evaluate efflux pump activity dibac4 3 bis 1 3 dibutylbarbituric acid trimethine oxonol to evaluate membrane potential and 2 nbdg 2 n 7 nitrobenz 2 oxa 1 3 diazol 4 yl amino 2 deoxy d glucose to evaluate glucose uptake they found that loss of efflux pump activity membrane potential and cultivability decreased significantly at a uva fluence i e time integrated flux of 1500 kj m2 while cell membranes only became permeable at a fluence of 2500 kj m2 fcm can also be combined with other indicators of cellular activity and viability to study disinfection as discussed further in section 5 the overall takeaway is that there is no one size fits all approach for using fcm to assess microbial water quality following different types of disinfection processes 4 3 3 multistage studies numerous researchers applied fcm combined with syto or sybr staining to quantify tcc removal by multiple stages in one or more dwtps in australia switzerland the netherlands italy south korea and china these researchers include hoefel et al 2005b hammes et al 2008 ho et al 2012 vital et al 2012b helmi et al 2014 foladori et al 2015b besmer and hammes 2016 park et al 2016 li et al 2017 and wang et al 2017 some of these studies applied fcm to examine other indicators of treatment effectiveness as well such as changes in viability activity and number of total coliforms there was consensus that fcm is a valuable tool for assessing microbial water quality in dwtps and for facilitating design and optimization of treatment strategies helmi et al 2014 and foladori et al 2015b both noted that fcm analyses are less labor intensive than alternative methods and that since fcm consumables costs are low fcm can be more cost effective if enough analyses are performed to justify initial investments in instrumentation hammes et al 2008 commented that while fcm based quantification of tcc changes is a good baseline descriptive parameter of dwt processes it is important to remember that tcc includes inactive and dead cells it is therefore often necessary to supplement tcc with viability assessments particularly for disinfection processes 4 4 drinking water distribution changes in water quality throughout drinking water distribution systems dwds have long been overlooked 2 2 we use the term drinking water distribution system to refer to all infrastructure used to transport water from treatment plant to end user including water mains smaller pipes and household plumbing as fabris et al 2016 writes t he aim should be to provide high quality water at the customer tap while in reality the goal is commonly rationalized to a more achievable target of providing high quality water leaving the water treatment plant the availability of more sophisticated instrumentation has allowed greater insight into dwds with a greater focus on the distribution systems as a dynamic rather than static infrastructure component this recent focus on applying advanced analytical methods to dwds is evident in the fcm literature of the 35 studies we identified that use fcm to study water in dwds all but four were published in 2010 or later nearly all of these used a syto or sybr stain more commonly sybr to stain samples from dwds to obtain bacterial tcc and many also stained with pi to obtain bacterial icc the one exception is lin et al 2017 who instead used crystal violet as the working stain for their study of the effect of sodium hypochlorite on biofilms in dwds lin et al 2017 did not provide any explicit reasoning for departing from convention many researchers have used fcm to study how different factors affect microbial growth in dwds hoefel et al 2005a rosenfeldt et al 2009 gillespie et al 2014 nescerecka et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 huang et al 2016 lin et al 2017 and liu et al 2017b each used fcm to compare the efficacy of different types of disinfectant residual in limiting microbial growth in dwds and or to examine changes in microbial water quality associated with residual loss other researchers have used fcm to examine how microbial communities grow and change in dwds in the absence of a disinfectant residual these include hammes et al 2010a vital et al 2012a lautenschlager et al 2013 liu et al 2013a b c prest et al 2014 wen et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 fabris et al 2016 liu et al 2016 prest et al 2016c sawade et al 2016 van nevel et al 2016 2017a and waller et al 2018 appenzeller et al 2002 did not study bacterial growth per se but did use fcm to investigate the effect of phosphate addition on limiting bacterial adhesion to corroded pipes in a dwds studies cited in this paragraph generally found fcm valuable for detecting changes in microbial communities difficult to detect otherwise a final category of studies applied fcm to characterize microbial characteristics of water directly available for human consumption most studies in this category including berney et al 2008 lautenschlager et al 2010 kahlisch et al 2010 2012 lipphaus et al 2014 and zhang et al 2015 used fcm to analyze tap water water exiting dwds each of these researchers employed syto sybr combined with pi staining to obtain tcc and icc kahlisch et al 2010 2012 also used facs to separate bacteria for subsequent phylogenetic analysis one key takeaway noted repeatedly in these studies is that the microbial characteristics of water exiting a tap can be quite different from the characteristics of water exiting a dwtp this is attributable to microbial growth in dwds particularly when water remains stagnant in dwds for a prolonged period of time yu et al 2015 focused not on tap water but on bottled water and teas they used picogreen staining in conjunction with fcm to enumerate bacteria in spiked samples of these beverages yu et al 2015 reported that fcm based tccs were highly correlated with but much faster to obtain than tccs from traditional plate counting they further found that stagnation barrel style dispenser can increase microbial concentration in bottled water just as stagnation in a dwds can increase microbial concentration in tap water regulators should factor in the likelihood of such changes when setting quality criteria many studies emphasized the value of fcm for identifying areas in a dwds exhibiting concerning microbial activity such areas may warrant further examination prest et al 2014 wrote that fcm data can be rapidly collected on samples from a large number of points in a distribution network to provide a first set of information on the bacterial community characteristics thereby revealing areas in the network with excessive bacterial growth or external contamination van nevel et al 2017a similarly observed that fcm is ideally suited for the fast detection of bacterial point contaminations based on this fast first screening of samples the target area to be examined in the drinking water network can be reduced rapidly enabling the exact localization of the source of contamination in a fast and efficient way besmer et al 2017b demonstrated the value of automated fcm for tracking microbial contamination and subsequent shock chlorination of a dwds in real time concluding that there is clear potential for this continuous fcm approach to be further explored as a direct microbial monitor in early warning systems prest et al 2016a b provides additional commentary on the potential of fcm to enhance microbial monitoring in dwds and outlines a systematic approach for integrating the technique with other methods 5 combination and comparison with other indicators because fcm is still a relatively new approach for assessing microbial water quality in water treatment distribution and reuse many studies considered in this review report fcm results alongside other water quality indicators these indicators can validate fcm results provide complementary information or argue for or against the use of fcm in particular applications this section describes the value added and caveats associated with five indicators commonly combined with fcm for water quality analysis information presented is summarized in table 1 5 1 heterotrophic plate count hpc fcm is often compared to heterotrophic plate count hpcs since this method is routinely incorporated in drinking water regulations and used for monitoring drinking water in the united states for instance drinking water must have an hpc of no more than 500 colonies per ml to maintain compliance with the national primary drinking water regulations npdwr because hpc is so widely employed hpc results provide a common basis of comparison across different labs settings and times plate counting is also sometimes considered the gold standard of viability given that any microbe detected through a culture based method is indisputably viable davey 2011 however hpc has several shortcomings relative to fcm three of the most commonly cited are high time requirements hpc takes 3 7 days to deliver results making it less able to detect temporal changes in microbial water quality hammes et al 2010a prest et al 2014 2016c el chakhtoura et al 2015 besmer et al 2017a variable results hammes et al 2008 reported that hpc based tccs of dwtp samples had a standard error of 30 compared with 5 for fcm prest et al 2014 reported a 5 standard error for fcm based tccs collected on drinking water samples as well variability in hpc results can be attributed in part to the use of different protocols in different labs limited detection capacity only about 1 of bacteria in drinking water are cultivable through hpc berney et al 2007 gillespie et al 2014 hammes et al 2010b van nevel et al 2017b all studies included in this review that compared hpc to fcm confirmed that tccs obtained through hpc were a small fraction of tccs obtained through fcm reported discrepancies ranged from one to two log orders of magnitude andreottola et al 2002a zhu et al 2014 to as many as four to five log orders of magnitude hoefel et al 2003 kahlisch et al 2010 2012 depending on various factors that can affect the composition and cultivability of the microbial community in a given water sample e g the presence of vbnc cells the fact that high nutrient concentrations in cultivation media may favor growth of select microbial strains van nevel et al 2017b also writes that fcm is more amenable to automation than hpc can be lower cost and can provide information on sample parameters beyond tcc that hpc cannot transitioning to fcm will be complicated by the fact that as noted above multiple factors can affect composition and cultivability of waterborne microbes meaning that there is no consistent statistical relationship between hpc and fcm yet given the advantages fcm can offer for characterizing microbial water quality the effort may well be worthwhile 5 2 epifluorescence microscopy efm a second common comparison is to efm efm is a relatively well established microbiological technique and like fcm relies on single cell particle fluorescence measurements to examine microorganisms studies reviewed for this article generally achieved similar tccs and iccs using efm and fcm abzazou et al 2015 di et al 2016 huang et al 2015 ma et al 2013 vivas et al 2017 ziglio et al 2002 good agreement has also been reported for efm based and fcm based quantification of viral abundance in water samples brown et al 2014 carreira et al 2015 efm is also a valuable tool for evaluating the success of sample preparation protocols for fcm foladori et al 2010a used efm to enumerate the bacterial aggregates remaining on a 20 μm filter used to remove clogging hazards prior to fcm analysis while studies such as vital et al 2007a and vivas et al 2017 used efm to assess staining efficiency finally efm can be applied to confirm and or provide more information about phenomena observed through fcm di cesare et al 2016 used efm to check the accuracy of fcm based differentiation of single cells and aggregates wang et al 2007 used fcm to enumerate bacteria passing through filters of different pore sizes and then used efm to investigate the morphologies of filterable bacteria fernandes et al 2014 used efm for closer examination of membrane damage detected by fcm in bleach treated salmonella cells they found that many of the cells had only partially compromised membranes resulting in an intermediate fluorescence signal that was difficult to classify using fcm alone but could be interpreted with the assistance of efm imaging the main drawback of efm is that because the method relies on visual inspection and manual counting data analysis is time consuming labor intensive and subject to human error wang et al 2010b reported the standard deviation of results collected on data from replicate samples to be 10 for efm but 5 for fcm variability in efm measurements has also been discussed elsewhere seo et al 2010 muthukrishnan et al 2017 because fcm is rapid amenable to automation and as observed in frossard et al 2016 can be better standardized through fixed gating it is viewed by many as an improvement over efm for cell counting nevertheless efm remains valuable as a tool for validating fcm based counts of bacteria viruses and other microorganisms efm can also provide information that could facilitate protocol development for new applications of fcm such as for microbial water quality assessment in dpr scenarios 5 3 molecular techniques pcr dna sequencing gel electrophoresis and other molecular techniques are often used to develop and validate fcm gating strategies and provide deeper insight into the nature of the microbial community in a sample these techniques are sometimes performed following facs to assess sorted fractions kahlisch et al 2010 2012 applied facs on drinking water samples stained with syto9 and pi they then performed rna and dna extraction followed by phylogenetic analysis on both the membrane intact live and membrane compromised dead bacterial fractions they found that the bacterial community structures identified in each fraction were substantially different depending on whether rna based or dna based phylogenetic analysis was used this suggests that concomitant rna and dna analysis conducted alongside fcm are needed to obtain a comprehensive view of the effects that different treatment steps have on microbial consortia kahlisch et al 2012 also commented that their protocol for using fcm to distinguish between live and dead cells could be modified and extended i e by replacing the general bacterial primers they used with group specific primer to specifically monitor pathogens or other bacteria relevant to human health other studies combining facs with molecular techniques illustrate the effects of dwt on specific microbial classes zilles et al 2002a b mcilroy et al 2008 günther et al 2012 mota et al 2012 mehlig et al 2013 and irie et al 2016 each applied facs to enrich target microbial communities in wastewater treatment prior to genetic analysis zilles et al 2002a b and mehlig et al 2013 applied facs to separate paos from activated sludge samples they then used 16s rrna gene sequencing on the separated paos to identify dominant microbial species mcilroy et al 2008 and mota et al 2012 used a similar approach to study respectively gaos and nitrite reducing bacteria in the same günther et al 2012 and irie et al 2016 both combined facs and molecular techniques to determine the phylogenetic identities of cytometrically distinct cell clusters in wwtp samples irie et al 2016 also applied fish to quantify and examine the morphological distribution of accumulibacter a pao and nitrospira a nitrifier cells in each cluster wang et al 2009 applied facs to isolate and enrich lna bacteria in source water and then used a variety of molecular techniques to characterize the enriched samples molecular techniques have also been used in parallel with standard i e non facs fcm to provide additional information on both specific microbial sub groups and entire microbial communities in water samples applications focusing on specific microbial sub groups include identifying bacteria capable of passing through filters with pore sizes in the 0 1 0 45 μm range wang et al 2007 determining phylogeny of ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a suspended carrier biofilm reactor for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification xia et al 2010 studying l pneumophila disinfection andreozzi et al 2016 testing for the presence of 16s rrna markers indicating fecal contamination baumgartner et al 2016 and studying ozone induced disruption of a particular antibiotic resistance gene czekalski et al 2016 studies combing molecular techniques with fcm examine entire microbial communities in water samples and or to track changes in microbial community composition include tay et al 2002 anneser et al 2010 hammes et al 2011b zheng et al 2011 de roy et al 2012 prest et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 smith et al 2015 yang et al 2015a liu et al 2016 park et al 2016 bai et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and vignola et al 2018 5 4 adenosine tri phosphate atp measurement of atp a molecule commonly referred to as the energy currency of a cell has been used as a fast simple indicator of microbial viability the assay is typically performed by first extracting atp from target cells and then measuring light emission when the extracted atp reacts with a bioluminescent complex protocols are available to distinguish between intracellular and extracellular free atp as nescerecka et al 2016b notes the presence of intracellular atp most likely indicates the presence of viable microorganisms in a sample atp measurement is fast inexpensive and relatively straightforward it has also been shown to signal changes in microbial water quality not detected by hpc prest et al 2014 atp measurement alone is of limited value as a bulk parameter atp levels cannot provide viability information at the single cell level efforts to derive atp cell conversion factors that can be used to obtain cell counts from atp levels are complicated by the fact that atp production varies significantly depending on cell type and cultivation conditions berney et al 2008 hammes et al 2010b müller and bley 2011 accurate assessment of intracellular atp in environmental samples can be further confounded by the presence of free atp substances that affect atp production and degradation and or interfering compounds berney et al 2006 hammes et al 2010b müller and bley 2011 nescerecka et al 2014 2016b lee et al 2016 van nevel et al 2017b atp is therefore best used alongside more sophisticated techniques like fcm for instance atp levels can help determine the extent to which membrane damage detected through fcm actually compromises cell viability nescerecka et al 2014 prest et al 2016c atp can also be used as a quality control measure for fcm analysis given that atp levels correlate well with fcm based tcc and icc berney et al 2008 vital et al 2012a ma et al 2013 nescerecka et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 frossard et al 2016 lee et al 2016 van nevel et al 2017b 5 5 assimilable organic carbon aoc aoc refers to the small fraction of dissolved organic carbon that is readily taken up by microorganisms facilitating growth unlike the other four indicators described in this section aoc measurement does not directly assess the microbial community in a water sample however aoc is a strong indicator of biological stability that is the inability of water to support microbial growth and hence highly relevant to drinking water treatment and distribution aoc is measured by comparing growth of test organisms typically either pseudomonas fluorescens p fluorescens p 17 or spirillum sp strain nox in the water sample of interest to growth on pure solutions of acetate or oxalate in the conventional aoc measurement assay microbial growth quantification involves multiple plate based culturing steps and a 9 day incubation period van der kooij et al 1992 fcm has been proposed as a way to decrease time and labor required for the assay by expediting microbial growth quantification this approach was first described by hammes and egli 2005 who found that integrating fcm reduced the time needed to obtain aoc results from several days to 30 40 h they used a natural microbial consortium in lieu of traditional pure cultures of test organisms hammes and egli argued that this substitution yields more realistic results although they acknowledged that use of a mixed culture makes standardization more difficult fcm based aoc measurement has since been used in a variety of water treatment distribution and reuse scenarios including to quantify formation of aoc during disinfection hammes et al 2007 rosenfeldt et al 2009 bazri et al 2012 explore the combined effects of aoc and a disinfectant residual on bacterial growth in drinking water liu et al 2015b assess the influence of aoc on growth of waterborne pathogens vital et al 2007a 2008 2012b and study growth properties of different types of aquatic bacteria wang et al 2007 2009 examine biological stability in full scale drinking water treatment and distribution systems hammes et al 2010a 2011b lautenschlager et al 2013 park et al 2016 prest et al 2016a several groups have adapted this aoc protocol for specific applications bazri and mohseni 2013 developed a modified protocol for use with waters containing a disinfectant residual while elhadidy et al 2016 developed a modified protocol for use with waters characterized by high organic and particle content aggarwal et al 2015 demonstrated that fcm based aoc measurement also works with the pure p fluorescens and spirillum nox pure cultures used in the conventional assay 6 cross cutting methodological considerations this section describes three cross cutting topics relevant to nearly all applications of fcm for water quality assessment sample preparation sample staining and interpretation of viability data 6 1 sample preparation preparation of water or wastewater samples for fcm analysis may involve one or more of the following fixation to preserve cell properties during subsequent preparation and analysis dilution or enrichment to achieve an appropriate particle concentration disaggregation of particle clumps and filtration to remove clogging hazards and or non target particles samples may also be stained with one or more fluorescent stains or antibodies to distinguish different populations section 6 2 the optimal sample preparation protocol for any experiment depends on sample type target particle s and instrumentation used the literature nevertheless reveals some best practices for preparing water samples for fcm analysis with regard to each of the aforementioned steps fixation fixation may not be necessary for online fcm or for fcm analyses performed shortly after sample collection but becomes important when samples are held for extended periods of time however fixation can have side effects that impede fcm including increased autofluorescence alteration of fluorescent staining efficiency greater particle aggregation distortion of light scatter via altered refractive indices and loss of double stranded dna günther et al 2008 hyka et al 2013 certain fixatives and fixation procedures can also affect membrane integrity morphology and other cell characteristics that may be the target of fcm analysis chao and zhang 2011 hu et al 2017 fcm protocols involving fixation should be optimized to avoid or minimize such effects see for instance günther et al 2008 hyka et al 2013 and huang et al 2015 dilution and enrichment overly high and overly low particle concentrations can both cause problems for fcm based water quality assessment at overly high concentrations particle coincidence two or more particles passing through an interrogation point simultaneously can affect accuracy and risk of clogging caused by particle clumps increases overly high concentrations can be addressed through dilution phosphate buffered saline and bottled evian water are commonly used as diluents due to their demonstrated history of yielding consistent results there is general consensus that dilution to between 105 and 106 particles ml is sufficient for fcm as long as analysis speed is less than 1000 particles sec at overly low concentrations large sample volumes must be processed to generate sufficient data increasing time and material costs required for fcm analysis there is less agreement on minimum particle concentration although experiments conducted by hammes et al 2008 suggest that a lower limit of 102 particles ml may be appropriate overly low concentrations can be addressed through enrichment strategies such as facs centrifugation and immunomagnetic separation overly high concentrations are most likely to be a problem for fcm based analysis of raw or partially treated wastewater besmer et al 2014 overly low concentrations are not a problem for general microbial assessment of most waters involved in water treatment and reuse scenarios as even finished drinking water normally contains bacterial tccs of 104 105 cells ml hammes et al 2008 an exception is water treated through membrane filtration however pathogenic bacteria and viruses are often present and can pose health risks at concentrations well below 102 pathogens ml making fcm based assessment of waterborne pathogens difficult ramírez castillo et al 2015 development of automated dilution and concentration systems is a necessary prerequisite to using fcm for online monitoring of samples containing overly high or low particle concentrations disaggregation fcm analysis requires samples consisting mostly of a single particle suspension particle aggregation can result in inaccurate enumeration and identification in water quality assessment treatment is often needed to disrupt activated sludge flocs biofilms and similar aggregates in wastewater and natural water samples disaggregation is widely achieved via sonication though this method requires care to avoid inadvertent cell death or damage bricheux et al 2013 foladori et al 2007 found that a specific energy e s of 80 kj l is sufficient to achieve disaggregation of activated sludge flocs without adversely impacting individual cells abzazou et al 2015 disaggregated particles in activated sludge samples by first passing samples ten times through a syringe needle and then repeatedly sonicating they reported this two step disaggregation procedure to be more reliable in terms of maintaining bacterial viability filtration the maximum particle size that can pass through a flow cytometer without presenting a clogging hazard varies by instrument and manufacturer but tends to be around 40 μm filters with smaller pore sizes are used to sort out non target particles prior to fcm analysis for instance filters with 0 1 0 45 μm pore sizes are commonly applied to exclude or retain bacteria while 30 kda centrifugal filters have been applied to retain viruses huang et al 2015 2016 however filtration size thresholds are imperfect wang et al 2007 found that a significant fraction of freshwater bacteria can pass through 0 45 0 22 and 0 1 μm filters they reported that bacterial shape influences filterability with slender spiral shaped species more likely to assume an orientation during filtration that enables passage this result means that the performance of filtration protocols needs to be carefully tested rather than merely assumed 6 2 sample staining although fsc and ssc provide some information about the number and type of particles in a sample fcm nearly always also involves one or more fluorescent stains that can distinguish cells from debris specifically identify target cell populations and provide additional information about cell properties table 2 summarizes fluorescent stains commonly used in fcm based microbial water quality assessment note that this table is not exhaustive the literature contains examples of numerous other stains that have been applied albeit less widely to fcm analysis of water samples factors that may influence the selection of a stain or stains and staining protocol include stain brightness stability binding specificity and efficiency including effect of additives and incubation temperature and time excitation emission spectra and potential spectral overlap the reader is referred to general texts on fcm for more detailed discussion of these factors e g shapiro 2003 however articles included in this review do contain several specific insights relevant to staining for fcm based microbial water quality assessment it has been observed that natural waters and other challenging samples may contain aggregates and exhibit nonuniform background fluorescence that can inhibit staining zhou et al 2007 müller and nebe von caron 2010 günther et al 2012 modified staining methods may be useful in distinguishing signal from noise in such samples lenaerts et al 2007 found that using dna based molecular beacons hairpin shaped fluorescent probes that bind specifically to target nucleic acid sequences for fish yielded improved fcm based discrimination of p putida in river water and activated sludge relative to the use of standard linear fluorescent probes yu et al 2015 reported that addition of edta can counteract adverse effects of cations on staining efficiency of nucleic acid stains like picogreen certain water treatment processes may also affect staining as mentioned in section 4 3 2 phe et al 2004 2007 observed that chlorination damages nucleic acids making it more difficult for stains like sybr green ii and pi to bind phe et al 2004 2007 cautioned that potential changes in staining success must be taken into consideration to when analyzing fcm data systematic development and testing of staining protocols as discussed in nescerecka et al 2016a can help avoid these and similar pitfalls 6 3 interpretation of viability data characterization of cellular viability is one of the most common applications of fcm for microbial water quality assessment however there is not a universally accepted definition of viability nor a universally accepted method for assessing it fcm based viability assessment is often achieved by combining a cell permeant nucleic acid stain e g the syto and sybr stain families with the cell impermeant nucleic acid stain pi one problem with this approach is that as discussed further in section 7 1 it cannot be used to assess viral viability yet the assay is imperfect even for analysis of microbes with cell membranes syto sybr and pi staining does not always clearly distinguish between membrane intact and membrane compromised populations intermediate states are often observed berney et al 2007 kaur et al 2013 moreover membrane damage does not correlate perfectly with viability hammes et al 2011a observed that while cells with severely compromised cytoplasmic membranes can be reasonably categorized as dead or dying cells with intact membranes are not always viable for instance uvc disinfection inactivates cells by severely damaging nucleic acids but does not affect membrane integrity kong et al 2016 nie et al 2016 yoon et al 2017 the most convincing viability assessments will combine information on membrane integrity with other stains and microbial water quality indicators as discussed in previous sections 7 research needs 7 1 flow virometry waterborne viruses are a leading cause of illness in the united states varughese et al 2018 according to the national research council viruses are of special interest in potable reuse applications because of their small size resistance to disinfection and their low infectious dose national research council 2012 viruses have historically presented a challenge for fcm based assessment vital et al 2007b small particles tend to generate weak scatter and fluorescence signals that are hard to detect particularly in particle dense environmental samples development of better instrumentation and new fluorescent stains has begun to overcome these technical limitations and enable progress in flow virometry in water quality assessment roudnew et al 2012 2013 2014 and wilhartitz et al 2013 used fcm to characterize viruses or virus like particles in groundwater while ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2016 used fcm to assess viral removal at various stages of wastewater treatment brown et al 2014 applied fcm to quantify viruses in activated sludge li et al 2010 developed an fcm based assay to detect infectious adenoviruses in natural waters the assay involved staining with fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to proteins expressed by infectious adenoviruses followed by facs for rapid quantitation additional discussion on advances in flow virometry for water quality assessment can be found in rockey et al 2018 these few promising examples notwithstanding the literature on applications of fcm for studying viruses in water treatment distribution and reuse is sparse compared to the literature on applications of fcm for studying other microbes in the same of the 145 studies included in this review on specific applications of fcm viruses were a primary focus in only the eight studies cited above additional effort is needed to optimize sample pretreatment and staining protocols for fcm analysis of waterborne viruses there is a particular need for development of fcm based assays for viral infectivity since the combination of syto sybr and pi stains for characterizing bacterial viability does not work on viruses gaudin and barteneva 2015 showed that fcm can be used to rapidly assess infectivity of junin virus based on a combination of virus size and levels of glycoprotein present in the viral envelope as detected using a fluorescently labeled antibody however their approach relied on a flow cytometer customized with an especially powerful laser as well as a digital focusing system to concentrate the interrogation laser beam and hence increase scatter signal such sophisticated instrumentation may be impractical for widespread use further study could yield more accessible viral infectivity assays for waterborne pathogens of interest such assays could be useful in microbial risk assessments they could also provide additional insight into the efficacy of disinfection processes for inactivating viruses since different disinfection processes have been shown to have unique virus inactivation mechanisms wigginton et al 2012 there is an additional need for robust mechanisms to validate that potential virus populations identified through fcm are indeed viruses rather than bacterial debris or other small particles finally pype et al 2016 note that while online fcm has been demonstrated for automated real time detection of waterborne bacteria section 7 3 no studies have yet applied online fcm to viruses 7 2 specific pathogen detection only a fraction of the microorganisms found in environmental waters drinking water and wastewater are potential human health hazards national research council 2012 strategies for rapidly accurately and specifically characterizing these target pathogens are hence valuable for ensuring safe water treatment and water reuse yet the sizeable majority of studies applying fcm for water quality assessment consider broader microbial dynamics e g quantification of bacterial tcc and icc comparison of the populations of hna and lna bacteria analysis of changes in overall cytometric fingerprints moreover work on specific pathogens often examine pathogenic behavior in pure culture see for instance widmer et al 2002 howard and inglis 2003 pianetti et al 2005 allegra et al 2008 bosshard et al 2009 khan et al 2010 wang et al 2010a vital et al 2010 heaselgrave and kilvington 2011 ssemakalu et al 2012 fernandes et al 2014 andreozzi et al 2016 nie et al 2016 while this work can inform development of effective treatment processes it is not as helpful for monitoring table 3 lists studies that have used fcm to detect and or isolate for further analysis particular pathogens in samples of various water types including both spiked and natural samples it is evident that while fcm based protocols for protozoa are reasonably well developed more work needs to be done to develop similar protocols for bacterial and viral pathogens in order to realize the full potential of fcm as a versatile tool for water quality assessment particular emphasis should be placed on developing fcm based protocols for studying and monitoring bacteria and viruses identified by the national research council as known waterborne hazards these are e coli o157 campylobacter jejuni salmonella shigella vibrio legionella noroviruses adenoviruses coxsackieviruses echoviruses hepatitis a virus and astroviruses national reseach council 2012 a critical step will be identifying appropriate preenrichment strategies e g large volume sampling and concentration as waterborne pathogens are often present at concentrations too low for fcm detection expeditious development of such protocols and strategies calls for increased reliance on interdisciplinary collaboration as fcm based methods developed in other settings may with some modification prove useful for water quality assessment for instance protocols documented for using fcm to detect salmonella e coli o157 and shigella in food safety contexts mcclelland and pinder 1994 xue et al 2016 could be adapted for applications in water treatment distribution and reuse 7 3 automation microbial water quality assessment today relies heavily on application of standard culture based methods to samples collected at predetermined intervals this approach is problematic for two reasons first periodic sampling offers only limited insight into the temporal dynamics of microbial communities second culture based methods generally take one to three days to deliver results for most bacteria and even longer for viruses and some bacteria e g up to 10 days for legionella this means that by the time contamination has been detected it is often too late to prevent public exposure hojris et al 2016 fcm is far faster yielding useful information in minutes or hours unfortunately the potential of fcm is limited by the lack of systems that integrate fcm instrumentation with automated sample handling researchers have experimented with coupling flow cytometers to automated sample handling modules since the 1980s broger et al 2011 arnoldini et al 2013 to our knowledge though the only work applying real time fcm rt fcm to microbial water quality assessment has been conducted by the hammes research group this group first described the development and laboratory scale testing of a rt fcm system for microbial water quality assessment in 2012 hammes et al 2012 hammes et al 2012 used this system to collect stable online measurements of bacterial tcc and icc from pure and mixed cultures at concentrations ranging from 103 106 cells ml the group has since demonstrated rt fcm for a variety of applications including examining temporal variability of microbial dynamics in tap water river water and groundwater besmer et al 2014 2016 2017a assessing the effectiveness of membrane filtration at mitigating microbial contamination in river water and wastewater mimoso et al 2015 characterizing microbial variation at a drinking water treatment plant besmer and hammes 2016 and tracking microbial contamination and subsequent chlorination in drinking water besmer et al 2017b this work has facilitated recent progress towards commercialization of automated fcm for microbial water quality assessment the company sigrist now sells the bactosense a fully automated instrument that uses fcm to enable continuous real time monitoring of tcc in drinking water the company oncyt microbiology ag recently began selling an add on module that gives conventional flow cytometers the capacity for automated sample handling and continuous measurements additional work on this front could enable near immediate detection of treatment process failure and could help grow the market for flow cytometers in microbial water quality assessment more research is also needed to support partial automation of fcm analysis in cases for which complete automation is difficult or infeasible e g when specific detection of a particular microbial strain requires a complex staining protocol or when field conditions prevent a cytometer from being installed in situ for instance van nevel et al 2012 explored whether multi well autoloaders can be used in fcm analysis without compromising results they found that autoloaders can be used for accurate tcc measurement in up to 96 samples as long as a reproducible staining protocol and a total measurement time of below 80 min is used further work to automate stand alone components of fcm sample handling and data analysis will make fcm even less time intensive and technically demanding for operators and will limit opportunities for human error 7 4 computational tools for fcm data analysis as discussed in section 2 1 fcm data is typically presented as histograms or two dimensional dot plots showing the intensity and frequency of electronic signals recorded by the instrument s detectors researchers analyze the data by setting gates around data clusters believed to represent populations that share certain characteristics gated populations can then be related to experimental treatments and or outcomes of interest the success of this workflow is heavily reliant on researcher expertise often to a problematic extent one study found that when 15 laboratories analyzed the same samples by fcm the mean inter laboratory coefficient of variation ranged from 17 to 44 gating was found to be a significant source of variability maecker et al 2005 manual analysis of fcm data is also time consuming with the time required for analysis increasing dramatically for experiments involving complex gating strategies multiple stains and or large numbers of samples verschoor et al 2015 multiple software packages and algorithms have been developed over the past decade to provide assistance in fcm data analysis aghaeepour et al 2013 verschoor et al 2015 such computational tools have been used for fcm analysis of environmental samples only infrequently koch et al 2014 identified and compared four computational tools for objectively comparing fcm dot plots generated by microbial biofilms grown from wastewater inocula they found that all four tools were suitable to monitor changes in the microbial communities evidenced by changes in the dot plots de roy et al 2012 and van nevel et al 2017a used computational tools to characterize aquatic microbial communities and to understand how communities respond to various perturbations these few studies illustrate the considerable benefits that such tools could have in water treatment distribution and reuse these include reducing the time and expertise requirements associated with fcm data analysis making it much easier for water treatment plant operators to use fcm for process assessment and control improving reproducibility of results giving regulators and other officials greater confidence in the reliability of water quality reports based on fcm data supporting rt fcm by enabling rapid automated data analysis advancing discovery of biological phenomena and patterns that are difficult to detect through visual inspection alone verschoor et al 2015 there is a particular need for tools to facilitate higher order analysis of fcm data research to date has been largely restricted to examination of patterns in two dimensional data i e dot plots even though fcm trials generate data in three or more dimensions forward scatter side scatter and multiple fluorescence signals fig 4 rich insight into environmental samples could be obtained by using computational tools to analyze all dimensions of an fcm dataset simultaneously researchers have also tended to use algorithmic approaches to characterize entire microbial communities there is unexplored potential to develop algorithms that can rapidly and reliably identify specific microbial species in environmental samples even when the target is obscured by the presence of other microorganisms and particles 7 5 standardization lack of standardization presents a major difficulty in positioning fcm as a routine method for microbial water quality assessment this manifests in several ways first there can be considerable variability among flow cytometers manufactured by different companies and even among different models manufactured by the same company key sources of variability include the number wavelengths and power of excitation lasers the number and types of detectors sample handling systems and options and whether fixed or dynamic detector voltages are used an additional complication is that fcm data is measured in arbitrary units of internal relative intensity this means that a large or highly fluorescent particle will always generate a stronger signal than a small or dim particle but the difference in signal intensity will vary from instrument to instrument as a result the appearance of the cytometric fingerprint generated can be highly instrument dependent fig 5 some progress has been made addressing this challenge prest et al 2013 found that applying a strict reproducible staining protocol and using fixed gating positions for lna and hna bacterial communities enables consistent reliable detection of changes in water quality regardless of instrument used czeh et al 2013 described an instrument independent fluorescence emission calibration protocol to support side by side evaluation of seven flow cytometer models while castillo hair et al 2016 developed software for converting fcm data from arbitrary to calibrated units methods and tools like these merit further exploration and testing on environmental samples in addition researchers should publish experimental data as flow cytometry standard fcs files alongside final scientific papers the fcs format is developed and maintained by the international society for advancement of cytometry and is available as a data export option on nearly all commercially available cytometers fcs files contain key metadata that facilitate comparison among data collected in different experiments and on different instruments compounding challenges associated with instrument variability is variability in documentation of fcm experimental information and protocols most of the articles included in this review include some specifics about the instrument model instrument settings lasers and detectors fluorescent stains and controls used but few provide details on all of the above general guidelines have been suggested e g by alvarez et al 2010 for consistent fcm reporting such guidelines could inform development of a standard fcm reporting template for water quality analyses which would in turn support replicability and rigorous comparison of results another valuable resource would be the creation of a searchable open source database to facilitate exchange and standardization of protocols including protocols published in the scientific literature as well as those such as the one from switzerland s federal office of public health for obtaining tccs and hna lna ratios in drinking water published by regulatory bodies for fcm based microbial water quality assessment 8 conclusion fcm is a relatively new but promising approach for routine microbial water quality assessment fcm s value has already been demonstrated in a variety of applications related to water treatment distribution and reuse and fcm accuracy has been widely validated fcm could be particularly useful in facilitating dpr since the high microbial and pathogenic loads and limited time between treatment and distribution associated with dpr require assays that are fast sensitive and amenable to automation fcm based analysis of water samples generally requires sample pretreatment and fluorescent staining analysis is strengthened when coupled with complementary methods such as hpc efm molecular techniques atp determination and aoc measurement although substantial progress has recently been made in fcm based examination of water samples there are several areas in which more work is needed to realize the full potential of fcm for microbial water quality assessment these include improving detection and characterization of waterborne viruses establishing protocols for specific detection of waterborne pathogens automating sample preparation processing and analysis developing new computational tools and methods to enable rapid objective analysis of fcm data developing standard methods and resources to support

19047,ensuring safe and effective water treatment distribution and reuse requires robust methods for characterizing and monitoring waterborne microbes methods widely used today can be limited by low sensitivity high labor and time requirements susceptibility to interference from inhibitory compounds and difficulties in distinguishing between viable and non viable cells flow cytometry fcm has recently gained attention as an alternative approach that can overcome many of these challenges this article critically and systematically reviews for the first time recent literature on applications of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse in the review we identify and examine nearly 300 studies published from 2000 to 2018 that illustrate the benefits and challenges of using fcm for assessing source water quality and impacts of treatment plant discharge on receiving waters wastewater treatment drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution we then discuss options for combining fcm with other indicators of water quality and address several topics that cut across nearly all applications reviewed finally we identify priority areas in which more work is needed to realize the full potential of this approach these include optimizing protocols for fcm based analysis of waterborne viruses optimizing protocols for specifically detecting target pathogens automating sample handling and preparation to enable real time fcm developing computational tools to assist data analysis and improving standards for instrumentation methods and reporting requirements we conclude that while more work is needed to realize the full potential of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse substantial progress has been made over the past two decades there is now a sufficiently large body of research documenting successful applications of fcm that the approach could reasonably and realistically see widespread adoption as a routine method for water quality

wastewater treatment wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction ensuring safe and effective water treatment distribution and reuse requires robust methods for characterizing and monitoring waterborne microbes including both pathogenic and nonpathogenic protozoa bacteria and viruses methods for assessing pathogenic microbes are needed to protect human health although it is difficult to precisely quantify the prevalence and impacts of waterborne disease pathogens in drinking water have been estimated to cause between 4 and 33 million cases of gastrointestinal illness alone in the united states every year byappanahalli et al 2006 messner et al 2006 at an annual cost of at least 1 billion collier et al 2012 methods for assessing nonpathogenic microbes can help detect meaningful changes in water quality and can help determine the effectiveness or failure of water treatment processes methods for assessing nonpathogenic microbes can also facilitate optimization of water treatment e g by enabling better understanding of microbes involved in activated sludge processes unfortunately current methods used widely to characterize and monitor microbial water quality are imperfect physiochemical parameters such as turbidity are sometimes correlated with microbial contamination but the relationships are scenario specific and hence of limited value allen et al 2008 culture based methods are relatively simple and low cost but limited by low sensitivity and high labor and time requirements ramírez castillo et al 2015 for instance standard methods for culturing bacteria typically take between 24 and 48 h to produce results culturing viruses can take even longer from days to weeks fong and lipp 2005 such high time requirements are particularly problematic for direct potable reuse dpr where highly treated wastewater is fed directly into drinking water systems this engenders concerns that contaminated water could be distributed and consumed before a microbial hazard is noted verhille 2013 in addition waterborne pathogens of concern such as escherichia coli e coli helicobacter pylori h pylori and vibrio cholerae v cholerae frequently exist in a viable but non cultivable vbnc state meaning that culture based methods may yield false negatives ramírez castillo et al 2015 molecular methods include a variety of techniques including polymerase chain reaction pcr oligonucleotide dna microarrays and pyrosequencing these techniques are generally faster and more sensitive than culture based methods can be highly target specific and can provide additional phylogenetic information about pathogens of interest however some molecular methods are particularly susceptible to interference from inhibitory compounds found in environmental samples such as humic acids and metals olivieri et al 2016 ramírez castillo et al 2015 molecular methods such as pcr may also be unable or have only limited ability to distinguish between viable and non viable organisms limiting their value in assessing the efficacy of disinfection processes although further development of molecular methods is likely the limitations of such methods are significant at present flow cytometry fcm offers an alternative approach fcm was first developed in the mid 1900s but initial uses were limited due to relatively high size thresholds for particle detection non specific binding of fluorescent stains and poor sensitivity and computational capacity wang et al 2010b over the past several decades availability of cheaper more powerful instrumentation coupled with the emergence of new analysis techniques has enabled numerous new uses of fcm including uses in water quality assessment scholars have surveyed applications of fcm for aquatic and environmental microbiology bergquist et al 2009 wang et al 2010b discussed types of information obtainable from fcm that may be relevant for analysis of aquatic systems hammes and egli 2010 and reviewed the value of fcm for studying microbial populations and communities müller and nebe von caron 2010 more recently fcm has been identified as a potentially valuable tool for virus enumeration in water reuse rockey et al 2018 we build on previous work by examining how fcm can support and indeed has already been used to support safe effective water treatment distribution and reuse the article is structured as follows section 2 briefly explains how fcm works and how it is already being used to characterize and monitor waterborne microbes sections 3 and 4 systematically review recent literature on fcm research and applications related to source and receiving water quality wastewater treatment drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution sections 5 7 provide critical analysis based on insights from the review section 5 identifies options for combining fcm with other water quality indicators to enhance analysis section 6 addresses three topics sample preparation sample staining and interpretation of viability data that cut across nearly all applications of fcm reviewed section 7 articulates research needs that must be met to realize the full potential of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse 2 background 2 1 principles of fcm flow cytometry fcm refers to analysis of suspended particles based on how they scatter light and or fluoresce when passing through a laser beam such particles include bacteria protozoa viruses cell fragments inorganic debris and so on fig 1 illustrates the basic components of a flow cytometer in brief the instrument draws sample into a focusing chamber that forces suspended particles to align in single file the focused stream is passed through one or more interrogation points at which a laser or other monochromatic light beam individually strikes each particle detectors measure the extent to which each particle scatters light in the forward and side directions and send these measurements to a computer for display and processing fcm data is typically presented as histograms or two dimensional dot plots that visualize the intensity and frequency of signals received on different parameters in general forward scatter fsc signals are related to particle size while side scatter ssc signals are related to particle complexity and granularity fluorescence is also an integral part of flow cytometry fluorescence occurs when certain molecules emit light following excitation by a beam of a compatible wavelength most cells have some natural autofluorescence that can be beneficially exploited for analysis but may also obscure fluorescent signals of interest in most cases autofluorescence alone is not sufficient to conclusively distinguish specific particle populations and or examine parameters of interest it is therefore standard practice for researchers to apply one or more fluorescent stains prior to fcm section 6 2 correctly interpreting fcm data requires researchers to keep many factors in mind some of the most important follow first scatter only indicates relative not absolute particle size and complexity since the intensity of scatter signals depends on factors such as laser wavelength collection angle surface roughness and refractive index of the particle and sheath fluid a particle that generates an fsc signal double that of another particle is not necessarily twice as big second most particles are irregularly shaped meaning that signal intensity depends on the orientation of a particle when it reaches the interrogation point shapiro 2003 third particles may clump together and register to the instrument as a single larger scatter or fluorescent signal fourth particle diameter can affect analysis strategies large diameter particles preferentially scatter light in the forward direction while small diameter particles do not small diameter particles will scatter light weakly and inconsistently generating small amounts of scatter that can be challenging to distinguish from noise finally all particles in a sample including intact cells fragmented cells and inorganic debris scatter light making it difficult to uniquely identify targets from scatter alone 2 2 status of fcm in water quality assessment fcm data can yield a wealth of information about the microbial characteristics of water samples as discussed in hammes and egli 2010 absolute cell counting also known as total cell counting or tcc is one of the most straightforward and common uses of fcm although it may be challenging to obtain reliable counts for environmental samples containing large amounts of non cell particles scatter and fluorescence data indicate cell characteristics such as relative size complexity and nucleic acid content and thus can serve as a unique cytometric fingerprint of the microbial community present in a water sample koch et al 2014 fluorescent stains can be used as indicators of cellular parameters such as membrane integrity and enzymatic activity which in turn can provide deeper insight into the kinetics and efficacy of water treatment processes finally fcm can be used to specifically identify target cells when present in a high enough concentration and when the target can be stained by a fluorescent marker this final function can directly detect microorganisms of concern can detect indicator populations known to be correlated with a target population or as a method for tracking process performance hammes and egli 2010 fcm is now generally accepted as a valuable tool for detection enumeration and characterization of waterborne microbial populations however it is not yet widely used in applied settings e g for ensuring compliance with water quality regulations a notable exception is switzerland in 2012 switzerland s federal office of public health foph published official methods in the swiss food book schweizerisches lebensmittelbuch or slmb a collection of standards to ensure the safety of food and beverages for human consumption for using fcm to obtain total microbial cell counts and determine the ratios of high and low nucleic acid cells in fresh water federal office of public health 2012 the method was recommended for analyzing water in drinking water treatment plants dwtps drinking water distribution systems dwdss and household plumbing among other areas although the slmb was recently discontinued a similar resource is forthcoming from the swiss gas and water association a revised version of the foph s fcm method are currently being developed for inclusion in this resource in the interim the method is still recommended by the swiss government for analysis of drinking water kötzsch et al 2012 while to our knowledge no other federal or state government has formally endorsed fcm for water quality assessment a growing number of utilities and regulatory bodies are exploring the benefits of the approach in california for instance a 2016 report commissioned by the state water resources control board identified fcm as a rapid potentially automatable method for characterizing water samples olivieri et al 2016 scottish water the statutory corporation that provides water and sewage services to the bulk of scotland s population is actively collaborating with cranfield university to develop fcm techniques for full scale dwtps and dwdss scottish water 2014 northumbrian water group a major water supplier in england is working to validate fcm with the ultimate objective of having fcm approved by the united kingdom drinking water inspectorate as an alternative to culture based methods for obtaining total and intact cell counts marsh 2017 as instrumentation improves and protocols become standardized it is likely that fcm for water quality assessment will continue to catch on with practitioners as well as researchers 3 review scope and methods the review process was informed by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis prisma guidelines moher et al 2009 primary research on the use of fcm related to any aspect of drinking water sourcing treatment and distribution and or on any aspect of wastewater treatment and discharge was eligible for inclusion in this review also eligible were studies on optimizing fcm sample preparation and data analysis as long as such studies explicitly defined applications related to water treatment distribution and or reuse studies focusing solely on marine samples were excluded the review was limited to research published in english language peer reviewed journal articles and books from academic publishers only articles and books published between january 2000 and march 2018 were considered both to keep the number of candidate references to a feasible level and because it is only relatively recently that fcm has been considered a practically viable method for water quality assessment in part due to technological advances that have rendered fcm instrumentation better and cheaper the literature search relied on three bibliographic databases web of science pubmed and the university of california library catalog the latter representing the largest university research library in the world was particularly valuable in ensuring as comprehensive a search as possible the search proceeded as follows first each of the databases was queried with the boolean subject search flow cytomet and bacteria or virus or protozoa and drinking water or wastewater or recycled water or groundwater or surface water or activated sludge or biological reactor or potable reuse or nonpotable reuse or source water and monitor or analyz or evaluat this search was intended to capture references focused on using fcm for water quality assessment in particular for studying waterborne microbes the specific query was selected by the authors after running a number of preliminary searches to identify terms that returned the greatest number of relevant results the search resulted in a total of 1375 references 651 from web of science 504 from pubmed and 220 from the university of california library catalog second duplicate references were eliminated leaving 827 references third unique references were screened for relevance to the review eligibility criteria and the citations of each relevant reference were hand scanned to identify additional candidate references for the review full texts of candidates were obtained and confirmed for relevance as well a total of 281 references were ultimately included in the systematic review 145 references describe specific applications of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse section 4 41 references address complementary topics sections 5 7 and 95 references cover both specific applications and complementary topics fig 2 summarizes the systematic review process 4 applications of fcm in water treatment distribution and reuse this section reviews applications of fcm for studying 1 source water quality and impacts of treatment plant discharge on receiving waters 2 wastewater treatment 3 drinking water treatment and 4 drinking water distribution fig 3 breaks down these references by application category note that some references are included in more than one category for convenience we use the term microbial water quality assessment to refer generally to characterization and monitoring of waterborne microbes we note however that no single parameter can provide a complete picture of microbial water quality for instance two samples exhibiting the same tcc could contain different levels of pathogenic bacteria on the other hand two samples devoid of pathogenic bacteria could exhibit different tccs potentially indicating different levels of biological stability 4 1 source waters and receiving waters assessing microbial quality of natural waters e g lakes rivers streams and aquifers is important at the beginning and end of water treatment processes upstream of treatment processes source water quality has considerable influence on the performance of water treatment distribution and reuse processes high quality inputs make it easier to realize high quality products downstream it is necessary to monitor water bodies receiving effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps in order to ensure that the plants are successfully removing microbial hazards that pose human and environmental health risks fcm has been used to analyze microbial quality of various source waters some studies explore the potential of fcm for detecting specific pathogens in source waters and or separating out such pathogens for further analysis these studies include tanaka et al 2000 weir et al 2000 riffard et al 2001 lindquist et al 2001a b chung et al 2004 shapiro et al 2010 and keserue et al 2011 2012b in addition vital et al 2007a 2008 2012b used fcm to investigate growth of v cholerae and e coli o157 under different freshwater conditions tanaka et al 2000 found fcm to be valuable for studying organisms likely to be present in vbnc states in the environment as such organisms are impossible to quantify accurately using plate based methods they further noted that fcm is particularly useful for environmental samples containing a low ratio of target cells to total cells since it is time and labor intensive to analyze these samples via manual count methods such as epifluorescence microscopy efm riffard et al 2001 caution that the presence of debris and autochthonous i e native microflora may interfere with direct application of fcm to natural samples they suggest integrating immunomagnetic separation or similar sample processing to isolate target cells prior to fcm analysis time and labor requirements associated with such processing would present a challenge for certain fcm applications such as online i e real time water quality assessment to facilitate dpr fcm has also been used to characterize microbes in source waters more generally mailloux and fuller 2003 wang et al 2009 anneser et al 2010 leys et al 2010 roudnew et al 2012 2013 2014 smith et al 2012 2015 wilhartitz et al 2013 besmer et al 2016 2017a and page et al 2017 used fcm to examine microbial water quality in groundwater systems stopa and mastromanolis 2001 yang et al 2015a baumgartner et al 2016 and elhadidy et al 2016 used fcm to examine microbial water quality in surface water objectives of these groundwater and surface water studies included characterizing how microbial water quality varies in space time and in response to perturbations like borehole purging aquifer recharge and precipitation events the majority of such studies assess microbial water quality through quantification of bacterial tcc and icc leys et al 2010 roudnew et al 2012 2013 2014 smith et al 2012 2015 and wilhartitz et al 2013 additionally enumerate populations of virus like particles vlps characterized by relatively small size and lower nucleic acid content compared to bacteria some studies go beyond simple enumeration to achieve deeper insight into microbial quality of source waters besmer et al 2016 2017a applied automated fcm to better characterize real time fluctuations in microbial dynamics of source waters wang et al 2009 besmer et al 2016 and elhadidy et al 2016 each distinguished subpopulations representing low nucleic acid lna and high nucleic acid hna bacteria in particular wang et al 2009 used fluorescence activated cell sorting facs a type of fcm in which the cytometer sorts and saves any cells exhibiting scatter and fluorescence properties prespecified by the instrument operator to enrich lna bacteria from source freshwater for further cultivation and examination others have combined fcm with other techniques e g phylogenetic analysis determination of assimilable organic content etc that can provide complementary or confirmatory information section 5 finally fcm has been used to assess how discharge from water treatment plants impacts environmental waters bricheux et al 2013 yang et al 2015b harry et al 2016 and vivas et al 2017 used fcm to assess environmental toxicity of effluent from wwtps e g by tracking changes in the number and viability of microbes in the receiving waterbody yuan et al 2016 did the same for drinking water treatment residue keserue et al 2012b stained with fluorescent antibodies before using fcm to specifically detect c parvum and giardia lamblia in a canal receiving wwtp discharge these researchers generally concluded that fcm is a useful cultivation free approach for such applications the biggest challenge noted was that it may be difficult to apply fcm directly to environmental waters containing and or receiving high particle loads since large particles and particle clumps can clog fluidics and or result in multiple particles passing through an interrogation point simultaneously adequate sample preparation section 6 1 can help reduce the likelihood of clogging or particle coincidence when applying fcm to turbid samples 4 2 wastewater treatment wastewater treatment wwt is the first stage of water reuse wwt processes include preliminary treatment screening to remove large pieces of trash primary treatment settling and skimming to remove suspended solids and floatable contaminants secondary treatment passage through activated sludge reactors and clarifiers to remove organic matter and other contaminants and in some cases tertiary treatment e g disinfection and nutrient removal this section discusses studies involving applications of fcm specific to wwt most such studies focus on characterizing the microbial communities involved in activated sludge processes and or on assessing the viability of activated sludge bacteria as discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 other applications of fcm in wwt are reviewed in section 4 2 3 4 2 1 microbial community characterization many studies have used fcm to help characterize microbial communities in wwt by employing various staining and sorting techniques some rely on facs to sort target cells for further analysis as forster et al 2003 explains isolating certain microbial species and subpopulations assists researchers in identifying keystone microbial species essential to particular wwt processes specific studies using facs to examine specific microbial species and subpopulations involved in wwt include those conducted by hung et al 2002 kawaharasaki et al 2002 zilles et al 2002a b miyauchi et al 2007 günther et al 2009 2012 schroeder et al 2009 kim et al 2010 and mehlig et al 2013 each of these studies focused on polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos used for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr kim et al 2010 initially had trouble with paos forming aggregates that impeded facs but were ultimately able to achieve accurate sorting by using fsc and ssc to exclude events that did not fit a single cell profile mcilroy et al 2008 combined facs with fluorescent in situ hybridization fish a set of techniques involving the use of fluorescent probes that bind specifically to target specific nucleic acid sequences on chromosomes to isolate glycogen accumulating organisms gao from an ebpr system mota et al 2012 did the same to isolate nitrite reducing bacteria from activated sludge irie et al 2016 was able to isolate target accumulibacter and nitrospira microcolonies from activated sludge by facs using only scatter data other studies targeted specific microbial strains or classes using non facs fcm forster et al 2002 used the nucleic acid stain hexidium iodide hi to differentiate gram positive and gram negative bacterial populations in samples taken from multiple stages of a wwtp they found that fcm based measurements of hi fluorescence were able to distinguish gram positive and gram negative bacteria as successfully as traditional microscopy tay et al 2002 used fcm and fish to enumerate cells of bacteroides spp in microbial granules taken from an activated sludge blanket similarly xia et al 2010 used fcm and fish to enumerate potential nitrifiers and denitrifiers in a lab scale suspended carrier biofilm reactor zheng et al 2010 2011 followed a similar process to identify microbial species responsible for filamentous fungal bulking in activated sludge a complication that leads to poor sludge settling during clarification and to investigate how different conditions affect such species brown et al 2014 tested different approaches for using fcm to quantify viruses in activated sludge as is also true for environmental waters researchers agreed on the importance of careful sample preparation section 6 1 for successful fcm analysis of wastewater samples characterized by high particle loads and or high levels of particle aggregation if preparation is adequate the advantages of fcm over conventional methods can be considerable forster et al 2003 observed that fcm allowed analysis of several thousand bacterial events in seconds while traditional gram staining requires growth and subsequent testing which can take days or weeks brown et al 2014 highlighted the high counting efficiency ease of preparation and rapidity of fcm analysis relative to other approaches for studying viruses in activated sludge 4 2 2 viability assessment viability assessment is one of the most common procedures in microbiology it is particularly important when it comes to determining the infectivity risk of pathogenic microorganisms in dpr and other water treatment and reuse scenarios membrane integrity a proxy for bacterial viability can be assessed through fcm by combining a cell permeant nucleic acid stain with a cell impermeant nucleic acid stain as discussed further in section 6 3 the syto and sybr stain families are the most common cell permeant stains 1 1 this article uses the shorthand syto sybr to refer to application of one or more stains in these families while propidium iodide pi is the most common cell impermeant stain falcioni et al 2005 described a step by step protocol for this staining approach and subsequent fcm analysis in wwt studies applying the approach to activated sludge include andreottola et al 2002a b ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010a abzazou et al 2015 lin et al 2016 and collado et al 2017 ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010a and collado et al 2017 also performed additional staining with fluorescein esters and fluorescein derivatives in order to use fcm analysis to identify enzymatically active bacteria moreover ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010a and abzazou et al 2015 explicitly concluded that fcm is a promising method for rapid examination of microbial viability in wastewater samples collado et al 2017 found fcm to be valuable for enumerating vbnc bacteria however they cautioned that fcm may not be sensitive enough for analysis of microbial species important to wwt processes but present at low proportion in activated sludge such as nitrifiers which often account for less than 10 of total bacterial cells in activated sludge reactors viability assays have also been used to assess the response of activated sludge bacteria to specific conditions compounds and processes in the first category specific conditions foladori et al 2015c used fcm to examine viability of bacterial cells exposed to aerobic and anaerobic conditions and wu et al 2015 stained activated sludge samples with pi as well as with the protein annexin v conjugated to the fluorescent protein allophycocyanin to assess viability of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria present under starvation conditions wu et al 2015 further stained with pyronin y to quantify the presence of synthesizing rna as an indicator of metabolic activity in the second category specific compounds liu et al 2013d used the same staining approach annexin v allophycocyanin as wu et al 2015 with fcm to demonstrate that adding ca2 had a significant positive effect on restoring a damaged anammox consortium foladori et al 2014 compared fcm to other approaches for investigating the physiological status of bacteria after toxicant addition they found that fcm based information on physiological effects of toxicants complements toxicity indicators obtained from tests that act on different cellular targets such as respirometry combarros et al 2016a b used fcm to evaluate the toxicity of titanium dioxide tio2 and graphene oxide both increasingly prevalent in advanced manufacturing on pseudomonas putida a bacterial strain often predominant in activated sludge processes foladori et al 2014 and combarros et al 2016a b also applied additional stains with fluorescein esters and fluorescein derivatives for fcm based assessment of toxicant effects on bacterial activity in the third category specific processes foladori et al 2007 2010b prorot et al 2008 2011 and meng et al 2015 used fcm to investigate the impact of sludge reduction processes on bacterial viability prorot et al 2008 2011 focused on thermal treatment meng et al 2015 focused on ozonation foladori et al 2007 focused on sonication and foladori et al 2010b compared the effects of four techniques to reduce excess sludge volume ultrasonication high pressure homogenization thermal treatment and ozonation rossi et al 2007 cunningham and lin 2010 czekalski et al 2016 di et al 2016 and lee et al 2016 used fcm to study wastewater disinfection pang et al 2014 used fcm to examine changes in bacterial viability during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge they found that by coupling fcm with three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy it was possible to completely characterize cell integrity and soluble organics in waste activated sludge in 10 of the time required for conventional methods pang et al 2014 further concluded that fcm based viability and fsc data provided a useful basis for inferring how bacterial flocs disaggregate during degradation of waste activated sludge yankey et al 2012 stained with syto 9 and pi combined with fcm to evaluate the success of thermal treatment on inactivating e coli isolated from sewage sludge 4 2 3 other applications other documented uses of fcm in wastewater analysis are highly diverse underscoring the flexibility of fcm as a tool for studying validating and monitoring wwt processes mezzanotte et al 2004 li et al 2007 manti et al 2008 muela et al 2011 ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2016b used fcm to investigate changes in wastewater quality at multiple stages and over time in full scale wwtps all quantified changes in bacterial tcc and icc with ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2016b also using fcm to examine virus removal muela et al 2011 compared fcm results to numerous other and microbiological parameters they concluded that microbiological parameters are essential to monitoring wwtp performance that quantification of active bacteria is an important microbiological indicator to track and that fcm is a useful tool for tracking it malaeb et al 2013 arends et al 2014 foladori et al 2015a di et al 2016 and bai et al 2017 each used fcm to assess the performance of relatively novel approaches to wwt respectively a microbial fuel cell membrane bioreactor constructed wetlands in combination with bioelectrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide constructed wetlands alone vermifiltration for sludge reduction and the introduction of plants into activated sludge reactors additional applications include assessment of wastewater toxicity shrivastava et al 2017 plasmid conjugation and horizontal genetic transfer in activated sludge pei and gunsch 2009 small particle removal in wwt eisenmann et al 2001 ivanov et al 2004 and the extent to which extraction of extracellular polymeric substances from an activated sludge reactor for further study affects bacterial viability in the reactor guo et al 2014 4 3 drinking water treatment for some water reuse applications standard wastewater treatment may be sufficient to achieve water quality targets for others such as dpr it is necessary to incorporate additional dwt processes including filtration and disinfection for pathogen removal this section discusses the use of fcm in both such applications as well as in assessing the broader effectiveness of dwt trains over multiple stages 4 3 1 filtration one group of studies on fcm applications in dwt focused on evaluating performance of filtration units this group can be subdivided into two categories studies concerning packed bed filtration and studies concerning membrane filtration the first category includes studies conducted by persson et al 2005 velten et al 2007 magic knezev et al 2014 casentini et al 2016 frossard et al 2016 and vignola et al 2018 persson et al 2005 examined the performance of granular activated carbon gac and expanded clay beds they used fcm scatter and fluorescence data to quantify percent reduction of autofluorescent microalgae and total particles from untreated surface water as well as percent reduction of fluorescent microspheres and salmonella typhimurium bacteriophages added in challenge tests velten et al 2007 combined fcm with adenosine tri phosphate atp analysis to investigate biofilm formation during gac start up magic knezev et al 2014 obtained fcm based tccs upstream and downstream of three sand filtration systems in order to determine the efficacy of filtration on improving microbial water quality vignola et al 2018 did the same to study the effect of biofilms in quartz sand and gac packed beds frossard et al 2016 used fcm to enumerate bacteria in sludge removed from a sand filter at a dwt plant and casentini et al 2016 applied fcm to examine microbial transport dynamics in a field scale filter that used zero valent iron for arsenic removal these studies demonstrate the value of fcm in confirming filter performance in water treatment and reuse applications the second category includes studies on microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis ro wang et al 2007 used fcm to quantify the fractions of various bacterial populations in natural freshwater able to pass through 0 1 0 2 and 0 45 μm pore size microfilters they found a significant fraction of natural freshwater bacterial communities is able to pass through such microfilters with bacterial shape being a major determinant of likelihood of passage this suggests that dwtps relying heavily on microfilters to achieve treatment goals may need to more carefully monitor filtrate to ensure that target bacteria are being excluded and adequate microbial water quality is being achieved wang et al 2008 later applied fcm to quantify total particle removal and changes in the lna hna ratio in groundwater passed through industrial scale microfiltration cartridges yu et al 2014 used fcm to study microbes that cause fouling of ultrafiltration membranes in dwt in particular they employed dual staining to assess the extent to which addition of naclo compromised bacterial membrane integrity since damaged cells are less able to form flocs that cause fouling mimoso et al 2015 performed online fcm section 7 3 to monitor changes in tcc and the lna hna ratio in water passed through a gravity driven ultrafiltration membrane liu et al 2017a applied fcm to examine cell breakage and membrane fouling in ultrafiltration treatment of cyanobacteria laden surface water habimana et al 2014 performed similar experiments to study biofilm formation on nanofiltration membranes used in the polishing stage of dwt finally dixon et al 2012 and huang et al 2015 used fcm to study ro dixon et al 2012 applied fcm to rapidly detect biofouling of ro membranes used in desalination while huang et al 2015 relied on fcm to quantify virus removal by ro in an advanced water reuse facility both concluded that fcm alone was insufficient for these applications dixon et al 2012 observed that it is difficult to separate changes in tcc caused by membrane biofouling from changes caused by membrane failure and or fluctuations in influent quality huang et al 2015 found that fcm can reliably quantify virus concentration changes in water reclamation processes however both dixon et al 2012 and huang et al 2015 suggested combining fcm with other tests including measurement of bacterial regrowth potential brp measurement of total organic carbon toc and dynamic light scattering dls to provide a more complete picture of ro performance 4 3 2 disinfection the majority of studies using fcm to examine individual dwt processes focus on disinfection disinfection is especially important process in dpr where the lack of an environmental buffer that is a lake river aquifer or other water body to which water is detained prior to entering a dwtp renders effective tertiary treatment critical disinfection studies can be grouped into several sub categories the first category comprises studies that examine the effect of disinfection for inactivating one or more specific waterborne pathogens usually though not exclusively in pure culture most studies combined pi with a syto or sybr stain to assess disinfection impacts on cellular membrane integrity this method was employed by widmer et al 2002 to study the effect of ozonation on giardia lamblia cysts by howard and inglis 2003 to study the effect of free chlorine on burkholderia pseudomallei by hwang et al 2006a b to study the effect of copper and silver on l pneumophila and pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa by giao et al 2009 to study the effect of chlorine on l pneumophila by bosshard et al 2009 to study the effect of solar disinfection on salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri by joyce et al 2011 to study the effect of sonication on e coli and klebsiella pneumonia by ssemakalu et al 2012 to study the effect of solar radiation on multiple strains of vibrio cholerae by carré et al 2013 to study the effect of tio2 on staphylococcus aureus s aureus and p aeruginosa by helmi et al 2015 to study the effect of chlorine on enterococcus faecalis by andreozzi et al 2016 to study the potential of two specialized classes of molecules polyamidoamine dendrimers and polyamino phenolic ligands to remove l pneumophila and by nie et al 2016 to study the effect of chlorine chloramine and ultraviolet uv radiation on s aureus nie et al observed that uv disinfection inactivates cells without affecting membrane integrity making uv induced viability losses more difficult to detect through fcm some studies use alternative fcm based methods to examine the effect of disinfection on specific pathogens for instance tang et al 2005 used fluorescent microspheres to model the inactivation of c parvum oocysts by ozonation noting that loss in microsphere fluorescence intensity has been previously demonstrated to serve as a good surrogate for loss of c parvum viability heaselgrave and kilvington 2011 used scatter data autofluorescence data and pi staining to assess the impact of solar disinfection on viability of giardia entamoeba invadens and c parvum the second category comprises studies that examine the effect of disinfection on cellular integrity of microcystis aeruginosa microcystis since microcystis and other cyanobacteria commonly found in drinking water release toxic metabolites when lysed the combination of syto sybr and pi staining does not work as well for assessing viability of microalgae as it does for assessing viability of other cell types because pi red fluorescence interferes with autofluorescence of photosynthetic pigments that can be used to detect microalgae hyka et al 2013 instead nearly all studies examining microcystis viability stain with sytox green another cell impermeant nucleic acid stain this method was used by daly et al 2007 and fan et al 2016 to study the effect of chlorine on microcystis by ho et al 2010 to study the effect of chloramine by fan et al 2013a b to compare the effects of copper sulphate chlorine potassium permanganate hydrogen peroxide and ozone by zhou et al 2014 to study the effects of potassium ferrate vi and by qi et al 2016 to study the effect of kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the only major challenge identified in applying fcm for microcystis viability analysis came from fan et al 2016 fan et al 2016 observed that because fcm is not well suited to analysis of particles larger than about 50 μm applying fcm to environmental samples requires some sort of dispersion method e g syringe aspiration dispersion to break up microcystis colonies commonly found in non lab settings the sytox green staining method was also used by liu et al 2017a who used fcm to examine microcystis cell breakage caused by ultrafiltration and by liu et al 2015a who compared fcm to other indicators potassium release and dissolved organic carbon release of microcystis cell breakage the latter study found that relative to the other indicators considered fcm has the broadest application scope and the fewest influencing factors making it a superior choice the third category comprises studies that use fcm to characterize the effects of disinfection on microbial communities rather than specific microbial species in drinking water most of these studies examine how disinfection reduces tcc and icc for natural microbial consortia and or for pure cultures of indicator non pathogenic bacteria using the combination of syto sybr and pi staining this approach was used by cunningham et al 2008 to study the effects of chlorine iodine and silver by wang et al 2010a to compare the effects of chemically and electrochemically dosed chlorine by ramseier et al 2011 to compare the effects of ozone chlorine chlorine dioxide monochloramine ferrate vi and permanganate by kaur et al 2013 to study the effects of ultraviolet radiation and multiple concentrations of tio2 by rezaeinejad and ivanov 2013 liu et al 2015b and nescerecka et al 2016b to study the effects of chlorine by berney et al 2006 and bigoni et al 2014 to study the effects of solar disinfection by mikula et al 2014 to study the effects of phthalocyanines photosensitive molecules that produce strong oxidizing agents with cytotoxic effects by lohwacharin et al 2015 to study the effects of residual ozone and chlorine on bacterial growth in biological activated carbon filters by kong et al 2016 to study the effect of uv radiation and chlorine on bacillus subtilis and by deng et al 2017 to study the effect of a graphene sponge decorated with copper nanoparticles some disinfection studies do not fit into any of the aforementioned categories hammes et al 2007 relied on scatter and autofluorescence data to study how ozonation disrupts algae they specifically examined scenedesmus vacuolatus as a representative for other types of algae commonly found in drinking water two studies laingam et al 2012 yang et al 2014 used fcm to evaluate the toxicity of disinfection byproducts produced from chlorination or chloramination of drinking water they both found that some of these byproducts were toxic to mammalian cells this suggests that chemical disinfection should be carried out with caution particularly when treating waters destined for direct human consumption in two other studies bazri et al 2012 and bazri and mohseni 2013 tested and described an approach for using fcm to assess the assimilable organic carbon aoc content of water following uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 disinfection finally yoon et al 2017 used fcm to help assess the efficiency of chlorine uv and uv h2o2 disinfection in inactivating plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance genes args by damaging arg amplicons yoon et al noted that while chlorine disinfection causes significant membrane damage detectable through fcm uv and uv h2o2 disinfection does not one challenge associated with fcm based assessment of disinfection efficacy is that membrane integrity stains do not always clearly distinguish between live and dead populations see section 6 3 a second is that disinfection processes that damage dna such as chlorination have also been shown to affect binding of membrane integrity stains to nucleic acids phe et al 2004 2007 these challenges can be addressed by using other stains to provide a more complete picture of whether and how disinfection is succeeding for example berney et al 2006 evaluated the effects of solar disinfection by applying fcm after staining with ethidium bromide eb to evaluate efflux pump activity dibac4 3 bis 1 3 dibutylbarbituric acid trimethine oxonol to evaluate membrane potential and 2 nbdg 2 n 7 nitrobenz 2 oxa 1 3 diazol 4 yl amino 2 deoxy d glucose to evaluate glucose uptake they found that loss of efflux pump activity membrane potential and cultivability decreased significantly at a uva fluence i e time integrated flux of 1500 kj m2 while cell membranes only became permeable at a fluence of 2500 kj m2 fcm can also be combined with other indicators of cellular activity and viability to study disinfection as discussed further in section 5 the overall takeaway is that there is no one size fits all approach for using fcm to assess microbial water quality following different types of disinfection processes 4 3 3 multistage studies numerous researchers applied fcm combined with syto or sybr staining to quantify tcc removal by multiple stages in one or more dwtps in australia switzerland the netherlands italy south korea and china these researchers include hoefel et al 2005b hammes et al 2008 ho et al 2012 vital et al 2012b helmi et al 2014 foladori et al 2015b besmer and hammes 2016 park et al 2016 li et al 2017 and wang et al 2017 some of these studies applied fcm to examine other indicators of treatment effectiveness as well such as changes in viability activity and number of total coliforms there was consensus that fcm is a valuable tool for assessing microbial water quality in dwtps and for facilitating design and optimization of treatment strategies helmi et al 2014 and foladori et al 2015b both noted that fcm analyses are less labor intensive than alternative methods and that since fcm consumables costs are low fcm can be more cost effective if enough analyses are performed to justify initial investments in instrumentation hammes et al 2008 commented that while fcm based quantification of tcc changes is a good baseline descriptive parameter of dwt processes it is important to remember that tcc includes inactive and dead cells it is therefore often necessary to supplement tcc with viability assessments particularly for disinfection processes 4 4 drinking water distribution changes in water quality throughout drinking water distribution systems dwds have long been overlooked 2 2 we use the term drinking water distribution system to refer to all infrastructure used to transport water from treatment plant to end user including water mains smaller pipes and household plumbing as fabris et al 2016 writes t he aim should be to provide high quality water at the customer tap while in reality the goal is commonly rationalized to a more achievable target of providing high quality water leaving the water treatment plant the availability of more sophisticated instrumentation has allowed greater insight into dwds with a greater focus on the distribution systems as a dynamic rather than static infrastructure component this recent focus on applying advanced analytical methods to dwds is evident in the fcm literature of the 35 studies we identified that use fcm to study water in dwds all but four were published in 2010 or later nearly all of these used a syto or sybr stain more commonly sybr to stain samples from dwds to obtain bacterial tcc and many also stained with pi to obtain bacterial icc the one exception is lin et al 2017 who instead used crystal violet as the working stain for their study of the effect of sodium hypochlorite on biofilms in dwds lin et al 2017 did not provide any explicit reasoning for departing from convention many researchers have used fcm to study how different factors affect microbial growth in dwds hoefel et al 2005a rosenfeldt et al 2009 gillespie et al 2014 nescerecka et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 huang et al 2016 lin et al 2017 and liu et al 2017b each used fcm to compare the efficacy of different types of disinfectant residual in limiting microbial growth in dwds and or to examine changes in microbial water quality associated with residual loss other researchers have used fcm to examine how microbial communities grow and change in dwds in the absence of a disinfectant residual these include hammes et al 2010a vital et al 2012a lautenschlager et al 2013 liu et al 2013a b c prest et al 2014 wen et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 fabris et al 2016 liu et al 2016 prest et al 2016c sawade et al 2016 van nevel et al 2016 2017a and waller et al 2018 appenzeller et al 2002 did not study bacterial growth per se but did use fcm to investigate the effect of phosphate addition on limiting bacterial adhesion to corroded pipes in a dwds studies cited in this paragraph generally found fcm valuable for detecting changes in microbial communities difficult to detect otherwise a final category of studies applied fcm to characterize microbial characteristics of water directly available for human consumption most studies in this category including berney et al 2008 lautenschlager et al 2010 kahlisch et al 2010 2012 lipphaus et al 2014 and zhang et al 2015 used fcm to analyze tap water water exiting dwds each of these researchers employed syto sybr combined with pi staining to obtain tcc and icc kahlisch et al 2010 2012 also used facs to separate bacteria for subsequent phylogenetic analysis one key takeaway noted repeatedly in these studies is that the microbial characteristics of water exiting a tap can be quite different from the characteristics of water exiting a dwtp this is attributable to microbial growth in dwds particularly when water remains stagnant in dwds for a prolonged period of time yu et al 2015 focused not on tap water but on bottled water and teas they used picogreen staining in conjunction with fcm to enumerate bacteria in spiked samples of these beverages yu et al 2015 reported that fcm based tccs were highly correlated with but much faster to obtain than tccs from traditional plate counting they further found that stagnation barrel style dispenser can increase microbial concentration in bottled water just as stagnation in a dwds can increase microbial concentration in tap water regulators should factor in the likelihood of such changes when setting quality criteria many studies emphasized the value of fcm for identifying areas in a dwds exhibiting concerning microbial activity such areas may warrant further examination prest et al 2014 wrote that fcm data can be rapidly collected on samples from a large number of points in a distribution network to provide a first set of information on the bacterial community characteristics thereby revealing areas in the network with excessive bacterial growth or external contamination van nevel et al 2017a similarly observed that fcm is ideally suited for the fast detection of bacterial point contaminations based on this fast first screening of samples the target area to be examined in the drinking water network can be reduced rapidly enabling the exact localization of the source of contamination in a fast and efficient way besmer et al 2017b demonstrated the value of automated fcm for tracking microbial contamination and subsequent shock chlorination of a dwds in real time concluding that there is clear potential for this continuous fcm approach to be further explored as a direct microbial monitor in early warning systems prest et al 2016a b provides additional commentary on the potential of fcm to enhance microbial monitoring in dwds and outlines a systematic approach for integrating the technique with other methods 5 combination and comparison with other indicators because fcm is still a relatively new approach for assessing microbial water quality in water treatment distribution and reuse many studies considered in this review report fcm results alongside other water quality indicators these indicators can validate fcm results provide complementary information or argue for or against the use of fcm in particular applications this section describes the value added and caveats associated with five indicators commonly combined with fcm for water quality analysis information presented is summarized in table 1 5 1 heterotrophic plate count hpc fcm is often compared to heterotrophic plate count hpcs since this method is routinely incorporated in drinking water regulations and used for monitoring drinking water in the united states for instance drinking water must have an hpc of no more than 500 colonies per ml to maintain compliance with the national primary drinking water regulations npdwr because hpc is so widely employed hpc results provide a common basis of comparison across different labs settings and times plate counting is also sometimes considered the gold standard of viability given that any microbe detected through a culture based method is indisputably viable davey 2011 however hpc has several shortcomings relative to fcm three of the most commonly cited are high time requirements hpc takes 3 7 days to deliver results making it less able to detect temporal changes in microbial water quality hammes et al 2010a prest et al 2014 2016c el chakhtoura et al 2015 besmer et al 2017a variable results hammes et al 2008 reported that hpc based tccs of dwtp samples had a standard error of 30 compared with 5 for fcm prest et al 2014 reported a 5 standard error for fcm based tccs collected on drinking water samples as well variability in hpc results can be attributed in part to the use of different protocols in different labs limited detection capacity only about 1 of bacteria in drinking water are cultivable through hpc berney et al 2007 gillespie et al 2014 hammes et al 2010b van nevel et al 2017b all studies included in this review that compared hpc to fcm confirmed that tccs obtained through hpc were a small fraction of tccs obtained through fcm reported discrepancies ranged from one to two log orders of magnitude andreottola et al 2002a zhu et al 2014 to as many as four to five log orders of magnitude hoefel et al 2003 kahlisch et al 2010 2012 depending on various factors that can affect the composition and cultivability of the microbial community in a given water sample e g the presence of vbnc cells the fact that high nutrient concentrations in cultivation media may favor growth of select microbial strains van nevel et al 2017b also writes that fcm is more amenable to automation than hpc can be lower cost and can provide information on sample parameters beyond tcc that hpc cannot transitioning to fcm will be complicated by the fact that as noted above multiple factors can affect composition and cultivability of waterborne microbes meaning that there is no consistent statistical relationship between hpc and fcm yet given the advantages fcm can offer for characterizing microbial water quality the effort may well be worthwhile 5 2 epifluorescence microscopy efm a second common comparison is to efm efm is a relatively well established microbiological technique and like fcm relies on single cell particle fluorescence measurements to examine microorganisms studies reviewed for this article generally achieved similar tccs and iccs using efm and fcm abzazou et al 2015 di et al 2016 huang et al 2015 ma et al 2013 vivas et al 2017 ziglio et al 2002 good agreement has also been reported for efm based and fcm based quantification of viral abundance in water samples brown et al 2014 carreira et al 2015 efm is also a valuable tool for evaluating the success of sample preparation protocols for fcm foladori et al 2010a used efm to enumerate the bacterial aggregates remaining on a 20 μm filter used to remove clogging hazards prior to fcm analysis while studies such as vital et al 2007a and vivas et al 2017 used efm to assess staining efficiency finally efm can be applied to confirm and or provide more information about phenomena observed through fcm di cesare et al 2016 used efm to check the accuracy of fcm based differentiation of single cells and aggregates wang et al 2007 used fcm to enumerate bacteria passing through filters of different pore sizes and then used efm to investigate the morphologies of filterable bacteria fernandes et al 2014 used efm for closer examination of membrane damage detected by fcm in bleach treated salmonella cells they found that many of the cells had only partially compromised membranes resulting in an intermediate fluorescence signal that was difficult to classify using fcm alone but could be interpreted with the assistance of efm imaging the main drawback of efm is that because the method relies on visual inspection and manual counting data analysis is time consuming labor intensive and subject to human error wang et al 2010b reported the standard deviation of results collected on data from replicate samples to be 10 for efm but 5 for fcm variability in efm measurements has also been discussed elsewhere seo et al 2010 muthukrishnan et al 2017 because fcm is rapid amenable to automation and as observed in frossard et al 2016 can be better standardized through fixed gating it is viewed by many as an improvement over efm for cell counting nevertheless efm remains valuable as a tool for validating fcm based counts of bacteria viruses and other microorganisms efm can also provide information that could facilitate protocol development for new applications of fcm such as for microbial water quality assessment in dpr scenarios 5 3 molecular techniques pcr dna sequencing gel electrophoresis and other molecular techniques are often used to develop and validate fcm gating strategies and provide deeper insight into the nature of the microbial community in a sample these techniques are sometimes performed following facs to assess sorted fractions kahlisch et al 2010 2012 applied facs on drinking water samples stained with syto9 and pi they then performed rna and dna extraction followed by phylogenetic analysis on both the membrane intact live and membrane compromised dead bacterial fractions they found that the bacterial community structures identified in each fraction were substantially different depending on whether rna based or dna based phylogenetic analysis was used this suggests that concomitant rna and dna analysis conducted alongside fcm are needed to obtain a comprehensive view of the effects that different treatment steps have on microbial consortia kahlisch et al 2012 also commented that their protocol for using fcm to distinguish between live and dead cells could be modified and extended i e by replacing the general bacterial primers they used with group specific primer to specifically monitor pathogens or other bacteria relevant to human health other studies combining facs with molecular techniques illustrate the effects of dwt on specific microbial classes zilles et al 2002a b mcilroy et al 2008 günther et al 2012 mota et al 2012 mehlig et al 2013 and irie et al 2016 each applied facs to enrich target microbial communities in wastewater treatment prior to genetic analysis zilles et al 2002a b and mehlig et al 2013 applied facs to separate paos from activated sludge samples they then used 16s rrna gene sequencing on the separated paos to identify dominant microbial species mcilroy et al 2008 and mota et al 2012 used a similar approach to study respectively gaos and nitrite reducing bacteria in the same günther et al 2012 and irie et al 2016 both combined facs and molecular techniques to determine the phylogenetic identities of cytometrically distinct cell clusters in wwtp samples irie et al 2016 also applied fish to quantify and examine the morphological distribution of accumulibacter a pao and nitrospira a nitrifier cells in each cluster wang et al 2009 applied facs to isolate and enrich lna bacteria in source water and then used a variety of molecular techniques to characterize the enriched samples molecular techniques have also been used in parallel with standard i e non facs fcm to provide additional information on both specific microbial sub groups and entire microbial communities in water samples applications focusing on specific microbial sub groups include identifying bacteria capable of passing through filters with pore sizes in the 0 1 0 45 μm range wang et al 2007 determining phylogeny of ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a suspended carrier biofilm reactor for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification xia et al 2010 studying l pneumophila disinfection andreozzi et al 2016 testing for the presence of 16s rrna markers indicating fecal contamination baumgartner et al 2016 and studying ozone induced disruption of a particular antibiotic resistance gene czekalski et al 2016 studies combing molecular techniques with fcm examine entire microbial communities in water samples and or to track changes in microbial community composition include tay et al 2002 anneser et al 2010 hammes et al 2011b zheng et al 2011 de roy et al 2012 prest et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 smith et al 2015 yang et al 2015a liu et al 2016 park et al 2016 bai et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and vignola et al 2018 5 4 adenosine tri phosphate atp measurement of atp a molecule commonly referred to as the energy currency of a cell has been used as a fast simple indicator of microbial viability the assay is typically performed by first extracting atp from target cells and then measuring light emission when the extracted atp reacts with a bioluminescent complex protocols are available to distinguish between intracellular and extracellular free atp as nescerecka et al 2016b notes the presence of intracellular atp most likely indicates the presence of viable microorganisms in a sample atp measurement is fast inexpensive and relatively straightforward it has also been shown to signal changes in microbial water quality not detected by hpc prest et al 2014 atp measurement alone is of limited value as a bulk parameter atp levels cannot provide viability information at the single cell level efforts to derive atp cell conversion factors that can be used to obtain cell counts from atp levels are complicated by the fact that atp production varies significantly depending on cell type and cultivation conditions berney et al 2008 hammes et al 2010b müller and bley 2011 accurate assessment of intracellular atp in environmental samples can be further confounded by the presence of free atp substances that affect atp production and degradation and or interfering compounds berney et al 2006 hammes et al 2010b müller and bley 2011 nescerecka et al 2014 2016b lee et al 2016 van nevel et al 2017b atp is therefore best used alongside more sophisticated techniques like fcm for instance atp levels can help determine the extent to which membrane damage detected through fcm actually compromises cell viability nescerecka et al 2014 prest et al 2016c atp can also be used as a quality control measure for fcm analysis given that atp levels correlate well with fcm based tcc and icc berney et al 2008 vital et al 2012a ma et al 2013 nescerecka et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 frossard et al 2016 lee et al 2016 van nevel et al 2017b 5 5 assimilable organic carbon aoc aoc refers to the small fraction of dissolved organic carbon that is readily taken up by microorganisms facilitating growth unlike the other four indicators described in this section aoc measurement does not directly assess the microbial community in a water sample however aoc is a strong indicator of biological stability that is the inability of water to support microbial growth and hence highly relevant to drinking water treatment and distribution aoc is measured by comparing growth of test organisms typically either pseudomonas fluorescens p fluorescens p 17 or spirillum sp strain nox in the water sample of interest to growth on pure solutions of acetate or oxalate in the conventional aoc measurement assay microbial growth quantification involves multiple plate based culturing steps and a 9 day incubation period van der kooij et al 1992 fcm has been proposed as a way to decrease time and labor required for the assay by expediting microbial growth quantification this approach was first described by hammes and egli 2005 who found that integrating fcm reduced the time needed to obtain aoc results from several days to 30 40 h they used a natural microbial consortium in lieu of traditional pure cultures of test organisms hammes and egli argued that this substitution yields more realistic results although they acknowledged that use of a mixed culture makes standardization more difficult fcm based aoc measurement has since been used in a variety of water treatment distribution and reuse scenarios including to quantify formation of aoc during disinfection hammes et al 2007 rosenfeldt et al 2009 bazri et al 2012 explore the combined effects of aoc and a disinfectant residual on bacterial growth in drinking water liu et al 2015b assess the influence of aoc on growth of waterborne pathogens vital et al 2007a 2008 2012b and study growth properties of different types of aquatic bacteria wang et al 2007 2009 examine biological stability in full scale drinking water treatment and distribution systems hammes et al 2010a 2011b lautenschlager et al 2013 park et al 2016 prest et al 2016a several groups have adapted this aoc protocol for specific applications bazri and mohseni 2013 developed a modified protocol for use with waters containing a disinfectant residual while elhadidy et al 2016 developed a modified protocol for use with waters characterized by high organic and particle content aggarwal et al 2015 demonstrated that fcm based aoc measurement also works with the pure p fluorescens and spirillum nox pure cultures used in the conventional assay 6 cross cutting methodological considerations this section describes three cross cutting topics relevant to nearly all applications of fcm for water quality assessment sample preparation sample staining and interpretation of viability data 6 1 sample preparation preparation of water or wastewater samples for fcm analysis may involve one or more of the following fixation to preserve cell properties during subsequent preparation and analysis dilution or enrichment to achieve an appropriate particle concentration disaggregation of particle clumps and filtration to remove clogging hazards and or non target particles samples may also be stained with one or more fluorescent stains or antibodies to distinguish different populations section 6 2 the optimal sample preparation protocol for any experiment depends on sample type target particle s and instrumentation used the literature nevertheless reveals some best practices for preparing water samples for fcm analysis with regard to each of the aforementioned steps fixation fixation may not be necessary for online fcm or for fcm analyses performed shortly after sample collection but becomes important when samples are held for extended periods of time however fixation can have side effects that impede fcm including increased autofluorescence alteration of fluorescent staining efficiency greater particle aggregation distortion of light scatter via altered refractive indices and loss of double stranded dna günther et al 2008 hyka et al 2013 certain fixatives and fixation procedures can also affect membrane integrity morphology and other cell characteristics that may be the target of fcm analysis chao and zhang 2011 hu et al 2017 fcm protocols involving fixation should be optimized to avoid or minimize such effects see for instance günther et al 2008 hyka et al 2013 and huang et al 2015 dilution and enrichment overly high and overly low particle concentrations can both cause problems for fcm based water quality assessment at overly high concentrations particle coincidence two or more particles passing through an interrogation point simultaneously can affect accuracy and risk of clogging caused by particle clumps increases overly high concentrations can be addressed through dilution phosphate buffered saline and bottled evian water are commonly used as diluents due to their demonstrated history of yielding consistent results there is general consensus that dilution to between 105 and 106 particles ml is sufficient for fcm as long as analysis speed is less than 1000 particles sec at overly low concentrations large sample volumes must be processed to generate sufficient data increasing time and material costs required for fcm analysis there is less agreement on minimum particle concentration although experiments conducted by hammes et al 2008 suggest that a lower limit of 102 particles ml may be appropriate overly low concentrations can be addressed through enrichment strategies such as facs centrifugation and immunomagnetic separation overly high concentrations are most likely to be a problem for fcm based analysis of raw or partially treated wastewater besmer et al 2014 overly low concentrations are not a problem for general microbial assessment of most waters involved in water treatment and reuse scenarios as even finished drinking water normally contains bacterial tccs of 104 105 cells ml hammes et al 2008 an exception is water treated through membrane filtration however pathogenic bacteria and viruses are often present and can pose health risks at concentrations well below 102 pathogens ml making fcm based assessment of waterborne pathogens difficult ramírez castillo et al 2015 development of automated dilution and concentration systems is a necessary prerequisite to using fcm for online monitoring of samples containing overly high or low particle concentrations disaggregation fcm analysis requires samples consisting mostly of a single particle suspension particle aggregation can result in inaccurate enumeration and identification in water quality assessment treatment is often needed to disrupt activated sludge flocs biofilms and similar aggregates in wastewater and natural water samples disaggregation is widely achieved via sonication though this method requires care to avoid inadvertent cell death or damage bricheux et al 2013 foladori et al 2007 found that a specific energy e s of 80 kj l is sufficient to achieve disaggregation of activated sludge flocs without adversely impacting individual cells abzazou et al 2015 disaggregated particles in activated sludge samples by first passing samples ten times through a syringe needle and then repeatedly sonicating they reported this two step disaggregation procedure to be more reliable in terms of maintaining bacterial viability filtration the maximum particle size that can pass through a flow cytometer without presenting a clogging hazard varies by instrument and manufacturer but tends to be around 40 μm filters with smaller pore sizes are used to sort out non target particles prior to fcm analysis for instance filters with 0 1 0 45 μm pore sizes are commonly applied to exclude or retain bacteria while 30 kda centrifugal filters have been applied to retain viruses huang et al 2015 2016 however filtration size thresholds are imperfect wang et al 2007 found that a significant fraction of freshwater bacteria can pass through 0 45 0 22 and 0 1 μm filters they reported that bacterial shape influences filterability with slender spiral shaped species more likely to assume an orientation during filtration that enables passage this result means that the performance of filtration protocols needs to be carefully tested rather than merely assumed 6 2 sample staining although fsc and ssc provide some information about the number and type of particles in a sample fcm nearly always also involves one or more fluorescent stains that can distinguish cells from debris specifically identify target cell populations and provide additional information about cell properties table 2 summarizes fluorescent stains commonly used in fcm based microbial water quality assessment note that this table is not exhaustive the literature contains examples of numerous other stains that have been applied albeit less widely to fcm analysis of water samples factors that may influence the selection of a stain or stains and staining protocol include stain brightness stability binding specificity and efficiency including effect of additives and incubation temperature and time excitation emission spectra and potential spectral overlap the reader is referred to general texts on fcm for more detailed discussion of these factors e g shapiro 2003 however articles included in this review do contain several specific insights relevant to staining for fcm based microbial water quality assessment it has been observed that natural waters and other challenging samples may contain aggregates and exhibit nonuniform background fluorescence that can inhibit staining zhou et al 2007 müller and nebe von caron 2010 günther et al 2012 modified staining methods may be useful in distinguishing signal from noise in such samples lenaerts et al 2007 found that using dna based molecular beacons hairpin shaped fluorescent probes that bind specifically to target nucleic acid sequences for fish yielded improved fcm based discrimination of p putida in river water and activated sludge relative to the use of standard linear fluorescent probes yu et al 2015 reported that addition of edta can counteract adverse effects of cations on staining efficiency of nucleic acid stains like picogreen certain water treatment processes may also affect staining as mentioned in section 4 3 2 phe et al 2004 2007 observed that chlorination damages nucleic acids making it more difficult for stains like sybr green ii and pi to bind phe et al 2004 2007 cautioned that potential changes in staining success must be taken into consideration to when analyzing fcm data systematic development and testing of staining protocols as discussed in nescerecka et al 2016a can help avoid these and similar pitfalls 6 3 interpretation of viability data characterization of cellular viability is one of the most common applications of fcm for microbial water quality assessment however there is not a universally accepted definition of viability nor a universally accepted method for assessing it fcm based viability assessment is often achieved by combining a cell permeant nucleic acid stain e g the syto and sybr stain families with the cell impermeant nucleic acid stain pi one problem with this approach is that as discussed further in section 7 1 it cannot be used to assess viral viability yet the assay is imperfect even for analysis of microbes with cell membranes syto sybr and pi staining does not always clearly distinguish between membrane intact and membrane compromised populations intermediate states are often observed berney et al 2007 kaur et al 2013 moreover membrane damage does not correlate perfectly with viability hammes et al 2011a observed that while cells with severely compromised cytoplasmic membranes can be reasonably categorized as dead or dying cells with intact membranes are not always viable for instance uvc disinfection inactivates cells by severely damaging nucleic acids but does not affect membrane integrity kong et al 2016 nie et al 2016 yoon et al 2017 the most convincing viability assessments will combine information on membrane integrity with other stains and microbial water quality indicators as discussed in previous sections 7 research needs 7 1 flow virometry waterborne viruses are a leading cause of illness in the united states varughese et al 2018 according to the national research council viruses are of special interest in potable reuse applications because of their small size resistance to disinfection and their low infectious dose national research council 2012 viruses have historically presented a challenge for fcm based assessment vital et al 2007b small particles tend to generate weak scatter and fluorescence signals that are hard to detect particularly in particle dense environmental samples development of better instrumentation and new fluorescent stains has begun to overcome these technical limitations and enable progress in flow virometry in water quality assessment roudnew et al 2012 2013 2014 and wilhartitz et al 2013 used fcm to characterize viruses or virus like particles in groundwater while ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2016 used fcm to assess viral removal at various stages of wastewater treatment brown et al 2014 applied fcm to quantify viruses in activated sludge li et al 2010 developed an fcm based assay to detect infectious adenoviruses in natural waters the assay involved staining with fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to proteins expressed by infectious adenoviruses followed by facs for rapid quantitation additional discussion on advances in flow virometry for water quality assessment can be found in rockey et al 2018 these few promising examples notwithstanding the literature on applications of fcm for studying viruses in water treatment distribution and reuse is sparse compared to the literature on applications of fcm for studying other microbes in the same of the 145 studies included in this review on specific applications of fcm viruses were a primary focus in only the eight studies cited above additional effort is needed to optimize sample pretreatment and staining protocols for fcm analysis of waterborne viruses there is a particular need for development of fcm based assays for viral infectivity since the combination of syto sybr and pi stains for characterizing bacterial viability does not work on viruses gaudin and barteneva 2015 showed that fcm can be used to rapidly assess infectivity of junin virus based on a combination of virus size and levels of glycoprotein present in the viral envelope as detected using a fluorescently labeled antibody however their approach relied on a flow cytometer customized with an especially powerful laser as well as a digital focusing system to concentrate the interrogation laser beam and hence increase scatter signal such sophisticated instrumentation may be impractical for widespread use further study could yield more accessible viral infectivity assays for waterborne pathogens of interest such assays could be useful in microbial risk assessments they could also provide additional insight into the efficacy of disinfection processes for inactivating viruses since different disinfection processes have been shown to have unique virus inactivation mechanisms wigginton et al 2012 there is an additional need for robust mechanisms to validate that potential virus populations identified through fcm are indeed viruses rather than bacterial debris or other small particles finally pype et al 2016 note that while online fcm has been demonstrated for automated real time detection of waterborne bacteria section 7 3 no studies have yet applied online fcm to viruses 7 2 specific pathogen detection only a fraction of the microorganisms found in environmental waters drinking water and wastewater are potential human health hazards national research council 2012 strategies for rapidly accurately and specifically characterizing these target pathogens are hence valuable for ensuring safe water treatment and water reuse yet the sizeable majority of studies applying fcm for water quality assessment consider broader microbial dynamics e g quantification of bacterial tcc and icc comparison of the populations of hna and lna bacteria analysis of changes in overall cytometric fingerprints moreover work on specific pathogens often examine pathogenic behavior in pure culture see for instance widmer et al 2002 howard and inglis 2003 pianetti et al 2005 allegra et al 2008 bosshard et al 2009 khan et al 2010 wang et al 2010a vital et al 2010 heaselgrave and kilvington 2011 ssemakalu et al 2012 fernandes et al 2014 andreozzi et al 2016 nie et al 2016 while this work can inform development of effective treatment processes it is not as helpful for monitoring table 3 lists studies that have used fcm to detect and or isolate for further analysis particular pathogens in samples of various water types including both spiked and natural samples it is evident that while fcm based protocols for protozoa are reasonably well developed more work needs to be done to develop similar protocols for bacterial and viral pathogens in order to realize the full potential of fcm as a versatile tool for water quality assessment particular emphasis should be placed on developing fcm based protocols for studying and monitoring bacteria and viruses identified by the national research council as known waterborne hazards these are e coli o157 campylobacter jejuni salmonella shigella vibrio legionella noroviruses adenoviruses coxsackieviruses echoviruses hepatitis a virus and astroviruses national reseach council 2012 a critical step will be identifying appropriate preenrichment strategies e g large volume sampling and concentration as waterborne pathogens are often present at concentrations too low for fcm detection expeditious development of such protocols and strategies calls for increased reliance on interdisciplinary collaboration as fcm based methods developed in other settings may with some modification prove useful for water quality assessment for instance protocols documented for using fcm to detect salmonella e coli o157 and shigella in food safety contexts mcclelland and pinder 1994 xue et al 2016 could be adapted for applications in water treatment distribution and reuse 7 3 automation microbial water quality assessment today relies heavily on application of standard culture based methods to samples collected at predetermined intervals this approach is problematic for two reasons first periodic sampling offers only limited insight into the temporal dynamics of microbial communities second culture based methods generally take one to three days to deliver results for most bacteria and even longer for viruses and some bacteria e g up to 10 days for legionella this means that by the time contamination has been detected it is often too late to prevent public exposure hojris et al 2016 fcm is far faster yielding useful information in minutes or hours unfortunately the potential of fcm is limited by the lack of systems that integrate fcm instrumentation with automated sample handling researchers have experimented with coupling flow cytometers to automated sample handling modules since the 1980s broger et al 2011 arnoldini et al 2013 to our knowledge though the only work applying real time fcm rt fcm to microbial water quality assessment has been conducted by the hammes research group this group first described the development and laboratory scale testing of a rt fcm system for microbial water quality assessment in 2012 hammes et al 2012 hammes et al 2012 used this system to collect stable online measurements of bacterial tcc and icc from pure and mixed cultures at concentrations ranging from 103 106 cells ml the group has since demonstrated rt fcm for a variety of applications including examining temporal variability of microbial dynamics in tap water river water and groundwater besmer et al 2014 2016 2017a assessing the effectiveness of membrane filtration at mitigating microbial contamination in river water and wastewater mimoso et al 2015 characterizing microbial variation at a drinking water treatment plant besmer and hammes 2016 and tracking microbial contamination and subsequent chlorination in drinking water besmer et al 2017b this work has facilitated recent progress towards commercialization of automated fcm for microbial water quality assessment the company sigrist now sells the bactosense a fully automated instrument that uses fcm to enable continuous real time monitoring of tcc in drinking water the company oncyt microbiology ag recently began selling an add on module that gives conventional flow cytometers the capacity for automated sample handling and continuous measurements additional work on this front could enable near immediate detection of treatment process failure and could help grow the market for flow cytometers in microbial water quality assessment more research is also needed to support partial automation of fcm analysis in cases for which complete automation is difficult or infeasible e g when specific detection of a particular microbial strain requires a complex staining protocol or when field conditions prevent a cytometer from being installed in situ for instance van nevel et al 2012 explored whether multi well autoloaders can be used in fcm analysis without compromising results they found that autoloaders can be used for accurate tcc measurement in up to 96 samples as long as a reproducible staining protocol and a total measurement time of below 80 min is used further work to automate stand alone components of fcm sample handling and data analysis will make fcm even less time intensive and technically demanding for operators and will limit opportunities for human error 7 4 computational tools for fcm data analysis as discussed in section 2 1 fcm data is typically presented as histograms or two dimensional dot plots showing the intensity and frequency of electronic signals recorded by the instrument s detectors researchers analyze the data by setting gates around data clusters believed to represent populations that share certain characteristics gated populations can then be related to experimental treatments and or outcomes of interest the success of this workflow is heavily reliant on researcher expertise often to a problematic extent one study found that when 15 laboratories analyzed the same samples by fcm the mean inter laboratory coefficient of variation ranged from 17 to 44 gating was found to be a significant source of variability maecker et al 2005 manual analysis of fcm data is also time consuming with the time required for analysis increasing dramatically for experiments involving complex gating strategies multiple stains and or large numbers of samples verschoor et al 2015 multiple software packages and algorithms have been developed over the past decade to provide assistance in fcm data analysis aghaeepour et al 2013 verschoor et al 2015 such computational tools have been used for fcm analysis of environmental samples only infrequently koch et al 2014 identified and compared four computational tools for objectively comparing fcm dot plots generated by microbial biofilms grown from wastewater inocula they found that all four tools were suitable to monitor changes in the microbial communities evidenced by changes in the dot plots de roy et al 2012 and van nevel et al 2017a used computational tools to characterize aquatic microbial communities and to understand how communities respond to various perturbations these few studies illustrate the considerable benefits that such tools could have in water treatment distribution and reuse these include reducing the time and expertise requirements associated with fcm data analysis making it much easier for water treatment plant operators to use fcm for process assessment and control improving reproducibility of results giving regulators and other officials greater confidence in the reliability of water quality reports based on fcm data supporting rt fcm by enabling rapid automated data analysis advancing discovery of biological phenomena and patterns that are difficult to detect through visual inspection alone verschoor et al 2015 there is a particular need for tools to facilitate higher order analysis of fcm data research to date has been largely restricted to examination of patterns in two dimensional data i e dot plots even though fcm trials generate data in three or more dimensions forward scatter side scatter and multiple fluorescence signals fig 4 rich insight into environmental samples could be obtained by using computational tools to analyze all dimensions of an fcm dataset simultaneously researchers have also tended to use algorithmic approaches to characterize entire microbial communities there is unexplored potential to develop algorithms that can rapidly and reliably identify specific microbial species in environmental samples even when the target is obscured by the presence of other microorganisms and particles 7 5 standardization lack of standardization presents a major difficulty in positioning fcm as a routine method for microbial water quality assessment this manifests in several ways first there can be considerable variability among flow cytometers manufactured by different companies and even among different models manufactured by the same company key sources of variability include the number wavelengths and power of excitation lasers the number and types of detectors sample handling systems and options and whether fixed or dynamic detector voltages are used an additional complication is that fcm data is measured in arbitrary units of internal relative intensity this means that a large or highly fluorescent particle will always generate a stronger signal than a small or dim particle but the difference in signal intensity will vary from instrument to instrument as a result the appearance of the cytometric fingerprint generated can be highly instrument dependent fig 5 some progress has been made addressing this challenge prest et al 2013 found that applying a strict reproducible staining protocol and using fixed gating positions for lna and hna bacterial communities enables consistent reliable detection of changes in water quality regardless of instrument used czeh et al 2013 described an instrument independent fluorescence emission calibration protocol to support side by side evaluation of seven flow cytometer models while castillo hair et al 2016 developed software for converting fcm data from arbitrary to calibrated units methods and tools like these merit further exploration and testing on environmental samples in addition researchers should publish experimental data as flow cytometry standard fcs files alongside final scientific papers the fcs format is developed and maintained by the international society for advancement of cytometry and is available as a data export option on nearly all commercially available cytometers fcs files contain key metadata that facilitate comparison among data collected in different experiments and on different instruments compounding challenges associated with instrument variability is variability in documentation of fcm experimental information and protocols most of the articles included in this review include some specifics about the instrument model instrument settings lasers and detectors fluorescent stains and controls used but few provide details on all of the above general guidelines have been suggested e g by alvarez et al 2010 for consistent fcm reporting such guidelines could inform development of a standard fcm reporting template for water quality analyses which would in turn support replicability and rigorous comparison of results another valuable resource would be the creation of a searchable open source database to facilitate exchange and standardization of protocols including protocols published in the scientific literature as well as those such as the one from switzerland s federal office of public health for obtaining tccs and hna lna ratios in drinking water published by regulatory bodies for fcm based microbial water quality assessment 8 conclusion fcm is a relatively new but promising approach for routine microbial water quality assessment fcm s value has already been demonstrated in a variety of applications related to water treatment distribution and reuse and fcm accuracy has been widely validated fcm could be particularly useful in facilitating dpr since the high microbial and pathogenic loads and limited time between treatment and distribution associated with dpr require assays that are fast sensitive and amenable to automation fcm based analysis of water samples generally requires sample pretreatment and fluorescent staining analysis is strengthened when coupled with complementary methods such as hpc efm molecular techniques atp determination and aoc measurement although substantial progress has recently been made in fcm based examination of water samples there are several areas in which more work is needed to realize the full potential of fcm for microbial water quality assessment these include improving detection and characterization of waterborne viruses establishing protocols for specific detection of waterborne pathogens automating sample preparation processing and analysis developing new computational tools and methods to enable rapid objective analysis of fcm data developing standard methods and resources to support

19048,hepatitis e virus hev is an enteric virus divided into eight genotypes genotype 1 g1 and g2 are specific to humans g3 g4 and g7 are zoonotic genotypes infecting humans and animals transmission to humans through water has been demonstrated for g1 and g2 mainly in developing countries but is only suspected for the zoonotic genotypes thus the water related hev hazard may be due to human and animal faeces the high hev genetic variability allows considering the presence in wastewater of not only different genotypes but also quasispecies adding even greater diversity moreover recent studies have demonstrated that hev particles may be either quasi enveloped or non enveloped potentially implying differential viral behaviours in the environment the presence of hev has been demonstrated at the different stages of the water cycle all over the world especially for hev g3 in europe and the usa concerning hev survival in water the virus does not have higher resistance to inactivating factors heat uv chlorine physical removal compared to viral indicators ms2 phage or other highly resistant enteric viruses hepatitis a virus but the studies did not take into account genetic genogroups quasispecies or structural quasi or non enveloped forms hev variability viral variability could indeed modify hev persistence in water by influencing its interaction with the environment its infectivity and its pathogenicity and subsequently its transmission by water the cell culture methods used to study hev survival still have drawbacks challenging virus cultivation time consuming lack of sensitivity as explained in the present review the issue of hev transmission to humans through water is similar to that of other enteric viruses because of their similar or lower survival hev transmission to animals through water and how the virus variability affects its survival and transmission remain to be investigated graphical abstract image 1 keywords hepatitis e virus hev water occurrence variability transmission survival 1 introduction hev is an enteric virus that causes not only acute but also chronic hepatitis it has been increasingly studied in the past decade and has been observed to also cause syndromes other than liver related such as neurological or renal hev related diseases underlying its highly variable pathogenesis pischke et al 2017 this virus is widespread or endemic in large parts of the world it has been largely demonstrated to be a waterborne virus in developing countries and since 1997 it has also been demonstrated to be a zoonotic virus in developed countries meng et al 1997 pavio et al 2015 this has led to numerous recent literature reviews focussing on the zoonotic origin of hev pavio et al 2015 its infection in humans and its treatments echevarría et al 2013 miyamura 2011 sridhar et al 2015 its molecular epidemiology purdy and khudyakov 2011 and the water transmission of human adapted hev in developing countries khuroo et al 2016 they all agree with the conclusion that a better understanding of the route of transmission is needed especially for the zoonotic hev however the transmission paths are still unclear in developed countries where a waterborne transmission is still questioned indeed some reports coming from these countries suggest shellfish borne outbreaks said et al 2009 or higher hev seroprevalence in shellfish consumers or non bottled water consumers mansuy et al 2015 2016 hev is a variable virus which makes it difficult to be studied as some different genotypes or forms might behave differently from one another especially through the water cycle indeed the high hev genetic variability can suggest a high potential for adaptation to various organs and tissues in humans and animals this genetic feature implies distinct pathogenic mechanisms in different syndromes for the hosts and encourages us to consider the presence in wastewater of different hev genotypes as well as complex viral quasispecies with various transmission routes favouring hev circulation in the environment the unravelling of these transmission paths would help prevent hev infection and develop sanitary policies in order to control infections our aim was to provide an overview of the transmission of hev through water with particular attention to variability linked to the source of pollution occurrence survival in water and removal by water treatment 2 source of water pollution host and viral particle variability hev is an enteric virus which infects its hosts through the faecal oral route in this review transmission through ingestion of contaminated meat will not be discussed there is only one serotype belonging to the hepevirus genus and the hepeviridae family geng et al 2011 it is usually a non enveloped icosaedric capsid measuring between 27 and 34 nm which contains a single strand positive sense rna virus of 7 2 kb in length rna is capped and polyadenylated at the 5 and 3 ends respectively it has two short untranslated regions utr at the 5 and 3 ends and three open reading frames orf orf1 orf2 and orf3 graff et al 2006 orf1 encodes non structural proteins such as methyltransferase papain like cysteine protease helicase and rna dependent rna polymerase okamoto 2007 the orf2 and orf3 proteins are encoded by a same subgenomic mrna which produces the capsid protein and phosphoryl protein respectively graff et al 2006 the size of quasi enveloped viruses is between 50 and 110 nm dalton and izopet 2018 among the eight hev genotypes five cause human infections g1 and g2 infect only humans and are mainly reported in regions with low levels of resources and poor sanitation resulting in contamination of food and water supplies khuroo et al 2016 they are mainly observed in asia indian subcontinent china bangladesh nepal pakistan and afghanistan and sub saharan africa for g1 and mexico and some african countries nigeria chad sudan and the central african republic for g2 nelson et al 2018 hev g3 and g4 infect humans but also a wide range of mammals such as pigs boars deer and rabbits colson et al 2010 masuda et al 2005 matsuda et al 2003 meng 2013 g3 infections are qualified as emerging diseases in european countries including france but they are just currently better identified and can be observed in north and latin america south africa asia australia and new zealand nevertheless the seroprevalence seems to be lower in oceania compared to europe g4 can be found in china northern japan india and sporadically in europe dalton and izopet 2018 hofmeister et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 the zoonotic transmission of g3 and g4 has been largely demonstrated for pigs wild boars and deer with sometimes no modification in the sequence between the animal and human strains meaning that there is no adaptation necessary to infect humans or animals a zoonotic transmission is suspected for rabbits abranavel et al 2017 izopet et al 2012 pavio et al 2015 the common ancestor of mammalian hev was shown to be between hev 1 2 and hev 3 4 it has been estimated that an ancestor strain gave rise on the one hand to human hev and on the other hand to zoonotic hev more than 500 years ago then both genotypes split again purdy and khudyakov 2011 finally only one human case has been described with hev g7 primarily infecting dromedaries and initially named dchev dromedary camel hev woo et al 2014 therefore depending on the geographical area genotypes found in water may differ but overall a large number of hosts not all of whom have been identified yet may contaminate the water through their faeces hev is a virus subject to a certain amount of genetic variability some authors took hev sequences some of which belonging to different genotypes and measured distances between them nucleotide similarity between genotypes is about 75 and within a genotype it is over 81 smith et al 2013 such genetic variability makes a single hev genotype based study insufficient for relevant conclusions to be drawn hev infection of many host species could require the involvement of many viral structural sites to favour adaptation to highly heterogeneous biotic or abiotic environments according to purdy and khudyakov 2010 hev g3 and g4 would carry more polymorphic positions than g1 and g2 the high genetic diversity seen in g3 and g4 may reflect a strong adaptation to many hosts purdy and khudyakov 2010 under different selective pressures many positive selection i e mutations leading to an amino acid substitution sites have been located in the overlapping region of orf2 and orf3 the orf1 and non overlapping orf2 have many negative selection i e silent mutations sites which are proportionally in greater numbers in g1 than in g3 and g4 purdy and khudyakov 2010 we have made phylogenetic trees with two of the orf2 domains middle m and protruding p in amino acids in g1 and g3 reference strains fig 1 these two domains are involved in the viral immunogenicity and interactions between hev and cellular membranes the overall mean distance is greater for g3 than for g1 for both m and p domains moreover this great difference between hev genotype sequences can also lead to potential technical concern failure of diagnostic tools reuter et al 2009 and failure of methods used for environmental analysis indeed the genetic variability can lead to physical variability the virus surface properties might be modified by the amino acid sequence modifications we have tested 25 amino acid sequences of orf2 of different hev subgenotypes belonging to g1 g2 g3 and g4 with the antheprot software this software developed by parker et al 1986 was principally used to analyse the viral antigenicity it takes into consideration three parameters to determine the antigenicity of a position within a polypeptide hydrophobicity accessibility and flexibility of the amino acid and the same parameters of the three amino acids before and after it parker et al 1986 in this review it was used to work on the hydrophobicity profile of the capsid protein which has 660 amino acids through comparison of the amino acid sequences of the different genotypes and subgenotypes different profiles were observed subgenotypes 3 showed a large number of differences in their hydrophobicity profiles between residues 68 and 100 the hydrophobicity profiles obtained for g3f and g3h were compared fig 2 and significant differences could be observed for subtypes of g4 differences in their hydrophobicity profiles were observed between residues 67 and 74 and residues 95 and 100 data not shown hev has a quasispecies distribution with complex mixtures of genetically distinct but closely related viral populations lhomme et al 2012 this means that hev populations coexist at any time point and any change in the environment of the virus can modify the equilibrium and the quasispecies distribution such a phenomenon has been described for poliovirus vignuzzi et al 2006 and hepatitis c virus farci et al 1997 the variability of viruses with an rna genome results first from errors occurring during genome replication steps with a lack of rna dependent rna polymerase proofreading activity there is about one mutation for a 10 000 nucleotide genome inducing a new virion sequence in each replication process thus producing viral quasispecies van tong et al 2016 these mutations can have a high functional impact on viral fitness second selective pressures from host related immunity cellular tissues or interactions with external environmental surfaces could also have a role in hev variability as an example poliovirus virulence is determined by quasispecies diversity vignuzzi et al 2006 there will be a cooperative interaction within a viral population in which some variants may facilitate the colonization of tissues others will have an impact on the immune system while some may even facilitate circulation of the virus the hypothesis of highly dominant variants within quasispecies combining strong pathogenesis immune evasion and effective viral circulation in the outside environment can be stated moreover the complexity of the viral quasispecies could allow the virus to combine complementary functions of different viral subpopulations for hev in the clinical setting a study from lhomme et al 2012 has been conducted to correlate viral genetic variability with the progression towards a chronic infection and or cirrhosis interestingly the greater the variability of the m and p domains the greater is the likelihood of developing a chronic hev infection lhomme et al 2012 as a consequence long term hev faecal excretion from patients suffering from chronic hepatitis will favour extensive viral spread in the outside environment review of the current literature seems to indicate that the quasispecies heterogeneity could favour hev persistence in an immunocompromised host and that higher variability between hev populations enhances a virus s ability to infect varied hosts we can hypothesize that these genetic characteristics can also have an impact on the transmission of the virus through water to gain further insight into these questions studies on hev genetic variability and quasispecies in different types of samples are needed hosts with chronic evolution versus hosts with virus clearance different host species and different environmental samples bisseux et al 2018 hev is more commonly defined as a non enveloped virus nevertheless when it leaves the hepatocytes the virion has a membrane envelope derived from the exosomes and composed of cholesterol phospholipids sphingomyelin phosphatidylethanolamine phosphoinositides and ceramides chapuy regaud et al 2017 it is further exposed to intestinal detergents which accounts for the destruction of the envelope yin et al 2016a release from infected hepatocytes mostly consists of quasi enveloped forms whereas the non enveloped form is more frequent within the infected cells the quasi enveloped particles bind to cells less effectively and more slowly than do non enveloped particles this could explain why hev from a patient s blood sample seems to be less infectious than that of faecal origin yin et al 2016b hev cellular entry mechanisms remain poorly understood but it is known that non enveloped hev binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a receptor on the hepatocyte surface the quasi enveloped hev enters the cells through a number of different steps it needs two gtpases rab5 and rab7 an endosomal acidification in the hepatic cells and the lipid degradation activity in the lysosome yin et al 2016b fig 3 thus non enveloped hev particles are excreted in the environment in the case of faecal pollution of animal or human origin but quasi enveloped hev particles may also be released in the environment in the case of animal blood pollution from slaughterhouses fig 4 to our knowledge the environmental excretion of quasi enveloped hev particles compared to non enveloped particles which are supposed to be the most prevalent has not been taken into account to sum up the sources of water pollution are diverse having human livestock and or wild animal origins and so are the viral particle types with from a physical point of view quasi enveloped versus non enveloped hev particles and from a genetic point of view four major genotypes g1 to g4 subgenotypes and quasispecies 3 epidemiological proof of the water transmission of hev g1 and g2 have been largely demonstrated to be transmitted by water in developing countries amanya et al 2017 hakim et al 2017 haque et al 2015 maila et al 2004 singh et al 2016 in india for example highly polluted water caused waves of g1 outbreaks 1978 1984 1993 1995 2007 2008 2012 2013 such a wave outbreak pattern has been explained by successive infection immunization and immunity loss cycles whose period length is estimated to be about 10 years outbreaks start when immunity decreases to 4 of total population and stop when it increases to 20 of total population in such situations transmission of the zoonotic genotypes seems insignificant the improvement of sanitation practices is clearly the solution for g1 control in developing countries khuroo et al 2016 interestingly as observed in china industrialization of a country decreases hev risk related to g1 but increases that related to g3 and g4 sridhar et al 2015 while zoonotic transmission of g3 and g4 has been largely demonstrated mainly through food colson et al 2010 masuda et al 2005 matsuda et al 2003 meng 2013 and exposure to pigs bouwknegt et al 2008 drobeniuc et al 2001 pérez gracia et al 2007 in developed countries the roadmap to control autochthonous hev is not so clear apart from better control of food products the role of water in the transmission of zoonotic hev has only been suspected sridhar et al 2015 detection of g3 in shellfish and seemingly shellfish related outbreaks have recently raised the question sridhar et al 2015 sometimes no clear direct transmission from pigs to humans is observed indirect contamination through the environment is then probable but difficult to prove purdy and khudyakov 2011 some studies conducted in developed countries seem to show higher hev seroprevalence in people exposed to water or in shellfish consumers which supports the idea of a hydric transmission of hev g3 mansuy et al 2015 2016 as there is only one hev serotype it is not possible in seroprevalence studies to assess which genotype the individuals have been in contact with however when a study is conducted in a country where g3 is by far the most frequent hev genotype it can be assumed that it is this genotype that seropositive people have encountered thus two studies about hev seroprevalence in blood donors in france show that it is higher in mussel consumers mansuy et al 2015 and oyster consumers mansuy et al 2016 compared to non consumers in one of these studies drinking bottled water seems to be a protective factor mansuy et al 2016 an outbreak on a cruise ship seemed to be linked with shellfish consumption g3 was determined in three patients said et al 2009 a study conducted in cornwall showed a higher risk of hepatitis e when living near the coast whereas there was no difference between cases and controls for people living near a pig holding hunter et al 2016 a g4 related outbreak has been suspected to be waterborne in china chen et al 2016 to conclude hev g1 and g2 are known to be transmitted through water and g3 and g4 through a zoonotic path however a number of arguments suggest that the latter genotypes could also be transmitted through water 4 occurrence of hev in the water cycle from the source to the water use in the food chain the first stage of the environmental cycle of hev particles is their excretion fig 3 of course non enveloped particles excreted in the faeces of contaminated humans wastewater treatment plants and animals slaughterhouses farming faeces of wild animals may be considered as the main part of hev particles released in the environment however quasi enveloped particles coming from blood might also be excreted in the environment especially in wastewater originating from slaughterhouses detection of viral hev genome by molecular tools e g retro transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr can be used to test for the occurrence and quantification of the total number of hev particles baez et al 2017 la rosa et al 2018 the advantages of this procedure include its fast running time high sensitivity and specificity and ease of use the genome can be detected even if the capsid is no longer able to bind to its receptor and free rna molecules can be found in some environmental samples cook et al 2016 the detection of the viral rna only means that the virus is present but not necessarily that it is infectious gassilloud et al 2003 in addition no difference can be made between quasi enveloped and non enveloped hev nevertheless the molecular approach is useful in occurrence and epidemiological studies there are pan genotypic quantitative real time pcr methods that allow the determination of whether a sample contains hev genome or not jothikumar et al 2006 for positive samples a pcr followed by sequencing can then be performed in order to determine the virus genotype erker et al 1999 inoue et al 2006 takahashi et al 2002 numerous studies have described the presence of hev genome in untreated sewage over the last 15 years especially in europe table 1 occurrences were very variable indeed they ranged from 0 to 93 uk and even 100 india but this has to be interpreted with caution since there is substantial variation between studies in terms of the volumes of samples the methods used and the period of sampling in europe the most prevalent hev genotype seems to be g3 but sometimes g1 may also be present in wastewater in other industrialized countries outside europe a lower number of studies have been published but g3 also seems to be the most frequent unsurprisingly g1 is the most frequent in asia but g4 has been recently detected in china fewer analyses have been performed on treated than on untreated sewage again mostly in europe table 2 the samples are mainly negative for hev genome and the determined genotypes are rare to date there have been several works on hev detection and phylogeny but there is a lack of information on hev viral loads before and after treatments applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nevertheless a study performed in india showed a slow decrease in the prevalence of hev from 15 2 n 46 to 10 8 n 46 during wastewater treatment consisting of primary screening aeration agitation primary secondary clarification anaerobic digestion and chlorination vaidya et al 2002 this shows at least that some hev particles may cross the wastewater treatment plant but quantitative molecular methods should be applied to raw and treated wastewater in order to better assess virus particle removal unsurprisingly the study of four articles showed that the highest values of prevalence of hev in surface water are lower than those described in sewage and do not exceed 20 nevertheless values ranging from 0 6 1 154 in 1 l gentry shields et al 2015 to 17 2 12 in 230 260 l rutjes et al 2009 are reported genome concentrations of up to 104 genome copies l have been reported in lake and river water in italy these two sites either were located in an urbanized area or had a history of enteric viral contamination d ugo et al 2016 a study conducted in the usa showed that in surface waters the occurrence and concentration of hev increased significantly after manure application the genotype could not be determined because of the shortness of the sequence and its location in a highly conserved region the authors suggested that runoff and tile input are important mechanisms of hev transport to surface waters and that subsurface drainage and overland flow contribute to the transport of hev to adjacent waters givens et al 2016 in poor countries humans defecate in backyards and open fields the rain then washes away these faecally contaminated areas into other waterways a phenomenon which can contaminate crops waterways groundwater and open waterways khuroo et al 2016 the same phenomenon of hev being transported by water could be hypothesized with g3 and g4 in developed countries with animal faeces and manure or bypass of untreated water in a wastewater treatment plant as a result hev has the potential to contaminate surface waters used for drinking water production and recreational purposes thus surface waters could be a source of contamination for animals shellfish and humans bivalve molluscan shellfish bms are known transmitters of enteric viruses in particular norovirus nov and hepatitis a virus hav bellou et al 2013 an iso method has been proposed for genome quantification of nov and hav in various foodstuffs including bms nf en iso 15216 2017 studies have been led on different bms in europe and asia with various results table 3 and again g3 is the most represented in europe whereas g3 and g4 are found in asia elsewhere as mentioned above water can contaminate food products by irrigation of crops khuroo et al 2016 studies led in canada and various countries in europe have found hev on field grown strawberries vegetables frozen raspberries and salad brassard et al 2012 kokkinos et al 2012 maunula et al 2013 terio et al 2017 to conclude on this part it appears that hev particles may be found at each stage of the water cycle even if their infectivity cannot be confirmed by molecular methods they may be found in large numbers in rivers in some cases resulting in a direct contamination risk for animals or indirect risk for humans through irrigation of crops contamination of resources for drinking water production and in bms producing areas to our knowledge the minimal hev infectious dose is still unknown but by analogy with nov hall 2012 and hav sánchez 2013 we can assume that 10 to 50 viral particles can be enough to make people ill and lead to an outbreak to know if this hev can really infect hosts and in what proportion we need to assess its capacity to remain infectious in water that is its survival 5 hev survival in water under natural conditions temperature and sunlight uv are the two main factors that may inactivate hev in water during drinking water treatment the physical treatment allows the removal of the viral particle whereas the disinfection process mainly based on chlorine impacts virus survival 5 1 method used to evaluate survival the reference method to evaluate viral infectivity is in vitro cell culture or assays which can be performed in vivo the use of the term inactivation for a virus means that the infectivity has been assayed by a cell culture method many enteric viruses can be cultivated on cells but some are difficult to cultivate and hev is one of them that being said some culture systems have been found a g3 strain je03 1760f and a g4 strain hev jf5 15f originating from human stool samples have been cultivated on plc prf 5 cells human hepatic carcinoma and a549 cells human lung cancer the g4 strain originated from a patient with a fulminant hepatitis this strain was propagated and passed more effectively than the g3 one tanaka et al 2009 moreover hepg2 and huh7 cells human hepatic carcinoma are not permissive for je03 1760f and hev jf5 15f strains originating from the stool samples but can support propagation and passages of the cell culture adapted je03 1760f and he jf5 15f strains okamoto 2013 g1 g3 and g4 strains originating from blood samples can also be cultivated on plc prf 5 and a549 cells okamoto 2013 a g3 strain kernow c1 isolated from a chronically infected patient s stool could effectively infect numerous cell lines from humans hepatic carcinoma hepg2 c3a and huh7 5 hepatoma plc prf 5 lung carcinoma a549 and colorectal adenocarcinoma caco 2 pigs kidney llc pk1 llc pk1a and sk rst and deer liver ohh1 li after being passed six times on hepg2 c3a cells the kernow c1 strain was able to grow more effectively in these cells shukla et al 2011 among these cell lines llc pk1 seems to be the most permissible to kernow c1 and kernow c1 p6 infections shukla et al 2011 another strain has been described by other authors lbpr 0379 strain isolated from a chronically infected patient g3 has a growth advantage in cell culture hepg2 c3a cells nguyen et al 2012 recently a three dimensional culture system has been developed for hev it seems to be a promising system that needs to be improved berto et al 2013 however the drawback of all these culture methods is that they are time consuming and difficult to apply another method has been developed by some authors in order to overcome the problems of culture and rt pcr it consists in a pre treatment of the sample with an rnase prior to rna extraction free rna damaged viruses will be destroyed by the rnase and only encapsidated rna will be taken into account this method has been used on hev in order to study its resistance to some temperatures schielke et al 2011 another approach has been developed the use of intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma and ethidium monoazide ema this strategy allows the assessment of capsid integrity these molecules will enter the cell if the membrane integrity is disrupted covalently bind to dna and inhibit pcr girones et al 2010 some authors have tested this approach on bacteria and recently others have attempted to develop it on rna viruses leifels et al 2015 parshionikar et al 2010 with various results this method is not relevant if the virus is inactivated with a preserved capsid and the secondary rna structure seems to interfere with the binding of the intercalating agent parshionikar et al 2010 the results can also vary according to which virus is studied and which region of its genome is targeted by pcr leifels et al 2015 in order to properly draw conclusions with cell culture work it is useful to know if we are working with non enveloped or quasi enveloped hev it seems that when working with liver cells such as huh 7 plc prf 5 and hepg2 or lung cells such as a549 the produced virions are predominantly quasi enveloped if the virus is then treated with a bile salt e g deoxycholic acid and a protease e g trypsin it can lose its envelope okamoto 2013 takahashi et al 2010 yin et al 2016b 2016a 5 2 thermal inactivation a review has summarized all tested methods of inactivation for hev in food matrices cook and van der poel 2015 as a consequence it focused on high temperatures used for food treatment or cooking which do not match environmental conditions nevertheless some interesting data were described first even if in the review no discussion was made about enveloped and non enveloped virus we can extract some data concerning the survival of non enveloped hev since stool extracted strains were studied moreover some of these data could be compared with those reported in a review focussing on the impact of temperature on the inactivation of enteric viruses in food and water bertrand et al 2012 in the latter review the authors determined the tfl value of each enteric virus which was defined as the time needed in days to observe the first log10 reduction the tfl values of the different enteric viruses were compared as a function of the temperature range 50 c or 50 c of the matrix type simple or complex and the detection method cell culture or pcr the log10tfl was then used a few studies described in cook s review allow us to calculate some tfl values thus a one log reduction was observed for hev g1 strain in stool suspension after exposure to 56 c for 15 min emerson et al 2005 this means that the tfl value reached 0 01 day under these conditions which is close to the tfl values observed for highly resistant enteric viruses such as phix174 phage and f specific rna phages of genogroup i this also suggests that hev could be more resistant than hav under these particular conditions but there is a huge difference in the number of data between these two hepatitis viruses with 38 data for hav bertrand et al 2012 and only one for hev from another study yunoki et al 2008 the tfl of hev at 60 c could be estimated at 0 02 day in a 25 albumin solution and 0 007 day in phosphate buffered saline in both cases the comparison with data from the review bertrand et al 2012 suggests that hev has a resistance close to that observed for f specific rna phages and higher than that observed for hav when hev was subjected to dry heating the tfl seemed to be of 0 4 day at 60 c and of 0 16 day at 80 c which is much higher than under the previous heat conditions yunoki et al 2008 johne et al 2016 have evaluated the impact of high temperatures in the range of 60 c 80 c on quasi enveloped hev in suspension in cell culture medium the tfl value reached 2 3 10 4 day 20 s at 70 c these authors worked with quasi enveloped hev particles we can thus attempt a comparison with an enveloped virus we have chosen hepatitis c virus hcv which is a well documented enveloped virus like hev its genome consists of a positive polarity single strand rna hcv in cell culture medium at a concentration of 2 5 103 ffu focus forming unit had a tfl of about 6 10 4 day 40 seconds at 65 c song et al 2010a thus the resistance of quasi enveloped hev might be close to that observed for hcv at high temperatures in the study by schielke et al 2011 the authors assayed the effect of short term heating on rnase protected hev g3 particles a reduction of 74 was observed after incubation at 56 c for 15 min and reduction rates above 99 2 16 to 4 42 log10 were observed after incubation at 56 c for 30 min or 60 min and at 60 c for 15 min 30 min or 60 min as these authors worked on a liver suspension we can infer that they mostly worked on quasi enveloped hev we can thus attempt a comparison with hcv as above when in human serum a 3 6 log10 inactivation was observed at 56 c for 30 min song et al 2010a caution is required when comparing these data since the assays were performed using a pcr derived technique for the detection of rnase protected hev schielke et al 2011 and by cell culture for hcv song et al 2010a johne et al 2016 and schielke et al 2011 also worked at low temperatures i e 37 c more frequently encountered under environmental conditions tfl values could be calculated from the results of johne et al 2016 a tfl of about 3 days at 22 c and about 2 days at 37 c in cell culture medium could be determined if again we compare that to hcv the tfl is of about 5 days at 25 c 2 c and about 9 h at 37 c song et al 2010a this would make quasi enveloped hev less resistant than hcv at room temperature and more resistant at 37 c but these results need confirmation from other studies second the thermal resistance of hev may depend on the virus strain as emerson et al 2005 suggested while working with two g1 strains and one g2 strain third the culture based detection method directly or indirectly provides highly variable results and sometimes only qualitative results the resistance of hev to heat might depend on the genotype and on the origin of the virus which makes it either quasi enveloped or non enveloped all in all on average hev seems about as resistant as f specific rna phages for non enveloped hev or hcv for quasi enveloped hev however other studies would be needed with as much as possible harmonized temperatures durations virus forms matrices and measurement methods 5 3 uv inactivation a recent study has compared the impact of uv radiation on hev g3 and ms2 phage in terms of loss of infectivity and degradation of the genome guerrero latorre et al 2016 the inactivation of hev was estimated by cell culture combined with immunofluorescence a viral suspension of 5 93 102 ffu ml was first irradiated with fluences of 10 20 40 80 100 and 140 mj cm2 since a fluence of only 10 mj cm2 was sufficient to inactivate hev a second experiment was performed with a viral suspension of 5 58 103 ffu ml by using fluences of 0 2 5 7 and 10 mj cm2 a regression curve was then constructed to predict fluences needed for viral inactivation it allowed the authors to determine that a fluence of 23 19 mj cm2 was needed for a 4 log10 99 99 inactivation the viral suspensions were coming from culture it can thus be assumed that the inactivation of hev by uv was determined for quasi enveloped hev a review paper has compared the uv radiation values needed to inactivate enteric pathogenic viruses such as poliovirus n 6 hav n 3 coxsackievirus n 2 and adenovirus n 7 and bacteriophages such as ms2 n 5 and qβ n 1 f specific rna phages and phix174 n 4 phages hijnen et al 2006 the inactivation rate constants named k values were determined for each virus the higher it is the more sensitive to uv the microorganism is the lowest k values were obtained for adenovirus and ms2 phage the k value of ms2 phage reached 0 08 in the experiments performed by guerrero latorre et al 2016 and was in accordance with the review by hijnen et al 2006 for quasi enveloped hev a k value of 0 153 could be calculated it was close to that of hav which was the least resistant of the viruses compared in the review published by hijnen et al 2006 for experiments performed with poliovirus and f specific rna phages it has been shown that inactivation by uv is correlated with genome size the longer the genome is the more sensitive it is to uv simonet and gantzer 2006 we should notice that hav and hev have about the same genome length with 7 5 and 7 2 103 nucleotides respectively moreover simonet and gantzer 2006 have also shown that genome degradation could explain uv induced viral inactivation to summarize quasi enveloped hev virus has a resistance to uv similar to that of other enteric viruses such as hav but lower than that of ms2 phage however other experiments would be needed in order to test non enveloped hev which would be more representative of particles that can be found in environmental waters other studies on other genotypes also need to be conducted because as with thermal inactivation virus behaviour might vary from one genotype to another 5 4 chlorine inactivation in a study reported by cook and van der poel 2015 hev treated with sodium hypochlorite was inoculated into a culture of plc prf 5 cells no cytopathic effect was observed but replication could be inferred from detection of hev rna however hev seems to be chlorine sensitive indeed in the same study it was reported that in cultures inoculated with untreated hev rna was detectable up to day 33 whereas it was detectable only for 7 days with treated hev results not shown another study led by girones et al 2014 compared chlorine resistance of hev g1 to that of human adenovirus 2 hadv2 in that study hev g1 originating both from culture and faeces was treated with sodium hypochlorite at 1000 ppm a first phase with an initial decline in infectious units of approximately 2 log was reported followed by a phase of further decline of less than 1 log and a still detectable rna and infectious viruses at 30 min hadv2 was more resistant to chlorination than hev ct concentration time values of 0 15 mg l min for quasi enveloped hev and 0 12 mg l min for non enveloped hev for 1 log reduction for hev and 1 15 mg l min for 1 log reduction for hadv2 the authors then compared chlorine activity on hev with and without sewage in the water ct values needed for a 2 log reduction of hev infectivity was 20 times higher with 1 sewage in the water compared to without sewage we can attempt a comparison with hav sobsey et al 1988 have studied the resistance of hav to chlorination from their data the ct value needed for 1 log reduction was estimated to be about 0 85 mg l min at 5 c and ph 6 and about 1 mg ml min at 5 c and ph 8 in their study on hev girones et al 2014 do not specify the ph and temperature conditions under which they performed their experiments so the comparison with hav is not easy but if we suppose that the conditions were close to those of sobsey et al then we can conclude that hev is more sensitive to chlorination than hav hev thus seems to be quite sensitive to chlorination as it is more susceptible than hadv2 and hav however this needs to be confirmed by further studies carried out with more harmonized conditions temperature ph and different types of hev in different types of environment e g clean water sewage containing water etc all in all it seems that hev does not exhibit a particularly high level of resistance to the main inactivating factors for viruses in water i e heat uv and chlorine compared to classical models of enteric viruses namely ms2 phage or f specific rna phages or to other pathogenic enteric viruses such as hav the classical multi barrier treatments to prevent enteric virus transmission to humans should thus be effective for hev the question is still under discussion for animals in order to expand our knowledge of hev resistance to treatments a method to assess rapidly and with high sensitivity and specificity the quantity of infectious viruses would be needed and as much as possible standardized studies need to be conducted harmonizing temperature or chlorine concentration is difficult to achieve but some efforts can be made on the duration of study or on the uv wavelength and fluence 6 physical removal in the environment and water treatment the behaviour of virus particles in the environment depends mainly on their size and on their surface properties including their electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity the size of hev is similar to that of most other pathogenic enteric viruses such as hav 27 33 nm or nov 27 nm and phages used as models such as f specific rna 20 30 nm hartard et al 2016 kapikian et al 1972 kuzmanovic et al 2003 rumnieks and tars 2017 yokosuka 2000 it is known that the virus charge depends on its isoelectric point abbreviations pi or iep and on the ph of the medium a negative charge is observed if the ph is above the pi and conversely a positive charge is observed when the ph is below the pi gerba 1984 to date nothing is known about the pi of hev even less so about its charge under environmental conditions defining total charge is far from an easy task because viruses are soft particles for which the genome may have an impact on the surface charge dika et al 2011 langlet et al 2008a the variability of hev may also impact its pi and charge indeed as there are different genotypes and subgenotypes a quasispecies distribution quasi enveloped and non enveloped forms the virus can be found under different forms within environment waters this can have an impact on its hydrophobicity and charge and thus on its behaviour charge greatly influences virus behaviour bhattacharjee et al 2002 thus high negative charge or low pi leads to low adhesion aggregation capacity in a review written in 2010 a summary of the isoelectric points of various viruses was constructed from this summary it was concluded that the pi is essential but not sufficient to predict adhesion michen and graule 2010 in fact hydrophobicity has also proved to be highly important in the adhesion aggregation process and may be of great importance in water treatment processes for example boudaud et al 2012 hydrophobic interactions are short distance interactions which may take place when the electrostatic charge of viral particles is low because of the virus type the medium ph close to the pi or a high ionic strength leading to ions neutralizing the particle charge dika et al 2015 langlet et al 2008b hydrophobicity of the different amino acids can also have an impact on surface adhesion as shown for nov samandoulgou et al 2015 changes in physico chemical conditions e g ionic strength or temperature can affect the secondary or tertiary structure and change which amino acids are exposed on the surface thus modifying hydrophobicity and adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces as discussed before hev can exist under non enveloped or quasi enveloped forms the presence of the quasi envelope means that there are lipids which should make the virus more hydrophobic thus modifying its physico chemical characteristics and therefore its behaviour again very little is known about hev hydrophobicity to begin addressing the question of the impact of hydrophobicity we compared orf2 sequences between the different hev genotypes using the antheprot software as already stated in the second paragraph and as shown in fig 2 subgenotypes 3 showed a large number of differences in their hydrophobicity profiles between residues 68 and 100 the hydrophobicity profiles obtained for g3f and g3h were compared which showed major differences for subgenotypes 4 differences in their hydrophobicity profiles were observed between residues 67 and 74 and residues 95 and 100 data not shown to conclude on this part hev is about the same size as many pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteriophages from which we could infer some behavioural data however its charge hydrophobicity and adhesion are still unknown and given its high variability intergenotype intragenotype quasispecies and different forms these criteria could vary which could impact the virus behaviour and transmission 7 how may we include the variability of hev in future studies concerning water in the future the investigation into hev variability concerning water will be facilitated by a number of increasingly sensitive molecular methods designed to analyse viral genomic plasticity these methods could prove useful for the study of the sequences of different hev isolates coming from different types of samples in order to better understand the virus circulation concentration and extraction methods are difficult to implement charge size and hydrophobicity of the virus are variable so far it has been possible to use direct sequencing sanger sequencing to sequence a variable part of the genome and then to study phylogenic links based on the results and to determine the genotype and sometimes the subgenotype xia et al 2015 that method only shows the main hev population but allows for the direct comparison between the sequences of different samples when it comes to quasispecies study cloning sequencing or ultra deep sequencing uds can be used cloning sequencing is considered to be a reference method in the exploration of viral quasispecies but this method has drawbacks it is time consuming expensive and the number of clones that are studied limits its sensitivity ramírez et al 2013 in the best case scenario about 100 clones can be sequenced which poorly represents a population of millions or even more of viral particles uds method allows the production of millions of sequences within one run and is less expensive than previous methods many different uds techniques have been developed such as illumina sequencing using synthesis ion torrent or pyrosequencing each one of them has its own advantages and drawbacks and the choice of technique used will depend on the local equipment personal experience and the type of microorganism being studied quail et al 2012 the outputs from the sanger sequencing and uds should be analysed by informatics tools analyses can be done on the resulting data keeping in mind the pros and cons of each sequencing technique these different techniques can be used together and compared according to the data comparisons can be made between the sequences of different samples and between the different subpopulations within one sample the diversity and complexity can be calculated between different subpopulations lhomme et al 2012 various protein properties such as the antigenicity profile can be predicted through use of the antheprot software as discussed above parker et al 1986 this approach has also been used in some studies and helps the determination of whether or not an amino acid substitution has consequences on the function of the protein schvoerer et al 2013 it can help the determination of viral behaviour and give information on the transmission which can be completed by analysis of different sample types such as human or animal samples however there is a need for a method that would allow the concentration of hev as many of the virus characteristics vary it would be complicated to use a method based on viral size charge or hydrophobicity as long as many of hev characteristics remain unknown or poorly known methods to study the virus will be difficult to implement 8 conclusion the transmission and persistence of hev in the environment are still poorly understood as explained in the present review hev seems to be quite resistant to high temperatures in its non enveloped form and as resistant as hcv in its quasi enveloped form we point out that the few studies performed on uv treatment suggest that hev has the same susceptibility as hav which is a uv sensitive virus compared to ms2 phage and that hev is sensitive to chlorination the classical treatments and surveillance methods to fight against enteric viruses should be effective against hev we are dealing with a highly variable virus there are different genotypes and subgenotypes a quasispecies distribution and quasi enveloped and non enveloped forms different particles can thus be found in environmental waters depending on the geographic location or the origin and type of pollution this can have an impact on the virus quantity hydrophobicity charge and infectivity and therefore on its behaviour and resistance to treatments virus culture from water samples would be informative but currently seems rather ambitious more information is also needed concerning hev surface properties isoelectric point hydrophobicity to better predict its behaviour in the environment and develop optimized concentration techniques in order to study it this knowledge will help sanitary authorities to monitor the circulation of hev and to develop measures to prevent human contamination declaration of interest none funding no sponsors were involved in the writing of this review all authors salaries

19048,hepatitis e virus hev is an enteric virus divided into eight genotypes genotype 1 g1 and g2 are specific to humans g3 g4 and g7 are zoonotic genotypes infecting humans and animals transmission to humans through water has been demonstrated for g1 and g2 mainly in developing countries but is only suspected for the zoonotic genotypes thus the water related hev hazard may be due to human and animal faeces the high hev genetic variability allows considering the presence in wastewater of not only different genotypes but also quasispecies adding even greater diversity moreover recent studies have demonstrated that hev particles may be either quasi enveloped or non enveloped potentially implying differential viral behaviours in the environment the presence of hev has been demonstrated at the different stages of the water cycle all over the world especially for hev g3 in europe and the usa concerning hev survival in water the virus does not have higher resistance to inactivating factors heat uv chlorine physical removal compared to viral indicators ms2 phage or other highly resistant enteric viruses hepatitis a virus but the studies did not take into account genetic genogroups quasispecies or structural quasi or non enveloped forms hev variability viral variability could indeed modify hev persistence in water by influencing its interaction with the environment its infectivity and its pathogenicity and subsequently its transmission by water the cell culture methods used to study hev survival still have drawbacks challenging virus cultivation time consuming lack of sensitivity as explained in the present review the issue of hev transmission to humans through water is similar to that of other enteric viruses because of their similar or lower survival hev transmission to animals through water and how the virus variability affects its survival and transmission remain to be investigated graphical abstract image 1 keywords hepatitis e virus hev water occurrence variability transmission survival 1 introduction hev is an enteric virus that causes not only acute but also chronic hepatitis it has been increasingly studied in the past decade and has been observed to also cause syndromes other than liver related such as neurological or renal hev related diseases underlying its highly variable pathogenesis pischke et al 2017 this virus is widespread or endemic in large parts of the world it has been largely demonstrated to be a waterborne virus in developing countries and since 1997 it has also been demonstrated to be a zoonotic virus in developed countries meng et al 1997 pavio et al 2015 this has led to numerous recent literature reviews focussing on the zoonotic origin of hev pavio et al 2015 its infection in humans and its treatments echevarría et al 2013 miyamura 2011 sridhar et al 2015 its molecular epidemiology purdy and khudyakov 2011 and the water transmission of human adapted hev in developing countries khuroo et al 2016 they all agree with the conclusion that a better understanding of the route of transmission is needed especially for the zoonotic hev however the transmission paths are still unclear in developed countries where a waterborne transmission is still questioned indeed some reports coming from these countries suggest shellfish borne outbreaks said et al 2009 or higher hev seroprevalence in shellfish consumers or non bottled water consumers mansuy et al 2015 2016 hev is a variable virus which makes it difficult to be studied as some different genotypes or forms might behave differently from one another especially through the water cycle indeed the high hev genetic variability can suggest a high potential for adaptation to various organs and tissues in humans and animals this genetic feature implies distinct pathogenic mechanisms in different syndromes for the hosts and encourages us to consider the presence in wastewater of different hev genotypes as well as complex viral quasispecies with various transmission routes favouring hev circulation in the environment the unravelling of these transmission paths would help prevent hev infection and develop sanitary policies in order to control infections our aim was to provide an overview of the transmission of hev through water with particular attention to variability linked to the source of pollution occurrence survival in water and removal by water treatment 2 source of water pollution host and viral particle variability hev is an enteric virus which infects its hosts through the faecal oral route in this review transmission through ingestion of contaminated meat will not be discussed there is only one serotype belonging to the hepevirus genus and the hepeviridae family geng et al 2011 it is usually a non enveloped icosaedric capsid measuring between 27 and 34 nm which contains a single strand positive sense rna virus of 7 2 kb in length rna is capped and polyadenylated at the 5 and 3 ends respectively it has two short untranslated regions utr at the 5 and 3 ends and three open reading frames orf orf1 orf2 and orf3 graff et al 2006 orf1 encodes non structural proteins such as methyltransferase papain like cysteine protease helicase and rna dependent rna polymerase okamoto 2007 the orf2 and orf3 proteins are encoded by a same subgenomic mrna which produces the capsid protein and phosphoryl protein respectively graff et al 2006 the size of quasi enveloped viruses is between 50 and 110 nm dalton and izopet 2018 among the eight hev genotypes five cause human infections g1 and g2 infect only humans and are mainly reported in regions with low levels of resources and poor sanitation resulting in contamination of food and water supplies khuroo et al 2016 they are mainly observed in asia indian subcontinent china bangladesh nepal pakistan and afghanistan and sub saharan africa for g1 and mexico and some african countries nigeria chad sudan and the central african republic for g2 nelson et al 2018 hev g3 and g4 infect humans but also a wide range of mammals such as pigs boars deer and rabbits colson et al 2010 masuda et al 2005 matsuda et al 2003 meng 2013 g3 infections are qualified as emerging diseases in european countries including france but they are just currently better identified and can be observed in north and latin america south africa asia australia and new zealand nevertheless the seroprevalence seems to be lower in oceania compared to europe g4 can be found in china northern japan india and sporadically in europe dalton and izopet 2018 hofmeister et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 the zoonotic transmission of g3 and g4 has been largely demonstrated for pigs wild boars and deer with sometimes no modification in the sequence between the animal and human strains meaning that there is no adaptation necessary to infect humans or animals a zoonotic transmission is suspected for rabbits abranavel et al 2017 izopet et al 2012 pavio et al 2015 the common ancestor of mammalian hev was shown to be between hev 1 2 and hev 3 4 it has been estimated that an ancestor strain gave rise on the one hand to human hev and on the other hand to zoonotic hev more than 500 years ago then both genotypes split again purdy and khudyakov 2011 finally only one human case has been described with hev g7 primarily infecting dromedaries and initially named dchev dromedary camel hev woo et al 2014 therefore depending on the geographical area genotypes found in water may differ but overall a large number of hosts not all of whom have been identified yet may contaminate the water through their faeces hev is a virus subject to a certain amount of genetic variability some authors took hev sequences some of which belonging to different genotypes and measured distances between them nucleotide similarity between genotypes is about 75 and within a genotype it is over 81 smith et al 2013 such genetic variability makes a single hev genotype based study insufficient for relevant conclusions to be drawn hev infection of many host species could require the involvement of many viral structural sites to favour adaptation to highly heterogeneous biotic or abiotic environments according to purdy and khudyakov 2010 hev g3 and g4 would carry more polymorphic positions than g1 and g2 the high genetic diversity seen in g3 and g4 may reflect a strong adaptation to many hosts purdy and khudyakov 2010 under different selective pressures many positive selection i e mutations leading to an amino acid substitution sites have been located in the overlapping region of orf2 and orf3 the orf1 and non overlapping orf2 have many negative selection i e silent mutations sites which are proportionally in greater numbers in g1 than in g3 and g4 purdy and khudyakov 2010 we have made phylogenetic trees with two of the orf2 domains middle m and protruding p in amino acids in g1 and g3 reference strains fig 1 these two domains are involved in the viral immunogenicity and interactions between hev and cellular membranes the overall mean distance is greater for g3 than for g1 for both m and p domains moreover this great difference between hev genotype sequences can also lead to potential technical concern failure of diagnostic tools reuter et al 2009 and failure of methods used for environmental analysis indeed the genetic variability can lead to physical variability the virus surface properties might be modified by the amino acid sequence modifications we have tested 25 amino acid sequences of orf2 of different hev subgenotypes belonging to g1 g2 g3 and g4 with the antheprot software this software developed by parker et al 1986 was principally used to analyse the viral antigenicity it takes into consideration three parameters to determine the antigenicity of a position within a polypeptide hydrophobicity accessibility and flexibility of the amino acid and the same parameters of the three amino acids before and after it parker et al 1986 in this review it was used to work on the hydrophobicity profile of the capsid protein which has 660 amino acids through comparison of the amino acid sequences of the different genotypes and subgenotypes different profiles were observed subgenotypes 3 showed a large number of differences in their hydrophobicity profiles between residues 68 and 100 the hydrophobicity profiles obtained for g3f and g3h were compared fig 2 and significant differences could be observed for subtypes of g4 differences in their hydrophobicity profiles were observed between residues 67 and 74 and residues 95 and 100 data not shown hev has a quasispecies distribution with complex mixtures of genetically distinct but closely related viral populations lhomme et al 2012 this means that hev populations coexist at any time point and any change in the environment of the virus can modify the equilibrium and the quasispecies distribution such a phenomenon has been described for poliovirus vignuzzi et al 2006 and hepatitis c virus farci et al 1997 the variability of viruses with an rna genome results first from errors occurring during genome replication steps with a lack of rna dependent rna polymerase proofreading activity there is about one mutation for a 10 000 nucleotide genome inducing a new virion sequence in each replication process thus producing viral quasispecies van tong et al 2016 these mutations can have a high functional impact on viral fitness second selective pressures from host related immunity cellular tissues or interactions with external environmental surfaces could also have a role in hev variability as an example poliovirus virulence is determined by quasispecies diversity vignuzzi et al 2006 there will be a cooperative interaction within a viral population in which some variants may facilitate the colonization of tissues others will have an impact on the immune system while some may even facilitate circulation of the virus the hypothesis of highly dominant variants within quasispecies combining strong pathogenesis immune evasion and effective viral circulation in the outside environment can be stated moreover the complexity of the viral quasispecies could allow the virus to combine complementary functions of different viral subpopulations for hev in the clinical setting a study from lhomme et al 2012 has been conducted to correlate viral genetic variability with the progression towards a chronic infection and or cirrhosis interestingly the greater the variability of the m and p domains the greater is the likelihood of developing a chronic hev infection lhomme et al 2012 as a consequence long term hev faecal excretion from patients suffering from chronic hepatitis will favour extensive viral spread in the outside environment review of the current literature seems to indicate that the quasispecies heterogeneity could favour hev persistence in an immunocompromised host and that higher variability between hev populations enhances a virus s ability to infect varied hosts we can hypothesize that these genetic characteristics can also have an impact on the transmission of the virus through water to gain further insight into these questions studies on hev genetic variability and quasispecies in different types of samples are needed hosts with chronic evolution versus hosts with virus clearance different host species and different environmental samples bisseux et al 2018 hev is more commonly defined as a non enveloped virus nevertheless when it leaves the hepatocytes the virion has a membrane envelope derived from the exosomes and composed of cholesterol phospholipids sphingomyelin phosphatidylethanolamine phosphoinositides and ceramides chapuy regaud et al 2017 it is further exposed to intestinal detergents which accounts for the destruction of the envelope yin et al 2016a release from infected hepatocytes mostly consists of quasi enveloped forms whereas the non enveloped form is more frequent within the infected cells the quasi enveloped particles bind to cells less effectively and more slowly than do non enveloped particles this could explain why hev from a patient s blood sample seems to be less infectious than that of faecal origin yin et al 2016b hev cellular entry mechanisms remain poorly understood but it is known that non enveloped hev binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a receptor on the hepatocyte surface the quasi enveloped hev enters the cells through a number of different steps it needs two gtpases rab5 and rab7 an endosomal acidification in the hepatic cells and the lipid degradation activity in the lysosome yin et al 2016b fig 3 thus non enveloped hev particles are excreted in the environment in the case of faecal pollution of animal or human origin but quasi enveloped hev particles may also be released in the environment in the case of animal blood pollution from slaughterhouses fig 4 to our knowledge the environmental excretion of quasi enveloped hev particles compared to non enveloped particles which are supposed to be the most prevalent has not been taken into account to sum up the sources of water pollution are diverse having human livestock and or wild animal origins and so are the viral particle types with from a physical point of view quasi enveloped versus non enveloped hev particles and from a genetic point of view four major genotypes g1 to g4 subgenotypes and quasispecies 3 epidemiological proof of the water transmission of hev g1 and g2 have been largely demonstrated to be transmitted by water in developing countries amanya et al 2017 hakim et al 2017 haque et al 2015 maila et al 2004 singh et al 2016 in india for example highly polluted water caused waves of g1 outbreaks 1978 1984 1993 1995 2007 2008 2012 2013 such a wave outbreak pattern has been explained by successive infection immunization and immunity loss cycles whose period length is estimated to be about 10 years outbreaks start when immunity decreases to 4 of total population and stop when it increases to 20 of total population in such situations transmission of the zoonotic genotypes seems insignificant the improvement of sanitation practices is clearly the solution for g1 control in developing countries khuroo et al 2016 interestingly as observed in china industrialization of a country decreases hev risk related to g1 but increases that related to g3 and g4 sridhar et al 2015 while zoonotic transmission of g3 and g4 has been largely demonstrated mainly through food colson et al 2010 masuda et al 2005 matsuda et al 2003 meng 2013 and exposure to pigs bouwknegt et al 2008 drobeniuc et al 2001 pérez gracia et al 2007 in developed countries the roadmap to control autochthonous hev is not so clear apart from better control of food products the role of water in the transmission of zoonotic hev has only been suspected sridhar et al 2015 detection of g3 in shellfish and seemingly shellfish related outbreaks have recently raised the question sridhar et al 2015 sometimes no clear direct transmission from pigs to humans is observed indirect contamination through the environment is then probable but difficult to prove purdy and khudyakov 2011 some studies conducted in developed countries seem to show higher hev seroprevalence in people exposed to water or in shellfish consumers which supports the idea of a hydric transmission of hev g3 mansuy et al 2015 2016 as there is only one hev serotype it is not possible in seroprevalence studies to assess which genotype the individuals have been in contact with however when a study is conducted in a country where g3 is by far the most frequent hev genotype it can be assumed that it is this genotype that seropositive people have encountered thus two studies about hev seroprevalence in blood donors in france show that it is higher in mussel consumers mansuy et al 2015 and oyster consumers mansuy et al 2016 compared to non consumers in one of these studies drinking bottled water seems to be a protective factor mansuy et al 2016 an outbreak on a cruise ship seemed to be linked with shellfish consumption g3 was determined in three patients said et al 2009 a study conducted in cornwall showed a higher risk of hepatitis e when living near the coast whereas there was no difference between cases and controls for people living near a pig holding hunter et al 2016 a g4 related outbreak has been suspected to be waterborne in china chen et al 2016 to conclude hev g1 and g2 are known to be transmitted through water and g3 and g4 through a zoonotic path however a number of arguments suggest that the latter genotypes could also be transmitted through water 4 occurrence of hev in the water cycle from the source to the water use in the food chain the first stage of the environmental cycle of hev particles is their excretion fig 3 of course non enveloped particles excreted in the faeces of contaminated humans wastewater treatment plants and animals slaughterhouses farming faeces of wild animals may be considered as the main part of hev particles released in the environment however quasi enveloped particles coming from blood might also be excreted in the environment especially in wastewater originating from slaughterhouses detection of viral hev genome by molecular tools e g retro transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr can be used to test for the occurrence and quantification of the total number of hev particles baez et al 2017 la rosa et al 2018 the advantages of this procedure include its fast running time high sensitivity and specificity and ease of use the genome can be detected even if the capsid is no longer able to bind to its receptor and free rna molecules can be found in some environmental samples cook et al 2016 the detection of the viral rna only means that the virus is present but not necessarily that it is infectious gassilloud et al 2003 in addition no difference can be made between quasi enveloped and non enveloped hev nevertheless the molecular approach is useful in occurrence and epidemiological studies there are pan genotypic quantitative real time pcr methods that allow the determination of whether a sample contains hev genome or not jothikumar et al 2006 for positive samples a pcr followed by sequencing can then be performed in order to determine the virus genotype erker et al 1999 inoue et al 2006 takahashi et al 2002 numerous studies have described the presence of hev genome in untreated sewage over the last 15 years especially in europe table 1 occurrences were very variable indeed they ranged from 0 to 93 uk and even 100 india but this has to be interpreted with caution since there is substantial variation between studies in terms of the volumes of samples the methods used and the period of sampling in europe the most prevalent hev genotype seems to be g3 but sometimes g1 may also be present in wastewater in other industrialized countries outside europe a lower number of studies have been published but g3 also seems to be the most frequent unsurprisingly g1 is the most frequent in asia but g4 has been recently detected in china fewer analyses have been performed on treated than on untreated sewage again mostly in europe table 2 the samples are mainly negative for hev genome and the determined genotypes are rare to date there have been several works on hev detection and phylogeny but there is a lack of information on hev viral loads before and after treatments applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nevertheless a study performed in india showed a slow decrease in the prevalence of hev from 15 2 n 46 to 10 8 n 46 during wastewater treatment consisting of primary screening aeration agitation primary secondary clarification anaerobic digestion and chlorination vaidya et al 2002 this shows at least that some hev particles may cross the wastewater treatment plant but quantitative molecular methods should be applied to raw and treated wastewater in order to better assess virus particle removal unsurprisingly the study of four articles showed that the highest values of prevalence of hev in surface water are lower than those described in sewage and do not exceed 20 nevertheless values ranging from 0 6 1 154 in 1 l gentry shields et al 2015 to 17 2 12 in 230 260 l rutjes et al 2009 are reported genome concentrations of up to 104 genome copies l have been reported in lake and river water in italy these two sites either were located in an urbanized area or had a history of enteric viral contamination d ugo et al 2016 a study conducted in the usa showed that in surface waters the occurrence and concentration of hev increased significantly after manure application the genotype could not be determined because of the shortness of the sequence and its location in a highly conserved region the authors suggested that runoff and tile input are important mechanisms of hev transport to surface waters and that subsurface drainage and overland flow contribute to the transport of hev to adjacent waters givens et al 2016 in poor countries humans defecate in backyards and open fields the rain then washes away these faecally contaminated areas into other waterways a phenomenon which can contaminate crops waterways groundwater and open waterways khuroo et al 2016 the same phenomenon of hev being transported by water could be hypothesized with g3 and g4 in developed countries with animal faeces and manure or bypass of untreated water in a wastewater treatment plant as a result hev has the potential to contaminate surface waters used for drinking water production and recreational purposes thus surface waters could be a source of contamination for animals shellfish and humans bivalve molluscan shellfish bms are known transmitters of enteric viruses in particular norovirus nov and hepatitis a virus hav bellou et al 2013 an iso method has been proposed for genome quantification of nov and hav in various foodstuffs including bms nf en iso 15216 2017 studies have been led on different bms in europe and asia with various results table 3 and again g3 is the most represented in europe whereas g3 and g4 are found in asia elsewhere as mentioned above water can contaminate food products by irrigation of crops khuroo et al 2016 studies led in canada and various countries in europe have found hev on field grown strawberries vegetables frozen raspberries and salad brassard et al 2012 kokkinos et al 2012 maunula et al 2013 terio et al 2017 to conclude on this part it appears that hev particles may be found at each stage of the water cycle even if their infectivity cannot be confirmed by molecular methods they may be found in large numbers in rivers in some cases resulting in a direct contamination risk for animals or indirect risk for humans through irrigation of crops contamination of resources for drinking water production and in bms producing areas to our knowledge the minimal hev infectious dose is still unknown but by analogy with nov hall 2012 and hav sánchez 2013 we can assume that 10 to 50 viral particles can be enough to make people ill and lead to an outbreak to know if this hev can really infect hosts and in what proportion we need to assess its capacity to remain infectious in water that is its survival 5 hev survival in water under natural conditions temperature and sunlight uv are the two main factors that may inactivate hev in water during drinking water treatment the physical treatment allows the removal of the viral particle whereas the disinfection process mainly based on chlorine impacts virus survival 5 1 method used to evaluate survival the reference method to evaluate viral infectivity is in vitro cell culture or assays which can be performed in vivo the use of the term inactivation for a virus means that the infectivity has been assayed by a cell culture method many enteric viruses can be cultivated on cells but some are difficult to cultivate and hev is one of them that being said some culture systems have been found a g3 strain je03 1760f and a g4 strain hev jf5 15f originating from human stool samples have been cultivated on plc prf 5 cells human hepatic carcinoma and a549 cells human lung cancer the g4 strain originated from a patient with a fulminant hepatitis this strain was propagated and passed more effectively than the g3 one tanaka et al 2009 moreover hepg2 and huh7 cells human hepatic carcinoma are not permissive for je03 1760f and hev jf5 15f strains originating from the stool samples but can support propagation and passages of the cell culture adapted je03 1760f and he jf5 15f strains okamoto 2013 g1 g3 and g4 strains originating from blood samples can also be cultivated on plc prf 5 and a549 cells okamoto 2013 a g3 strain kernow c1 isolated from a chronically infected patient s stool could effectively infect numerous cell lines from humans hepatic carcinoma hepg2 c3a and huh7 5 hepatoma plc prf 5 lung carcinoma a549 and colorectal adenocarcinoma caco 2 pigs kidney llc pk1 llc pk1a and sk rst and deer liver ohh1 li after being passed six times on hepg2 c3a cells the kernow c1 strain was able to grow more effectively in these cells shukla et al 2011 among these cell lines llc pk1 seems to be the most permissible to kernow c1 and kernow c1 p6 infections shukla et al 2011 another strain has been described by other authors lbpr 0379 strain isolated from a chronically infected patient g3 has a growth advantage in cell culture hepg2 c3a cells nguyen et al 2012 recently a three dimensional culture system has been developed for hev it seems to be a promising system that needs to be improved berto et al 2013 however the drawback of all these culture methods is that they are time consuming and difficult to apply another method has been developed by some authors in order to overcome the problems of culture and rt pcr it consists in a pre treatment of the sample with an rnase prior to rna extraction free rna damaged viruses will be destroyed by the rnase and only encapsidated rna will be taken into account this method has been used on hev in order to study its resistance to some temperatures schielke et al 2011 another approach has been developed the use of intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma and ethidium monoazide ema this strategy allows the assessment of capsid integrity these molecules will enter the cell if the membrane integrity is disrupted covalently bind to dna and inhibit pcr girones et al 2010 some authors have tested this approach on bacteria and recently others have attempted to develop it on rna viruses leifels et al 2015 parshionikar et al 2010 with various results this method is not relevant if the virus is inactivated with a preserved capsid and the secondary rna structure seems to interfere with the binding of the intercalating agent parshionikar et al 2010 the results can also vary according to which virus is studied and which region of its genome is targeted by pcr leifels et al 2015 in order to properly draw conclusions with cell culture work it is useful to know if we are working with non enveloped or quasi enveloped hev it seems that when working with liver cells such as huh 7 plc prf 5 and hepg2 or lung cells such as a549 the produced virions are predominantly quasi enveloped if the virus is then treated with a bile salt e g deoxycholic acid and a protease e g trypsin it can lose its envelope okamoto 2013 takahashi et al 2010 yin et al 2016b 2016a 5 2 thermal inactivation a review has summarized all tested methods of inactivation for hev in food matrices cook and van der poel 2015 as a consequence it focused on high temperatures used for food treatment or cooking which do not match environmental conditions nevertheless some interesting data were described first even if in the review no discussion was made about enveloped and non enveloped virus we can extract some data concerning the survival of non enveloped hev since stool extracted strains were studied moreover some of these data could be compared with those reported in a review focussing on the impact of temperature on the inactivation of enteric viruses in food and water bertrand et al 2012 in the latter review the authors determined the tfl value of each enteric virus which was defined as the time needed in days to observe the first log10 reduction the tfl values of the different enteric viruses were compared as a function of the temperature range 50 c or 50 c of the matrix type simple or complex and the detection method cell culture or pcr the log10tfl was then used a few studies described in cook s review allow us to calculate some tfl values thus a one log reduction was observed for hev g1 strain in stool suspension after exposure to 56 c for 15 min emerson et al 2005 this means that the tfl value reached 0 01 day under these conditions which is close to the tfl values observed for highly resistant enteric viruses such as phix174 phage and f specific rna phages of genogroup i this also suggests that hev could be more resistant than hav under these particular conditions but there is a huge difference in the number of data between these two hepatitis viruses with 38 data for hav bertrand et al 2012 and only one for hev from another study yunoki et al 2008 the tfl of hev at 60 c could be estimated at 0 02 day in a 25 albumin solution and 0 007 day in phosphate buffered saline in both cases the comparison with data from the review bertrand et al 2012 suggests that hev has a resistance close to that observed for f specific rna phages and higher than that observed for hav when hev was subjected to dry heating the tfl seemed to be of 0 4 day at 60 c and of 0 16 day at 80 c which is much higher than under the previous heat conditions yunoki et al 2008 johne et al 2016 have evaluated the impact of high temperatures in the range of 60 c 80 c on quasi enveloped hev in suspension in cell culture medium the tfl value reached 2 3 10 4 day 20 s at 70 c these authors worked with quasi enveloped hev particles we can thus attempt a comparison with an enveloped virus we have chosen hepatitis c virus hcv which is a well documented enveloped virus like hev its genome consists of a positive polarity single strand rna hcv in cell culture medium at a concentration of 2 5 103 ffu focus forming unit had a tfl of about 6 10 4 day 40 seconds at 65 c song et al 2010a thus the resistance of quasi enveloped hev might be close to that observed for hcv at high temperatures in the study by schielke et al 2011 the authors assayed the effect of short term heating on rnase protected hev g3 particles a reduction of 74 was observed after incubation at 56 c for 15 min and reduction rates above 99 2 16 to 4 42 log10 were observed after incubation at 56 c for 30 min or 60 min and at 60 c for 15 min 30 min or 60 min as these authors worked on a liver suspension we can infer that they mostly worked on quasi enveloped hev we can thus attempt a comparison with hcv as above when in human serum a 3 6 log10 inactivation was observed at 56 c for 30 min song et al 2010a caution is required when comparing these data since the assays were performed using a pcr derived technique for the detection of rnase protected hev schielke et al 2011 and by cell culture for hcv song et al 2010a johne et al 2016 and schielke et al 2011 also worked at low temperatures i e 37 c more frequently encountered under environmental conditions tfl values could be calculated from the results of johne et al 2016 a tfl of about 3 days at 22 c and about 2 days at 37 c in cell culture medium could be determined if again we compare that to hcv the tfl is of about 5 days at 25 c 2 c and about 9 h at 37 c song et al 2010a this would make quasi enveloped hev less resistant than hcv at room temperature and more resistant at 37 c but these results need confirmation from other studies second the thermal resistance of hev may depend on the virus strain as emerson et al 2005 suggested while working with two g1 strains and one g2 strain third the culture based detection method directly or indirectly provides highly variable results and sometimes only qualitative results the resistance of hev to heat might depend on the genotype and on the origin of the virus which makes it either quasi enveloped or non enveloped all in all on average hev seems about as resistant as f specific rna phages for non enveloped hev or hcv for quasi enveloped hev however other studies would be needed with as much as possible harmonized temperatures durations virus forms matrices and measurement methods 5 3 uv inactivation a recent study has compared the impact of uv radiation on hev g3 and ms2 phage in terms of loss of infectivity and degradation of the genome guerrero latorre et al 2016 the inactivation of hev was estimated by cell culture combined with immunofluorescence a viral suspension of 5 93 102 ffu ml was first irradiated with fluences of 10 20 40 80 100 and 140 mj cm2 since a fluence of only 10 mj cm2 was sufficient to inactivate hev a second experiment was performed with a viral suspension of 5 58 103 ffu ml by using fluences of 0 2 5 7 and 10 mj cm2 a regression curve was then constructed to predict fluences needed for viral inactivation it allowed the authors to determine that a fluence of 23 19 mj cm2 was needed for a 4 log10 99 99 inactivation the viral suspensions were coming from culture it can thus be assumed that the inactivation of hev by uv was determined for quasi enveloped hev a review paper has compared the uv radiation values needed to inactivate enteric pathogenic viruses such as poliovirus n 6 hav n 3 coxsackievirus n 2 and adenovirus n 7 and bacteriophages such as ms2 n 5 and qβ n 1 f specific rna phages and phix174 n 4 phages hijnen et al 2006 the inactivation rate constants named k values were determined for each virus the higher it is the more sensitive to uv the microorganism is the lowest k values were obtained for adenovirus and ms2 phage the k value of ms2 phage reached 0 08 in the experiments performed by guerrero latorre et al 2016 and was in accordance with the review by hijnen et al 2006 for quasi enveloped hev a k value of 0 153 could be calculated it was close to that of hav which was the least resistant of the viruses compared in the review published by hijnen et al 2006 for experiments performed with poliovirus and f specific rna phages it has been shown that inactivation by uv is correlated with genome size the longer the genome is the more sensitive it is to uv simonet and gantzer 2006 we should notice that hav and hev have about the same genome length with 7 5 and 7 2 103 nucleotides respectively moreover simonet and gantzer 2006 have also shown that genome degradation could explain uv induced viral inactivation to summarize quasi enveloped hev virus has a resistance to uv similar to that of other enteric viruses such as hav but lower than that of ms2 phage however other experiments would be needed in order to test non enveloped hev which would be more representative of particles that can be found in environmental waters other studies on other genotypes also need to be conducted because as with thermal inactivation virus behaviour might vary from one genotype to another 5 4 chlorine inactivation in a study reported by cook and van der poel 2015 hev treated with sodium hypochlorite was inoculated into a culture of plc prf 5 cells no cytopathic effect was observed but replication could be inferred from detection of hev rna however hev seems to be chlorine sensitive indeed in the same study it was reported that in cultures inoculated with untreated hev rna was detectable up to day 33 whereas it was detectable only for 7 days with treated hev results not shown another study led by girones et al 2014 compared chlorine resistance of hev g1 to that of human adenovirus 2 hadv2 in that study hev g1 originating both from culture and faeces was treated with sodium hypochlorite at 1000 ppm a first phase with an initial decline in infectious units of approximately 2 log was reported followed by a phase of further decline of less than 1 log and a still detectable rna and infectious viruses at 30 min hadv2 was more resistant to chlorination than hev ct concentration time values of 0 15 mg l min for quasi enveloped hev and 0 12 mg l min for non enveloped hev for 1 log reduction for hev and 1 15 mg l min for 1 log reduction for hadv2 the authors then compared chlorine activity on hev with and without sewage in the water ct values needed for a 2 log reduction of hev infectivity was 20 times higher with 1 sewage in the water compared to without sewage we can attempt a comparison with hav sobsey et al 1988 have studied the resistance of hav to chlorination from their data the ct value needed for 1 log reduction was estimated to be about 0 85 mg l min at 5 c and ph 6 and about 1 mg ml min at 5 c and ph 8 in their study on hev girones et al 2014 do not specify the ph and temperature conditions under which they performed their experiments so the comparison with hav is not easy but if we suppose that the conditions were close to those of sobsey et al then we can conclude that hev is more sensitive to chlorination than hav hev thus seems to be quite sensitive to chlorination as it is more susceptible than hadv2 and hav however this needs to be confirmed by further studies carried out with more harmonized conditions temperature ph and different types of hev in different types of environment e g clean water sewage containing water etc all in all it seems that hev does not exhibit a particularly high level of resistance to the main inactivating factors for viruses in water i e heat uv and chlorine compared to classical models of enteric viruses namely ms2 phage or f specific rna phages or to other pathogenic enteric viruses such as hav the classical multi barrier treatments to prevent enteric virus transmission to humans should thus be effective for hev the question is still under discussion for animals in order to expand our knowledge of hev resistance to treatments a method to assess rapidly and with high sensitivity and specificity the quantity of infectious viruses would be needed and as much as possible standardized studies need to be conducted harmonizing temperature or chlorine concentration is difficult to achieve but some efforts can be made on the duration of study or on the uv wavelength and fluence 6 physical removal in the environment and water treatment the behaviour of virus particles in the environment depends mainly on their size and on their surface properties including their electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity the size of hev is similar to that of most other pathogenic enteric viruses such as hav 27 33 nm or nov 27 nm and phages used as models such as f specific rna 20 30 nm hartard et al 2016 kapikian et al 1972 kuzmanovic et al 2003 rumnieks and tars 2017 yokosuka 2000 it is known that the virus charge depends on its isoelectric point abbreviations pi or iep and on the ph of the medium a negative charge is observed if the ph is above the pi and conversely a positive charge is observed when the ph is below the pi gerba 1984 to date nothing is known about the pi of hev even less so about its charge under environmental conditions defining total charge is far from an easy task because viruses are soft particles for which the genome may have an impact on the surface charge dika et al 2011 langlet et al 2008a the variability of hev may also impact its pi and charge indeed as there are different genotypes and subgenotypes a quasispecies distribution quasi enveloped and non enveloped forms the virus can be found under different forms within environment waters this can have an impact on its hydrophobicity and charge and thus on its behaviour charge greatly influences virus behaviour bhattacharjee et al 2002 thus high negative charge or low pi leads to low adhesion aggregation capacity in a review written in 2010 a summary of the isoelectric points of various viruses was constructed from this summary it was concluded that the pi is essential but not sufficient to predict adhesion michen and graule 2010 in fact hydrophobicity has also proved to be highly important in the adhesion aggregation process and may be of great importance in water treatment processes for example boudaud et al 2012 hydrophobic interactions are short distance interactions which may take place when the electrostatic charge of viral particles is low because of the virus type the medium ph close to the pi or a high ionic strength leading to ions neutralizing the particle charge dika et al 2015 langlet et al 2008b hydrophobicity of the different amino acids can also have an impact on surface adhesion as shown for nov samandoulgou et al 2015 changes in physico chemical conditions e g ionic strength or temperature can affect the secondary or tertiary structure and change which amino acids are exposed on the surface thus modifying hydrophobicity and adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces as discussed before hev can exist under non enveloped or quasi enveloped forms the presence of the quasi envelope means that there are lipids which should make the virus more hydrophobic thus modifying its physico chemical characteristics and therefore its behaviour again very little is known about hev hydrophobicity to begin addressing the question of the impact of hydrophobicity we compared orf2 sequences between the different hev genotypes using the antheprot software as already stated in the second paragraph and as shown in fig 2 subgenotypes 3 showed a large number of differences in their hydrophobicity profiles between residues 68 and 100 the hydrophobicity profiles obtained for g3f and g3h were compared which showed major differences for subgenotypes 4 differences in their hydrophobicity profiles were observed between residues 67 and 74 and residues 95 and 100 data not shown to conclude on this part hev is about the same size as many pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteriophages from which we could infer some behavioural data however its charge hydrophobicity and adhesion are still unknown and given its high variability intergenotype intragenotype quasispecies and different forms these criteria could vary which could impact the virus behaviour and transmission 7 how may we include the variability of hev in future studies concerning water in the future the investigation into hev variability concerning water will be facilitated by a number of increasingly sensitive molecular methods designed to analyse viral genomic plasticity these methods could prove useful for the study of the sequences of different hev isolates coming from different types of samples in order to better understand the virus circulation concentration and extraction methods are difficult to implement charge size and hydrophobicity of the virus are variable so far it has been possible to use direct sequencing sanger sequencing to sequence a variable part of the genome and then to study phylogenic links based on the results and to determine the genotype and sometimes the subgenotype xia et al 2015 that method only shows the main hev population but allows for the direct comparison between the sequences of different samples when it comes to quasispecies study cloning sequencing or ultra deep sequencing uds can be used cloning sequencing is considered to be a reference method in the exploration of viral quasispecies but this method has drawbacks it is time consuming expensive and the number of clones that are studied limits its sensitivity ramírez et al 2013 in the best case scenario about 100 clones can be sequenced which poorly represents a population of millions or even more of viral particles uds method allows the production of millions of sequences within one run and is less expensive than previous methods many different uds techniques have been developed such as illumina sequencing using synthesis ion torrent or pyrosequencing each one of them has its own advantages and drawbacks and the choice of technique used will depend on the local equipment personal experience and the type of microorganism being studied quail et al 2012 the outputs from the sanger sequencing and uds should be analysed by informatics tools analyses can be done on the resulting data keeping in mind the pros and cons of each sequencing technique these different techniques can be used together and compared according to the data comparisons can be made between the sequences of different samples and between the different subpopulations within one sample the diversity and complexity can be calculated between different subpopulations lhomme et al 2012 various protein properties such as the antigenicity profile can be predicted through use of the antheprot software as discussed above parker et al 1986 this approach has also been used in some studies and helps the determination of whether or not an amino acid substitution has consequences on the function of the protein schvoerer et al 2013 it can help the determination of viral behaviour and give information on the transmission which can be completed by analysis of different sample types such as human or animal samples however there is a need for a method that would allow the concentration of hev as many of the virus characteristics vary it would be complicated to use a method based on viral size charge or hydrophobicity as long as many of hev characteristics remain unknown or poorly known methods to study the virus will be difficult to implement 8 conclusion the transmission and persistence of hev in the environment are still poorly understood as explained in the present review hev seems to be quite resistant to high temperatures in its non enveloped form and as resistant as hcv in its quasi enveloped form we point out that the few studies performed on uv treatment suggest that hev has the same susceptibility as hav which is a uv sensitive virus compared to ms2 phage and that hev is sensitive to chlorination the classical treatments and surveillance methods to fight against enteric viruses should be effective against hev we are dealing with a highly variable virus there are different genotypes and subgenotypes a quasispecies distribution and quasi enveloped and non enveloped forms different particles can thus be found in environmental waters depending on the geographic location or the origin and type of pollution this can have an impact on the virus quantity hydrophobicity charge and infectivity and therefore on its behaviour and resistance to treatments virus culture from water samples would be informative but currently seems rather ambitious more information is also needed concerning hev surface properties isoelectric point hydrophobicity to better predict its behaviour in the environment and develop optimized concentration techniques in order to study it this knowledge will help sanitary authorities to monitor the circulation of hev and to develop measures to prevent human contamination declaration of interest none funding no sponsors were involved in the writing of this review all authors salaries

19049,cyanobacterial bloom events that produce natural toxins occur in freshwaters across the globe yet the potential risk of many cyanobacterial metabolites remains mostly unknown only microcystins one class of cyanopeptides have been studied intensively and the wealth of evidence regarding exposure concentrations and toxicity led to their inclusion in risk management frameworks for water quality however cyanobacteria produce an incredible diversity of hundreds of cyanopeptides beyond the class of microcystins the question arises whether the other cyanopeptides are in fact of no human and ecological concern or whether these compounds merely received too little attention thus far current observations suggest that an assessment of their eco toxicological risk is indeed relevant first other cyanopeptides including cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins can occur just as frequently and at similar nanomolar concentrations as microcystins in surface waters second cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aeruginosins and microginins inhibit proteases in the nanomolar range in contrast to protein phosphatase inhibition by microcystins cyanopeptolins aeruginosins and aerucyclamide also show toxicity against grazers in the micromolar range comparable to microcystins the key challenge for a comprehensive risk assessment of cyanopeptides remains their large structural diversity lack of reference standards and high analytical requirements for identification and quantification one way forward would be a prevalence study to identify the priority candidates of tentatively abundant persistent and toxic cyanopeptides to make comprehensive risk assessments more manageable graphical abstract image 1 keywords harmful algal bloom cyanobacteria toxin risk assessment ecotoxicology human health 1 introduction our ecosystems and drinking water resources are not only vulnerable towards anthropogenic pollutants but also natural toxins bucheli 2014 among the natural toxins from organisms of various kingdoms those produced by aquatic organisms such as cyanobacteria blue green algae are of particular concern for water resources since these waterborne toxins are released directly into surface waters when the cells die bogialli et al 2017 flores and caixach 2015 saker et al 2005 because cyanobacteria produce a diverse mixture of potentially toxic metabolites there is a need to identify which of these metabolites are of toxicological concern cyanobacteria can grow to extremely high densities forming so called harmful algal blooms within few days or weeks such blooms generally occur at warmer temperatures higher nutrient loads adequate light penetration into the water and residence time of the water schindler 2006 whitton 2012 cyanobacterial bloom events have deleterious effects on the ecosystem and on human activities including decreased biodiversity higher oxygen consumption due to decaying biomass restriction of recreational activities limited usability of water for agriculture and the need for additional technical measures to provide safe drinking water while bloom events occur also under pristine conditions and at colder temperatures ostermaier and kurmayer 2010 trout haney et al 2016 anthropogenic pressure contributes to extended warm periods and high nutrient loads that favor growth of cyanobacteria o neil et al 2012 cyanobacterial blooms occur regularly in numerous lakes baumann and juttner 2008 gkelis et al 2015 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes et al 2012 mazur marzec et al 2013 and drinking water reservoirs ferranti et al 2013 grabowska et al 2014 jancula et al 2014 welker et al 2006 but our knowledge about the potential risks of the secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria remains limited among the bioactive metabolites cyanobacteria produce low molecular weight toxins including anatoxin saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin but also non ribosomal oligopeptides termed cyanopeptides which this review focuses on to date microcystins are the one class of cyanopeptides that is studied most intensely across scientific disciplines with more than 300 journal articles published annually on the topic fig 1 a the dominance of studies on microcystins may have been catalyzed by the early link of this compound class to human intoxications in 1996 the death of 52 dialysis patients due to liver failure was traced back to water contaminated with cyanobacteria and the presence of microcystins in a brazilian hospital carmichael et al 2001 pouria et al 1998 these tragic incidents in brazil triggered the interest in assessing toxicity of microcystins and monitoring environmental concentrations in addition intoxication of human has been reported across the globe mostly by recreational exposure through inhalation of aerosols or swallowing contaminated surface water and a comprehensive review on epidemiological research can be found elsewhere svircev et al 2017 essentially for every country on the globe at least one isi publication documents the occurrence of microcystin producing cyanobacteria meriluoto et al 2017 trout haney et al 2016 because microcystins are potent liver toxins and can occur at up to micromolar concentrations during cyanobacterial bloom events several countries include microcystins in their risk management frameworks for water quality ibelings et al 2014 despite the wealth of publications even microcystins remain an active field of research for example to better understand why cyanobacteria produce these complex molecules how production is regulated how water treatment can be improved for their effective removal and which regulatory implementations are needed to protect human and ecosystem health during bloom events ibelings et al 2014 while microcystins are of ecotoxicological concern several studies with cyanobacterial extracts observed toxic effects that could not be explained by the presence of microcystins alone suggesting that other bioactive metabolites need to be considered in risk assessment as well baumann and juttner 2008 keil et al 2002 le manach et al 2016 smutna et al 2014 teneva et al 2003 2005 recent advancements of analytical techniques enabled researcher to identify hundreds of cyanopeptides beyond the well known class of microcystins including cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aerucyclamides aeruginosines and microginins with a multitude of structural variants within each class welker and von döhren 2006 however these cyanopeptides have received little attention thus far regarding their potential human and ecological risk this article raises awareness for the diversity of biologically active and potentially toxic cyanopeptides that human and wildlife can be exposed to during cyanobacterial bloom events information regarding co occurrence of cyanopeptides potential exposure concentrations in surface waters and toxic effects is synthesized with a particular focus on quantitative data rather than phenomenological observations key challenges and research needs towards a risk assessment of cyanopeptides are discussed 2 cyanopeptides beyond microcystins the 1990s present the onset of ever increasing records of cyanopeptide studies not only for microcystins but also for nodularin aeruginosins anabaenopeptins cyanopeptolins microginins microviridins and aerucyclamides in the 2000s among others fig 1 over the past decades a legion of other cyanopeptides beyond microcystins has been identified in pure cultures and biomass collected from cyanobacterial bloom events beversdorf et al 2017 bogialli et al 2017 flores and caixach 2015 saker et al 2005 welker et al 2004 in the 1960s some early studies reported the production of aeruginosins from microcystis aeruginosa a cyanobacterial genus renowned for producing also microcystins herbert and holliman 1964 holliman 1969 murakami et al 1995 namikoshi and rinehart 1996 despite the increasing scientific output across cyanopeptide classes the publication records are heavily disproportionate as studies on cyanopeptides other than microcystins represent less than 10 of the total scientific output particularly few studies are available within the disciplines of environmental chemistry with less than 100 studies for other cyanopeptides together compared to more than 2000 studies focusing on environmental behavior of microcystins alone here the key challenge for a systematic risk assessment is the large diversity of cyanopeptides this article will first demonstrate the structural diversity of cyanopeptides before presenting the current understanding of their co occurrence exposure concentrations and quantitative information about toxicity 2 1 structural diversity peptides comprise more than 60 percent of the known biological active compounds produced by cyanobacteria chlipala et al 2011 in addition to more than 240 microcystins a minimum of 500 cyanopeptides ranging from 400 to 1900 da have been structurally identified to date and with their variety comes the complexity of the naming system meriluoto et al 2017 welker and von döhren 2006 cyanopeptides consist of cyclic and linear non ribosomal peptides that can also contain non proteinogenic residues and posttranslational modifications welker and döhren presented a classification of cyanopeptides based on conserved molecular substructures welker and von döhren 2006 each class contains a characteristic substructure with a shared biosynthesis pathway while variations of monomers define the different variants within each class for example microcystins are heptapeptides with the characteristic adda moiety 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl deca 4 6 dienoic acid and the different variants result from altering monomers in mainly two positions the variation is typically expressed by adding the one letter code of the amino acid so that microcystin lr refers to the variant with leucine l and arginine r in positions 2 and 4 respectively however the one letter code is limited to the standard amino acids and other modifications require more elaborate suffixes nodularins are hexapeptides with a similar structure to microcystins including the adda moiety structural representations of prominent classes beyond microcystins are presented in fig 2 including the cyclic classes of cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins and aeru cyclamides as well as linear peptide classes of aeruginosines and microginins each class contains a conserved substructure indicative of this class and variable building blocks other than microcystins more than two monomeric building blocks can vary in these peptides resulting in a large combinatorial set of isoforms within each cyanopeptide class for example anabaenopeptins carry characteristic ureido bond and variation in the other five building blocks is possible details in box 1 among the cyanopeptides beyond microcystins cyanopeptolins contain the most structurally known compounds approx 36 followed by microginins approx 14 aeruginosins 13 cryptophycins and anabaenopeptins approx 9 each other than these cyanopeptide classes the depsipeptidic crytophycins have mostly been isolated from nostoc sp and not from a variety of other cyanobacteria schwartz et al 1990 often several synonyms exist for the same class of cyanopeptides or individual compounds because no standardized naming systems was introduced early on for example the class of cyanopeptolins is also referred to as microcystilides micropeptins aeruginopeptins or oscillapeptins and aeruginosins are also known as microcins or spumigins in the early literature the cyanopeptide names are often chosen to refer to the taxon from which the compound had been isolated from and a suffix is added referring to structural properties including characteristic residues molecular weight or strain number further details of some additional cyanopeptides and their naming systems can be found in comprehensive reviews on this matter chlipala et al 2011 van wagoner et al 2007 welker and von döhren 2006 3 occurrence of cyanopeptides during bloom events the chemical diversity of cyanopeptides is large but how common are these compounds in surface waters dominated by cyanobacteria while the abundance of cyanobacteria can be monitored successfully following cyanobacterial peptides is more challenging because of the variety of potential target compounds few studies focused on the presence of cyanopeptides other than microcystins but those that did search further discovered that microcystins never occurred alone while the ecological benefit for cyanobacteria to produce these complex and metabolically expensive cyanopeptides has not been completely resolved not even for microcystins evidence is presented below on their abundance and bioactivity 3 1 ability of cyanopeptide production the likelihood of cyanopeptides to occur in the environment depends on the presence of cyanobacteria that carry the genes for toxin production and that these genes are actually expressed the exposure concentrations of cyanopeptides depend on the abundance of those toxin producers and the cyanopeptide production dynamics as well as the degradation and fate processes of toxins in surface waters genotype analysis can reveal gene clusters that are indicative of the metabolic synthesis pathways for cyanopeptides kurmayer et al 2011 2015 cyanopeptide biosynthesis involves multi enzyme complexes of non ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases that can be conserved across cyanobacterial genomes kurmayer et al 2011 2015 neilan et al 2013 for example the biosynthetic cluster code and highly conserved multidomain proteins required to produce microcystins have been identified in the genus of microcystis planktothrix nostoc and dolichospermum anabaena christiansen et al 2003 kosol et al 2009 kurmayer and christiansen 2009 merel et al 2013 rantala et al 2004 rouhiainen et al 2004 zikova et al 2010 within one species the genes may not always be expressed and also non producing strains exists that lack the ability to produce microcystins altogether bogialli et al 2017 briand et al 2016 davis et al 2009 kurmayer and christiansen 2009 kurmayer et al 2004 welker and von döhren 2006 at the same time one cyanobacterial species can harbor biosynthesis pathways for several cyanopeptides beyond microcystins kurmayer and christiansen 2009 neilan et al 2013 shishido et al 2017 for example the biosynthesis genes for microcystins anabaenopeptins aeruginosins microginins microviridins and cyanopeptolins were identified in the common cyanobacteria planktothrix rubescens and p agardhii as well as in microcystis sp kurmayer et al 2016 otten et al 2017 overall much less genetic information for example regarding indicative syntheses gene clusters or distribution of non producing strains is available for cyanopeptides beyond microcystins cyanobacteria often co occur during bloom events and their genotypes suggest that they are able to produce different cyanopeptides but not whether these metabolites are actually produced 3 2 production during bloom events chemical analysis verifies that cyanobacteria can indeed use their genetic ability effectively to biosynthesize cyanopeptides during bloom events a variety of cyanopeptides was frequently detected in lakes rivers estuaries and reservoirs affected by cyanobacteria across the globe including studies in italy greece poland portugal israel switzerland and finland ferranti et al 2013 gkelis et al 2015 grabowska et al 2014 lifshits and carmeli 2012 lopes et al 2012 rohrlack et al 2009 additional studies inspected field isolates which constitute cyanobacterial cultures isolated from environmental samples and regrown under laboratory conditions all 26 cyanobacterial isolates from a drinking water reservoir in portugal produced a range of aeruginosines anabaenopeptins and microcystins saker et al 2005 similar field isolates originating from a czech reservoir showed up to 90 co occurring cyanopeptides from brazilian surface waters up to 38 cyanopeptides and nearly 60 cyanopeptides from baltic sea isolates mazur marzec et al 2016 sanz et al 2015 welker et al 2006 advanced analytical techniques further revealed the diverse cyanopetidome on the cellular scale realized by analyzing single bacterial colonies and cyanobacterial filaments with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms harustiakova and welker 2017 welker et al 2004 3 3 exposure concentrations in surface waters quantification of cyanopeptides is a key prerequisite to characterize the potential exposure concentrations in surface waters where cyanobacteria proliferate most studies however only report qualitative information such as frequencies of detection of cyanopeptides as mentioned above to date only few studies quantified absolute concentrations of cyanopeptides beyond microcystins fig 3 a recent study quantified three cyanopeptolins one microginins two anabaenopeptins and five microcystins in samples from six eutrophic lakes in the united states beversdorf et al 2017 another study assessed the aqueous concentrations of five anabaenopeptins one cyanopeptolin and ten microcystins in european lakes using analytical standards isolated from biomass extracts here all cyanopeptides were detected frequently with 87 for microcystins 90 for a cyanopeptolin and 100 for anabaenopeptins chorus et al 2006 data in fig 3 show that concentrations were in the μg l range i e nanomolar and microcystins were not always dominating particularly in the european lakes the study on european lakes further showed that cyanopeptide production from one cyanobacterial species can vary between different lakes and only correlated with biovolume of cyanobacteria for some cyanopeptides chorus et al 2006 furthermore a recent study of the u s great lakes basin demonstrates that the total load of cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins entering drinking water treatment plants can be comparable to microcystins and also correlated with abundance of cyanobacteria cell count chlorophyll a and organic carbon concentrations uv absorbance turbidity beversdorf et al 2018 such quantitative assessments are rare because of the lack of standard reference materials for most cyanopeptides that would allow to convert a signal from analytical instruments into the absolute mass of a cyanopeptide present in the sample currently reference standards of 12 microcystins mc lr rr yr la lf lw wr d asp3 lr d asp3 rr htyr hilr are commercially available and partially included in standardized analytical methods iso 20179 2005 us epa method 544 which can reach sensitivities in the low nanomolar range e g by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry the limited availability of reference standards restricts comprehensive quantification of cyanopeptide concentrations considering that more than 240 microcystin isoforms and many more additional cyanopeptides have been identified meriluoto et al 2017 organic synthesis was achieved for some linear aeruginosines that also allowed to selectively test the effect of subtle changes of functional moieties i e chloride and sulfate removal scherer et al 2016 scherer and gademann 2017 however organic synthesis is currently not feasible for the structurally more complex cyanopeptides particularly considering the stereochemistry of these molecules most commercially available cyanopeptide materials stem from isolation efforts of cyanobacterial biomass called bioreagents which do not strictly qualify as reference material because of their lower purity and even certified reference materials come in varying purity and require batch to batch verification of the absolute concentration without reference standards for each compound of interest one common alternative is to report semi quantitative concentrations relative to an available standard microcystin lr 4 toxicity of cyanopeptides considering that other cyanopeptides indeed occur at similar concentrations as microcystins during cyanobacterial bloom events there is a need to evaluate their potential eco toxicological risk in the following first those studies are highlighted that assessed the sub lethal effects for these cyanopeptides then studies are presented that focused on microcystins alone but observations suggest that additional compounds might be present in the cyanobacterial extracts that contributed to toxic effects 4 1 sub lethal effects one common effect observed for cyanopeptides is the inhibition of enzymes particularly inhibition of proteases has been frequently reported for cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aeruginosins and microginins with inhibitory potencies ic50 values down to the low nanomolar range comparable to concentrations observed during bloom events fig 4 for cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins and aeruginosins inhibition of human serine proteases involved in blood coagulation was observed i e factor via viia thrombin plasmin and kallikrein bonjouklian et al 1996 gademann et al 2010 hanessian et al 2006 kodani et al 1999 kohler et al 2014 schreuder et al 2016 and inhibition of pancreatic and leucocyte elastases for cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins bubik et al 2008 sedmak et al 2008 further tests with proteases showed inhibition of carboxypeptidases a b and leucine aminopeptidase involved in food metabolism for cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins and microginins ishida et al 1997 1998 2000a itou et al 1999 kodani et al 1999 murakami et al 2000 walther et al 2009 inhibition of angiotensin converting enzymes involved in blood pressure regulation for microginins kodani et al 1999 okino et al 1993 and inhibition of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity for cyanopeptolins and aeruginosins banker and carmeli 1999 bister et al 2004 bonjouklian et al 1996 gademann et al 2010 hanessian et al 2006 kodani et al 1999 kohler et al 2014 raveh and carmeli 2009 reshef and carmeli 2001 sano and kaya 1995 von elert et al 2005 microginins were also observed to inhibit the mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase muller et al 2006 and aerucyclamides showed activity against leukemia cells and human parasites ishida et al 2000b portmann et al 2008b cyanopeptides also show antimicrobial antifungal and antimycobacterial activity as recently reviewed elsewhere swain et al 2017 another common observation is the toxicity against the grazing crustacean thamnocephalus platyurus reported for microcystins cyanopeptolins aeruginosins microginins and aerucyclamides with lc50 values in the low micromolar range mg l blom et al 2001 2003 bober and bialczyk 2017 gademann et al 2010 kohler et al 2014 portmann et al 2008a 2008b while the observed concentrations in lake water were one order of magnitude lower fig 3 much higher exposure concentration must be expected for organisms that feed directly on cyanobacterial cells by ingestion of biomass the hypothesis that cyanobacteria produce these complex molecules to defend themselves against predators is in line with observed toxicity against grazers and a promising avenue to further explore in future mechanistic studies cyanopeptides have been detected in tissue of exposed fish frogs snails and mussels but the toxicokinetics of internal distribution and bioaccumulation is not completely understood gkelis et al 2006 4 2 toxicity of microcystins and beyond microcystins are hepatotoxins that can enter liver cells by hitchhiking a specific membrane transporter i e organic anionic transporting polypeptide fischer et al 2005 once in the liver cell microcystins suppress enzyme activities by binding to protein phosphatases pp1 and pp2 which causes dysregulation formation of reactive oxygen species and eventually liver failure ding et al 2000 honkanen et al 1990 konst et al 1965 mackintosh et al 1990 the toxicity depends critically on the microcystin variant the exposure route and the target organisms for example the lethal dose to kill 50 of mice acute ld50 ranges between 5000 10 000 μg kg for oral and 50 μg kg for intraperitoneal administration kuiper goodman et al 1999 epidemiological studies indicate human health effects and potential cancer development from acute and chronic exposure to cyanopeptides as recently reviewed liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 some toxicological studies on microcystins offer clues concerning the potential toxicity of other cyanopeptides these studies did not include other cyanopeptides specifically but hint towards their toxicity when a the observed toxic effects exceeded the toxicity expected from microcystins alone or b the symptoms could not be associated with microcystins one example is the case of human exposure to cyanotoxins by recreational activities here the concurrence of illness was correlated with cyanobacterial cell number but vomiting diarrhea and flu symptoms could not directly be associated with the presence of known liver toxins microcystins or neurotoxins e g saxitoxin anatoxin berg et al 2011 pilotto et al 1997 other studies compared microcystin producing strains wild type with cyanobacterial strains that specifically cannot produce microcystins knock out mutants for example while only the microcystin producing strain had lethal effects on crustaceans daphnia geleata d magna also the non producing strain caused decreased ingestion rates increased enzyme production involved in biotransformation and altered reproductive processes suggesting that compounds other than microcystins also affect aquatic organisms dao et al 2013 hulot et al 2012 rohrlack et al 1999 additional studies frequently observed that extracts from the microcystin knock out mutants also caused adverse effects on aquatic organisms and cell lines baumann and juttner 2008 best et al 2001 dao et al 2013 fastner et al 2003 hulot et al 2012 keil et al 2002 liang et al 2017 smutna et al 2014 for example the formation of oedema and bent tails in zebrafish larvae and dysregulation in fish were observed also upon exposure to extracts of non microcystin producing cyanobacteria keil et al 2002 le manach et al 2016 information on the toxicity of some additional cyanopeptides including cryptophycins tolytoxin scytophycins and microviridins can be found elsewhere chlipala et al 2011 5 implications for risk assessment the key challenge for future risk assessment of cyanobacterial peptides is the need to cover a large chemical and biological space implications and research needs for analytical methods assessment of abundant and persistent peptides as well as toxic peptides to prioritize relevant cyanotoxins are discussed in the following fig 5 5 1 analytical methods hundreds of cyanopetides have been structurally identified and the lack of reference standard materials and comprehensive databases of all cyanopeptides are the key challenges for standardized and sensitive analytical detection high resolution tandem mass spectrometry hrms ms has become more widely available at scientific research institutions regulatory laboratories and even at larger water treatment utilities while hrms ms analysis alone is not sufficient for structurally elucidating newly identified compounds it can be directed to specifically detect and differentiate structurally known cyanopeptides so called suspect screening with hrms ms allows to identify cyanopeptides without available reference materials based on the exact mass m z presence of one or more charge states z 1 2 etc expected isotope pattern and common adducts e g h na nh4 as well as secondary fragmentation ms2 following procedures established for small organic pollutants and their transformation products krauss et al 2010 schymanski et al 2014 those cyanopeptides that are structurally known comprise the suspect list in this scenario the high resolving power and mass spectral accuracy is essential for a reliable assignment of the exact mass of a cyanopeptide other than for small organic molecules most cyanopeptides are large molecules and automated chemical formula assignment is often not reliable for identification to increase the confidence of the identification the secondary fragmentation pattern can be matched with in silico predictions and literature information because we also face isobaric compounds one needs to obtain fragmentation spectra that are unambiguously identifying a single cyanopeptide e g due to unique fragments for reliable and faster cyanopeptide identification a public spectral library should be built and maintained by collaborative efforts of the scientific community the use of extracts from pure cyanobacterial laboratory cultures may serve as qualitative reference materials for the identification of cyanopeptides in field samples for example when the dominating cyanobacterial species in a water body are known these field samples can be compared to the extract of the respective cyanobacterial species from laboratory culture this approach would allow to compare not only the spectral fragmentation but also the retention behavior during chromatographic separation retention time match with such diagnostic evidence cyanopeptides can be identified as the probable structure even without reference standards available level 2 after schymanski et al 2014 while identification of cyanopeptide is possible with conclusive hrms ms data the quantification without certified reference standards presents another critical challenge analytical chemistry widely relies on semi quantitative exposure concentrations thus far for example by microcystin lr equivalent concentrations for all cyanopeptides one avenue to explore can be a class specific semi quantitative equivalent approach that uses representative reference material of one abundant and potentially toxic cyanopeptides of each class however even among microcystin variants the analytical response can vary by a multitude due to different response factors in mass spectrometry which leads to higher uncertainties when relying on equivalent concentrations because variants of a cyanopeptide class vary only in a limited number of moieties a structure based prediction of response factors for variants within a cyanopeptide class presents an attractive opportunity in the case of electronspray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms commonly employed to analyse cyanopeptides the response factor comprises how well a structural moiety can be ionized which depends on instrumental parameters source settings mobile phase composition ph etc physico chemical properties of the analyte and matrix specific interferences for example the ionization of microcystins in esi ms depends largely on the presence of basic ionizable arginine moieties yuan et al 1999 but can also be greatly affected by polarity and vaporability of the target compounds kiontke et al 2016 in silico tools have been used in proteomic research to prioritize the best ionizable i e best observable proteolytic peptides for target proteins based on the primary sequence of linear peptides matsuda et al 2017 however such prediction becomes more complex with the stereochemistry of cyanopeptides particularly for cyclic structures wang and cole 1994 and in presence of sample matrix from biomass extracts e g ion suppression kankaanpaeae et al 2009 karlsson et al 2005 while these quantification methods may be sufficient to screen for general presence of cyanopeptide and tentative abundance reference standard materials of those cyanopeptide of toxicological concern are ultimately required 5 2 abundant and persistent peptides to make future risk assessment of cyanopeptides more manageable one approach is to assess the number of tentatively relevant compounds based on exposure concentrations by prioritizing those compounds that are produced in considerable amounts by common cyanobacteria peptide profiles can be assessed and curated for common strains in comprehensive archives and compared across geographic and temporal trends when the major cyanobacterial strains in a bloom event are identified one can explore whether the expected cyanopeptides can be predicted based on archived peptide profiles from laboratory cultures and field isolates while current literature suggests that only a smaller subset of cyanopeptides is expected at an individual site this may still comprise dozens of compounds among the abundant cyanopeptides those that are persistent could be further prioritized for risk assessment here both persistence in environmental and engineered systems is of interest environmental fate studies include biodegradability as well as mass transfer complexation abiotic hydrolysis and photochemical transformation processes microcystins are susceptible to microbial degradation and photochemical transformation but can still persist in water for several days or weeks de la cruz et al 2011 edwards et al 2008 sharma et al 2012 walker 2014 while open questions regarding the behavior of microcystins remain essentially no information currently exists on the fate of the other cyanopeptides the relatively long half life of microcystins in surface waters suggest that cyanopeptides can reach water treatment plants influents when blooms occur in freshwater reservoirs consequently the engineered processes need to be inspected for their ability to remove cyanopeptides by conventional treatment including sand and activated carbon filtration as well as advanced oxidation processes including uv h2o2 ozonation and membrane filtration all treatment options need to consider that intracellular toxins can be released by lysing the bacterial cells for example ozonation can effectively oxidize microcystins but also lyses cells and thus does not always result in sufficient total removal of the toxin hoeger et al 2005 since microcystins have been frequently detected even in finished drinking waters carmichael 2000 hoeger et al 2005 miller et al 2017 avoiding the intake of contaminated water and developing adoptive treatment strategies during bloom events needs to be considered for impacted source waters overall the fate and transformation behavior of cyanopeptides will define the exposure concentrations after release from the bacterial cells that need to be considered for risk assessment 5 3 toxic peptides in addition to chemical analysis effect based tests are needed in the process of prioritizing cyanopeptides first the most abundant and persistent compounds might not be the most toxic second not all cyanopeptides might be structurally known and would be missed by suspect screening with hrms ms as described above in addition toxicological analysis is promising to investigate mixture toxicities of co occurring cyanopeptides to identify and quantify the main toxicological effects of one cyanopeptide one can focus on a targeted approach with a specific hypothesis for the toxic mode of action or effect based analysis by screening various endpoints the hypothesis driven approach is challenged by the lack of information about potential target sites of these cyanopeptides we currently lack a clear understanding of internal distribution and concentrations of the cyanopeptides in the case of microcystins they do not only cause liver toxicity but have also been reported to induce neurological symptoms in exposed patients hu et al 2016 also the organic anion transporting polypeptides oatp which mediate the cellular uptake of microcystins are not only expressed in the liver but also at the blood brain barrier fischer et al 2005 a better understanding of the exposure routes can further guide which tissue will be in contact with cyanopeptides for example via aerosol inhalation and swallowing contaminated water the current literature demonstrates that cyanopeptides inhibit different target enzymes compared to microcystins which needs to be considered when selecting toxicity tests hence not only liver but also the brain gill lung and gut are among the plausible target organs to investigate in addition to the challenge that we are dealing with hundreds of cyanopeptides also many possible toxic modes of action need to be considered high throughput toxicity screening can be a powerful approach to sieve through thousands of potential endpoints high throughput toxicity screening uses in vitro toxicity assays and is being used extensively for testing the effects of chemicals and their mixtures in risk assessment and drug discovery szymanski et al 2012 cellular assays that measure defined toxic endpoints in automated and miniaturized systems present an opportunity to overcome the bottle neck of extremely low throughput in conventional in vivo tests however toxicity can not only be toxin specific but also cell specific and individual cellular models can not cover all possible toxic mechanisms processes that rely on cellular communication and control systems throughout the organisms astashkina et al 2012 transcriptomic analysis offers another holistic approach to predict potential adverse effects and molecular mechanisms considering the whole organism for example a reduced transcriptome atlas of the zebrafish was investigated for 74 chemicals including microcystin lr and cyanopeptolin 1020 revealing their effects on early neuronal development zhang and zhao 2018 the transcriptomics approach can help characterize and quantify unanticipated toxic effects but the relationship between gene expression and toxic mechanisms still needs to better understood and annotating the function of genes of organisms with ecological relevance is still limited schirmer et al 2010 in the future advanced data processing a mechanistic understanding and reduced costs may enable the wider use of transcriptomic screening for the risk assessment of cyanopeptides these screening approaches can also be used for crude cyanobacterial extracts without identifying each cyanopeptide therein the chemical demand of several mg for comprehensive toxicity tests are high compared to chemical analysis where even a few μg can be sufficient hence bioactive screening of complex extracts can be attractive to delineate a potential toxic sample early on when an effect is observed fractionation of extracts allows to further curtail the origin of a toxic effect but only isolation efforts of a single compound can yield clarity about toxic potencies of one specific cyanopeptide the risk assessment for cyanotoxins can learn from development in drug discovery that uses high throughput screening in combination with in silico modelling for toxicity but also for adsorption distribution metabolism and excretion van de waterbeemd and gifford 2003 in silico models rely on molecular modelling of the potential interaction of the compound with a target site e g an enzyme as well as data modelling including structure activity relationships once a target site has been identified for one cyanopeptide the molecular mechanism of toxicity and quantitative structure activity relationships can be further explored for other variants in the cyanopeptide class for example the binding affinities to carboxypeptidase has been recently modelled for a range of anabaenopeptins walther et al 2009 also the development of antibodies should be explored in the future to allow for quantification of total cyanopeptide of one class analogous to the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa existing for microcystins 6 conclusions the current state of the literature supports that cyanopeptides are bioactive and produced in legions at comparable frequency as microcystins in surface waters that are impacted by cyanobacteria consequently risk assessment of cyanopeptides beyond microcystins and their mixtures is necessary the few studies that quantified cyanopeptides beyond microcystins find that they can reach comparable concentrations and complementary studies are desired to verify these phenomena for different surface waters cyanobacterial species and bloom dynamics also additional toxicity studies are needed that target human and ecosystem health with relevant exposure scenarios the key challenge is the need to cover a large chemical and biological space for risk assessment without essential reference standards for the hundreds of known cyanopeptides to move forward from here advanced analytical methods to identify and quantify cyanopeptides need to be used to determine toxin profiles in field samples and laboratory strains to assess their fate and transformation processes and to screen for their potential bioactivity such prevalence study could reveal the priority candidates among cyanopeptides and their mixtures for which a comprehensive risk assessment will be more manageable fig 5 the combined approach of chemical and effect based screening aims for an informed decision about the tentatively abundant persistent and toxic cyanopeptides in the process of prioritizing cyanopeptides for risk assessment additional factors may be decisive for example the value of a field site harbouring particularly sensitive organisms impacts on natural resource utilization and water

19049,cyanobacterial bloom events that produce natural toxins occur in freshwaters across the globe yet the potential risk of many cyanobacterial metabolites remains mostly unknown only microcystins one class of cyanopeptides have been studied intensively and the wealth of evidence regarding exposure concentrations and toxicity led to their inclusion in risk management frameworks for water quality however cyanobacteria produce an incredible diversity of hundreds of cyanopeptides beyond the class of microcystins the question arises whether the other cyanopeptides are in fact of no human and ecological concern or whether these compounds merely received too little attention thus far current observations suggest that an assessment of their eco toxicological risk is indeed relevant first other cyanopeptides including cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins can occur just as frequently and at similar nanomolar concentrations as microcystins in surface waters second cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aeruginosins and microginins inhibit proteases in the nanomolar range in contrast to protein phosphatase inhibition by microcystins cyanopeptolins aeruginosins and aerucyclamide also show toxicity against grazers in the micromolar range comparable to microcystins the key challenge for a comprehensive risk assessment of cyanopeptides remains their large structural diversity lack of reference standards and high analytical requirements for identification and quantification one way forward would be a prevalence study to identify the priority candidates of tentatively abundant persistent and toxic cyanopeptides to make comprehensive risk assessments more manageable graphical abstract image 1 keywords harmful algal bloom cyanobacteria toxin risk assessment ecotoxicology human health 1 introduction our ecosystems and drinking water resources are not only vulnerable towards anthropogenic pollutants but also natural toxins bucheli 2014 among the natural toxins from organisms of various kingdoms those produced by aquatic organisms such as cyanobacteria blue green algae are of particular concern for water resources since these waterborne toxins are released directly into surface waters when the cells die bogialli et al 2017 flores and caixach 2015 saker et al 2005 because cyanobacteria produce a diverse mixture of potentially toxic metabolites there is a need to identify which of these metabolites are of toxicological concern cyanobacteria can grow to extremely high densities forming so called harmful algal blooms within few days or weeks such blooms generally occur at warmer temperatures higher nutrient loads adequate light penetration into the water and residence time of the water schindler 2006 whitton 2012 cyanobacterial bloom events have deleterious effects on the ecosystem and on human activities including decreased biodiversity higher oxygen consumption due to decaying biomass restriction of recreational activities limited usability of water for agriculture and the need for additional technical measures to provide safe drinking water while bloom events occur also under pristine conditions and at colder temperatures ostermaier and kurmayer 2010 trout haney et al 2016 anthropogenic pressure contributes to extended warm periods and high nutrient loads that favor growth of cyanobacteria o neil et al 2012 cyanobacterial blooms occur regularly in numerous lakes baumann and juttner 2008 gkelis et al 2015 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes et al 2012 mazur marzec et al 2013 and drinking water reservoirs ferranti et al 2013 grabowska et al 2014 jancula et al 2014 welker et al 2006 but our knowledge about the potential risks of the secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria remains limited among the bioactive metabolites cyanobacteria produce low molecular weight toxins including anatoxin saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin but also non ribosomal oligopeptides termed cyanopeptides which this review focuses on to date microcystins are the one class of cyanopeptides that is studied most intensely across scientific disciplines with more than 300 journal articles published annually on the topic fig 1 a the dominance of studies on microcystins may have been catalyzed by the early link of this compound class to human intoxications in 1996 the death of 52 dialysis patients due to liver failure was traced back to water contaminated with cyanobacteria and the presence of microcystins in a brazilian hospital carmichael et al 2001 pouria et al 1998 these tragic incidents in brazil triggered the interest in assessing toxicity of microcystins and monitoring environmental concentrations in addition intoxication of human has been reported across the globe mostly by recreational exposure through inhalation of aerosols or swallowing contaminated surface water and a comprehensive review on epidemiological research can be found elsewhere svircev et al 2017 essentially for every country on the globe at least one isi publication documents the occurrence of microcystin producing cyanobacteria meriluoto et al 2017 trout haney et al 2016 because microcystins are potent liver toxins and can occur at up to micromolar concentrations during cyanobacterial bloom events several countries include microcystins in their risk management frameworks for water quality ibelings et al 2014 despite the wealth of publications even microcystins remain an active field of research for example to better understand why cyanobacteria produce these complex molecules how production is regulated how water treatment can be improved for their effective removal and which regulatory implementations are needed to protect human and ecosystem health during bloom events ibelings et al 2014 while microcystins are of ecotoxicological concern several studies with cyanobacterial extracts observed toxic effects that could not be explained by the presence of microcystins alone suggesting that other bioactive metabolites need to be considered in risk assessment as well baumann and juttner 2008 keil et al 2002 le manach et al 2016 smutna et al 2014 teneva et al 2003 2005 recent advancements of analytical techniques enabled researcher to identify hundreds of cyanopeptides beyond the well known class of microcystins including cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aerucyclamides aeruginosines and microginins with a multitude of structural variants within each class welker and von döhren 2006 however these cyanopeptides have received little attention thus far regarding their potential human and ecological risk this article raises awareness for the diversity of biologically active and potentially toxic cyanopeptides that human and wildlife can be exposed to during cyanobacterial bloom events information regarding co occurrence of cyanopeptides potential exposure concentrations in surface waters and toxic effects is synthesized with a particular focus on quantitative data rather than phenomenological observations key challenges and research needs towards a risk assessment of cyanopeptides are discussed 2 cyanopeptides beyond microcystins the 1990s present the onset of ever increasing records of cyanopeptide studies not only for microcystins but also for nodularin aeruginosins anabaenopeptins cyanopeptolins microginins microviridins and aerucyclamides in the 2000s among others fig 1 over the past decades a legion of other cyanopeptides beyond microcystins has been identified in pure cultures and biomass collected from cyanobacterial bloom events beversdorf et al 2017 bogialli et al 2017 flores and caixach 2015 saker et al 2005 welker et al 2004 in the 1960s some early studies reported the production of aeruginosins from microcystis aeruginosa a cyanobacterial genus renowned for producing also microcystins herbert and holliman 1964 holliman 1969 murakami et al 1995 namikoshi and rinehart 1996 despite the increasing scientific output across cyanopeptide classes the publication records are heavily disproportionate as studies on cyanopeptides other than microcystins represent less than 10 of the total scientific output particularly few studies are available within the disciplines of environmental chemistry with less than 100 studies for other cyanopeptides together compared to more than 2000 studies focusing on environmental behavior of microcystins alone here the key challenge for a systematic risk assessment is the large diversity of cyanopeptides this article will first demonstrate the structural diversity of cyanopeptides before presenting the current understanding of their co occurrence exposure concentrations and quantitative information about toxicity 2 1 structural diversity peptides comprise more than 60 percent of the known biological active compounds produced by cyanobacteria chlipala et al 2011 in addition to more than 240 microcystins a minimum of 500 cyanopeptides ranging from 400 to 1900 da have been structurally identified to date and with their variety comes the complexity of the naming system meriluoto et al 2017 welker and von döhren 2006 cyanopeptides consist of cyclic and linear non ribosomal peptides that can also contain non proteinogenic residues and posttranslational modifications welker and döhren presented a classification of cyanopeptides based on conserved molecular substructures welker and von döhren 2006 each class contains a characteristic substructure with a shared biosynthesis pathway while variations of monomers define the different variants within each class for example microcystins are heptapeptides with the characteristic adda moiety 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl deca 4 6 dienoic acid and the different variants result from altering monomers in mainly two positions the variation is typically expressed by adding the one letter code of the amino acid so that microcystin lr refers to the variant with leucine l and arginine r in positions 2 and 4 respectively however the one letter code is limited to the standard amino acids and other modifications require more elaborate suffixes nodularins are hexapeptides with a similar structure to microcystins including the adda moiety structural representations of prominent classes beyond microcystins are presented in fig 2 including the cyclic classes of cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins and aeru cyclamides as well as linear peptide classes of aeruginosines and microginins each class contains a conserved substructure indicative of this class and variable building blocks other than microcystins more than two monomeric building blocks can vary in these peptides resulting in a large combinatorial set of isoforms within each cyanopeptide class for example anabaenopeptins carry characteristic ureido bond and variation in the other five building blocks is possible details in box 1 among the cyanopeptides beyond microcystins cyanopeptolins contain the most structurally known compounds approx 36 followed by microginins approx 14 aeruginosins 13 cryptophycins and anabaenopeptins approx 9 each other than these cyanopeptide classes the depsipeptidic crytophycins have mostly been isolated from nostoc sp and not from a variety of other cyanobacteria schwartz et al 1990 often several synonyms exist for the same class of cyanopeptides or individual compounds because no standardized naming systems was introduced early on for example the class of cyanopeptolins is also referred to as microcystilides micropeptins aeruginopeptins or oscillapeptins and aeruginosins are also known as microcins or spumigins in the early literature the cyanopeptide names are often chosen to refer to the taxon from which the compound had been isolated from and a suffix is added referring to structural properties including characteristic residues molecular weight or strain number further details of some additional cyanopeptides and their naming systems can be found in comprehensive reviews on this matter chlipala et al 2011 van wagoner et al 2007 welker and von döhren 2006 3 occurrence of cyanopeptides during bloom events the chemical diversity of cyanopeptides is large but how common are these compounds in surface waters dominated by cyanobacteria while the abundance of cyanobacteria can be monitored successfully following cyanobacterial peptides is more challenging because of the variety of potential target compounds few studies focused on the presence of cyanopeptides other than microcystins but those that did search further discovered that microcystins never occurred alone while the ecological benefit for cyanobacteria to produce these complex and metabolically expensive cyanopeptides has not been completely resolved not even for microcystins evidence is presented below on their abundance and bioactivity 3 1 ability of cyanopeptide production the likelihood of cyanopeptides to occur in the environment depends on the presence of cyanobacteria that carry the genes for toxin production and that these genes are actually expressed the exposure concentrations of cyanopeptides depend on the abundance of those toxin producers and the cyanopeptide production dynamics as well as the degradation and fate processes of toxins in surface waters genotype analysis can reveal gene clusters that are indicative of the metabolic synthesis pathways for cyanopeptides kurmayer et al 2011 2015 cyanopeptide biosynthesis involves multi enzyme complexes of non ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases that can be conserved across cyanobacterial genomes kurmayer et al 2011 2015 neilan et al 2013 for example the biosynthetic cluster code and highly conserved multidomain proteins required to produce microcystins have been identified in the genus of microcystis planktothrix nostoc and dolichospermum anabaena christiansen et al 2003 kosol et al 2009 kurmayer and christiansen 2009 merel et al 2013 rantala et al 2004 rouhiainen et al 2004 zikova et al 2010 within one species the genes may not always be expressed and also non producing strains exists that lack the ability to produce microcystins altogether bogialli et al 2017 briand et al 2016 davis et al 2009 kurmayer and christiansen 2009 kurmayer et al 2004 welker and von döhren 2006 at the same time one cyanobacterial species can harbor biosynthesis pathways for several cyanopeptides beyond microcystins kurmayer and christiansen 2009 neilan et al 2013 shishido et al 2017 for example the biosynthesis genes for microcystins anabaenopeptins aeruginosins microginins microviridins and cyanopeptolins were identified in the common cyanobacteria planktothrix rubescens and p agardhii as well as in microcystis sp kurmayer et al 2016 otten et al 2017 overall much less genetic information for example regarding indicative syntheses gene clusters or distribution of non producing strains is available for cyanopeptides beyond microcystins cyanobacteria often co occur during bloom events and their genotypes suggest that they are able to produce different cyanopeptides but not whether these metabolites are actually produced 3 2 production during bloom events chemical analysis verifies that cyanobacteria can indeed use their genetic ability effectively to biosynthesize cyanopeptides during bloom events a variety of cyanopeptides was frequently detected in lakes rivers estuaries and reservoirs affected by cyanobacteria across the globe including studies in italy greece poland portugal israel switzerland and finland ferranti et al 2013 gkelis et al 2015 grabowska et al 2014 lifshits and carmeli 2012 lopes et al 2012 rohrlack et al 2009 additional studies inspected field isolates which constitute cyanobacterial cultures isolated from environmental samples and regrown under laboratory conditions all 26 cyanobacterial isolates from a drinking water reservoir in portugal produced a range of aeruginosines anabaenopeptins and microcystins saker et al 2005 similar field isolates originating from a czech reservoir showed up to 90 co occurring cyanopeptides from brazilian surface waters up to 38 cyanopeptides and nearly 60 cyanopeptides from baltic sea isolates mazur marzec et al 2016 sanz et al 2015 welker et al 2006 advanced analytical techniques further revealed the diverse cyanopetidome on the cellular scale realized by analyzing single bacterial colonies and cyanobacterial filaments with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms harustiakova and welker 2017 welker et al 2004 3 3 exposure concentrations in surface waters quantification of cyanopeptides is a key prerequisite to characterize the potential exposure concentrations in surface waters where cyanobacteria proliferate most studies however only report qualitative information such as frequencies of detection of cyanopeptides as mentioned above to date only few studies quantified absolute concentrations of cyanopeptides beyond microcystins fig 3 a recent study quantified three cyanopeptolins one microginins two anabaenopeptins and five microcystins in samples from six eutrophic lakes in the united states beversdorf et al 2017 another study assessed the aqueous concentrations of five anabaenopeptins one cyanopeptolin and ten microcystins in european lakes using analytical standards isolated from biomass extracts here all cyanopeptides were detected frequently with 87 for microcystins 90 for a cyanopeptolin and 100 for anabaenopeptins chorus et al 2006 data in fig 3 show that concentrations were in the μg l range i e nanomolar and microcystins were not always dominating particularly in the european lakes the study on european lakes further showed that cyanopeptide production from one cyanobacterial species can vary between different lakes and only correlated with biovolume of cyanobacteria for some cyanopeptides chorus et al 2006 furthermore a recent study of the u s great lakes basin demonstrates that the total load of cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins entering drinking water treatment plants can be comparable to microcystins and also correlated with abundance of cyanobacteria cell count chlorophyll a and organic carbon concentrations uv absorbance turbidity beversdorf et al 2018 such quantitative assessments are rare because of the lack of standard reference materials for most cyanopeptides that would allow to convert a signal from analytical instruments into the absolute mass of a cyanopeptide present in the sample currently reference standards of 12 microcystins mc lr rr yr la lf lw wr d asp3 lr d asp3 rr htyr hilr are commercially available and partially included in standardized analytical methods iso 20179 2005 us epa method 544 which can reach sensitivities in the low nanomolar range e g by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry the limited availability of reference standards restricts comprehensive quantification of cyanopeptide concentrations considering that more than 240 microcystin isoforms and many more additional cyanopeptides have been identified meriluoto et al 2017 organic synthesis was achieved for some linear aeruginosines that also allowed to selectively test the effect of subtle changes of functional moieties i e chloride and sulfate removal scherer et al 2016 scherer and gademann 2017 however organic synthesis is currently not feasible for the structurally more complex cyanopeptides particularly considering the stereochemistry of these molecules most commercially available cyanopeptide materials stem from isolation efforts of cyanobacterial biomass called bioreagents which do not strictly qualify as reference material because of their lower purity and even certified reference materials come in varying purity and require batch to batch verification of the absolute concentration without reference standards for each compound of interest one common alternative is to report semi quantitative concentrations relative to an available standard microcystin lr 4 toxicity of cyanopeptides considering that other cyanopeptides indeed occur at similar concentrations as microcystins during cyanobacterial bloom events there is a need to evaluate their potential eco toxicological risk in the following first those studies are highlighted that assessed the sub lethal effects for these cyanopeptides then studies are presented that focused on microcystins alone but observations suggest that additional compounds might be present in the cyanobacterial extracts that contributed to toxic effects 4 1 sub lethal effects one common effect observed for cyanopeptides is the inhibition of enzymes particularly inhibition of proteases has been frequently reported for cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aeruginosins and microginins with inhibitory potencies ic50 values down to the low nanomolar range comparable to concentrations observed during bloom events fig 4 for cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins and aeruginosins inhibition of human serine proteases involved in blood coagulation was observed i e factor via viia thrombin plasmin and kallikrein bonjouklian et al 1996 gademann et al 2010 hanessian et al 2006 kodani et al 1999 kohler et al 2014 schreuder et al 2016 and inhibition of pancreatic and leucocyte elastases for cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins bubik et al 2008 sedmak et al 2008 further tests with proteases showed inhibition of carboxypeptidases a b and leucine aminopeptidase involved in food metabolism for cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins and microginins ishida et al 1997 1998 2000a itou et al 1999 kodani et al 1999 murakami et al 2000 walther et al 2009 inhibition of angiotensin converting enzymes involved in blood pressure regulation for microginins kodani et al 1999 okino et al 1993 and inhibition of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity for cyanopeptolins and aeruginosins banker and carmeli 1999 bister et al 2004 bonjouklian et al 1996 gademann et al 2010 hanessian et al 2006 kodani et al 1999 kohler et al 2014 raveh and carmeli 2009 reshef and carmeli 2001 sano and kaya 1995 von elert et al 2005 microginins were also observed to inhibit the mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase muller et al 2006 and aerucyclamides showed activity against leukemia cells and human parasites ishida et al 2000b portmann et al 2008b cyanopeptides also show antimicrobial antifungal and antimycobacterial activity as recently reviewed elsewhere swain et al 2017 another common observation is the toxicity against the grazing crustacean thamnocephalus platyurus reported for microcystins cyanopeptolins aeruginosins microginins and aerucyclamides with lc50 values in the low micromolar range mg l blom et al 2001 2003 bober and bialczyk 2017 gademann et al 2010 kohler et al 2014 portmann et al 2008a 2008b while the observed concentrations in lake water were one order of magnitude lower fig 3 much higher exposure concentration must be expected for organisms that feed directly on cyanobacterial cells by ingestion of biomass the hypothesis that cyanobacteria produce these complex molecules to defend themselves against predators is in line with observed toxicity against grazers and a promising avenue to further explore in future mechanistic studies cyanopeptides have been detected in tissue of exposed fish frogs snails and mussels but the toxicokinetics of internal distribution and bioaccumulation is not completely understood gkelis et al 2006 4 2 toxicity of microcystins and beyond microcystins are hepatotoxins that can enter liver cells by hitchhiking a specific membrane transporter i e organic anionic transporting polypeptide fischer et al 2005 once in the liver cell microcystins suppress enzyme activities by binding to protein phosphatases pp1 and pp2 which causes dysregulation formation of reactive oxygen species and eventually liver failure ding et al 2000 honkanen et al 1990 konst et al 1965 mackintosh et al 1990 the toxicity depends critically on the microcystin variant the exposure route and the target organisms for example the lethal dose to kill 50 of mice acute ld50 ranges between 5000 10 000 μg kg for oral and 50 μg kg for intraperitoneal administration kuiper goodman et al 1999 epidemiological studies indicate human health effects and potential cancer development from acute and chronic exposure to cyanopeptides as recently reviewed liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 some toxicological studies on microcystins offer clues concerning the potential toxicity of other cyanopeptides these studies did not include other cyanopeptides specifically but hint towards their toxicity when a the observed toxic effects exceeded the toxicity expected from microcystins alone or b the symptoms could not be associated with microcystins one example is the case of human exposure to cyanotoxins by recreational activities here the concurrence of illness was correlated with cyanobacterial cell number but vomiting diarrhea and flu symptoms could not directly be associated with the presence of known liver toxins microcystins or neurotoxins e g saxitoxin anatoxin berg et al 2011 pilotto et al 1997 other studies compared microcystin producing strains wild type with cyanobacterial strains that specifically cannot produce microcystins knock out mutants for example while only the microcystin producing strain had lethal effects on crustaceans daphnia geleata d magna also the non producing strain caused decreased ingestion rates increased enzyme production involved in biotransformation and altered reproductive processes suggesting that compounds other than microcystins also affect aquatic organisms dao et al 2013 hulot et al 2012 rohrlack et al 1999 additional studies frequently observed that extracts from the microcystin knock out mutants also caused adverse effects on aquatic organisms and cell lines baumann and juttner 2008 best et al 2001 dao et al 2013 fastner et al 2003 hulot et al 2012 keil et al 2002 liang et al 2017 smutna et al 2014 for example the formation of oedema and bent tails in zebrafish larvae and dysregulation in fish were observed also upon exposure to extracts of non microcystin producing cyanobacteria keil et al 2002 le manach et al 2016 information on the toxicity of some additional cyanopeptides including cryptophycins tolytoxin scytophycins and microviridins can be found elsewhere chlipala et al 2011 5 implications for risk assessment the key challenge for future risk assessment of cyanobacterial peptides is the need to cover a large chemical and biological space implications and research needs for analytical methods assessment of abundant and persistent peptides as well as toxic peptides to prioritize relevant cyanotoxins are discussed in the following fig 5 5 1 analytical methods hundreds of cyanopetides have been structurally identified and the lack of reference standard materials and comprehensive databases of all cyanopeptides are the key challenges for standardized and sensitive analytical detection high resolution tandem mass spectrometry hrms ms has become more widely available at scientific research institutions regulatory laboratories and even at larger water treatment utilities while hrms ms analysis alone is not sufficient for structurally elucidating newly identified compounds it can be directed to specifically detect and differentiate structurally known cyanopeptides so called suspect screening with hrms ms allows to identify cyanopeptides without available reference materials based on the exact mass m z presence of one or more charge states z 1 2 etc expected isotope pattern and common adducts e g h na nh4 as well as secondary fragmentation ms2 following procedures established for small organic pollutants and their transformation products krauss et al 2010 schymanski et al 2014 those cyanopeptides that are structurally known comprise the suspect list in this scenario the high resolving power and mass spectral accuracy is essential for a reliable assignment of the exact mass of a cyanopeptide other than for small organic molecules most cyanopeptides are large molecules and automated chemical formula assignment is often not reliable for identification to increase the confidence of the identification the secondary fragmentation pattern can be matched with in silico predictions and literature information because we also face isobaric compounds one needs to obtain fragmentation spectra that are unambiguously identifying a single cyanopeptide e g due to unique fragments for reliable and faster cyanopeptide identification a public spectral library should be built and maintained by collaborative efforts of the scientific community the use of extracts from pure cyanobacterial laboratory cultures may serve as qualitative reference materials for the identification of cyanopeptides in field samples for example when the dominating cyanobacterial species in a water body are known these field samples can be compared to the extract of the respective cyanobacterial species from laboratory culture this approach would allow to compare not only the spectral fragmentation but also the retention behavior during chromatographic separation retention time match with such diagnostic evidence cyanopeptides can be identified as the probable structure even without reference standards available level 2 after schymanski et al 2014 while identification of cyanopeptide is possible with conclusive hrms ms data the quantification without certified reference standards presents another critical challenge analytical chemistry widely relies on semi quantitative exposure concentrations thus far for example by microcystin lr equivalent concentrations for all cyanopeptides one avenue to explore can be a class specific semi quantitative equivalent approach that uses representative reference material of one abundant and potentially toxic cyanopeptides of each class however even among microcystin variants the analytical response can vary by a multitude due to different response factors in mass spectrometry which leads to higher uncertainties when relying on equivalent concentrations because variants of a cyanopeptide class vary only in a limited number of moieties a structure based prediction of response factors for variants within a cyanopeptide class presents an attractive opportunity in the case of electronspray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms commonly employed to analyse cyanopeptides the response factor comprises how well a structural moiety can be ionized which depends on instrumental parameters source settings mobile phase composition ph etc physico chemical properties of the analyte and matrix specific interferences for example the ionization of microcystins in esi ms depends largely on the presence of basic ionizable arginine moieties yuan et al 1999 but can also be greatly affected by polarity and vaporability of the target compounds kiontke et al 2016 in silico tools have been used in proteomic research to prioritize the best ionizable i e best observable proteolytic peptides for target proteins based on the primary sequence of linear peptides matsuda et al 2017 however such prediction becomes more complex with the stereochemistry of cyanopeptides particularly for cyclic structures wang and cole 1994 and in presence of sample matrix from biomass extracts e g ion suppression kankaanpaeae et al 2009 karlsson et al 2005 while these quantification methods may be sufficient to screen for general presence of cyanopeptide and tentative abundance reference standard materials of those cyanopeptide of toxicological concern are ultimately required 5 2 abundant and persistent peptides to make future risk assessment of cyanopeptides more manageable one approach is to assess the number of tentatively relevant compounds based on exposure concentrations by prioritizing those compounds that are produced in considerable amounts by common cyanobacteria peptide profiles can be assessed and curated for common strains in comprehensive archives and compared across geographic and temporal trends when the major cyanobacterial strains in a bloom event are identified one can explore whether the expected cyanopeptides can be predicted based on archived peptide profiles from laboratory cultures and field isolates while current literature suggests that only a smaller subset of cyanopeptides is expected at an individual site this may still comprise dozens of compounds among the abundant cyanopeptides those that are persistent could be further prioritized for risk assessment here both persistence in environmental and engineered systems is of interest environmental fate studies include biodegradability as well as mass transfer complexation abiotic hydrolysis and photochemical transformation processes microcystins are susceptible to microbial degradation and photochemical transformation but can still persist in water for several days or weeks de la cruz et al 2011 edwards et al 2008 sharma et al 2012 walker 2014 while open questions regarding the behavior of microcystins remain essentially no information currently exists on the fate of the other cyanopeptides the relatively long half life of microcystins in surface waters suggest that cyanopeptides can reach water treatment plants influents when blooms occur in freshwater reservoirs consequently the engineered processes need to be inspected for their ability to remove cyanopeptides by conventional treatment including sand and activated carbon filtration as well as advanced oxidation processes including uv h2o2 ozonation and membrane filtration all treatment options need to consider that intracellular toxins can be released by lysing the bacterial cells for example ozonation can effectively oxidize microcystins but also lyses cells and thus does not always result in sufficient total removal of the toxin hoeger et al 2005 since microcystins have been frequently detected even in finished drinking waters carmichael 2000 hoeger et al 2005 miller et al 2017 avoiding the intake of contaminated water and developing adoptive treatment strategies during bloom events needs to be considered for impacted source waters overall the fate and transformation behavior of cyanopeptides will define the exposure concentrations after release from the bacterial cells that need to be considered for risk assessment 5 3 toxic peptides in addition to chemical analysis effect based tests are needed in the process of prioritizing cyanopeptides first the most abundant and persistent compounds might not be the most toxic second not all cyanopeptides might be structurally known and would be missed by suspect screening with hrms ms as described above in addition toxicological analysis is promising to investigate mixture toxicities of co occurring cyanopeptides to identify and quantify the main toxicological effects of one cyanopeptide one can focus on a targeted approach with a specific hypothesis for the toxic mode of action or effect based analysis by screening various endpoints the hypothesis driven approach is challenged by the lack of information about potential target sites of these cyanopeptides we currently lack a clear understanding of internal distribution and concentrations of the cyanopeptides in the case of microcystins they do not only cause liver toxicity but have also been reported to induce neurological symptoms in exposed patients hu et al 2016 also the organic anion transporting polypeptides oatp which mediate the cellular uptake of microcystins are not only expressed in the liver but also at the blood brain barrier fischer et al 2005 a better understanding of the exposure routes can further guide which tissue will be in contact with cyanopeptides for example via aerosol inhalation and swallowing contaminated water the current literature demonstrates that cyanopeptides inhibit different target enzymes compared to microcystins which needs to be considered when selecting toxicity tests hence not only liver but also the brain gill lung and gut are among the plausible target organs to investigate in addition to the challenge that we are dealing with hundreds of cyanopeptides also many possible toxic modes of action need to be considered high throughput toxicity screening can be a powerful approach to sieve through thousands of potential endpoints high throughput toxicity screening uses in vitro toxicity assays and is being used extensively for testing the effects of chemicals and their mixtures in risk assessment and drug discovery szymanski et al 2012 cellular assays that measure defined toxic endpoints in automated and miniaturized systems present an opportunity to overcome the bottle neck of extremely low throughput in conventional in vivo tests however toxicity can not only be toxin specific but also cell specific and individual cellular models can not cover all possible toxic mechanisms processes that rely on cellular communication and control systems throughout the organisms astashkina et al 2012 transcriptomic analysis offers another holistic approach to predict potential adverse effects and molecular mechanisms considering the whole organism for example a reduced transcriptome atlas of the zebrafish was investigated for 74 chemicals including microcystin lr and cyanopeptolin 1020 revealing their effects on early neuronal development zhang and zhao 2018 the transcriptomics approach can help characterize and quantify unanticipated toxic effects but the relationship between gene expression and toxic mechanisms still needs to better understood and annotating the function of genes of organisms with ecological relevance is still limited schirmer et al 2010 in the future advanced data processing a mechanistic understanding and reduced costs may enable the wider use of transcriptomic screening for the risk assessment of cyanopeptides these screening approaches can also be used for crude cyanobacterial extracts without identifying each cyanopeptide therein the chemical demand of several mg for comprehensive toxicity tests are high compared to chemical analysis where even a few μg can be sufficient hence bioactive screening of complex extracts can be attractive to delineate a potential toxic sample early on when an effect is observed fractionation of extracts allows to further curtail the origin of a toxic effect but only isolation efforts of a single compound can yield clarity about toxic potencies of one specific cyanopeptide the risk assessment for cyanotoxins can learn from development in drug discovery that uses high throughput screening in combination with in silico modelling for toxicity but also for adsorption distribution metabolism and excretion van de waterbeemd and gifford 2003 in silico models rely on molecular modelling of the potential interaction of the compound with a target site e g an enzyme as well as data modelling including structure activity relationships once a target site has been identified for one cyanopeptide the molecular mechanism of toxicity and quantitative structure activity relationships can be further explored for other variants in the cyanopeptide class for example the binding affinities to carboxypeptidase has been recently modelled for a range of anabaenopeptins walther et al 2009 also the development of antibodies should be explored in the future to allow for quantification of total cyanopeptide of one class analogous to the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa existing for microcystins 6 conclusions the current state of the literature supports that cyanopeptides are bioactive and produced in legions at comparable frequency as microcystins in surface waters that are impacted by cyanobacteria consequently risk assessment of cyanopeptides beyond microcystins and their mixtures is necessary the few studies that quantified cyanopeptides beyond microcystins find that they can reach comparable concentrations and complementary studies are desired to verify these phenomena for different surface waters cyanobacterial species and bloom dynamics also additional toxicity studies are needed that target human and ecosystem health with relevant exposure scenarios the key challenge is the need to cover a large chemical and biological space for risk assessment without essential reference standards for the hundreds of known cyanopeptides to move forward from here advanced analytical methods to identify and quantify cyanopeptides need to be used to determine toxin profiles in field samples and laboratory strains to assess their fate and transformation processes and to screen for their potential bioactivity such prevalence study could reveal the priority candidates among cyanopeptides and their mixtures for which a comprehensive risk assessment will be more manageable fig 5 the combined approach of chemical and effect based screening aims for an informed decision about the tentatively abundant persistent and toxic cyanopeptides in the process of prioritizing cyanopeptides for risk assessment additional factors may be decisive for example the value of a field site harbouring particularly sensitive organisms impacts on natural resource utilization and water
