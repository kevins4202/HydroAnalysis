random response highly skewed propeller propeller shafting system turbulence inflow 1 introduction low frequency radiated noise is an important issue in ships and submarines which is mainly due to the fluctuating forces on the propeller when rotating in the non uniform and unsteady wake the fluctuating forces are formed on the propeller blades which is composed of periodic component and broadband component blake 2017 homicz and george 1974 the periodic force caused by the non uniform inflow usually occurs at frequencies proportional to the shaft speed and the number of blades massaro and graham 2015 thompson 1976 the low frequency broadband force is due to the interaction of inflow turbulence which is superposed on the ambient free stream turbulence and generated in the boundary layers on all appendages upstream of propeller abbas et al 2015 anderson et al 2014 the transmission of the unsteady force induces vibrations of the hull through the propeller shafting system and caused the sound radiation at the same time in order to give a deep insight into the vibration and acoustic characteristics of ships and submarines there are a large number of studies computing the hull s vibration and transmitted forces induced by the narrow band forces the propeller is simplified to a lumped mass and the vibration and radiated sound of the hull are estimated by an analytical method qu et al 2017 by simplifying the propeller as a disk the modal shapes of the rigid propeller shaft system are obtained and the axial mobility function of the system is found to have the characteristics of low frequency resonance peak pan et al 2002 according to the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the propeller shafting system the measures to impede the transmitted force are put forward a kind of damping ring embedded in the hub is designed to suppress the vibration transmission of the propeller shafting system huang et al 2018 in addition active devices are also proposed to reduce the oscillatory axial shaft vibrations in ship shafting systems lewis et al 1989 however the elasticity of the propeller is not considered in these investigations which is questionable as some early work indicated that the elasticity of the propeller can reduce the periodic propeller forces over a large frequency range especially above the fundamental resonance frequency brooks 1980 kinns et al 2007 because of the influence of propeller geometry on the natural frequency of the propeller shafting system the neglected propeller geometry is also a significant issue in this study warikoo and haddara 1992 in modern submarine industry the first natural frequency of propeller blade can be as low as several tens of hertz young 2008 which makes the responses of propeller shafting system induced by broadband forces in the low frequency range inevitable estimations of broadband forces usually use the assumption of isotropic turbulence inflow which indicates that humps occur at the first and second blade rate frequencies in the low frequency range jiang et al 1994 sevik 1970 in the theoretical study of the random response of a ten blade marine propeller shafting system caused by broadband forces chen et al 2017 it is found that both the bending mode and the torsional mode of the propeller blades respond to the random loads induced by the inflow turbulence however only the first bending mode of the propeller blades amplifies the transmitted force although many researches have concerned about the dynamic response of the propeller shafting system induced by the unsteady hydrodynamic force there are few studies on the relationships between the modal characteristics of propeller and the transmitted forces especially for the system with highly skewed propeller which generally has more complex modal shape for the coupling of bending and torsional deflection therefore in order to obtain the ship s vibration and acoustic response it is necessary to accurately model its dynamic response in this paper the random responses of a highly skewed propeller shafting system induced by inflow turbulence are numerically studied the motivation is to discern the amplification effect on the unsteady hydrodynamic force transmission path of highly skewed propeller in both axial and radial direction and then to provide reference for the design of propeller shafting system with low noise performance 2 theoretical approach a three step numerical simulation is performed to predict the random responses of highly skewed propeller shafting system induced by inflow turbulence which is shown in fig 1 in the first step the unsteady pressure spectrum on the blade surface is computed based on the strip theory and mapped onto all nodes that distribute on the blade surfaces in the second step the transfer response function matrix between every exciting node on the blade surface and the corresponding transmitted forces from different bearings are formed based on the fem model of the propeller shafting system in fluid in the third step the random response of the system and the power spectrum of the transmitted forces from both axial and radial bearings can be obtained by simply multiplying the transfer function vector with the force matrix furthermore the influence of highly skewed propeller configuration on the random vibration response of the system is discussed in the analysis the turbulence inflow is considered isotropic and vibration inducing effects such as wake interaction and flow separation are not modeled because of the negligible vibration level 2 1 unsteady thrust spectrum the calculation of the unsteady thrust spectrum acting on the blade is based on the strip theory and the isotropic turbulence

at n b t h strip the integrand is the cross spectral density of the up wash velocity fluctuations observed by the propeller which is denoted as φ n n ω then cross spectrum can be expressed as 7 ψ ω n b m b h s n b ω h s m b ω φ n n s n b s m b ω d s n b d s m b as shown in the lower right corner of fig 2 b this equation is discretized by dividing the each strip into m elements along the chord wise direction in order to simplify the calculation the integrand function in eq 7 is set as constant of each element along the span wise direction and chord wise direction then the density spectrum is expressed in the discretized form 8 ψ ω n m h s n ω h s m ω δ s m δ s n φ n n n m ω t o t a l or 9 ψ ω n m ψ n m n n ω t o t a l where δ s is the area of the element n and m is the serial number of the elements the term ψ n m n n ω in the summation notation is the cross power spectrum of the force between two elements the derivation of φ n n ω is made by assuming that the turbulence is isotropic with the additional assumption of the divergence free flow field and exponentially decaying normalized stream wise velocity correlation function the velocity correlation tensor takes the following form hinze 1959 10 r i j u 2 1 2 r f r r r i r j f r r 2 f r r δ i j the longitudinal correlation function f r can be approximated as an exponential function 11 f r e r λ where λ is the integral scale

rotating in a turbulent field with rotational speed ω r τ is 12 r τ d x 2 r n 2 r m 2 2 r n r m θ n 0 θ m 0 ω τ if the average inflow of elements is denoted by u n then the unsteady angle of attack

unsteady thrust matrix ψ n n is formed by calculating ψ n m n n ω with eq 8 2 2 formulations on the transfer function vector and spectrum of transmitted force fig 3 a shows the unsteady hydrodynamic force transmission process from the propeller to the foundation through a shafting system with three bearings which are back stern bearing front stern bearing and thrust bearing the thrust bearing transmits both axial thrust and radial thrust while the other two stern bearings transmit only radial thrust considering the complexity of hull geometry this paper focuses on the propeller shafting system which simplifies the hull to a rigid foundation the finite element method is used to compute the transfer function because of the complex geometry of the propeller considering the surrounding fluid the equilibrium equation of the system is 18 k s s f t s 0 k f u ω p ω i ω c s 0 0 c f u ω p ω ω 2 m s 0 s f s m f u ω p ω f ω p a ω where u ω is structure displacement and p ω is the pressure

related to the fluid s f s is the coupling item related to the fluid and structure p a ω is the acoustic excitation exerted directly on the fluid considering the unit force exerted on the n t h node of the blades surface a transfer response function is calculated in the frequency domain on the basis of linear modal analysis an alternative frequency domain formulation involves the substitution p i

frequency and vector associated with the i t h mode then the problem projects into a set of uncoupled modal response equations 21 m i u i c i u i k i u i f i n where f i n is the generalized broadband load in n direction and u i is the displacement in the generalized coordinate the modal amplitude for mode i the transfer response function is expressed as 22 h n i n ω k i j u j i n ω ϕ j i where h n

23 g i ω n h n i n l n n where g i ω is the transmitted force in i direction and l n n is the broadband force exerted on the n t h node of the lifting surface of the blades in n direction the auto spectrum of the transmitted force is written as 24 s i i ω n m h n i n h m i n l n n l m n where h m i n and l m n is the complex conjugate of h m i n and l m n eq 24 can be conveniently written as the product of the transfer vector and broadband force matrix 25 s i i ω h i n ψ n n ω h i n where the line vector of the transfer function h i n h 1 i n h 2 i n h n e i n and h i n is the conjugate transpose of h i n ψ n n ω is the broadband force matrix and the elements is calculated in eq 8 two computation solvers are used to solve the random response of the propeller shaft system the matlab is used to calculate the thrust spectrum acting on the blades according to equation 1 17 in this part the main calculation procedure is the fourier transform of velocity correlations which can be conducted with the built in function of matlab the force force transfer function from the loading points on blades to different bearings is calculated by using the commercial fem solver abaqus standard module once the transfer function matrix is obtained it can be loaded into matlab and used to calculate the random transmitted forces on the basis of linear random dynamics theory 3 results and discussions 3 1 geometry of the highly skewed propeller and the unsteady thrust spectrum in order for the validation of the method described in section 2 1 the thrust spectrum of the propeller which has been experimentally studied in 1970s is computed sevik 1970 the propeller has ten equally spaced blades with a radius of 101 6 mm the test is carried out in a 1 22m diameter water tunnel the tunnel speed u 4 56 m s and the operating advance ratio was 1 22 with ω 1140 rpm 19 hz the turbulence level is about 3 with integral length scale λ 4 cm power spectral density of the longitudinal unsteady thrust measured is compared with the theoretically predicted value as shown in fig 5 the results show that good agreement can be achieved except that measured spectral exhibits more significant humps at the first blade passing frequency which is attributed to the inconsistency between the isotropic hypothesis and the practical inflow characteristics under the assumption of isotropic inflow the result calculated by the method described in section 2 1 is convincing the geometry of the propeller analyzed in this paper is a highly skewed propeller 5471 as shown in fig 4 the propeller has six equally spaced blades with the outer diameter of 3045 mm and the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 the reason for the enlarging of the propeller is that in most practical ship engineering the fundamental natural frequency of the propeller should be within the turbulent energy intensive band within one hundred hz the propeller has six blades with naca 16 thickness and a 0 8 camber distribution the variable from left to right on the first row of the table indicate the radius pitch to diameter ratio rake to diameter ratio skew angle in degree chord to diameter ratio maximum camber to chord ratio and maximum thickness to chord ratio of each blade section young 2008 the inflow conditions of the highly skewed propeller are listed in table 2 and compared with that of the sevik s experiment sevik 1970 by defining two non dimensional parameters λ r and u λ ω the influences of the turbulence characteristics on the thrust spectrum is investigated as can be seen from fig 6 a the magnitude of the unsteady thrust spectrum increases with the advance ratio and the hump appears at the third and fourth passing frequencies as the advance ratio decreases the influences of the integral length on the unsteady thrust are shown in fig 6 b the hump at the first passing frequency becomes larger with the increase of the integral length as the integral length increases the amplitude of the force spectrum increases in low frequency band while decreases in high frequency band when the integral length is small enough there is no hump at the passing frequency fig 7 plots the spatial distribution of the pressure spectrum loading on the highly skewed propeller at several typical frequencies such as 1hz 10hz 100hz and 250hz the inflow condition is u 6 m s λ 10 cm u u 3 and the rotating speed of the propeller is ω 3 hz with the increase of frequency the spectrum amplitude decreases rapidly when the frequency is higher than 100hz the thrust spectrum at the trailing edge is almost zero since the spectrum decays with increasing frequency the response can be expected to decay rapidly the spatial distribution along the chord wise direction shows that spectrum decreases from the leading edge to the trailing edge thus the torsional modes of the propeller can be excited since the force spectrum increases from the hub to tip of the blade pronounced response can be expected at the resonance frequency of the bending mode of the propeller 3 2 modal analysis of the propeller shaft system the modal analysis of the highly skewed propeller shafting system is carried out by abaqus standard fig 8 shows the simplified model of the propeller shafting system fluid around the propeller is a sphere with a diameter of 30m as shown in fig 8 b the fluid is modeled with 1123855 ac3d4 linear tetrahedral fluid elements the meshes of the propeller are shown in fig 9 a 40320 linear wedge elements of type c3d6 are used to model the blades and 25516 linear tetrahedral elements of type c3d10 are used to model the hub a spatial two node linear beam b31 is used to model the shaft and the propeller is rigidly tied to the shaft by multipoint constraint mpc the back stern bearing and front stern bearing adopt radial spring model the thrust bearing is modeled with three springs one of which is in axial direction and the other two are in the radial direction as shown in fig 3 b all the springs are connected to the ground assuming that the foundation is much more rigid than the bearings in order to map the broadband thrust spectrum onto the blade surfaces the surfaces are meshed as shown in fig 9 b fig 9 c shows the nodes distribution on loading surfaces of the propeller which are divided into 60 elements in span wise direction and 18 elements in chord wise direction the material of the propeller is set as copper with ρ p 8300 kg m 3 e p 10 gpa the material of the shaft is set as common steel with ρ s 7800 kg m 3 e p 210 gpa the stiffness of bearings are k 1 x 1 8 e 8 n m k 1 y k 1 z 1 e 8 n m k 3 6 e 8 n m and k 2 3 e 8 n m tables 3 a 3 c shows the first twenty modal frequencies and modal shapes of the propeller shafting system in terms of the modal shape these modes can be roughly divided into three categories propeller dominant modes shaft dominant modes and propeller shaft coupled modes as for the modal shape of the propeller dominant mode the deformation of the propeller at each blade is in phase and symmetry while the deformation of shaft is small therefore there is a significant contribution of propeller dominant mode to the axially transmitted force in the modal shape of the shaft dominant modes the deformation of the shaft is obvious but the deformation of the propeller is small for the coupled modes the deformation of both propeller and shaft is obvious and the deformation of different propeller blades is asymmetry as a result the shaft dominant mode and the coupled mode contribute significantly to radially transmitted force in the following analysis the frequency of propeller dominant modes shaft dominant modes and coupled modes are denoted as f p f s and f c 3 3 random response of the highly skewed propeller shafting system on the basis of the transfer functions vector matrix and unsteady thrust spectrum the axially and radially transmitted forces to the foundation are computed the inflow condition is u 6 m s λ 10 cm u u 3 and the rotating speed of the propeller is ω 3 hz fig 10 shows the comparison between the axially transmitted force spectrum and the axial thrust spectrum acting on the propeller the transmitted force spectrum is characterized by the propeller dominant modes compared with the unsteady thrust the amplification of the transmitted force in the first and second propeller dominant mode f p 1 f p 2 is pronounced and the attenuation of the transmitted forces is occurred above f p 2 fig 11 compares the radially transmitted force spectrum from different bearings with the radial thrust spectrum acting on the propeller the contribution of the shaft dominant modes and coupled modes to the transmitted force is obvious as indicated in the figure the most pronounced peaks of the spectrum are at f c 1 and f c 2 compared with the radial force there is almost no attenuation of the radially transmitted forces from back and front stern bearings considering that the transmitted forces from the back stern bearing is the largest the following analysis of radially transmitted force is mainly based on force from the back stern bearing fig 12 compares the axially transmitted force with the radially transmitted force as shown in the figure the axially transmitted force has the most pronounced peak at f p 1 and the radially transmitted force is larger than the axially transmitted force when the frequency is above f p 1 in high frequency band the attenuation of axially transmitted force is more prominent than that of the radially transmitted force 3 4 the influences of the inflow condition on the transmitted forces the influences of inflow condition on the transmitted force are analyzed by two dimensionless parameters λ r and u λ ω the rotating speed of the propeller is kept constant as ω 3 hz the influences of advance ratio on the transmitted force are shown in fig 13 the larger the advance ratio the larger the transmitted force is fig 14 shows the influences of the integral length on the transmitted force when the integral length parameter λ r is 0 27 a small hump appears in the radially transmitted forces at 3 5hz which is due to the large unsteady thrust at low frequency as shown in fig 6 b with the increase of the integral length the transmitted force increases at 0 80hz at 80 140hz the transmitted force spectrum does not change with the increase of the integral length above 140hz the spectrum decreases with the increase of the integral length 3 5 the influences of the bearing s stiffness and propeller s material on transmitted force the influences of the propeller material and bearing stiffness on the transmitted force are analyzed respectively as shown in fig 15 and 16 fig 15 is a comparison of the force transmission characteristics when propeller materials change the three cases are analyzed with material being aluminum copper and steel respectively in general the materials have little influence on the global trend of the force transmission in the case of the steel propeller there is a 15 3 db decrease at f p 2 in the axially transmitted force spectrum compared with aluminum propeller case as shown in fig 15 a the results indicate that the axially transmitted force decreases with the increase of the propeller modulus in addition the modulus of propeller also has significant influences on the radially transmitted force as shown in fig 15 b as the modulus increases the radially transmitted force drops about 6 db at f c 1 fig 16 a is the comparison of the axially transmitted force through the axial thrust bearing with different stiffness when the stiffness of axial thrust bearing changes from 1 8e8n m to 1e9n m the amplitude of the axially transmitted forces increases approximately 15 db indicating that the reduction of axial thrust bearing s stiffness will effectively impede the axially transmitted forces fig 16 b shows the influences of the back stern bearing stiffness on the radially transmitted forces with the increase of the back stern stiffness the radially transmitted forces increase approximately 2 db at f c 1 and decrease about 6 db at f c 4 which means that the reduction of back stern bearing s stiffness is invalid to reduce the radially transmitted forces 4 conclusions in this paper the random response of highly skewed propeller shafting system induced by inflow turbulence is numerically studied the influences of the inflow turbulence condition propeller elasticity and other dynamic parameters on the force transmission characteristics from both axial and radial bearings are discussed results are summarized as follows i due to the differences of the geometric shape and mass between propeller and shaft the modes of the propeller shafting system can be divided into three categories propeller dominant modes shaft dominant modes and coupled ones ii because of high stiffness of shaft in the axial direction the amplification on the axial thrust is mainly controlled by the propeller elasticity and the axial stiffness of thrust bearing in contrast the bending modes of shaft mainly control the amplification of radially transmitted forces since the impedance of the shaft is much lower in radial direction the elasticity of the highly skewed propeller influences both axially and radially transmitted forces increasing the propeller modulus can reduce the magnification effect of the axially transmitted forces at the frequency of the first propeller dominant mode iii it is effective to reduce the stiffness of the axial thrust bearing to achieve axial unsteady thrust isolation but it is not obvious to reduce the stiffness of radial bearing to achieve vibration isolation declaration of competing interest we the

force transmission process from the propeller to the foundation through a shafting system with three bearings which are back stern bearing front stern bearing and thrust bearing the thrust bearing transmits both axial thrust and radial thrust while the other two stern bearings transmit only radial thrust considering the complexity of hull geometry this paper focuses on the propeller shafting system which simplifies the hull to a rigid foundation the finite element method is used to compute the transfer function because of the complex geometry of the propeller considering the surrounding

conducted with the built in function of matlab the force force transfer function from the loading points on blades to different bearings is calculated by using the commercial fem solver abaqus standard module once the transfer function matrix is obtained it can be loaded into matlab and used to calculate the random transmitted forces on the basis of linear random dynamics theory 3 results and discussions 3 1 geometry of the highly skewed propeller and the unsteady thrust spectrum in order for the validation of the method described in section 2 1 the thrust spectrum of the propeller which has been experimentally studied in 1970s is computed sevik 1970 the propeller has ten equally spaced blades with a radius of 101 6 mm the test is carried out in a 1 22m diameter water tunnel the tunnel speed u 4 56 m s and the operating advance ratio was 1 22 with ω 1140 rpm 19 hz the turbulence level is about 3 with integral length scale λ 4 cm power spectral density of the longitudinal unsteady thrust measured is compared with the theoretically predicted value as shown in fig 5 the results show that good agreement can be achieved except that measured spectral exhibits more significant humps at the first blade passing frequency which is attributed to the inconsistency between the isotropic hypothesis and the practical inflow characteristics under the assumption of isotropic inflow the result calculated by the method described in section 2 1 is convincing the geometry of the propeller analyzed in this paper is a highly skewed propeller 5471 as shown in fig 4 the propeller has six equally spaced blades with the outer diameter of 3045 mm and the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 the reason for the enlarging of the propeller is that in most practical ship engineering the fundamental natural frequency of the propeller should be within the turbulent energy intensive band within one hundred hz the propeller has six blades with naca 16 thickness and a 0 8 camber distribution the variable from left to right on the first row of the table indicate the radius pitch to diameter ratio rake to diameter ratio skew angle in degree chord to diameter ratio maximum camber to chord ratio and maximum thickness to chord ratio of each blade section young 2008 the inflow conditions of the highly skewed propeller are listed in table 2 and compared with that of the sevik s experiment sevik 1970 by defining two non dimensional parameters λ r and u λ ω the influences of the turbulence characteristics on the thrust spectrum is investigated as can be seen from fig 6 a the magnitude of the unsteady thrust spectrum increases with the advance ratio and the hump appears at the third and fourth passing frequencies as the advance ratio decreases the influences of the integral length on the unsteady thrust are shown in fig 6 b the hump at the first passing frequency becomes larger with the increase of the integral length as the integral length increases the amplitude of the force spectrum increases in low frequency band while decreases in high frequency band when the integral length is small enough there is no hump at the passing frequency fig 7 plots the spatial distribution of the pressure spectrum loading on the highly skewed propeller at several typical frequencies such as 1hz 10hz 100hz and 250hz the inflow condition is u 6 m s λ 10 cm u u 3 and the rotating speed of the propeller is ω 3 hz with the increase of frequency the spectrum amplitude decreases rapidly when the frequency is higher than 100hz the thrust spectrum at the trailing edge is almost zero since the spectrum decays with increasing frequency the response can be expected to decay rapidly the spatial distribution along the chord wise direction shows that spectrum decreases from the leading edge to the trailing edge thus the torsional modes of the propeller can be excited since the force spectrum increases from the hub to tip of the blade pronounced response can be expected at the resonance frequency of the bending mode of the propeller 3 2 modal analysis of the propeller shaft system the modal analysis of the highly skewed propeller shafting system is carried out by abaqus standard fig 8 shows the simplified model of the propeller shafting system fluid around the propeller is a sphere with a diameter of 30m as shown in fig 8 b the fluid is modeled with 1123855 ac3d4 linear tetrahedral fluid elements the meshes of the propeller are shown in fig 9 a 40320 linear wedge elements of type c3d6 are used to model the blades and 25516 linear tetrahedral elements of type c3d10 are used to model the hub a spatial two node linear beam b31 is used to model the shaft and the propeller is rigidly tied to the shaft by multipoint constraint mpc the back stern bearing and front stern bearing adopt radial spring model the thrust bearing is modeled with three springs one of which is in axial direction and the other two are in the radial direction as shown in fig 3 b all the springs are connected to the ground assuming that the foundation is much more rigid than the bearings in order to map the broadband thrust spectrum onto the blade surfaces the surfaces are meshed as shown in fig 9 b fig 9 c shows the nodes distribution on loading surfaces of the propeller which are divided into 60 elements in span wise direction and 18 elements in chord wise direction the material of the propeller is set as copper with ρ p 8300 kg m 3 e p 10 gpa the material of the shaft is set as common steel with ρ s 7800 kg m 3 e p 210 gpa the stiffness of bearings are k 1 x 1 8 e 8 n m k 1 y k 1 z 1 e 8 n m k 3 6 e 8 n m and k 2 3 e 8 n m tables 3 a 3 c shows the first twenty modal frequencies and modal shapes of the propeller shafting system in terms of the modal shape these modes can be roughly divided into three categories propeller dominant modes shaft dominant modes and propeller shaft coupled modes as for the modal shape of the propeller dominant mode the deformation of the propeller at each blade is in phase and symmetry while the deformation of shaft is small therefore there is a significant contribution of propeller dominant mode to the axially transmitted force in the modal shape of the shaft dominant modes the deformation of the shaft is obvious but the deformation of the propeller is small for the coupled modes the deformation of both propeller and shaft is obvious and the deformation of different propeller blades is asymmetry as a result the shaft dominant mode and the coupled mode contribute significantly to radially transmitted force in the following analysis the frequency of propeller dominant modes shaft dominant modes and coupled modes are denoted as f p f s and f c 3 3 random response of the highly skewed propeller shafting system on the basis of the transfer functions vector matrix and unsteady thrust spectrum the axially and radially transmitted forces to the foundation are computed the inflow condition is u 6 m s λ 10 cm u u 3 and the rotating speed of the propeller is ω 3 hz fig 10 shows the comparison between the axially transmitted force spectrum and the axial thrust spectrum acting on the propeller the transmitted force spectrum is characterized by the propeller dominant modes compared with the unsteady thrust the amplification of the transmitted force in the first and second propeller dominant mode f p 1 f p 2 is pronounced and the attenuation of the transmitted forces is occurred above f p 2 fig 11 compares the radially transmitted force spectrum from different bearings with the radial thrust spectrum acting on the propeller the contribution of the shaft dominant modes and coupled modes to the transmitted force is obvious as indicated in the figure the most pronounced peaks of the spectrum are at f c 1 and f c 2 compared with the radial force there is almost no attenuation of the radially transmitted forces from back and front stern bearings considering that the transmitted forces from the back stern bearing is the largest the following analysis of radially transmitted force is mainly based on force from the back stern bearing fig 12 compares the axially transmitted force with the radially transmitted force as shown in the figure the axially transmitted force has the most pronounced peak at f p 1 and the radially transmitted force is larger than the axially transmitted force when the frequency is above f p 1 in high frequency band the attenuation of axially transmitted force is more prominent than that of the radially transmitted force 3 4 the influences of the inflow condition on the transmitted forces the influences of inflow condition on the transmitted force are analyzed by two dimensionless parameters λ r and u λ ω the rotating speed of the propeller is kept constant as ω 3 hz the influences of advance ratio on the transmitted force are shown in fig 13 the larger the advance ratio the larger the transmitted force is fig 14 shows the influences of the integral length on the transmitted force when the integral length parameter λ r is 0 27 a small hump appears in the radially transmitted forces at 3 5hz which is due to the large unsteady thrust at low frequency as shown in fig 6 b with the increase of the integral length the transmitted force increases at 0 80hz at 80 140hz the transmitted force spectrum does not change with the increase of the integral length above 140hz the spectrum decreases with the increase of the integral length 3 5 the influences of the bearing s stiffness and propeller s material on transmitted force the influences of the propeller material and bearing stiffness on the transmitted force are analyzed respectively as shown in fig 15 and 16 fig 15 is a comparison of the force transmission characteristics when propeller materials change the three cases are analyzed with material being aluminum copper and steel respectively in general the materials have little influence on the global trend of the force transmission in the case of the steel propeller there is a 15 3 db decrease at f p 2 in the axially transmitted force spectrum compared with aluminum propeller case as shown in fig 15 a the results indicate that the axially transmitted force decreases with the increase of the propeller modulus in addition the modulus of propeller also has significant influences on the radially transmitted force as shown in fig 15 b as the modulus increases the radially transmitted force drops about 6 db at f c 1 fig 16 a is the comparison of the axially transmitted force through the axial thrust bearing with different stiffness when the stiffness of axial thrust bearing changes from 1 8e8n m to 1e9n m the amplitude of the axially transmitted forces increases approximately 15 db indicating that the reduction of axial thrust bearing s stiffness will effectively impede the axially transmitted forces fig 16 b shows the influences of the back stern bearing stiffness on the radially transmitted forces with the increase of the back stern stiffness the radially transmitted forces increase approximately 2 db at f c 1 and decrease about 6 db at f c 4 which means that the reduction of back stern bearing s stiffness is invalid to reduce the radially transmitted forces 4 conclusions in this paper the random response of highly skewed propeller shafting system induced by inflow turbulence is numerically studied the influences of the inflow turbulence condition propeller elasticity and other dynamic parameters on the force transmission characteristics from both axial and radial bearings are discussed results are summarized as follows i due to the differences of the geometric shape and mass between propeller and shaft the modes of the propeller shafting system can be divided into three categories propeller dominant modes shaft dominant modes and coupled ones ii because of high stiffness of shaft in the axial direction the amplification on the axial thrust is mainly controlled by the propeller elasticity and the axial stiffness of thrust bearing in contrast the bending modes of shaft mainly control the amplification of radially transmitted forces since the impedance of the shaft is much lower in radial direction the elasticity of the highly skewed propeller influences both axially and radially transmitted forces increasing the propeller modulus can reduce the magnification effect of the axially transmitted forces at the frequency of the first propeller dominant mode iii it is effective to reduce the stiffness of the axial thrust bearing to achieve axial unsteady thrust isolation but it is not obvious to reduce the stiffness of radial bearing to achieve vibration isolation declaration of competing interest we the

22291,initial imperfections out of straightness constitute one of the key parameters impacting lateral buckling of pipelines as they influence both pre buckling assessment and pipeline integrity assessment during the post buckling stage when adjacent imperfections exist in a submarine pipeline the influence regularity of initial imperfections on the global buckling of pipelines will become more complicated an elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method is proposed to investigate the global lateral buckling of pipelines with single and double imperfections then an investigation is conducted on the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the global buckling characteristics such as the critical temperature rise the buckling deformation amplitude and the buckling mode based on the limit state criteria of global buckling pipelines in dnvgl rp f110 the structural integrity of pipeline with different buckling modes is assessment the results show that pipeline failure has a certain correlation with its buckling mode type for pipelines with the same buckling mode type the pipeline failure parameter is approximately linearly associated with the double imperfection spacing keywords submarine pipeline initial imperfection global lateral buckling failure assessment numerical method 1 introduction submarine pipelines utilized for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas resources in the deep sea where trenching and burial are less feasible are primarily non trenched and they are increasingly being required to operate under high temperatures and high pressure with greater depth these factors will increase the probability that a pipeline will experience global lateral buckling which constitutes an important trigger of pipeline failure accordingly this challenge has led to considerable research on the global buckling of submarine pipelines for example the safebuck jip joint industry project 2005 performed by boreas consultants twi cambridge university and otm consulting summarized the mechanisms of pipeline buckling and concluded that the formation of buckling is governed by three parameters compressive force in the pipeline out of straightness oos and pipe soil interaction among these parameters oos is the triggering of pipeline global buckling and it plays an important role during global buckling the general behavior of global buckling triggered by imperfections can be described as follows as illustrated in dnvgl rp f110 2017 an imperfect pipeline laid on the seabed will tend to develop effective compression in the operation period of high temperature and axial compressive force will develop along the pipeline when the axial force reaches the lowest global buckling capacity the global buckling capacity has its lowest point at one imperfection the pipeline will buckle if the pressure or temperature is further increased the post buckling will happen or a second buckle may initiate when a neighboring imperfection is located therefore the influences of initial imperfections on the global buckling of submarine pipelines can be divided into the influence on pre buckling and the influence on post buckling the influence on pre buckling is mainly related to the critical buckling force equivalent to the lowest global buckling capacity mentioned above in contrast the influence on post buckling is related to the following two aspects the first is an intuitive effect on the deformation amplitude and buckling mode whereas the second is the influence of buckling deformation on the bending moment stress and strain which represent the key factors governing the buckling failure of submarine pipelines studies on the influences of initial imperfections on pipeline global buckling by analytical solutions were firstly conducted by taylor et al 1986 1996 they proposed an analytical solution for the global buckling of pipelines with single arch and double arch geometric initial imperfections based on hobbs 1984 research taylor analytical solution provides formulas for calculating the critical axial force and the buckling amplitude of a pipeline with first or second order modes of buckling fig 1 with the energy method hong et al 2015a proposed an analytical solution containing formulas for calculating the critical axial forces and buckling amplitudes of imperfect pipelines exhibiting buckling of higher order modes modes 3 and 4 in fig 1 however the abovementioned formulas did not consider the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m which zeng 2014 claimed is an essential imperfection parameter of the critical buckling force therefore zeng 2014 derived a formula for the critical axial force incorporating the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m with the theory of dimensional analysis based on this formulation xu and lin 2017 further proposed a formula for the critical axial force that considers the imperfection size and shape in addition to the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m due to their assumptions of linear elasticity and small deformation analytical solutions have inherent limitations in research on post buckling in pipelines as an effective alternative numerical methods have been widely used to study the global buckling of imperfect pipelines by many researchers such as pedersen and jensen 1987 liu 2011 and karampour et al 2013 compared with the analytical solution method the finite element method can study the influence of initial imperfections on both pre buckling and post buckling of pipelines sriskandarajah et al 1999 the effect of initial imperfections on pre buckling is mainly related to the critical buckling force previous studies shown that the critical axial force of buckling decreases with the increase of the initial imperfection amplitude and is related to the imperfection shape when it comes to the case of a small imperfection amplitude the phenomenon of snap through will appear torselleti et al 1999 the influence on post buckling is related to the deformation amplitude buckling mode bending moment stress strain and the integrity of pipelines with the study on the buckling process of pipelines with initial imperfection villarraga et al 2004 found that the imperfections have a considerable influence on the stress distribution of pipelines which in some cases lead to the stress levels above the allowable limit established by the design suzuki et al 2006 emphasized that the strain of buckling pipeline is easily affected by geometric imperfection rathbone et al 2008 proposed an alternative methodology to define and assess imperfection of pipelines hong 2015b analyzed the influence of imperfections on the global buckling failure of deep water ht hp pipelines moreover research on the effects of initial imperfections on post buckling within pipelines contributes significantly to the development of global buckling mitigation measures such as the use of a snake lay geometry guan et al 2007 luo et al 2013 vertical upset wang et al 2008 wang et al 2018a and distributed buoyancy wang et al 2018b li et al 2016 the discussion presented above indicates that considerable research has been performed on the influences of initial imperfections on the global buckling of pipelines through analytical solutions and numerical methods and most of this research has been focused on isolated initial imperfections however in engineering terms adjacent imperfections can easily occur during the production installation and operation of pipelines many additional questions including whether every imperfection can trigger buckling how these buckling interact and how adjacent imperfections affect the buckling critical axial force buckling deformation mode and integrity of pipelines arise when a pipeline contains adjacent imperfections answers to these questions are of great importance for the prediction and prevention of global buckling within pipelines therefore based on the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method the global lateral buckling of pipelines with single and double imperfections is investigated in this study accordingly the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the pipeline global buckling are illustrated the results of which can be adopted for future pipeline design 2 elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method for simulating the global buckling of pipelines 2 1 3d explicit method liu et al 2014 proposed a 3d explicit method based on abaqus and this method proved to be applicable for the simulation of global buckling in a pipeline before it experiences plastic deformation this method can be briefly described as follows pipe31 beam elements and c3d8r solid elements are used to model the pipeline and foundation soil in the 3d fea model the material of the pipeline is assumed to be linearly elastic and the material properties of the pipeline include the pipe density elastic modulus poisson ratio and coefficient of thermal expansion the mohr coulomb model is used to model the seabed the material properties of the soil include the density elastic modulus poisson ratio cohesion and internal friction angle for the boundary conditions both ends of the pipe are free the soil boundary conditions around the seabed are resistant both laterally and axially and the bottom boundary of the soil is completely fixed the interaction between the pipeline and seabed is simulated by a hard contact in the vertical direction whereas the lateral interaction is simulated by the penalty function implying that the lateral resistance is governed by both the friction coefficient and the submerged weight of the pipeline there are two steps in this simulation the first step is to apply the gravity field to ensure a hard contact between the pipeline and the soil the second step is to increase the temperature of the pipeline to simulate a high temperature load until the pipeline exhibits global buckling 2 2 elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method 2 2 1 material modelling of the pipeline as with most existing analytical models used to simulate the occurrence of global buckling in a pipeline the 3d explicit numerical methods described above is based purely on elastic stress limits therefore this method cannot simulate plastic deformation during post buckling which is likely to occur in an engineering application to address this problem the engineering stress strain responses of a pipeline at 0 c and 100 c shown in fig 2 zhang 2014 are introduced into the 3d explicit method in this study and the improved method is named the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method the stress strain relationship adopted in the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method takes temperature into account for its importance in affecting the pipeline global buckling for a pipeline in the bohai sea the design temperature is 80 c above the ambient temperature which is 0 c and the internal pressure of the pipeline is 4 65 mpa to simplify the calculation the internal pressure is converted by equation 1 given by hobbs 1984 into an equivalent temperature equal to 5 c thus the total temperature is 85 c above the ambient temperature the plastic properties of a pipeline material are defined by digitally specifying the complete plastic stress strain curve of the steel from the material definition contained in the input document during the buckling calculation the stress strain parameters of the pipeline at a certain temperature are determined by linear interpolation of the two curves illustrated in fig 2 1 δ t p d 0 5 v 2 e α t 2 2 2 introduction of initial imperfections into the fea model the method utilized to introduce a single imperfection into the 3d explicit method is described as follows first an initial imperfection is calculated by the buckle step in abaqus that is often used to study the probability of different buckling shapes under a unit load then the parameters of the initial imperfection are output as an inp file through the statement nodefile finally with the statement imperfection file job name step 1 the shape of the imperfection is smoothly introduced into the pipeline model based on the introduction of a single imperfection the method employed to introduce double imperfections into the fea model can be described as three steps first the form of a single initial imperfection is calculated by the buckle step in abaqus and output the parameters of the single initial imperfection second the parameters magnitude and direction of target imperfection can be determined by multiplying the single initial imperfection by a coefficient then parameters of two target imperfections along with the spacing of double imperfections are imported into a computer aided drafting cad software package to outline double imperfections finally the double imperfections are introduced into the pipeline model by the import sketch step in abaqus which is prepared for drawing the outline of double imperfections of pipeline model in the step of create part it should be noted that the initial stress of pipeline is not considered in this study since the double imperfections are created before the application of the load 2 3 model parameters the importance of the calculated length of pipelines in global buckling analysis has been confirmed by previous research christensen 2005 maoût et al 2011 for example liu and li 2018 studied the buckling behaviour of imperfect pipelines with different lengths and suggested that the buckling amplitudes for pipelines with the same imperfections increase with the calculated length of pipelines therefore the calculated pipeline length should be kept constant in research on the influences of initial imperfections on the global buckling in this study the calculated length of the pipelines is fixed at 4000 m the other parameters of the pipelines and soil are provided in table 1 2 4 validation of the model for the pipeline with parameters mentioned above the global buckling of pipeline is calculated by the 3d explicit method and the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method respectively the buckling amplitudes of pipeline at the design temperature of 85 c are illustrated in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the buckling modes of pipeline simulated by the two methods are identical and the buckling amplitudes are similar given that the 3d explicit method has been validated as an effective method for pipeline buckling simulation liu et al 2014 the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method can be considered as an alternative method for global buckling analysis of pipelines stress of buckling pipeline obtained by the two numerical simulation methods is shown as fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the stress of the pipeline calculated by the two models differs greatly in the buckling region and it can be seen from fig 4 b that the maximum stress of the two models is consistent with the increase of temperature before point a and the difference in stress arises as the temperature continues to increase after point a the stress of the elastic model keeps growing until it reaches about 500 mpa at the design temperature 85 c which is greater than the yield stress of the pipeline material shown in fig 2 this indicates that the 3d explicit method based purely on elastic stress limits cannot reflect the yield and plastic deformation of the pipeline subjected to high temperature however yield and plastic deformation during post buckling is likely to occur in an engineering application therefore it is necessary to consider the elastic plastic stress strain responses of pipeline in the simulation of pipeline buckling 3 global lateral buckling of a pipeline with a single imperfection dnvgl rp f110 2017 defines the initial imperfection of a submarine pipeline as a curvature that may be caused by an uneven seabed or purposely made during installation as shown in fig 5 the wavelength l 0m and amplitude v 0m are two key parameters of initial imperfections taylor et al 1986 1993 performed a series of studies on the global buckling of imperfect pipelines with different values of v 0m and l 0m they noted that the ratio of the amplitude to the wavelength v 0m l 0m constitutes a key parameter that affects the pipeline global buckling in addition xu and lin 2017 claimed that global buckling varies significantly with the size of the initial imperfection even for imperfections with the same imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m in this study the influences of the initial imperfection amplitude and wavelength on the global buckling are analysed then these two effects are compared to analyse the influence of the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m on the global buckling of a pipeline 3 1 influence of the imperfection amplitude v 0m on global lateral buckling for the pipeline with a single imperfection shown in fig 5 the initial imperfection wavelength l 0m is fixed at 40 m and the initial imperfection amplitude v 0m is changed from 0 05 m to 1 m to analyse the influence of the amplitude magnitude on the critical axial force and deformation amplitude of global buckling because the internal pressure has been converted into an equivalent temperature the critical temperature difference is equivalent to the critical axial force of the global buckling phenomenon the relationship between the temperature rise δt and the lateral displacement of the pipeline midpoint is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that buckling is absent in the case with a relatively small imperfection amplitude v0m 0 05 m for the pipeline with an imperfection amplitude of v0m 0 1 m the onset of buckling requires a maximum critical temperature rise point a together with the associated snap through buckling phenomenon i e a large buckling deflection occurs within a small temperature rise once the critical temperature is reached the remaining four cases generate a natural development of global lateral buckling and the critical temperature decreases with the increase in the imperfection amplitude the general characteristics of the buckling amplitudes of all six pipelines at the design temperature of 85 c are illustrated in fig 7 as illustrated in fig 7 all imperfection amplitude cases except v 0m 0 05 m generate a buckle with the third mode of hobbs 1984 fig 1 in addition the variation trend of the buckling deformation amplitude is consistent with that of the initial imperfection amplitude 3 2 influence of the imperfection wavelength l 0m on global lateral buckling to study the influence of the imperfection wavelength l 0m on the global buckling of a pipeline the imperfection amplitude v 0m in fig 5 is fixed at 0 5 m and the imperfection wavelength l 0m is varied from 20 m to 400 m the magnitude of each l 0m is determined by the constraint insomuch that the ratio v 0m l 0m is equal to the value of v 0m l 0m in fig 4 the relationship between the temperature rise δt and the lateral displacement of the pipeline midpoint is depicted in fig 8 the curves in fig 8 show that the two cases with long wavelengths l 0m 400 m 200 m do not exhibit buckling the pipeline with an imperfection wavelength of l 0m 100 m has the maximum critical temperature coincident with the snap through buckling phenomenon in contrast the other three cases generate stable post buckling paths and the critical temperature increases with the imperfection wavelength it should be noted that although the pipeline with v 0m 0 1 m l 0m 40 m in fig 6 and the pipeline with l 0m 200 m v 0m 0 5 m in fig 8 have the same imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m 0 025 their buckling responses do not coincide with each other the lateral displacements along the pipelines with different values of l 0m at 85 c are illustrated in fig 9 where the origin of the x axis is the midpoint of the initial imperfection as shown in fig 9 the remaining four wavelength amplitude cases i e excluding l 0m 400 m 200 m generate third mode buckling according to hobbs 1984 fig 1 furthermore the deformation amplitude does not exhibit an evident change with a variation in the imperfection wavelength 3 3 comparison between the influences of v 0m and l 0m the curves illustrated in figs 6 and 8 involve the relationship between the critical temperature rise δt and the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m for each pipeline exhibiting global buckling these relationships are further depicted in fig 10 by connecting them into smooth curves with legends of l 0m 40 m obtained from fig 6 and v 0m 0 5 m obtained from fig 8 the similarity between the trends of these two curves indicates that the critical temperature rise δt regularly decreases as v 0m l 0m increases for both single imperfection cases with a fixed amplitude and a fixed wavelength however the misalignment of these two curves verifies the conclusion of xu and lin 2017 even with the same imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m the critical temperature varies with the magnitudes of the initial imperfection amplitude and wavelength this variability can be described as follows for a certain v 0m l 0m the larger the imperfection magnitude the higher the critical buckling temperature is one possible explanation is that the soil resistance required to be overcome during buckling is greater for pipelines with larger imperfection the relationship between the buckling amplitude and v 0m l 0m shown in fig 11 is obtained by extracting the corresponding values of the pipelines with l 0m 40 m in fig 7 and with v 0m 0 5 m in fig 9 for pipelines with v 0m l 0m 0 025 a buckling amplitude exceeding 3 m is observed for the relatively large imperfection case i e pipeline v2 v 0m 0 1 m l 0m 40 m while no buckling is observed for the smaller deformation amplitude i e pipeline l2 v 0m 0 5 m l 0m 200 m the reason is that the soil resistance required to be overcome during buckling is greater for pipelines with larger imperfection for buckling pipelines with the same v 0m l 0 the larger the imperfection size the larger the buckling amplitude is the general characteristics of the critical temperature and buckling amplitude given in figs 8 and 9 are affected by both the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m and the size of the imperfection the influences of the imperfection ratio and size can be demonstrated better by pipelines with a fixed imperfection wavelength l 0m than by pipelines with a fixed imperfection amplitude v 0m therefore this finding will be applied to further research on the influences of double imperfections on the global lateral buckling of pipelines 4 global lateral buckling of a pipeline with double imperfections for the pipeline with double imperfections shown in fig 12 the imperfection configuration is governed by three parameters the spacing between the two imperfections the relative directions of the two imperfections and the form i e imperfection ratio and size of each imperfection the effect of each parameter on the global buckling of the pipeline will be studied by keeping the other two fixed 4 1 influence of the double imperfection spacing on global lateral buckling to study the influence of the double imperfection spacing l s i e the distance between the ends of the 1st and 2nd imperfections on global lateral buckling the forms of both imperfections are fixed at l 0m 40 m and v 0m1 v 0m2 0 5 m in addition the relative directions of these two imperfections are set to be consistent and the spacing l s is varied from 0l 0m to 10l 0m as shown in table 2 the global buckling deformation of pipelines s1 s7 at the design temperature is plotted in fig 13 in which the lateral coordinates of pipelines are enlarged proportionally by 50 times to properly illustrate the lateral deformation the buckling modes shown in fig 13 are different from the modes presented in hobbs 1984 fig 1 and the relatively large spacing cases pipelines s5 s7 display buckling modes that are not included among the modes of hobbs 1984 the buckling modes of s1 s7 can be divided into three types as the spacing decreases from 10l 0m to 0l 0m the pipelines s5 s6 and s7 present the same buckling mode characterized as the primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other and their secondary buckles do not merge with each other the deformation forms of pipeline s4 s3 and s2 can be classified into one mode type which is characterized by the independence of the primary buckling at the 1st and 2nd imperfections together with the merging of their secondary buckling pipeline s1 in fig 9 shows the last buckling mode in which there is only one primary buckling located at the middle of the 1st and 2nd imperfection to study the formation mechanisms of these three types of buckling modes the buckling deformation characteristics during a rise in the temperature for pipelines s1 s4 and s6 which are representative of each type of buckling mode are presented in fig 12 through 14 the formation of the buckling mode along pipeline s1 is clearly shown in fig 14 as the temperature rises from 0 c to 51 c primary buckling is activated at the 1st imperfection and 2nd imperfection along with the superposition of secondary buckling between the primary buckles when the temperature reaches 59 5 c the two primary buckles in conjunction with the secondary buckles between them merge into one buckle resulting in an abrupt increase in the buckling deformation amplitude and wavelength as the temperature increases from 59 5 c to the design temperature the buckling deformation of the pipeline coincides with that of the single imperfection pipeline v5 shown in fig 7 fig 15 displays the buckling process of pipeline s4 the primary buckles triggered by the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other throughout the temperature rise the secondary buckles between the primary buckles merge as the temperature rises to 42 5 c the amplitude of the merged secondary buckle a significantly increases compared with those of the individual secondary buckles b and c and the amplitude of a is approximately thrice the amplitude of b the instances of primary buckling observed at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other for pipeline s6 as shown in fig 16 the secondary buckles between them do not merge but their buckling amplitudes a are less than 50 of the amplitudes of the other two secondary buckles b and c further to clarify this phenomenon the regularity of the axial displacement along pipeline s6 is considered in fig 17 a negative value of the axial displacement indicates movement toward the left as denoted by arrows the axial displacement direction of the pipeline around the midpoint deviates from the midpoint implying that the pipeline between the 1st imperfection and the 2nd imperfection is evenly divided into two segments during buckling and that each segment acts as the feed in of adjacent buckling the amount of feed in is less than the amount of feed in from the left of the 1st imperfection or from the right of the 2nd imperfection this is why the buckling amplitude at point a is smaller than that at point b and c obviously the effect of weakening the amplitude of the secondary buckling will decrease with an increase in the spacing and will eventually disappear thus double imperfections will eventually become equivalent to two single imperfections a comparison of figs 13 and 14 demonstrates that the amplitude of the secondary buckling between the two primary buckles can be either strengthened or weakened the weakening effect is due to a relatively small amount of feed in whereas the strengthening effect is due to the merging of secondary buckling between the two imperfections thereby transforming the feed in segment into a segment of buckling deformation prior to further considering fig 13 and the ensuing implications it is pertinent to summarize the three possible configurations which are dependent on the magnitude of the imperfection spacing the first buckling mode is characterized by the merging of primary buckling s1 the second buckling mode is characterized by the merging of secondary buckling s2 s4 and the third buckling mode is characterized by the weakening of the secondary buckles s5 s7 it should be noted that in addition to the spacing all three of the modes obtained in fig 13 rely on various other parameters such as the ratio of the outside diameter to the wall thickness of the pipeline d t internal and external pressure lateral and axial friction operating temperature and installation depth therefore not all pipelines with double imperfections exhibiting the same relative direction will include all three buckling modes as the spacing changes for example for a series of pipelines with a design temperature of 25 5 c in which the other parameters are consistent with those of the pipelines shown in fig 13 the buckling of the pipeline with a spacing equal to 0l 0m shown as the displacement curve of 25 5 c in fig 10 the buckling of the pipeline with a spacing of 2l 0m fig 11 and the pipeline with a spacing of 6l 0m fig 12 all belong to the third type of buckling mode as the buckling mode of a pipeline with a certain spacing will vary with the abovementioned parameters the type of buckling mode for a double imperfection pipeline cannot be separately determined by the imperfection spacing however for pipelines with fixed parameters and operating conditions the influence of spacing on the buckling mode of pipelines shows good regularity it can be described as the spacing l s required for the third buckling mode will be greater than the spacing l s required for the second buckling mode which will be greater than the spacing l s required for the first buckling mode furthermore the smaller the spacing is the more intense the merging of buckling will be and the buckling amplitude increase will also be greater when the spacing increases insomuch that the secondary buckles no longer merge the amplitude of the secondary buckles between double imperfections will change from exhibiting a strengthening effect to exhibiting a weakening effect and this effect will decrease with an increase in the spacing before eventually disappearing thus double imperfections are eventually equivalent to two single imperfections accordingly distinguishing between double imperfections and two single imperfections is important for the study of adjacent imperfections 4 2 influence of double imperfection directions on global lateral buckling the relative directions of double imperfections can be similar or opposite to each other an example of double imperfections with opposite directions is shown in fig 18 the form of each imperfection is fixed at l 0m 40 m and v 0m1 v 0m2 0 5 m while the spacing l s is varied from 0l 0m to 10l 0m to analyse the global lateral buckling of a pipeline with counter direction double imperfections as shown in table 3 the global buckling deformation of pipelines r1 r7 at the design temperature is plotted in fig 19 in which the lateral coordinates of the pipelines are enlarged proportionally by 50 times to properly illustrate the lateral deformation the buckling modes shown in fig 19 vary with the spacing between the counter direction double imperfections the pipelines r1 r2 and r3 present the same buckling mode as the primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are adjacent to each other at the midpoint of the spacing the adjacency of primary buckles indicates that the secondary buckles between the two imperfections are respectively incorporated into the associated primary buckle in contrast the deformation forms of pipelines r6 and r7 are characterized as primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other and their secondary buckling amplitudes are weakened the global buckling forms of pipelines r4 and r5 are the transitions of the above two forms characterized as the secondary buckles between the two imperfections are adjacent to each other at the midpoint of the spacing therefore the buckling modes vary with the spacing between the counter direction double imperfections and are split into the following three categories the first buckling mode is characterized by the adjacency of primary buckles r1 r3 the second buckling mode is characterized by the adjacency of secondary buckles r4 r5 and the third buckling mode is characterized by the weakening of secondary buckling r5 r7 in conjunction with figs 13 and 19 suggests that with a relatively small spacing the buckling modes for counter direction double imperfection pipelines is more stable than that for co direction double imperfection pipelines as there is no merging of primary or secondary buckling triggered by the 1st and 2nd imperfections for example in the case with a spacing of 0l 0m the primary buckles along pipeline r1 are independent of each other and the secondary buckles between them are incorporated into the associated primary buckles these characteristics are different from those of pipeline s1 which is characterized by the merging of two primary buckles together with the secondary buckles between them however for a relatively large spacing the relative directions of the double imperfections have little effect on the global buckling mode taking a spacing of 7l 0m as an example for both pipelines s7 and r7 the primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other and their secondary buckling amplitudes are weakened in conclusion the buckling mode is susceptible to the relative directions of double imperfections at relatively small spacings and the effect will decrease until it disappears with an increase in the spacing 4 3 influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections on global lateral buckling to study the influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections on global lateral buckling the two imperfection directions are set to be consistent with those in fig 12 the spacing l s is fixed at 5l 0m the imperfection wavelength l 0m is fixed at 40 m and the amplitude of the 1st imperfection v 0m1 is fixed at 0 5 m while the amplitude of the 2nd imperfection v 0m2 is varied from 0 1 m to 2 m as shown in table 4 the global buckling deformation of pipeline series s6 at the design temperature is plotted in fig 20 because the amplitude of the 1st imperfection in fig 20 is constant at 0 5 m the decrease in the buckling amplitude triggered by the 1st imperfection suggests that the buckling amplitude of one imperfection will be significantly affected by the other imperfection the buckling amplitude triggered by the 1st imperfection gradually decreases as the 2nd imperfection amplitude v 0m2 increases from 0 05 m to 1 0 m this implies that a smaller ratio of one imperfection to the other will coincide with a smaller buckling deformation amplitude of one imperfection when the ratio is as small as the ratio required for the onset of buckling the smaller imperfection will fail to initiate buckling as is observed for the 2nd imperfection of pipeline s6b however buckling occurred in pipeline v5 in fig 7 whose imperfection size is equal to the 2nd imperfection size of pipeline s6b with an amplitude of approximately 3 m for the case of pipeline s6c the 2nd imperfection activated buckling with an amplitude much smaller than the buckling amplitude of pipeline v4 in fig 7 although these two imperfections are equal in size this suggests that the buckling deformation of the smaller imperfection in a double imperfection pipeline will be weakened relative to an equally sized single imperfection in a single imperfection pipeline in conclusion the larger imperfection among a pair of double imperfections plays an important role in the buckling deformation of the smaller imperfection as it may inhibit the activation of buckling by the smaller imperfection or weaken the buckling deformation activated by the smaller imperfection to study the critical buckling temperature of each imperfection in double imperfection pipelines the relationship between the rise in the temperature δt and the lateral displacement of the midpoint between the 1st imperfection and 2nd imperfection is depicted in fig 21 the critical buckling temperatures of the 1st and 2nd imperfections in fig 21 with the exception of the imperfections with amplitudes of v 0m2 0 05 m and 0 1 m that failed to initiate buckling are equal to the critical buckling temperatures of pipelines with the equally sized single imperfection shown in fig 6 this indicates that the critical temperature of one imperfection in a pair of double imperfections is determined by itself regardless of the other imperfection from this it is easy to know that the critical buckling temperatures of pipelines s1 s7 and r1 r7 at each imperfection are equal to that of pipelines with the equally sized single imperfection therefore in order to keep the analysis content of the article from repeating the influence of critical temperature is not analysed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 however for an imperfection with an amplitude of v 0m2 0 1 m buckling is triggered at a temperature of 21 25 c for pipeline v5 in fig 7 but buckling is not triggered in the 2nd imperfection along pipeline s6b this phenomenon can be explained by formula 2 in dnvgl rp f110 2017 2 s r 1 δ s s g 2 where s r 1 is the post buckle effective axial force in the first buckle δs is the axial force build up between adjacent buckles and s g 2 is the axial global buckling capacity force for the second buckle formula 2 is illustrated in fig 22 where the 1st buckle is initiated by the larger imperfection in a pair of double imperfections based on this principle whether the axial force build up is sufficient to initiate the 2nd buckle is determined by the double imperfection spacing and the difference between s g 2 and s g 1 the smaller imperfection is less likely to buckle with a decrease in the double imperfection spacing or an increase in the difference between s g 2 and s g 1 this is why the 2nd imperfection along pipeline s6b in fig 20 does not buckle the growth rate of buckling deformation at the smaller imperfection during a rise in the temperature shown in fig 21 is smaller than that of the equally size single imperfection shown in fig 6 this feature again demonstrates that the buckling deformation activated by a smaller imperfection will be relatively weakened this weakening principle can be explained by the axial force distribution of pipeline s6c shown in fig 23 as demonstrated in dnvgl rp f110 2017 the global buckling response manifests as an expansion into an area to relieve the resulting high axial stress in the pipe wall and the buckling deformation of the pipeline is proportional to the amount of released axial force taking the axial force curve at 8 5 c as an example the 1st and 2nd imperfections both start to buckle and the effective axial force at the apex decreases as shown by the shaded area the buckling deformation of both the 1st imperfection and the 2nd imperfection is proportional to the shaded area with an increasing temperature the magnitude of the released axial force will increase leading to a longer feed in length to the largest buckles at the 1st imperfection extending to the 2nd imperfection beyond this point the growth rate of the 1st shaded area is much larger than that of the 2nd shaded area this is illustrated by the axial force curves at 12 75 c and 17 c implying that the feed in length of the pipeline on the right side of the 2nd imperfection will mostly contribute to the buckling of the 1st imperfection as the temperature is further increased the growth rate of the 2nd shaded area drops to zero thus the expansion into the 2nd imperfection is stopped and the buckling deformation no longer grows with an increase in the temperature in summary for double imperfection pipelines the larger imperfection may inhibit the activation of buckling by the smaller imperfection or weaken the buckling deformation activated by the smaller imperfection both of these effects can stop the snap through buckling phenomenon of relatively small imperfections shown in fig 6 this conclusion can be reasonably applied to pipeline engineering that is to purposely impose relatively large imperfections at known locations to stop the snap through buckling phenomenon activated by the relatively small imperfections which are randomly caused during production and installation 5 failure assessment of global lateral buckling in pipelines with different imperfections 5 1 failure assessment criterion of a pipeline exhibiting global lateral buckling in addition to the deformation amplitude and buckling mode described above the initial imperfection also affects the bending moment stress and strain during the post buckling of pipelines these factors may jeopardize the structural integrity and lead to final failure modes such as local buckling fracture and fatigue dnv os f101 2012 suggests that the major resulting failure mode for a pipeline exhibiting global buckling is local buckling and proposes two design criteria for performing a failure assessment the displacement controlled criterion and the load controlled criterion which is based on the maximum axial force and bending moment pipeline members subjected to bending moment and effective axial force shall be designed to satisfy the following criterion at all cross sections 3 θ γ m γ sc m sd α c m p t 2 γ m γ sc s sd p i α c s p t 2 2 2 1 where γ m is the material resistance factor γ sc is the safety class resistance factor α c is a flow stress parameter m sd is the design moment m p is the plastic moment s sd is the design effective axial force s p is the plastic axial force p i is the internal pressure θ is the failure parameter and when θ 1 the pipeline still works efficiently under the current load combination a larger value of θ corresponding to a higher load indicates a higher probability of failure 5 2 failure assessment of global lateral buckling for a single imperfection pipeline to assess whether pipeline members will satisfy the criterion of formula 3 at all cross sections the first step is to determine a typical section the contours of the stress strain moment and axial force plotted on the deformation shape of pipeline v6 shown in fig 24 are taken as an example to analyse the selection of typical sections in the failure assessment of a pipeline exhibiting global buckling for the load controlled criterion the section with the maximum axial force and moment should be selected as the typical section however fig 24 shows that the sections with the maximum axial force and the maximum moment are not the same section hence a judgment must be made regarding the main contribution to the stress as the stress is composed of the axial force and bending moment the maximum moment and stress appear at the same section as shown in fig 24 therefore the section with the maximum bending moment should be selected as the typical section for the load controlled criterion in contrast for the displacement controlled criterion the section with the maximum strain should be selected as the typical section as shown in fig 24 b in conjunction with fig 24 a and b shows that the sections with the maximum strain and maximum stress appear at different positions indicating that the same typical section cannot be used for both the load controlled criterion and the displacement controlled criterion moreover a large accumulated plastic strain may aggravate local buckling hence plastic strain will be considered in addition to the axial force and moment the buckling results of single imperfection pipelines v1 v6 are shown in table 5 table 5 shows that the failure parameters of the pipelines increase significantly with an increase in the initial imperfection amplitude when the initial imperfection amplitude increases to 1 0 m pipeline v6 the failure parameter θ 1 implying that pipeline v6 cannot work effectively under the current load similar to the failure parameter the plastic strain increases as the imperfection amplitude increases for the total strain the gap between different pipelines is small except for pipeline v1 5 3 failure assessment of global lateral buckling for a double imperfection pipeline for double imperfection pipelines the maximum buckling deformation may occur at the 1st imperfection at the 2nd imperfection or at the midpoint between the two imperfections as shown in figs 11 and 17 therefore three typical sections namely the midpoint between the two imperfections and the maximum moment sections of the 1st and 2nd imperfections are selected for the failure assessment based on the load controlled criterion the maximum failure parameter of all three sections is the failure parameter of the double imperfection pipeline similarly three typical sections i e the midpoint between the two imperfections and the maximum strain sections of the 1st and 2nd imperfections are selected to analyse the strain and plastic strain of double imperfection pipelines 5 3 1 influence of the double imperfection spacing the buckling results of pipelines s1 s7 are listed in table 6 it shows the influence of the imperfection spacing on the failure parameter of global buckling pipelines table 6 shows that the maximum failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 may occur at the 1st imperfection at the 2nd imperfection or at the midpoint between these two imperfections this validates the necessity of adopting three typical sections simultaneously the differences in the failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 suggest that the double imperfection spacing has a significant impact on the failure parameters as the spacing increases from 0l 0m to 10l 0m the pipeline failure parameters first increase after which they decrease and then increase in conjunction with fig 13 the pipeline failure parameters in table 6 suggest that the pipeline with the first buckling mode s1 has the minimum failure parameter for pipelines with second mode buckling s2 s4 the failure parameters decrease with an increase in the spacing for pipelines with third mode buckling s5 s7 the failure parameter increases as the spacing increases evidently the failure parameters are closely related to the buckling modes for pipelines with different spacing moreover the strain and plastic of pipelines are also related to the buckling modes for example the strain and plastic strain of pipeline s2 as with the failure parameter of pipeline s2 are larger than those of the other pipelines table 7 gives the buckling results for pipelines r1 r7 the following regularity characteristics can be obtained from a comprehensive analysis of table 7 and fig 19 for counter direction double imperfection pipelines the failure parameters of the pipeline with first mode buckling r1 r3 have a negative correlation with the imperfection spacing however the failure parameters of the pipelines with second mode buckling r4 r5 have a positive correlation with the imperfection spacing for the pipelines with third mode buckling r6 r7 the failure parameters increase with an increase in the spacing the variation rule of the failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 and pipelines r1 r7 show the susceptibility of buckling failure to the type of buckling mode for pipelines with the same buckling mode type the failure parameters and the spacing are approximately linearly correlated i e there exists a maximally dangerous spacing for every buckling mode type in this case plastic strain is most likely to occur in the pipeline because it may reach the yield stress such as in pipelines r1 r4 and r7 in table 7 5 3 2 influence of the relative directions of double imperfections to analyse the influence of the relative directions of double imperfections on the integrity of pipelines exhibiting global buckling the maximum failure parameters of tables 6 and 7 are plotted in fig 25 fig 25 shows that when l s 5l 0m the failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 co direction double imperfection pipelines and pipelines r1 r7 counter direction double imperfection pipelines fluctuate significantly the trend of the failure parameters of the co direction double imperfection pipelines is opposite to that of the counter direction double imperfection pipelines demonstrating the significant influence of the relative directions of double imperfections on the pipeline failure parameters in the case of ls 5 l0m the failure parameters of both pipelines s1 s7 and pipelines r1 r7 show a steady upward trend and the failure parameters of pipelines r1 r7 are slightly larger than those of pipelines s1 s7 when compared with the failure parameters of pipeline v5 whose imperfection size is equal to the imperfection sizes of pipelines s1 s7 and r1 r7 the failure parameters of the double imperfection pipelines are clearly always smaller than those of the single imperfection pipelines 5 3 3 influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections to analyse the influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections on the integrity of pipelines exhibiting global buckling table 8 gives the buckling results of the s6 series pipelines table 8 shows that the failure parameters at the 1st imperfection of the s6 series pipelines decrease with increasing amplitude of the 2nd imperfection although the amplitude of the 1st imperfection is constant at 0 5 m for pipelines s6a and s6b which have relatively small 2nd imperfections the failure parameters at their 1st imperfections v0m 0 5 m are 0 91 which are equal to the failure parameter of single imperfection pipeline v5 v 0m 0 5 m in the case of v0m2 v0m1 pipeline s6d the failure parameter of the 1st imperfection drops to 0 17 which is less than 20 of the failure parameter of single imperfection pipeline v5 by comparing the failure parameters of the 1st and 2nd imperfections the maximum failure parameters evidently always appear at the larger imperfection and the failure parameter at one imperfection will be significantly affected by the other imperfection the maximum failure parameters of the double imperfection pipelines in table 8 are less than or equal to those of the single imperfection pipelines with equally sized imperfections in table 4 furthermore the strain and plastic strain of the double imperfection pipelines are all smaller than those of the single imperfection pipelines with equally sized imperfections 6 conclusions the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method is proposed by introducing the engineering stress strain responses of a pipeline at 0 c and 100 c into the 3d explicit method and based on the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method the global lateral buckling of pipelines with single and double imperfections is investigated and the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the global buckling characteristics are analysed moreover the relationship between the failure parameter of pipelines and their buckling mode types is illustrated the conclusions are as follows 1 the buckling modes of double imperfection pipelines impacting by the spacing and relative directions of double imperfections are quite different from the modes presented in hobbs 1984 which are derived from the global buckling of single imperfection pipelines dependent on the magnitude of the imperfection spacing there are three possible buckling mode types respectively for both co direction and counter direction double imperfection pipelines and the spacing ls required for the third buckling mode will be greater than the spacing ls required for the second buckling mode which will be greater than the spacing ls required for the first buckling mode furthermore the smaller the spacing is the more intense the merging of buckling will be and the buckling amplitude increase will also be greater 2 for double imperfection pipelines with two unequally sized imperfections the larger imperfection may inhibit the activation of buckling by the smaller imperfection or weaken the buckling deformation activated by the smaller imperfection both of these effects can stop the snap through buckling phenomenon of relatively small imperfections this conclusion can be reasonably applied to pipeline engineering that is to purposely impose relatively large imperfections at known locations to stop the snap through buckling phenomenon activated by the relatively small imperfections which are randomly caused during production and installation 3 the integrity of pipelines exhibiting global buckling is susceptible to the type of buckling mode i e the pipeline failure has a certain correlation with its buckling mode type for pipelines with the same buckling mode type the failure parameters and the spacing are approximately linearly correlated i e there exists a maximally dangerous spacing for every buckling mode type in this case plastic strain is most likely to occur in the pipeline because it may reach

22291,initial imperfections out of straightness constitute one of the key parameters impacting lateral buckling of pipelines as they influence both pre buckling assessment and pipeline integrity assessment during the post buckling stage when adjacent imperfections exist in a submarine pipeline the influence regularity of initial imperfections on the global buckling of pipelines will become more complicated an elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method is proposed to investigate the global lateral buckling of pipelines with single and double imperfections then an investigation is conducted on the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the global buckling characteristics such as the critical temperature rise the buckling deformation amplitude and the buckling mode based on the limit state criteria of global buckling pipelines in dnvgl rp f110 the structural integrity of pipeline with different buckling modes is assessment the results show that pipeline failure has a certain correlation with its buckling mode type for pipelines with the same buckling mode type the pipeline failure parameter is approximately linearly associated with the double imperfection spacing keywords submarine pipeline initial imperfection global lateral buckling failure assessment numerical method 1 introduction submarine pipelines utilized for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas resources in the deep sea where trenching and burial are less feasible are primarily non trenched and they are increasingly being required to operate under high temperatures and high pressure with greater depth these factors will increase the probability that a pipeline will experience global lateral buckling which constitutes an important trigger of pipeline failure accordingly this challenge has led to considerable research on the global buckling of submarine pipelines for example the safebuck jip joint industry project 2005 performed by boreas consultants twi cambridge university and otm consulting summarized the mechanisms of pipeline buckling and concluded that the formation of buckling is governed by three parameters compressive force in the pipeline out of straightness oos and pipe soil interaction among these parameters oos is the triggering of pipeline global buckling and it plays an important role during global buckling the general behavior of global buckling triggered by imperfections can be described as follows as illustrated in dnvgl rp f110 2017 an imperfect pipeline laid on the seabed will tend to develop effective compression in the operation period of high temperature and axial compressive force will develop along the pipeline when the axial force reaches the lowest global buckling capacity the global buckling capacity has its lowest point at one imperfection the pipeline will buckle if the pressure or temperature is further increased the post buckling will happen or a second buckle may initiate when a neighboring imperfection is located therefore the influences of initial imperfections on the global buckling of submarine pipelines can be divided into the influence on pre buckling and the influence on post buckling the influence on pre buckling is mainly related to the critical buckling force equivalent to the lowest global buckling capacity mentioned above in contrast the influence on post buckling is related to the following two aspects the first is an intuitive effect on the deformation amplitude and buckling mode whereas the second is the influence of buckling deformation on the bending moment stress and strain which represent the key factors governing the buckling failure of submarine pipelines studies on the influences of initial imperfections on pipeline global buckling by analytical solutions were firstly conducted by taylor et al 1986 1996 they proposed an analytical solution for the global buckling of pipelines with single arch and double arch geometric initial imperfections based on hobbs 1984 research taylor analytical solution provides formulas for calculating the critical axial force and the buckling amplitude of a pipeline with first or second order modes of buckling fig 1 with the energy method hong et al 2015a proposed an analytical solution containing formulas for calculating the critical axial forces and buckling amplitudes of imperfect pipelines exhibiting buckling of higher order modes modes 3 and 4 in fig 1 however the abovementioned formulas did not consider the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m which zeng 2014 claimed is an essential imperfection parameter of the critical buckling force therefore zeng 2014 derived a formula for the critical axial force incorporating the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m with the theory of dimensional analysis based on this formulation xu and lin 2017 further proposed a formula for the critical axial force that considers the imperfection size and shape in addition to the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m due to their assumptions of linear elasticity and small deformation analytical solutions have inherent limitations in research on post buckling in pipelines as an effective alternative numerical methods have been widely used to study the global buckling of imperfect pipelines by many researchers such as pedersen and jensen 1987 liu 2011 and karampour et al 2013 compared with the analytical solution method the finite element method can study the influence of initial imperfections on both pre buckling and post buckling of pipelines sriskandarajah et al 1999 the effect of initial imperfections on pre buckling is mainly related to the critical buckling force previous studies shown that the critical axial force of buckling decreases with the increase of the initial imperfection amplitude and is related to the imperfection shape when it comes to the case of a small imperfection amplitude the phenomenon of snap through will appear torselleti et al 1999 the influence on post buckling is related to the deformation amplitude buckling mode bending moment stress strain and the integrity of pipelines with the study on the buckling process of pipelines with initial imperfection villarraga et al 2004 found that the imperfections have a considerable influence on the stress distribution of pipelines which in some cases lead to the stress levels above the allowable limit established by the design suzuki et al 2006 emphasized that the strain of buckling pipeline is easily affected by geometric imperfection rathbone et al 2008 proposed an alternative methodology to define and assess imperfection of pipelines hong 2015b analyzed the influence of imperfections on the global buckling failure of deep water ht hp pipelines moreover research on the effects of initial imperfections on post buckling within pipelines contributes significantly to the development of global buckling mitigation measures such as the use of a snake lay geometry guan et al 2007 luo et al 2013 vertical upset wang et al 2008 wang et al 2018a and distributed buoyancy wang et al 2018b li et al 2016 the discussion presented above indicates that considerable research has been performed on the influences of initial imperfections on the global buckling of pipelines through analytical solutions and numerical methods and most of this research has been focused on isolated initial imperfections however in engineering terms adjacent imperfections can easily occur during the production installation and operation of pipelines many additional questions including whether every imperfection can trigger buckling how these buckling interact and how adjacent imperfections affect the buckling critical axial force buckling deformation mode and integrity of pipelines arise when a pipeline contains adjacent imperfections answers to these questions are of great importance for the prediction and prevention of global buckling within pipelines therefore based on the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method the global lateral buckling of pipelines with single and double imperfections is investigated in this study accordingly the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the pipeline global buckling are illustrated the results of which can be adopted for future pipeline design 2 elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method for simulating the global buckling of pipelines 2 1 3d explicit method liu et al 2014 proposed a 3d explicit method based on abaqus and this method proved to be applicable for the simulation of global buckling in a pipeline before it experiences plastic deformation this method can be briefly described as follows pipe31 beam elements and c3d8r solid elements are used to model the pipeline and foundation soil in the 3d fea model the material of the pipeline is assumed to be linearly elastic and the material properties of the pipeline include the pipe density elastic modulus poisson ratio and coefficient of thermal expansion the mohr coulomb model is used to model the seabed the material properties of the soil include the density elastic modulus poisson ratio cohesion and internal friction angle for the boundary conditions both ends of the pipe are free the soil boundary conditions around the seabed are resistant both laterally and axially and the bottom boundary of the soil is completely fixed the interaction between the pipeline and seabed is simulated by a hard contact in the vertical direction whereas the lateral interaction is simulated by the penalty function implying that the lateral resistance is governed by both the friction coefficient and the submerged weight of the pipeline there are two steps in this simulation the first step is to apply the gravity field to ensure a hard contact between the pipeline and the soil the second step is to increase the temperature of the pipeline to simulate a high temperature load until the pipeline exhibits global buckling 2 2 elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method 2 2 1 material modelling of the pipeline as with most existing analytical models used to simulate the occurrence of global buckling in a pipeline the 3d explicit numerical methods described above is based purely on elastic stress limits therefore this method cannot simulate plastic deformation during post buckling which is likely to occur in an engineering application to address this problem the engineering stress strain responses of a pipeline at 0 c and 100 c shown in fig 2 zhang 2014 are introduced into the 3d explicit method in this study and the improved method is named the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method the stress strain relationship adopted in the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method takes temperature into account for its importance in affecting the pipeline global buckling for a pipeline in the bohai sea the design temperature is 80 c above the ambient temperature which is 0 c and the internal pressure of the pipeline is 4 65 mpa to simplify the calculation the internal pressure is converted by equation 1 given by hobbs 1984 into an equivalent temperature equal to 5 c thus the total temperature is 85 c above the ambient temperature the plastic properties of a pipeline material are defined by digitally specifying the complete plastic stress strain curve of the steel from the material definition contained in the input document during the buckling calculation the stress strain parameters of the pipeline at a certain temperature are determined by linear interpolation of the two curves illustrated in fig 2 1 δ t p d 0 5 v 2 e α t 2 2 2 introduction of initial imperfections into the fea model the method utilized to introduce a single imperfection into the 3d explicit method is described as follows first an initial imperfection is calculated by the buckle step in abaqus that is often used to study the probability of different buckling shapes under a unit load then the parameters of the initial imperfection are output as an inp file through the statement nodefile finally with the statement imperfection file job name step 1 the shape of the imperfection is smoothly introduced into the pipeline model based on the introduction of a single imperfection the method employed to introduce double imperfections into the fea model can be described as three steps first the form of a single initial imperfection is calculated by the buckle step in abaqus and output the parameters of the single initial imperfection second the parameters magnitude and direction of target imperfection can be determined by multiplying the single initial imperfection by a coefficient then parameters of two target imperfections along with the spacing of double imperfections are imported into a computer aided drafting cad software package to outline double imperfections finally the double imperfections are introduced into the pipeline model by the import sketch step in abaqus which is prepared for drawing the outline of double imperfections of pipeline model in the step of create part it should be noted that the initial stress of pipeline is not considered in this study since the double imperfections are created before the application of the load 2 3 model parameters the importance of the calculated length of pipelines in global buckling analysis has been confirmed by previous research christensen 2005 maoût et al 2011 for example liu and li 2018 studied the buckling behaviour of imperfect pipelines with different lengths and suggested that the buckling amplitudes for pipelines with the same imperfections increase with the calculated length of pipelines therefore the calculated pipeline length should be kept constant in research on the influences of initial imperfections on the global buckling in this study the calculated length of the pipelines is fixed at 4000 m the other parameters of the pipelines and soil are provided in table 1 2 4 validation of the model for the pipeline with parameters mentioned above the global buckling of pipeline is calculated by the 3d explicit method and the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method respectively the buckling amplitudes of pipeline at the design temperature of 85 c are illustrated in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the buckling modes of pipeline simulated by the two methods are identical and the buckling amplitudes are similar given that the 3d explicit method has been validated as an effective method for pipeline buckling simulation liu et al 2014 the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method can be considered as an alternative method for global buckling analysis of pipelines stress of buckling pipeline obtained by the two numerical simulation methods is shown as fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the stress of the pipeline calculated by the two models differs greatly in the buckling region and it can be seen from fig 4 b that the maximum stress of the two models is consistent with the increase of temperature before point a and the difference in stress arises as the temperature continues to increase after point a the stress of the elastic model keeps growing until it reaches about 500 mpa at the design temperature 85 c which is greater than the yield stress of the pipeline material shown in fig 2 this indicates that the 3d explicit method based purely on elastic stress limits cannot reflect the yield and plastic deformation of the pipeline subjected to high temperature however yield and plastic deformation during post buckling is likely to occur in an engineering application therefore it is necessary to consider the elastic plastic stress strain responses of pipeline in the simulation of pipeline buckling 3 global lateral buckling of a pipeline with a single imperfection dnvgl rp f110 2017 defines the initial imperfection of a submarine pipeline as a curvature that may be caused by an uneven seabed or purposely made during installation as shown in fig 5 the wavelength l 0m and amplitude v 0m are two key parameters of initial imperfections taylor et al 1986 1993 performed a series of studies on the global buckling of imperfect pipelines with different values of v 0m and l 0m they noted that the ratio of the amplitude to the wavelength v 0m l 0m constitutes a key parameter that affects the pipeline global buckling in addition xu and lin 2017 claimed that global buckling varies significantly with the size of the initial imperfection even for imperfections with the same imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m in this study the influences of the initial imperfection amplitude and wavelength on the global buckling are analysed then these two effects are compared to analyse the influence of the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m on the global buckling of a pipeline 3 1 influence of the imperfection amplitude v 0m on global lateral buckling for the pipeline with a single imperfection shown in fig 5 the initial imperfection wavelength l 0m is fixed at 40 m and the initial imperfection amplitude v 0m is changed from 0 05 m to 1 m to analyse the influence of the amplitude magnitude on the critical axial force and deformation amplitude of global buckling because the internal pressure has been converted into an equivalent temperature the critical temperature difference is equivalent to the critical axial force of the global buckling phenomenon the relationship between the temperature rise δt and the lateral displacement of the pipeline midpoint is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that buckling is absent in the case with a relatively small imperfection amplitude v0m 0 05 m for the pipeline with an imperfection amplitude of v0m 0 1 m the onset of buckling requires a maximum critical temperature rise point a together with the associated snap through buckling phenomenon i e a large buckling deflection occurs within a small temperature rise once the critical temperature is reached the remaining four cases generate a natural development of global lateral buckling and the critical temperature decreases with the increase in the imperfection amplitude the general characteristics of the buckling amplitudes of all six pipelines at the design temperature of 85 c are illustrated in fig 7 as illustrated in fig 7 all imperfection amplitude cases except v 0m 0 05 m generate a buckle with the third mode of hobbs 1984 fig 1 in addition the variation trend of the buckling deformation amplitude is consistent with that of the initial imperfection amplitude 3 2 influence of the imperfection wavelength l 0m on global lateral buckling to study the influence of the imperfection wavelength l 0m on the global buckling of a pipeline the imperfection amplitude v 0m in fig 5 is fixed at 0 5 m and the imperfection wavelength l 0m is varied from 20 m to 400 m the magnitude of each l 0m is determined by the constraint insomuch that the ratio v 0m l 0m is equal to the value of v 0m l 0m in fig 4 the relationship between the temperature rise δt and the lateral displacement of the pipeline midpoint is depicted in fig 8 the curves in fig 8 show that the two cases with long wavelengths l 0m 400 m 200 m do not exhibit buckling the pipeline with an imperfection wavelength of l 0m 100 m has the maximum critical temperature coincident with the snap through buckling phenomenon in contrast the other three cases generate stable post buckling paths and the critical temperature increases with the imperfection wavelength it should be noted that although the pipeline with v 0m 0 1 m l 0m 40 m in fig 6 and the pipeline with l 0m 200 m v 0m 0 5 m in fig 8 have the same imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m 0 025 their buckling responses do not coincide with each other the lateral displacements along the pipelines with different values of l 0m at 85 c are illustrated in fig 9 where the origin of the x axis is the midpoint of the initial imperfection as shown in fig 9 the remaining four wavelength amplitude cases i e excluding l 0m 400 m 200 m generate third mode buckling according to hobbs 1984 fig 1 furthermore the deformation amplitude does not exhibit an evident change with a variation in the imperfection wavelength 3 3 comparison between the influences of v 0m and l 0m the curves illustrated in figs 6 and 8 involve the relationship between the critical temperature rise δt and the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m for each pipeline exhibiting global buckling these relationships are further depicted in fig 10 by connecting them into smooth curves with legends of l 0m 40 m obtained from fig 6 and v 0m 0 5 m obtained from fig 8 the similarity between the trends of these two curves indicates that the critical temperature rise δt regularly decreases as v 0m l 0m increases for both single imperfection cases with a fixed amplitude and a fixed wavelength however the misalignment of these two curves verifies the conclusion of xu and lin 2017 even with the same imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m the critical temperature varies with the magnitudes of the initial imperfection amplitude and wavelength this variability can be described as follows for a certain v 0m l 0m the larger the imperfection magnitude the higher the critical buckling temperature is one possible explanation is that the soil resistance required to be overcome during buckling is greater for pipelines with larger imperfection the relationship between the buckling amplitude and v 0m l 0m shown in fig 11 is obtained by extracting the corresponding values of the pipelines with l 0m 40 m in fig 7 and with v 0m 0 5 m in fig 9 for pipelines with v 0m l 0m 0 025 a buckling amplitude exceeding 3 m is observed for the relatively large imperfection case i e pipeline v2 v 0m 0 1 m l 0m 40 m while no buckling is observed for the smaller deformation amplitude i e pipeline l2 v 0m 0 5 m l 0m 200 m the reason is that the soil resistance required to be overcome during buckling is greater for pipelines with larger imperfection for buckling pipelines with the same v 0m l 0 the larger the imperfection size the larger the buckling amplitude is the general characteristics of the critical temperature and buckling amplitude given in figs 8 and 9 are affected by both the imperfection ratio v 0m l 0m and the size of the imperfection the influences of the imperfection ratio and size can be demonstrated better by pipelines with a fixed imperfection wavelength l 0m than by pipelines with a fixed imperfection amplitude v 0m therefore this finding will be applied to further research on the influences of double imperfections on the global lateral buckling of pipelines 4 global lateral buckling of a pipeline with double imperfections for the pipeline with double imperfections shown in fig 12 the imperfection configuration is governed by three parameters the spacing between the two imperfections the relative directions of the two imperfections and the form i e imperfection ratio and size of each imperfection the effect of each parameter on the global buckling of the pipeline will be studied by keeping the other two fixed 4 1 influence of the double imperfection spacing on global lateral buckling to study the influence of the double imperfection spacing l s i e the distance between the ends of the 1st and 2nd imperfections on global lateral buckling the forms of both imperfections are fixed at l 0m 40 m and v 0m1 v 0m2 0 5 m in addition the relative directions of these two imperfections are set to be consistent and the spacing l s is varied from 0l 0m to 10l 0m as shown in table 2 the global buckling deformation of pipelines s1 s7 at the design temperature is plotted in fig 13 in which the lateral coordinates of pipelines are enlarged proportionally by 50 times to properly illustrate the lateral deformation the buckling modes shown in fig 13 are different from the modes presented in hobbs 1984 fig 1 and the relatively large spacing cases pipelines s5 s7 display buckling modes that are not included among the modes of hobbs 1984 the buckling modes of s1 s7 can be divided into three types as the spacing decreases from 10l 0m to 0l 0m the pipelines s5 s6 and s7 present the same buckling mode characterized as the primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other and their secondary buckles do not merge with each other the deformation forms of pipeline s4 s3 and s2 can be classified into one mode type which is characterized by the independence of the primary buckling at the 1st and 2nd imperfections together with the merging of their secondary buckling pipeline s1 in fig 9 shows the last buckling mode in which there is only one primary buckling located at the middle of the 1st and 2nd imperfection to study the formation mechanisms of these three types of buckling modes the buckling deformation characteristics during a rise in the temperature for pipelines s1 s4 and s6 which are representative of each type of buckling mode are presented in fig 12 through 14 the formation of the buckling mode along pipeline s1 is clearly shown in fig 14 as the temperature rises from 0 c to 51 c primary buckling is activated at the 1st imperfection and 2nd imperfection along with the superposition of secondary buckling between the primary buckles when the temperature reaches 59 5 c the two primary buckles in conjunction with the secondary buckles between them merge into one buckle resulting in an abrupt increase in the buckling deformation amplitude and wavelength as the temperature increases from 59 5 c to the design temperature the buckling deformation of the pipeline coincides with that of the single imperfection pipeline v5 shown in fig 7 fig 15 displays the buckling process of pipeline s4 the primary buckles triggered by the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other throughout the temperature rise the secondary buckles between the primary buckles merge as the temperature rises to 42 5 c the amplitude of the merged secondary buckle a significantly increases compared with those of the individual secondary buckles b and c and the amplitude of a is approximately thrice the amplitude of b the instances of primary buckling observed at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other for pipeline s6 as shown in fig 16 the secondary buckles between them do not merge but their buckling amplitudes a are less than 50 of the amplitudes of the other two secondary buckles b and c further to clarify this phenomenon the regularity of the axial displacement along pipeline s6 is considered in fig 17 a negative value of the axial displacement indicates movement toward the left as denoted by arrows the axial displacement direction of the pipeline around the midpoint deviates from the midpoint implying that the pipeline between the 1st imperfection and the 2nd imperfection is evenly divided into two segments during buckling and that each segment acts as the feed in of adjacent buckling the amount of feed in is less than the amount of feed in from the left of the 1st imperfection or from the right of the 2nd imperfection this is why the buckling amplitude at point a is smaller than that at point b and c obviously the effect of weakening the amplitude of the secondary buckling will decrease with an increase in the spacing and will eventually disappear thus double imperfections will eventually become equivalent to two single imperfections a comparison of figs 13 and 14 demonstrates that the amplitude of the secondary buckling between the two primary buckles can be either strengthened or weakened the weakening effect is due to a relatively small amount of feed in whereas the strengthening effect is due to the merging of secondary buckling between the two imperfections thereby transforming the feed in segment into a segment of buckling deformation prior to further considering fig 13 and the ensuing implications it is pertinent to summarize the three possible configurations which are dependent on the magnitude of the imperfection spacing the first buckling mode is characterized by the merging of primary buckling s1 the second buckling mode is characterized by the merging of secondary buckling s2 s4 and the third buckling mode is characterized by the weakening of the secondary buckles s5 s7 it should be noted that in addition to the spacing all three of the modes obtained in fig 13 rely on various other parameters such as the ratio of the outside diameter to the wall thickness of the pipeline d t internal and external pressure lateral and axial friction operating temperature and installation depth therefore not all pipelines with double imperfections exhibiting the same relative direction will include all three buckling modes as the spacing changes for example for a series of pipelines with a design temperature of 25 5 c in which the other parameters are consistent with those of the pipelines shown in fig 13 the buckling of the pipeline with a spacing equal to 0l 0m shown as the displacement curve of 25 5 c in fig 10 the buckling of the pipeline with a spacing of 2l 0m fig 11 and the pipeline with a spacing of 6l 0m fig 12 all belong to the third type of buckling mode as the buckling mode of a pipeline with a certain spacing will vary with the abovementioned parameters the type of buckling mode for a double imperfection pipeline cannot be separately determined by the imperfection spacing however for pipelines with fixed parameters and operating conditions the influence of spacing on the buckling mode of pipelines shows good regularity it can be described as the spacing l s required for the third buckling mode will be greater than the spacing l s required for the second buckling mode which will be greater than the spacing l s required for the first buckling mode furthermore the smaller the spacing is the more intense the merging of buckling will be and the buckling amplitude increase will also be greater when the spacing increases insomuch that the secondary buckles no longer merge the amplitude of the secondary buckles between double imperfections will change from exhibiting a strengthening effect to exhibiting a weakening effect and this effect will decrease with an increase in the spacing before eventually disappearing thus double imperfections are eventually equivalent to two single imperfections accordingly distinguishing between double imperfections and two single imperfections is important for the study of adjacent imperfections 4 2 influence of double imperfection directions on global lateral buckling the relative directions of double imperfections can be similar or opposite to each other an example of double imperfections with opposite directions is shown in fig 18 the form of each imperfection is fixed at l 0m 40 m and v 0m1 v 0m2 0 5 m while the spacing l s is varied from 0l 0m to 10l 0m to analyse the global lateral buckling of a pipeline with counter direction double imperfections as shown in table 3 the global buckling deformation of pipelines r1 r7 at the design temperature is plotted in fig 19 in which the lateral coordinates of the pipelines are enlarged proportionally by 50 times to properly illustrate the lateral deformation the buckling modes shown in fig 19 vary with the spacing between the counter direction double imperfections the pipelines r1 r2 and r3 present the same buckling mode as the primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are adjacent to each other at the midpoint of the spacing the adjacency of primary buckles indicates that the secondary buckles between the two imperfections are respectively incorporated into the associated primary buckle in contrast the deformation forms of pipelines r6 and r7 are characterized as primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other and their secondary buckling amplitudes are weakened the global buckling forms of pipelines r4 and r5 are the transitions of the above two forms characterized as the secondary buckles between the two imperfections are adjacent to each other at the midpoint of the spacing therefore the buckling modes vary with the spacing between the counter direction double imperfections and are split into the following three categories the first buckling mode is characterized by the adjacency of primary buckles r1 r3 the second buckling mode is characterized by the adjacency of secondary buckles r4 r5 and the third buckling mode is characterized by the weakening of secondary buckling r5 r7 in conjunction with figs 13 and 19 suggests that with a relatively small spacing the buckling modes for counter direction double imperfection pipelines is more stable than that for co direction double imperfection pipelines as there is no merging of primary or secondary buckling triggered by the 1st and 2nd imperfections for example in the case with a spacing of 0l 0m the primary buckles along pipeline r1 are independent of each other and the secondary buckles between them are incorporated into the associated primary buckles these characteristics are different from those of pipeline s1 which is characterized by the merging of two primary buckles together with the secondary buckles between them however for a relatively large spacing the relative directions of the double imperfections have little effect on the global buckling mode taking a spacing of 7l 0m as an example for both pipelines s7 and r7 the primary buckles at the 1st and 2nd imperfections are independent of each other and their secondary buckling amplitudes are weakened in conclusion the buckling mode is susceptible to the relative directions of double imperfections at relatively small spacings and the effect will decrease until it disappears with an increase in the spacing 4 3 influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections on global lateral buckling to study the influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections on global lateral buckling the two imperfection directions are set to be consistent with those in fig 12 the spacing l s is fixed at 5l 0m the imperfection wavelength l 0m is fixed at 40 m and the amplitude of the 1st imperfection v 0m1 is fixed at 0 5 m while the amplitude of the 2nd imperfection v 0m2 is varied from 0 1 m to 2 m as shown in table 4 the global buckling deformation of pipeline series s6 at the design temperature is plotted in fig 20 because the amplitude of the 1st imperfection in fig 20 is constant at 0 5 m the decrease in the buckling amplitude triggered by the 1st imperfection suggests that the buckling amplitude of one imperfection will be significantly affected by the other imperfection the buckling amplitude triggered by the 1st imperfection gradually decreases as the 2nd imperfection amplitude v 0m2 increases from 0 05 m to 1 0 m this implies that a smaller ratio of one imperfection to the other will coincide with a smaller buckling deformation amplitude of one imperfection when the ratio is as small as the ratio required for the onset of buckling the smaller imperfection will fail to initiate buckling as is observed for the 2nd imperfection of pipeline s6b however buckling occurred in pipeline v5 in fig 7 whose imperfection size is equal to the 2nd imperfection size of pipeline s6b with an amplitude of approximately 3 m for the case of pipeline s6c the 2nd imperfection activated buckling with an amplitude much smaller than the buckling amplitude of pipeline v4 in fig 7 although these two imperfections are equal in size this suggests that the buckling deformation of the smaller imperfection in a double imperfection pipeline will be weakened relative to an equally sized single imperfection in a single imperfection pipeline in conclusion the larger imperfection among a pair of double imperfections plays an important role in the buckling deformation of the smaller imperfection as it may inhibit the activation of buckling by the smaller imperfection or weaken the buckling deformation activated by the smaller imperfection to study the critical buckling temperature of each imperfection in double imperfection pipelines the relationship between the rise in the temperature δt and the lateral displacement of the midpoint between the 1st imperfection and 2nd imperfection is depicted in fig 21 the critical buckling temperatures of the 1st and 2nd imperfections in fig 21 with the exception of the imperfections with amplitudes of v 0m2 0 05 m and 0 1 m that failed to initiate buckling are equal to the critical buckling temperatures of pipelines with the equally sized single imperfection shown in fig 6 this indicates that the critical temperature of one imperfection in a pair of double imperfections is determined by itself regardless of the other imperfection from this it is easy to know that the critical buckling temperatures of pipelines s1 s7 and r1 r7 at each imperfection are equal to that of pipelines with the equally sized single imperfection therefore in order to keep the analysis content of the article from repeating the influence of critical temperature is not analysed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 however for an imperfection with an amplitude of v 0m2 0 1 m buckling is triggered at a temperature of 21 25 c for pipeline v5 in fig 7 but buckling is not triggered in the 2nd imperfection along pipeline s6b this phenomenon can be explained by formula 2 in dnvgl rp f110 2017 2 s r 1 δ s s g 2 where s r 1 is the post buckle effective axial force in the first buckle δs is the axial force build up between adjacent buckles and s g 2 is the axial global buckling capacity force for the second buckle formula 2 is illustrated in fig 22 where the 1st buckle is initiated by the larger imperfection in a pair of double imperfections based on this principle whether the axial force build up is sufficient to initiate the 2nd buckle is determined by the double imperfection spacing and the difference between s g 2 and s g 1 the smaller imperfection is less likely to buckle with a decrease in the double imperfection spacing or an increase in the difference between s g 2 and s g 1 this is why the 2nd imperfection along pipeline s6b in fig 20 does not buckle the growth rate of buckling deformation at the smaller imperfection during a rise in the temperature shown in fig 21 is smaller than that of the equally size single imperfection shown in fig 6 this feature again demonstrates that the buckling deformation activated by a smaller imperfection will be relatively weakened this weakening principle can be explained by the axial force distribution of pipeline s6c shown in fig 23 as demonstrated in dnvgl rp f110 2017 the global buckling response manifests as an expansion into an area to relieve the resulting high axial stress in the pipe wall and the buckling deformation of the pipeline is proportional to the amount of released axial force taking the axial force curve at 8 5 c as an example the 1st and 2nd imperfections both start to buckle and the effective axial force at the apex decreases as shown by the shaded area the buckling deformation of both the 1st imperfection and the 2nd imperfection is proportional to the shaded area with an increasing temperature the magnitude of the released axial force will increase leading to a longer feed in length to the largest buckles at the 1st imperfection extending to the 2nd imperfection beyond this point the growth rate of the 1st shaded area is much larger than that of the 2nd shaded area this is illustrated by the axial force curves at 12 75 c and 17 c implying that the feed in length of the pipeline on the right side of the 2nd imperfection will mostly contribute to the buckling of the 1st imperfection as the temperature is further increased the growth rate of the 2nd shaded area drops to zero thus the expansion into the 2nd imperfection is stopped and the buckling deformation no longer grows with an increase in the temperature in summary for double imperfection pipelines the larger imperfection may inhibit the activation of buckling by the smaller imperfection or weaken the buckling deformation activated by the smaller imperfection both of these effects can stop the snap through buckling phenomenon of relatively small imperfections shown in fig 6 this conclusion can be reasonably applied to pipeline engineering that is to purposely impose relatively large imperfections at known locations to stop the snap through buckling phenomenon activated by the relatively small imperfections which are randomly caused during production and installation 5 failure assessment of global lateral buckling in pipelines with different imperfections 5 1 failure assessment criterion of a pipeline exhibiting global lateral buckling in addition to the deformation amplitude and buckling mode described above the initial imperfection also affects the bending moment stress and strain during the post buckling of pipelines these factors may jeopardize the structural integrity and lead to final failure modes such as local buckling fracture and fatigue dnv os f101 2012 suggests that the major resulting failure mode for a pipeline exhibiting global buckling is local buckling and proposes two design criteria for performing a failure assessment the displacement controlled criterion and the load controlled criterion which is based on the maximum axial force and bending moment pipeline members subjected to bending moment and effective axial force shall be designed to satisfy the following criterion at all cross sections 3 θ γ m γ sc m sd α c m p t 2 γ m γ sc s sd p i α c s p t 2 2 2 1 where γ m is the material resistance factor γ sc is the safety class resistance factor α c is a flow stress parameter m sd is the design moment m p is the plastic moment s sd is the design effective axial force s p is the plastic axial force p i is the internal pressure θ is the failure parameter and when θ 1 the pipeline still works efficiently under the current load combination a larger value of θ corresponding to a higher load indicates a higher probability of failure 5 2 failure assessment of global lateral buckling for a single imperfection pipeline to assess whether pipeline members will satisfy the criterion of formula 3 at all cross sections the first step is to determine a typical section the contours of the stress strain moment and axial force plotted on the deformation shape of pipeline v6 shown in fig 24 are taken as an example to analyse the selection of typical sections in the failure assessment of a pipeline exhibiting global buckling for the load controlled criterion the section with the maximum axial force and moment should be selected as the typical section however fig 24 shows that the sections with the maximum axial force and the maximum moment are not the same section hence a judgment must be made regarding the main contribution to the stress as the stress is composed of the axial force and bending moment the maximum moment and stress appear at the same section as shown in fig 24 therefore the section with the maximum bending moment should be selected as the typical section for the load controlled criterion in contrast for the displacement controlled criterion the section with the maximum strain should be selected as the typical section as shown in fig 24 b in conjunction with fig 24 a and b shows that the sections with the maximum strain and maximum stress appear at different positions indicating that the same typical section cannot be used for both the load controlled criterion and the displacement controlled criterion moreover a large accumulated plastic strain may aggravate local buckling hence plastic strain will be considered in addition to the axial force and moment the buckling results of single imperfection pipelines v1 v6 are shown in table 5 table 5 shows that the failure parameters of the pipelines increase significantly with an increase in the initial imperfection amplitude when the initial imperfection amplitude increases to 1 0 m pipeline v6 the failure parameter θ 1 implying that pipeline v6 cannot work effectively under the current load similar to the failure parameter the plastic strain increases as the imperfection amplitude increases for the total strain the gap between different pipelines is small except for pipeline v1 5 3 failure assessment of global lateral buckling for a double imperfection pipeline for double imperfection pipelines the maximum buckling deformation may occur at the 1st imperfection at the 2nd imperfection or at the midpoint between the two imperfections as shown in figs 11 and 17 therefore three typical sections namely the midpoint between the two imperfections and the maximum moment sections of the 1st and 2nd imperfections are selected for the failure assessment based on the load controlled criterion the maximum failure parameter of all three sections is the failure parameter of the double imperfection pipeline similarly three typical sections i e the midpoint between the two imperfections and the maximum strain sections of the 1st and 2nd imperfections are selected to analyse the strain and plastic strain of double imperfection pipelines 5 3 1 influence of the double imperfection spacing the buckling results of pipelines s1 s7 are listed in table 6 it shows the influence of the imperfection spacing on the failure parameter of global buckling pipelines table 6 shows that the maximum failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 may occur at the 1st imperfection at the 2nd imperfection or at the midpoint between these two imperfections this validates the necessity of adopting three typical sections simultaneously the differences in the failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 suggest that the double imperfection spacing has a significant impact on the failure parameters as the spacing increases from 0l 0m to 10l 0m the pipeline failure parameters first increase after which they decrease and then increase in conjunction with fig 13 the pipeline failure parameters in table 6 suggest that the pipeline with the first buckling mode s1 has the minimum failure parameter for pipelines with second mode buckling s2 s4 the failure parameters decrease with an increase in the spacing for pipelines with third mode buckling s5 s7 the failure parameter increases as the spacing increases evidently the failure parameters are closely related to the buckling modes for pipelines with different spacing moreover the strain and plastic of pipelines are also related to the buckling modes for example the strain and plastic strain of pipeline s2 as with the failure parameter of pipeline s2 are larger than those of the other pipelines table 7 gives the buckling results for pipelines r1 r7 the following regularity characteristics can be obtained from a comprehensive analysis of table 7 and fig 19 for counter direction double imperfection pipelines the failure parameters of the pipeline with first mode buckling r1 r3 have a negative correlation with the imperfection spacing however the failure parameters of the pipelines with second mode buckling r4 r5 have a positive correlation with the imperfection spacing for the pipelines with third mode buckling r6 r7 the failure parameters increase with an increase in the spacing the variation rule of the failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 and pipelines r1 r7 show the susceptibility of buckling failure to the type of buckling mode for pipelines with the same buckling mode type the failure parameters and the spacing are approximately linearly correlated i e there exists a maximally dangerous spacing for every buckling mode type in this case plastic strain is most likely to occur in the pipeline because it may reach the yield stress such as in pipelines r1 r4 and r7 in table 7 5 3 2 influence of the relative directions of double imperfections to analyse the influence of the relative directions of double imperfections on the integrity of pipelines exhibiting global buckling the maximum failure parameters of tables 6 and 7 are plotted in fig 25 fig 25 shows that when l s 5l 0m the failure parameters of pipelines s1 s7 co direction double imperfection pipelines and pipelines r1 r7 counter direction double imperfection pipelines fluctuate significantly the trend of the failure parameters of the co direction double imperfection pipelines is opposite to that of the counter direction double imperfection pipelines demonstrating the significant influence of the relative directions of double imperfections on the pipeline failure parameters in the case of ls 5 l0m the failure parameters of both pipelines s1 s7 and pipelines r1 r7 show a steady upward trend and the failure parameters of pipelines r1 r7 are slightly larger than those of pipelines s1 s7 when compared with the failure parameters of pipeline v5 whose imperfection size is equal to the imperfection sizes of pipelines s1 s7 and r1 r7 the failure parameters of the double imperfection pipelines are clearly always smaller than those of the single imperfection pipelines 5 3 3 influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections to analyse the influence of the relative sizes of double imperfections on the integrity of pipelines exhibiting global buckling table 8 gives the buckling results of the s6 series pipelines table 8 shows that the failure parameters at the 1st imperfection of the s6 series pipelines decrease with increasing amplitude of the 2nd imperfection although the amplitude of the 1st imperfection is constant at 0 5 m for pipelines s6a and s6b which have relatively small 2nd imperfections the failure parameters at their 1st imperfections v0m 0 5 m are 0 91 which are equal to the failure parameter of single imperfection pipeline v5 v 0m 0 5 m in the case of v0m2 v0m1 pipeline s6d the failure parameter of the 1st imperfection drops to 0 17 which is less than 20 of the failure parameter of single imperfection pipeline v5 by comparing the failure parameters of the 1st and 2nd imperfections the maximum failure parameters evidently always appear at the larger imperfection and the failure parameter at one imperfection will be significantly affected by the other imperfection the maximum failure parameters of the double imperfection pipelines in table 8 are less than or equal to those of the single imperfection pipelines with equally sized imperfections in table 4 furthermore the strain and plastic strain of the double imperfection pipelines are all smaller than those of the single imperfection pipelines with equally sized imperfections 6 conclusions the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method is proposed by introducing the engineering stress strain responses of a pipeline at 0 c and 100 c into the 3d explicit method and based on the elastic plastic 3d explicit numerical method the global lateral buckling of pipelines with single and double imperfections is investigated and the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the global buckling characteristics are analysed moreover the relationship between the failure parameter of pipelines and their buckling mode types is illustrated the conclusions are as follows 1 the buckling modes of double imperfection pipelines impacting by the spacing and relative directions of double imperfections are quite different from the modes presented in hobbs 1984 which are derived from the global buckling of single imperfection pipelines dependent on the magnitude of the imperfection spacing there are three possible buckling mode types respectively for both co direction and counter direction double imperfection pipelines and the spacing ls required for the third buckling mode will be greater than the spacing ls required for the second buckling mode which will be greater than the spacing ls required for the first buckling mode furthermore the smaller the spacing is the more intense the merging of buckling will be and the buckling amplitude increase will also be greater 2 for double imperfection pipelines with two unequally sized imperfections the larger imperfection may inhibit the activation of buckling by the smaller imperfection or weaken the buckling deformation activated by the smaller imperfection both of these effects can stop the snap through buckling phenomenon of relatively small imperfections this conclusion can be reasonably applied to pipeline engineering that is to purposely impose relatively large imperfections at known locations to stop the snap through buckling phenomenon activated by the relatively small imperfections which are randomly caused during production and installation 3 the integrity of pipelines exhibiting global buckling is susceptible to the type of buckling mode i e the pipeline failure has a certain correlation with its buckling mode type for pipelines with the same buckling mode type the failure parameters and the spacing are approximately linearly correlated i e there exists a maximally dangerous spacing for every buckling mode type in this case plastic strain is most likely to occur in the pipeline because it may reach

22292,re compaction process after previous liquefaction exerts significant effects on subsequent cyclic behaviour of soil due to the complexities in environmental loading conditions the relevant studies on this topic are limited in this paper we collected natural submarine silts from non liquefied and post liquefied seabed in the yellow river subaqueous delta via offshore hydraulic sampling method respectively monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted between them to investigate the re compaction effect after previous wave induced liquefaction on the undrained static and cyclic shear behaviours of seabed soil our experiments indicated that due to re compaction process the static and cyclic strengths of seabed silt in post liquefied area are both enhanced in comparison to non liquefied soil a transformation in static shear failure mode from plastic to brittle after wave induced liquefaction could be identified in seabed silt furthermore the developments of pore water pressure and cyclic axial strain with number of cycles for seabed silts could be characterized by the hyperbolic and power models respectively and an empirical relationship between pore water pressure and cyclic axial strain is proposed for natural seabed silt finally compared with non liquefied seabed silt the threshold cyclic stress ratio csr for post liquefied seabed silt is also elevated due to re compaction effect keywords natural seabed silt post liquefaction behaviour re compaction wave loading yellow river delta 1 introduction with the relentless rise of word energy consumption offshore geotechnical practice related to marine oil and gas exploration and production has grown rapidly over the last 40 years randolph et al 2005 2011 for this reason more and more attentions have been paid to investigate the cyclic behaviour of marine soil supporting the offshore structures subjected to wave loading due to the unique physical properties e g high water content and void ratio and low relative density marine soil commonly exhibits an apparent degradation of stiffness under long term wave loading and even can be liquefied under some extreme circumstances i e storm wave or earthquake prior et al 1986 zen and yamazaki 1991 paramasivam and banerjee 2017 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 considering the episodic nature of wave loading it is inevitable to reconsolidate for seabed soil to a new stable or meta stable state between sequences of wave white et al 2013 in addition the wave induced densification on seabed during reconsolidation also cannot be ignored zen and yamazaki 1990 miyamoto et al 2004 sumer et al 2006 xu et al 2016 hence research on re compaction effect including reconsolidation and wave induced densification functions on cyclic behavior of seabed soil after liquefaction is warranted as illustrated in fig 1 reconsolidation progress can be marked as a specified stress path after previous cyclic loading during reconsolidation the excess pore pressure induced by previous cyclic loading dissipates gradually and soil will be densified again el sekelly et al 2016 due to the variation of soil state the resistance of it to re liquefaction will change accordingly much research has been conducted to elucidate the reconsolidation effect on subsequent cyclic response of soil subjected to earthquake loading for sand low levels of prior seismic strain history generally play a positive effect on subsequent cyclic behaviour after reconsolidation while large strains induced by previous cyclic loading will produce lower resistances to pore pressure generation finn et al 1970 seed et al 1977 ishihara and okada 1982 porcino et al 2009 wahyudi et al 2014 actually under prior small amplitude of cyclic loading sand may become denser or the interlocking of the particles in the original structure transfers into a more stable state due to elimination of small local instabilities at the contact points seed et al 1977 in contrast large strain may damage the intact condition of sand and incur weak zones in the soil due to uneven densification ishihara and okada 1982 in order to differentiate the diverse function between small and large prior cyclic strains the so called phase transformation pt line theory was adopted by ishihara and okada 1978 in their research a reduction of the resistance to future liquefaction is expected when previous cyclic loading stress path crosses the phase transformation pt line while a positive effect could be obtained if not passing the line anyway it should be noted that the function of reconsolidation may not fully remedy the damage to the cyclic strength of sand induced by prior large strains due to the bonding forces between soil particles and the overall structure effect sorensen et al 2007 the post cyclic behaviour of cohesive soil exhibits more complexly than sand yasuhara et al 1992 for normally consolidated cohesive soil hyde et al 2007 indicated that the soil skeleton of remoulded silt will be densified after post cyclic reconsolidation and the post drainage cyclic strength of it will increase with initial anisotropically consolidated ratio however this silt can still be liquefied by aftershocks comparing undrained shear behaviour between pre and post cyclic loading wang et al 2015 found that the shear strength and stiffness of mississippi river silt rise steadily with an increase of the degree of reconsolidation and the slopes of csl of silt before and after cyclic loading are different due to the change in the microstructure of silt for overconsolidated cohesive soil the dissipation of negative pore pressure after pre cyclic loading will lead to swelling and therefore a reduction of post cyclic undrained static strength bishop and henkel 1953 actually for marine sediments on active margins the post cyclic shear strength can also be elevated apparently by reconsolidation after earthquake resulting in lower frequency of submarine landslide sawyer and devore 2015 in addition to earthquake coastal marine sediments always suffer long term wave loading with different amplitudes in that case marine sediment may experience the circles of post liquefaction and re consolidation processes as indicated in fig 1 nevertheless the unique stress history will exert some effects on subsequent mechanical behaviour of marine sediments yang et al 2018 however the relevant studies are very limited at present a novel hyperbolic model had been proposed by ren et al 2018 b to predict the development of undrained pore pressure of soft marine clay under long term low cyclic loads but the effect of stress history was not included in the model paramasivam and banerjee 2017 made an attempt to study the variation of post cyclic undrained shear strength of reconstituted marine clay specimens with the cyclic loading conditions namely staged cyclic loading and continuous cyclic loading it was found that the post cyclic undrained strength and stiffness of marine clay were greatly influenced by the cyclic loading condition and reconsolidation after cyclic loading however due to the limitations of specimen numerous cyclic triaxial test results in terms of remoulded or reconstituted specimens may not truly represent the effect of post liquefaction re compaction on cyclic behavior of natural marine soil apart from cyclic loading tests some physical model experiments have also been conducted to clarify the wave induced liquefaction and reconsolidation processes in seabed jia et al 2014 liu et al 2017a for example zen and yamazaki 1990 presented that in addition to wave induced cyclic shear stress the densification in seabed could also be caused by the vertical oscillation of water pressure through an one dimensional cylinder test apparatus sumer et al 2006 indicated that the liquefaction process of seabed induced by wave loading in a wave flume may be divided into six sequences and re compaction or re solidification phenomenon occurs in stage five actually a substantial amount of research has been carried out on the sequences of wave induced liquefaction process in seabed by sumer s research group through wave flume tests sumer et al 2005 2012 kirca et al 2013 and a summary of recent advances could be found in his book sumer 2014 similarly xu et al 2016 also found that silty sediment could be liquefied by wave movement and after liquefaction sedimentary strata is re stratified and a new stable structure of post liquefied sediment can be built due to oscillation and fluctuation of soil particles with wave movement for the above cases it may be conceived that the new sediment structure originated from re compaction or re solidification after wave induced liquefaction will definitely influence the subsequent cyclic behaviour of seabed soil due to the extremely complex wave loading conditions in nature the laboratory wave flume test results may not fully capture the liquefaction process of seabed in that case a large number of field studies have also been conducted to investigate the development of excess pore water pressure in seabed and submarine sediment transport induced by wave bennett 1977 prior et al 1989 schultheiss 1990 in the yellow river subaqueous delta jia s research group has also published many research papers on the phenomenon of wave induced sediment erosion and re suspension zhang et al 2018 jia et al 2019 however their research mainly focuses on the in situ monitoring of sediment responses to wave loading and the corresponding physical mechanism very limited work has been done to investigate the effect of re compaction after wave induced liquefaction on cyclic behavior of marine soil as a very important offshore oil and gas production area of china yellow river subaqueous delta distributes a large number of submarine cables and pipelines and some of them had been broken due to wave induced liquefaction in seabed during storm for practical purposes it is vital to evaluate the mechanical behavior of seabed soil undergone previous wave loading process which essentially belongs to the research area about the effect of previous cyclic loading history on subsequent static or cyclic behaviors of soil as discussed above there are many limits existing in this area while the wave liquefied seabed in the yellow river subaqueous delta provides a very good opportunity to conduct research on this topic from a more realistic perspective main objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of re compaction after liquefaction on the cyclic behavior of seabed soil in the yellow river delta through laboratory cyclic triaxial tests specially in the present study a representative area of wave induced liquefaction in silty seabed was identified at first through shallow seismic profile investigation in the yellow river subaqueous delta after that natural seabed silts were collected via offshore hydraulic sampling method from the post liquefied and its adjacent non liquefied seabed respectively among the natural seabed soils specimens sampled in post liquefied seabed were deemed as the case suffered from re compaction after previous wave induced liquefaction while the others were used for comparisons monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were then conducted between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts to investigate the post liquefaction re compaction effect on the undrained static and cyclic shear behaviours of natural seabed soil finally based on the test results some empirical relationships were built to describe the cyclic behaviors of seabed silt in the yellow river subaqueous delta under wave loading and the enhancement effect in re liquefaction resistance caused by re compaction after previous wave induced liquefaction was emphasized specially 2 experimental program 2 1 wave liquefied seabed and material as an important offshore oil and gas enrichment area many geophysical investigations have been conducted in the modern yellow river subaqueous delta fig 2 based on the survey results a number of submarine instable landforms e g shallow landslide pockmark post liquefied stratum and hard crust have been identified the detailed schematic of these instabilities can be found in wang and liu 2016 normally the acoustic recordings in non liquefied seabed sediment show some certain regularity while they become messy and unordered in post liquefied submarine stratum fig 3 in this way post liquefied seabed can be easily depicted in the study area fig 2 through shallow stratigraphic profile investigation according to sun et al 2008 storm induced liquefaction is deemed as the primary cause to create such submarine disturbed stratum in this area the similar research conclusions could also be found in many other literatures prior et al 1989 xu et al 2012 2016 wang and liu 2016 hence it provides an excellent chance to investigate the re compaction effect after previous wave induced liquefaction on subsequent cyclic behaviour of natural seabed soil it should be noted that based on statistic data the wave height length and period are 2 0m 40m 5 0s and 6 7m 88m 8 6s for 1 year and 50 year return period in the study area respectively wang and liu 2016 soils tested in the present study were collected from the post liquefied and its adjacent non liquefied seabed in the yellow river subaqueous delta respectively fig 3 presents the corresponding sedimentary profiles obtained from shallow stratigraphic section investigation compared with the circumjacent non liquefied stratum the post liquefied area could be clearly identified in fig 3 b through the red dash line as shown the maximum wave liquefied depth is about 4 5m below the seabed and the sampling borehole zk 3 covers almost the whole liquefied layer in depth specially the hydraulic method was used to sample undisturbed seabed silty soil in the present study the sampler is a composite sampler using plastic inner cylinders with a diameter of 100 mm during sampling the displacement method is used wherein the sampler is pushed down to the desired sampling depth without pre augering following strict operational procedures the sampling method can be considered appropriate in sampling undisturbed silty soils in the yellow river delta the sampling tubes with 100 mm in diameter were sawed into several subsections in the field and then wax sealed instantly before shipping to the laboratory during the preparation work of triaxial specimens in the laboratory we collected the soil that had been trimmed from undisturbed specimen for basic physical properties determination the density of sample can be calculated based on the weight of a standard cylinder triaxial specimen 50 mm 100 mm following chinese national standard for soil testing method gb t50123 1999 the index properties of natural submarine soil were measured and listed in table 1 as indicated by wen et al 2007 the national standard of china is very similar to the related standards of astm it should be noted however that in chinese national standard the liquid plastic combined testing method which is actually a kind of penetration method was used to measure atterberg limits of seabed soil specially in this method a cone with an angle of 30 and total mass of 76g is firstly suspended above but just in contact with the sample then the cone is permitted to fall freely into the sample within 5s after that the water content of the soil sample adjacent to the tip of the cone is measured the water content corresponding to cone penetrations of 17 mm and 2 mm defines the liquid limit and plastic limit respectively andrade et al 2011 liu et al 2017b the choice of 17 mm and 2 mm penetration depths as threshold limit values is based on a large of number of statistical analyses of shear strength testing results on various soils in china to guarantee that the present test results are equivalent to that obtained through traditional atterberg method wen et al 2007 generally as presented in table 1 the index properties of specimens between non liquefied and post liquefied areas in the yellow river subaqueous delta are similar and the seabed soil in the present study belongs to silt according to the soil classification standard in china gb 50021 2001 however it should be noted that compared with non liquefied seabed soil the submerged unit weight of post liquefied soil is relatively bigger indicating a denser soil structure created by re compaction after wave induced liquefaction the same phenomenon can also be found in permeability between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed soils the particle size distributions of seabed soil with various burial depths are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the soil particles in post liquefied area are generally finer than in non liquefied area however based on numerous statistical results ma et al 2015 reported that compared with non liquefied seabed soil the clay content of seabed soil in post liquefied area has reduced the median diameter d50 has increased and the sorting has become better and better after previous wave induced liquefaction 2 2 testing program the detailed testing program is presented in table 2 as may be noted two kinds of experiment are conducted on natural seabed soils conventional static triaxial test is used to explore the post liquefaction re compaction effect on undrained shear behavior of seabed soil and cyclic triaxial test is conducted to evaluate the effect on cyclic behavior of seabed soil the gcts i e geotechnical consulting and testing systems automatic pneumatic soil triaxial system is adopted for the testing program fig 5 wang et al 2015 had used this device to investigate the post liquefaction behavior of low plasticity silt in mississippi river this system provides the necessary versatility to easily perform dynamic tests for liquefaction resilient modulus and cyclic strength and incorporates high resolution control of the pneumatic loader allowing it to obtain clear stress strain curves and apply load at very low rates both monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on samples with 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height firstly a cylindrical soil block with dimensions of 100 mm 150 mm was cut out carefully from a plastic sampling pipe with a diameter of 100 mm using the method of manual sawing after that in order to reduce sample disturbance a wire saw was utilized to trim the specimen into the required dimensions 50 mm 100 mm of the triaxial apparatus very slowly the prepared specimens were saturated firstly in the vacuum pumping equipment and then transferred into the triaxial cell to further increase its degree of saturation full saturation was confirmed by measuring the skempton s b value which was required to be greater than 0 95 in this study after saturation the samples were isotropically consolidated under an effective confining stress the consolidation process could be completed in 4 h in the present study it is well known that the undrained shear strength of soil was strain rate dependent graham et al 1983 the undrained monotonic compression in the present study was conducted by displacement controlled shearing with 0 25 min which was deemed to be suitable in analyzing the behavior of marine soil under field conditions such as spud driving and pulling process of mobile offshore drilling platform and fast installation processes involved in pile foundation sudan and sachan 2016 the monotonic test will be terminated when axial strain reached 20 in terms of cyclic triaxial test a frequency of symmetrically cyclic stress with a sine function of 0 2 hz which was used to simulate the wave loading term in the yellow river delta was applied by servo motor the cyclic tests were terminated when the single amplitude axial strain reached 5 hu et al 2010 initial states of stress and the cyclic stress ratios csr i e ratio of cyclic deviator stress to twice effective confining pressure investigated are listed in table 2 additionally table 2 also summarizes the test scheme and the number of cycles n at which the cyclic tests are terminated some representative images of samples before and after triaxial test could be found in fig 6 3 monotonic shear behaviour of marine silty soils results of monotonic shear tests of marine silts in the yellow river delta are presented in fig 7 in the form of plots of deviator stress q versus axial strain ε a excess pore water pressure δu versus axial strain ε a and mean effective stress p versus deviator stress q where p σ 1 2σ 3 3 and q σ 1 σ 3 as it can be observed a point of flexure exists at a relatively low axial strain about 2 in the stress strain plots of marine silts in non liquefied state which is followed by hardening up to the axial strain of 20 where critical state occurs approximately without a clear peak is being reached however for post liquefied case the stress strain curves of marine silts exhibit apparent strain softening characteristics the deviator stress reaches a peak value which is much higher than the shear strength in non liquefied area and the corresponding axial strain is generally bigger than 7 indicating that due to re compaction after wave induced liquefaction on seabed submarine silt in post liquefied area becomes more and more resistant to further shear loading while the shear failure mode transforms from plastic to brittle pattern similar observations were made by wang et al 2015 on remoulded mississippi river silt as indicated by hyde et al 2007 low plasticity silt will become denser than initial condition after reconsolidation due to cyclic loading meanwhile soil microstructure will change accordingly after liquefaction wang and wei 2016 in view of this the change in shear behavior of seabed silt in post liquefied area may be attributed to the increase in soil density see table 1 and the change of soil fabric ma et al 2015 fig 7 b displays the excess pore water pressure generation during monotonic shearing as shown the excess pore water pressure increases quickly in the beginning and then slightly afterwards to a steady value for seabed silt in non liquefied area indicating a continuous compression during shearing stage for post liquefied seabed silt subsequent to an initial contractive response the specimen exhibits significant dilation upon continued shearing resulting in negative excess pore water pressures at the end of the monotonic test the corresponding phase transformation i e compressive to dilative behavior begins at around 3 axial strain the effective stress paths esp of monotonic compression test are illustrated in fig 7 c as shown the esp shapes of seabed silt collected from the same submarine area under various confining pressures are similar while the esp variations are totally different between non liquefied and post liquefied state for seabed silt for the non liquefied case the effective stress paths first rise nearly along a straight line with a slope of about 3 90 followed by a slight trend of leftward concave after that the stress paths continue to increase progressively before reaching the critical state in terms of post liquefied case there is a slight deviation for the stress paths compared to non liquefied ones until the first phase transformation point i e dilation to contraction of non liquefied seabed soil as the shear strength increasing further the stress path of post liquefied seabed silt rises to higher level with a continuous decreasing slope until a peak value is being reached and the slope of the peak line is about 1 61 it then turns right and declines quickly before approaching the critical state line the unique stress path behavior is different from that of typical clays and sands while it is similar to some undrained behaviors of overconsolidated silty and clayey soils qian et al 2019 indicating an overconsolidation effect in seabed silt induced by re compaction after previous wave liquefaction in the yellow river delta 4 cyclic behaviour of seabed silt 4 1 accumulative behavior of pore water pressure during cyclic loading the developments of pore water pressure with number of cycles n for non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are illustrated in fig 8 where δu corresponds to the peak value of each cycle generally the similar development mode of pore water pressure can be found between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts i e in initial cyclic loading stage the pore pressure of seabed silt rises quickly and then more slowly even under some cyclic stress ratios csr it tends to approach a steady value finally moreover there is still a general trend that as csr increases the pore pressure of seabed silt develops more dramatically some of the scatter in fig 8 c and d may arise from heterogeneity or inevitable disturbance of seabed specimen berre 2014 what deserves to be mentioned is that except the cases of non liquefied silt with csr 0 20 and post liquefied silt with csr 0 50 under σ v 20 kpa the pore pressures of the other submarine silts can t reach the initial effective confining pressures within 5 axial strain indicating that strain criterion may be more suitable in evaluating the liquefaction potential of seabed silt in the yellow river delta from an engineering point of view holzer and youd 2007 the variations of pore water pressure with number of cycles n under the similar csrs and confining pressures for non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are presented in fig 8 e and f although it is not very convenient to differentiate the pore pressure development characteristics between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts because strain criterion is adopted in liquefaction tests there is a general trend that the pore pressures of post liquefied seabed silt accumulate more slowly than non liquefied one which means that according to pore pressure criterion the seabed silts collected from submarine post liquefied area are less susceptible to liquefaction than them in non liquefied area in other words after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction the liquefaction resistance of seabed silt is enhanced to some extent which is also consistent to the monotonic test results as shown in fig 7 a in view of the above described events there is a close relationship between pore pressure δu and number of cycles n for seabed silts under cyclic loading an empirical model is always needed to quantify the relationship in the work of simulation analysis in the present study a widely used hyperbolic model originally proposed by ohara and matsuda 1988 is adopted here to describe the quantitative relationship of pore pressure δu with n for seabed silts in the yellow river delta it is expressed as the following equation 1 δ u σ v n a b n where δu is the pore water pressure σ v is the effective confining pressure a and b are model parameters which can be related to cyclic stress cyclic strain confining pressure loading frequency ocr and plasticity index matasovic and vucetic 1995 ren et al 2018b the empirical relationships between pore pressure δu and number of cycles n for seabed silts obtained by hyperbolic model are given in fig 9 as shown in light of the high goodness of fit the hyperbolic model can be applied for natural seabed silt in the yellow river delta 4 2 accumulative behavior of axial strain during cyclic loading in fig 10 the accumulations of axial strain with number of cycles n for seabed silt in the yellow river delta are illustrated where γcy corresponds to the peak value of each cycle as shown the axial strain γcy increases nonlinearly with n during cyclic loading and the higher the csr is the quicker is the accumulation rate of γcy for most cases it is noted that the development mode of axial strain γcy during cyclic loading for seabed silt can be generally classified into two categories zheng et al 2013 a destructive type and b growth type for destructive type there is a clear inflexion on the axial strain accumulative curve meaning that the axial strain increases very slowly before the inflexion afterwards an abrupt increase of axial strain occurs in contrast to destructive type the growth type indicates that the axial strain rises rapidly at the beginning of cyclic loading and then increases in a reduced growth rate with the further increase of n in the present study the variation curves of axial strain with n for seabed silt in non liquefied area with csr 0 20 and 0 45 belong to destructive type and the others conform to growth type moreover it is worth noticing that with the increase of csr there is general trend that the development mode of axial strain γcy transforms from destructive to growth type sağlam and bakır 2014 the variations of axial strain γcy with number of cycles n under the similar csrs and confining pressures for non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are shown in fig 10 e and f similar to pore water pressure case more cycles are required for seabed silt in post liquefied area to reach the same axial strain during cyclic loading than that in non liquefied area indicating an improvement in soil liquefaction resistance after wave induced liquefaction too following the same principles in building pore pressure development model various empirical models have also been proposed to describe the accumulative behavior of axial strain γcy with number of cycles n during cyclic loading abdelkrim et al 2003 ren et al 2018a however the most widely used is the following power model monismith et al 1975 2 γcy a n b where γcy is the cumulative axial strain after n cycles a and b are coefficients that are functions of applied stress and material characteristics in the present study the relationship between cumulative axial strain γcy and number of cycles n is modelled by the power model and the modelling results are illustrated in fig 11 it can be observed that the modelling results accord well with the cyclic test data indicating the power model can be also applied in natural seabed silts in the yellow river delta to describe the accumulation characteristics of axial strain γcy with n based on a summarization of cyclic loading test results it is clear that there is a definite hyperbolic relationship between pore pressure δu and number of cycles n and a clear power relationship of axial strain γcy with n for seabed silt in the yellow river delta in view of this it can be postulated that there will be an empirical relationship existing between pore pressure δu and axial strain γcy ren et al 2018a using n as an intermediate variable the following empirical model can be built 3 δ u σ v γ c y b a c γ c y b where a b and c are model coefficients that are functions of applied stress and material characteristics fig 12 presents the comparisons between model fitting results and experimental data in δu γcy relationship as can be seen the pattern of δu γcy curves in fig 12 is nicely captured by the model shown in equation 3 4 3 comparisons of liquefaction resistance between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts recall that after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction the seabed silt in post liquefied area possesses stronger liquefaction resistance than non liquefied seabed silt based on both pore pressure and axial strain criteria in order to get a more visual insight into the effect comparative results of cyclic stress ratio csr versus number of cycles n under various effective confining pressures between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are presented in fig 13 it is apparent that with the increase of csr the number of cycles n required to reach liquefaction reduces nonlinearly for both non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts however under the same csr many more cycles n are needed before liquefaction for post liquefied seabed silt compared to non liquefied silt indicating a definite enhancement in liquefaction resistance which can also be attributed to the changes in soil structure density and particle compositions for post liquefied seabed silts after wave induced liquefaction ma et al 2015 in addition it should be noted that the curve of csr n for post liquefied seabed silt degrades more slowly in comparison to non liquefied case and the so called threshold csr moses et al 2003 is also elevated to some extent by re compaction after previous liquefaction this finding is very meaningful in the design activity of offshore platform foundation but more research work is needed on this topic the study of soil behavior after liquefaction has been a research hotspot in the field of geotechnical engineering in recent years ajmera 2015 the offshore seabed soil is persistently subjected to the wave loading of different periods and amplitudes so the stress histories it undergoes are very complicated paramasivam and banerjee 2017 e g repeated liquefaction repeated recompression and reconsolidation and so on due to many limitations the mechanical behavior of seabed soil after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction is very rarely investigated yang et al 2018 in the present study the preliminary research results indicate that the re compaction after wave induced liquefaction has significant effects on the static and dynamic mechanical behavior of seabed silt considering that various engineering activities are widely distributed in offshore areas e g offshore oil and gas platforms submarine pipelines cables etc in addition the complex and variable stress history loading combinations on seabed cannot be completely simulated by indoor physical model test and numerical simulation analysis yang et al 2018 therefore more in situ tests and laboratory experiments on undisturbed seabed soil are essential for more accurate evaluation of its mechanical characteristics which helps to deepen the understanding of the influence of stress history on the mechanical behavior of soil and it is also very meaningful in predicting the long term mechanical properties of it shi et al 2017 5 conclusions the post liquefaction re compacted submarine strata are widely distributed in the yellow river subaqueous delta where offshore oil and gas exploration activities are frequent comparative studies on the monotonic and cyclic behaviours between non liquefied and post liquefied intact seabed silts were conducted for the first time through laboratory triaxial tests in the present study based on the analysis of test results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction process the static shear strength of seabed silt was enhanced to some extent and the corresponding shear failure mode may transform from plastic to brittle pattern however more research was needed to further ascertain the effect of post liquefaction re compaction process on the mechanical behaviors of seabed silt quantitatively 2 the monotonic shear behavior of post liquefied seabed silt exhibited an overconsolidation characteristic in comparison to non liquefied silt 3 the development of pore water pressure of seabed silt in non liquefied and post liquefied areas could both be characterized by hyperbolic model while the pore pressure of post liquefied seabed silt accumulated more slowly than non liquefied silt under the same condition 4 the dynamic axial strain of both non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts developed with number of cycles n in a power way while the growth rate of axial strain of post liquefied seabed silt was much smaller than non liquefied silt under the same condition 5 there was a definite empirical relationship between pore water pressure and dynamic axial strain for seabed silt in the yellow river delta 6 compared with non liquefied case an apparent improvement in liquefaction resistance could be expected due to re compaction after wave induced liquefaction in post liquefied seabed and the threshold csr increased too for post liquefied seabed silt in summary the results presented in this paper indicated an apparent influence of post liquefaction re compaction process on the static and cyclic behaviors of natural seabed silty soils in the yellow river delta they provided an excellent reference in the research area about mechanical behavior of soil experiencing previous cyclic loading history and also a good guide in the design and maintenance of platform foundations submarine pipelines and cables and other projects in offshore oil and gas development activities in the yellow river delta on the basis of accumulating more relevant research results in the future it may be feasible to establish empirical prediction models to predict the evolution of soil mechanical properties under long term complex wave loading history these models could be applied in numerical simulation analysis such as ocean engineering stability analysis under complex wave loading conditions and the simulation results could in turn guide the practice although this study was limited to the yellow river delta the research results could also provide good references for the study of wave induced liquefaction characteristics of seabed soil in other coastal areas

22292,re compaction process after previous liquefaction exerts significant effects on subsequent cyclic behaviour of soil due to the complexities in environmental loading conditions the relevant studies on this topic are limited in this paper we collected natural submarine silts from non liquefied and post liquefied seabed in the yellow river subaqueous delta via offshore hydraulic sampling method respectively monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted between them to investigate the re compaction effect after previous wave induced liquefaction on the undrained static and cyclic shear behaviours of seabed soil our experiments indicated that due to re compaction process the static and cyclic strengths of seabed silt in post liquefied area are both enhanced in comparison to non liquefied soil a transformation in static shear failure mode from plastic to brittle after wave induced liquefaction could be identified in seabed silt furthermore the developments of pore water pressure and cyclic axial strain with number of cycles for seabed silts could be characterized by the hyperbolic and power models respectively and an empirical relationship between pore water pressure and cyclic axial strain is proposed for natural seabed silt finally compared with non liquefied seabed silt the threshold cyclic stress ratio csr for post liquefied seabed silt is also elevated due to re compaction effect keywords natural seabed silt post liquefaction behaviour re compaction wave loading yellow river delta 1 introduction with the relentless rise of word energy consumption offshore geotechnical practice related to marine oil and gas exploration and production has grown rapidly over the last 40 years randolph et al 2005 2011 for this reason more and more attentions have been paid to investigate the cyclic behaviour of marine soil supporting the offshore structures subjected to wave loading due to the unique physical properties e g high water content and void ratio and low relative density marine soil commonly exhibits an apparent degradation of stiffness under long term wave loading and even can be liquefied under some extreme circumstances i e storm wave or earthquake prior et al 1986 zen and yamazaki 1991 paramasivam and banerjee 2017 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 considering the episodic nature of wave loading it is inevitable to reconsolidate for seabed soil to a new stable or meta stable state between sequences of wave white et al 2013 in addition the wave induced densification on seabed during reconsolidation also cannot be ignored zen and yamazaki 1990 miyamoto et al 2004 sumer et al 2006 xu et al 2016 hence research on re compaction effect including reconsolidation and wave induced densification functions on cyclic behavior of seabed soil after liquefaction is warranted as illustrated in fig 1 reconsolidation progress can be marked as a specified stress path after previous cyclic loading during reconsolidation the excess pore pressure induced by previous cyclic loading dissipates gradually and soil will be densified again el sekelly et al 2016 due to the variation of soil state the resistance of it to re liquefaction will change accordingly much research has been conducted to elucidate the reconsolidation effect on subsequent cyclic response of soil subjected to earthquake loading for sand low levels of prior seismic strain history generally play a positive effect on subsequent cyclic behaviour after reconsolidation while large strains induced by previous cyclic loading will produce lower resistances to pore pressure generation finn et al 1970 seed et al 1977 ishihara and okada 1982 porcino et al 2009 wahyudi et al 2014 actually under prior small amplitude of cyclic loading sand may become denser or the interlocking of the particles in the original structure transfers into a more stable state due to elimination of small local instabilities at the contact points seed et al 1977 in contrast large strain may damage the intact condition of sand and incur weak zones in the soil due to uneven densification ishihara and okada 1982 in order to differentiate the diverse function between small and large prior cyclic strains the so called phase transformation pt line theory was adopted by ishihara and okada 1978 in their research a reduction of the resistance to future liquefaction is expected when previous cyclic loading stress path crosses the phase transformation pt line while a positive effect could be obtained if not passing the line anyway it should be noted that the function of reconsolidation may not fully remedy the damage to the cyclic strength of sand induced by prior large strains due to the bonding forces between soil particles and the overall structure effect sorensen et al 2007 the post cyclic behaviour of cohesive soil exhibits more complexly than sand yasuhara et al 1992 for normally consolidated cohesive soil hyde et al 2007 indicated that the soil skeleton of remoulded silt will be densified after post cyclic reconsolidation and the post drainage cyclic strength of it will increase with initial anisotropically consolidated ratio however this silt can still be liquefied by aftershocks comparing undrained shear behaviour between pre and post cyclic loading wang et al 2015 found that the shear strength and stiffness of mississippi river silt rise steadily with an increase of the degree of reconsolidation and the slopes of csl of silt before and after cyclic loading are different due to the change in the microstructure of silt for overconsolidated cohesive soil the dissipation of negative pore pressure after pre cyclic loading will lead to swelling and therefore a reduction of post cyclic undrained static strength bishop and henkel 1953 actually for marine sediments on active margins the post cyclic shear strength can also be elevated apparently by reconsolidation after earthquake resulting in lower frequency of submarine landslide sawyer and devore 2015 in addition to earthquake coastal marine sediments always suffer long term wave loading with different amplitudes in that case marine sediment may experience the circles of post liquefaction and re consolidation processes as indicated in fig 1 nevertheless the unique stress history will exert some effects on subsequent mechanical behaviour of marine sediments yang et al 2018 however the relevant studies are very limited at present a novel hyperbolic model had been proposed by ren et al 2018 b to predict the development of undrained pore pressure of soft marine clay under long term low cyclic loads but the effect of stress history was not included in the model paramasivam and banerjee 2017 made an attempt to study the variation of post cyclic undrained shear strength of reconstituted marine clay specimens with the cyclic loading conditions namely staged cyclic loading and continuous cyclic loading it was found that the post cyclic undrained strength and stiffness of marine clay were greatly influenced by the cyclic loading condition and reconsolidation after cyclic loading however due to the limitations of specimen numerous cyclic triaxial test results in terms of remoulded or reconstituted specimens may not truly represent the effect of post liquefaction re compaction on cyclic behavior of natural marine soil apart from cyclic loading tests some physical model experiments have also been conducted to clarify the wave induced liquefaction and reconsolidation processes in seabed jia et al 2014 liu et al 2017a for example zen and yamazaki 1990 presented that in addition to wave induced cyclic shear stress the densification in seabed could also be caused by the vertical oscillation of water pressure through an one dimensional cylinder test apparatus sumer et al 2006 indicated that the liquefaction process of seabed induced by wave loading in a wave flume may be divided into six sequences and re compaction or re solidification phenomenon occurs in stage five actually a substantial amount of research has been carried out on the sequences of wave induced liquefaction process in seabed by sumer s research group through wave flume tests sumer et al 2005 2012 kirca et al 2013 and a summary of recent advances could be found in his book sumer 2014 similarly xu et al 2016 also found that silty sediment could be liquefied by wave movement and after liquefaction sedimentary strata is re stratified and a new stable structure of post liquefied sediment can be built due to oscillation and fluctuation of soil particles with wave movement for the above cases it may be conceived that the new sediment structure originated from re compaction or re solidification after wave induced liquefaction will definitely influence the subsequent cyclic behaviour of seabed soil due to the extremely complex wave loading conditions in nature the laboratory wave flume test results may not fully capture the liquefaction process of seabed in that case a large number of field studies have also been conducted to investigate the development of excess pore water pressure in seabed and submarine sediment transport induced by wave bennett 1977 prior et al 1989 schultheiss 1990 in the yellow river subaqueous delta jia s research group has also published many research papers on the phenomenon of wave induced sediment erosion and re suspension zhang et al 2018 jia et al 2019 however their research mainly focuses on the in situ monitoring of sediment responses to wave loading and the corresponding physical mechanism very limited work has been done to investigate the effect of re compaction after wave induced liquefaction on cyclic behavior of marine soil as a very important offshore oil and gas production area of china yellow river subaqueous delta distributes a large number of submarine cables and pipelines and some of them had been broken due to wave induced liquefaction in seabed during storm for practical purposes it is vital to evaluate the mechanical behavior of seabed soil undergone previous wave loading process which essentially belongs to the research area about the effect of previous cyclic loading history on subsequent static or cyclic behaviors of soil as discussed above there are many limits existing in this area while the wave liquefied seabed in the yellow river subaqueous delta provides a very good opportunity to conduct research on this topic from a more realistic perspective main objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of re compaction after liquefaction on the cyclic behavior of seabed soil in the yellow river delta through laboratory cyclic triaxial tests specially in the present study a representative area of wave induced liquefaction in silty seabed was identified at first through shallow seismic profile investigation in the yellow river subaqueous delta after that natural seabed silts were collected via offshore hydraulic sampling method from the post liquefied and its adjacent non liquefied seabed respectively among the natural seabed soils specimens sampled in post liquefied seabed were deemed as the case suffered from re compaction after previous wave induced liquefaction while the others were used for comparisons monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were then conducted between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts to investigate the post liquefaction re compaction effect on the undrained static and cyclic shear behaviours of natural seabed soil finally based on the test results some empirical relationships were built to describe the cyclic behaviors of seabed silt in the yellow river subaqueous delta under wave loading and the enhancement effect in re liquefaction resistance caused by re compaction after previous wave induced liquefaction was emphasized specially 2 experimental program 2 1 wave liquefied seabed and material as an important offshore oil and gas enrichment area many geophysical investigations have been conducted in the modern yellow river subaqueous delta fig 2 based on the survey results a number of submarine instable landforms e g shallow landslide pockmark post liquefied stratum and hard crust have been identified the detailed schematic of these instabilities can be found in wang and liu 2016 normally the acoustic recordings in non liquefied seabed sediment show some certain regularity while they become messy and unordered in post liquefied submarine stratum fig 3 in this way post liquefied seabed can be easily depicted in the study area fig 2 through shallow stratigraphic profile investigation according to sun et al 2008 storm induced liquefaction is deemed as the primary cause to create such submarine disturbed stratum in this area the similar research conclusions could also be found in many other literatures prior et al 1989 xu et al 2012 2016 wang and liu 2016 hence it provides an excellent chance to investigate the re compaction effect after previous wave induced liquefaction on subsequent cyclic behaviour of natural seabed soil it should be noted that based on statistic data the wave height length and period are 2 0m 40m 5 0s and 6 7m 88m 8 6s for 1 year and 50 year return period in the study area respectively wang and liu 2016 soils tested in the present study were collected from the post liquefied and its adjacent non liquefied seabed in the yellow river subaqueous delta respectively fig 3 presents the corresponding sedimentary profiles obtained from shallow stratigraphic section investigation compared with the circumjacent non liquefied stratum the post liquefied area could be clearly identified in fig 3 b through the red dash line as shown the maximum wave liquefied depth is about 4 5m below the seabed and the sampling borehole zk 3 covers almost the whole liquefied layer in depth specially the hydraulic method was used to sample undisturbed seabed silty soil in the present study the sampler is a composite sampler using plastic inner cylinders with a diameter of 100 mm during sampling the displacement method is used wherein the sampler is pushed down to the desired sampling depth without pre augering following strict operational procedures the sampling method can be considered appropriate in sampling undisturbed silty soils in the yellow river delta the sampling tubes with 100 mm in diameter were sawed into several subsections in the field and then wax sealed instantly before shipping to the laboratory during the preparation work of triaxial specimens in the laboratory we collected the soil that had been trimmed from undisturbed specimen for basic physical properties determination the density of sample can be calculated based on the weight of a standard cylinder triaxial specimen 50 mm 100 mm following chinese national standard for soil testing method gb t50123 1999 the index properties of natural submarine soil were measured and listed in table 1 as indicated by wen et al 2007 the national standard of china is very similar to the related standards of astm it should be noted however that in chinese national standard the liquid plastic combined testing method which is actually a kind of penetration method was used to measure atterberg limits of seabed soil specially in this method a cone with an angle of 30 and total mass of 76g is firstly suspended above but just in contact with the sample then the cone is permitted to fall freely into the sample within 5s after that the water content of the soil sample adjacent to the tip of the cone is measured the water content corresponding to cone penetrations of 17 mm and 2 mm defines the liquid limit and plastic limit respectively andrade et al 2011 liu et al 2017b the choice of 17 mm and 2 mm penetration depths as threshold limit values is based on a large of number of statistical analyses of shear strength testing results on various soils in china to guarantee that the present test results are equivalent to that obtained through traditional atterberg method wen et al 2007 generally as presented in table 1 the index properties of specimens between non liquefied and post liquefied areas in the yellow river subaqueous delta are similar and the seabed soil in the present study belongs to silt according to the soil classification standard in china gb 50021 2001 however it should be noted that compared with non liquefied seabed soil the submerged unit weight of post liquefied soil is relatively bigger indicating a denser soil structure created by re compaction after wave induced liquefaction the same phenomenon can also be found in permeability between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed soils the particle size distributions of seabed soil with various burial depths are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the soil particles in post liquefied area are generally finer than in non liquefied area however based on numerous statistical results ma et al 2015 reported that compared with non liquefied seabed soil the clay content of seabed soil in post liquefied area has reduced the median diameter d50 has increased and the sorting has become better and better after previous wave induced liquefaction 2 2 testing program the detailed testing program is presented in table 2 as may be noted two kinds of experiment are conducted on natural seabed soils conventional static triaxial test is used to explore the post liquefaction re compaction effect on undrained shear behavior of seabed soil and cyclic triaxial test is conducted to evaluate the effect on cyclic behavior of seabed soil the gcts i e geotechnical consulting and testing systems automatic pneumatic soil triaxial system is adopted for the testing program fig 5 wang et al 2015 had used this device to investigate the post liquefaction behavior of low plasticity silt in mississippi river this system provides the necessary versatility to easily perform dynamic tests for liquefaction resilient modulus and cyclic strength and incorporates high resolution control of the pneumatic loader allowing it to obtain clear stress strain curves and apply load at very low rates both monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on samples with 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height firstly a cylindrical soil block with dimensions of 100 mm 150 mm was cut out carefully from a plastic sampling pipe with a diameter of 100 mm using the method of manual sawing after that in order to reduce sample disturbance a wire saw was utilized to trim the specimen into the required dimensions 50 mm 100 mm of the triaxial apparatus very slowly the prepared specimens were saturated firstly in the vacuum pumping equipment and then transferred into the triaxial cell to further increase its degree of saturation full saturation was confirmed by measuring the skempton s b value which was required to be greater than 0 95 in this study after saturation the samples were isotropically consolidated under an effective confining stress the consolidation process could be completed in 4 h in the present study it is well known that the undrained shear strength of soil was strain rate dependent graham et al 1983 the undrained monotonic compression in the present study was conducted by displacement controlled shearing with 0 25 min which was deemed to be suitable in analyzing the behavior of marine soil under field conditions such as spud driving and pulling process of mobile offshore drilling platform and fast installation processes involved in pile foundation sudan and sachan 2016 the monotonic test will be terminated when axial strain reached 20 in terms of cyclic triaxial test a frequency of symmetrically cyclic stress with a sine function of 0 2 hz which was used to simulate the wave loading term in the yellow river delta was applied by servo motor the cyclic tests were terminated when the single amplitude axial strain reached 5 hu et al 2010 initial states of stress and the cyclic stress ratios csr i e ratio of cyclic deviator stress to twice effective confining pressure investigated are listed in table 2 additionally table 2 also summarizes the test scheme and the number of cycles n at which the cyclic tests are terminated some representative images of samples before and after triaxial test could be found in fig 6 3 monotonic shear behaviour of marine silty soils results of monotonic shear tests of marine silts in the yellow river delta are presented in fig 7 in the form of plots of deviator stress q versus axial strain ε a excess pore water pressure δu versus axial strain ε a and mean effective stress p versus deviator stress q where p σ 1 2σ 3 3 and q σ 1 σ 3 as it can be observed a point of flexure exists at a relatively low axial strain about 2 in the stress strain plots of marine silts in non liquefied state which is followed by hardening up to the axial strain of 20 where critical state occurs approximately without a clear peak is being reached however for post liquefied case the stress strain curves of marine silts exhibit apparent strain softening characteristics the deviator stress reaches a peak value which is much higher than the shear strength in non liquefied area and the corresponding axial strain is generally bigger than 7 indicating that due to re compaction after wave induced liquefaction on seabed submarine silt in post liquefied area becomes more and more resistant to further shear loading while the shear failure mode transforms from plastic to brittle pattern similar observations were made by wang et al 2015 on remoulded mississippi river silt as indicated by hyde et al 2007 low plasticity silt will become denser than initial condition after reconsolidation due to cyclic loading meanwhile soil microstructure will change accordingly after liquefaction wang and wei 2016 in view of this the change in shear behavior of seabed silt in post liquefied area may be attributed to the increase in soil density see table 1 and the change of soil fabric ma et al 2015 fig 7 b displays the excess pore water pressure generation during monotonic shearing as shown the excess pore water pressure increases quickly in the beginning and then slightly afterwards to a steady value for seabed silt in non liquefied area indicating a continuous compression during shearing stage for post liquefied seabed silt subsequent to an initial contractive response the specimen exhibits significant dilation upon continued shearing resulting in negative excess pore water pressures at the end of the monotonic test the corresponding phase transformation i e compressive to dilative behavior begins at around 3 axial strain the effective stress paths esp of monotonic compression test are illustrated in fig 7 c as shown the esp shapes of seabed silt collected from the same submarine area under various confining pressures are similar while the esp variations are totally different between non liquefied and post liquefied state for seabed silt for the non liquefied case the effective stress paths first rise nearly along a straight line with a slope of about 3 90 followed by a slight trend of leftward concave after that the stress paths continue to increase progressively before reaching the critical state in terms of post liquefied case there is a slight deviation for the stress paths compared to non liquefied ones until the first phase transformation point i e dilation to contraction of non liquefied seabed soil as the shear strength increasing further the stress path of post liquefied seabed silt rises to higher level with a continuous decreasing slope until a peak value is being reached and the slope of the peak line is about 1 61 it then turns right and declines quickly before approaching the critical state line the unique stress path behavior is different from that of typical clays and sands while it is similar to some undrained behaviors of overconsolidated silty and clayey soils qian et al 2019 indicating an overconsolidation effect in seabed silt induced by re compaction after previous wave liquefaction in the yellow river delta 4 cyclic behaviour of seabed silt 4 1 accumulative behavior of pore water pressure during cyclic loading the developments of pore water pressure with number of cycles n for non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are illustrated in fig 8 where δu corresponds to the peak value of each cycle generally the similar development mode of pore water pressure can be found between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts i e in initial cyclic loading stage the pore pressure of seabed silt rises quickly and then more slowly even under some cyclic stress ratios csr it tends to approach a steady value finally moreover there is still a general trend that as csr increases the pore pressure of seabed silt develops more dramatically some of the scatter in fig 8 c and d may arise from heterogeneity or inevitable disturbance of seabed specimen berre 2014 what deserves to be mentioned is that except the cases of non liquefied silt with csr 0 20 and post liquefied silt with csr 0 50 under σ v 20 kpa the pore pressures of the other submarine silts can t reach the initial effective confining pressures within 5 axial strain indicating that strain criterion may be more suitable in evaluating the liquefaction potential of seabed silt in the yellow river delta from an engineering point of view holzer and youd 2007 the variations of pore water pressure with number of cycles n under the similar csrs and confining pressures for non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are presented in fig 8 e and f although it is not very convenient to differentiate the pore pressure development characteristics between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts because strain criterion is adopted in liquefaction tests there is a general trend that the pore pressures of post liquefied seabed silt accumulate more slowly than non liquefied one which means that according to pore pressure criterion the seabed silts collected from submarine post liquefied area are less susceptible to liquefaction than them in non liquefied area in other words after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction the liquefaction resistance of seabed silt is enhanced to some extent which is also consistent to the monotonic test results as shown in fig 7 a in view of the above described events there is a close relationship between pore pressure δu and number of cycles n for seabed silts under cyclic loading an empirical model is always needed to quantify the relationship in the work of simulation analysis in the present study a widely used hyperbolic model originally proposed by ohara and matsuda 1988 is adopted here to describe the quantitative relationship of pore pressure δu with n for seabed silts in the yellow river delta it is expressed as the following equation 1 δ u σ v n a b n where δu is the pore water pressure σ v is the effective confining pressure a and b are model parameters which can be related to cyclic stress cyclic strain confining pressure loading frequency ocr and plasticity index matasovic and vucetic 1995 ren et al 2018b the empirical relationships between pore pressure δu and number of cycles n for seabed silts obtained by hyperbolic model are given in fig 9 as shown in light of the high goodness of fit the hyperbolic model can be applied for natural seabed silt in the yellow river delta 4 2 accumulative behavior of axial strain during cyclic loading in fig 10 the accumulations of axial strain with number of cycles n for seabed silt in the yellow river delta are illustrated where γcy corresponds to the peak value of each cycle as shown the axial strain γcy increases nonlinearly with n during cyclic loading and the higher the csr is the quicker is the accumulation rate of γcy for most cases it is noted that the development mode of axial strain γcy during cyclic loading for seabed silt can be generally classified into two categories zheng et al 2013 a destructive type and b growth type for destructive type there is a clear inflexion on the axial strain accumulative curve meaning that the axial strain increases very slowly before the inflexion afterwards an abrupt increase of axial strain occurs in contrast to destructive type the growth type indicates that the axial strain rises rapidly at the beginning of cyclic loading and then increases in a reduced growth rate with the further increase of n in the present study the variation curves of axial strain with n for seabed silt in non liquefied area with csr 0 20 and 0 45 belong to destructive type and the others conform to growth type moreover it is worth noticing that with the increase of csr there is general trend that the development mode of axial strain γcy transforms from destructive to growth type sağlam and bakır 2014 the variations of axial strain γcy with number of cycles n under the similar csrs and confining pressures for non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are shown in fig 10 e and f similar to pore water pressure case more cycles are required for seabed silt in post liquefied area to reach the same axial strain during cyclic loading than that in non liquefied area indicating an improvement in soil liquefaction resistance after wave induced liquefaction too following the same principles in building pore pressure development model various empirical models have also been proposed to describe the accumulative behavior of axial strain γcy with number of cycles n during cyclic loading abdelkrim et al 2003 ren et al 2018a however the most widely used is the following power model monismith et al 1975 2 γcy a n b where γcy is the cumulative axial strain after n cycles a and b are coefficients that are functions of applied stress and material characteristics in the present study the relationship between cumulative axial strain γcy and number of cycles n is modelled by the power model and the modelling results are illustrated in fig 11 it can be observed that the modelling results accord well with the cyclic test data indicating the power model can be also applied in natural seabed silts in the yellow river delta to describe the accumulation characteristics of axial strain γcy with n based on a summarization of cyclic loading test results it is clear that there is a definite hyperbolic relationship between pore pressure δu and number of cycles n and a clear power relationship of axial strain γcy with n for seabed silt in the yellow river delta in view of this it can be postulated that there will be an empirical relationship existing between pore pressure δu and axial strain γcy ren et al 2018a using n as an intermediate variable the following empirical model can be built 3 δ u σ v γ c y b a c γ c y b where a b and c are model coefficients that are functions of applied stress and material characteristics fig 12 presents the comparisons between model fitting results and experimental data in δu γcy relationship as can be seen the pattern of δu γcy curves in fig 12 is nicely captured by the model shown in equation 3 4 3 comparisons of liquefaction resistance between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts recall that after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction the seabed silt in post liquefied area possesses stronger liquefaction resistance than non liquefied seabed silt based on both pore pressure and axial strain criteria in order to get a more visual insight into the effect comparative results of cyclic stress ratio csr versus number of cycles n under various effective confining pressures between non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts are presented in fig 13 it is apparent that with the increase of csr the number of cycles n required to reach liquefaction reduces nonlinearly for both non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts however under the same csr many more cycles n are needed before liquefaction for post liquefied seabed silt compared to non liquefied silt indicating a definite enhancement in liquefaction resistance which can also be attributed to the changes in soil structure density and particle compositions for post liquefied seabed silts after wave induced liquefaction ma et al 2015 in addition it should be noted that the curve of csr n for post liquefied seabed silt degrades more slowly in comparison to non liquefied case and the so called threshold csr moses et al 2003 is also elevated to some extent by re compaction after previous liquefaction this finding is very meaningful in the design activity of offshore platform foundation but more research work is needed on this topic the study of soil behavior after liquefaction has been a research hotspot in the field of geotechnical engineering in recent years ajmera 2015 the offshore seabed soil is persistently subjected to the wave loading of different periods and amplitudes so the stress histories it undergoes are very complicated paramasivam and banerjee 2017 e g repeated liquefaction repeated recompression and reconsolidation and so on due to many limitations the mechanical behavior of seabed soil after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction is very rarely investigated yang et al 2018 in the present study the preliminary research results indicate that the re compaction after wave induced liquefaction has significant effects on the static and dynamic mechanical behavior of seabed silt considering that various engineering activities are widely distributed in offshore areas e g offshore oil and gas platforms submarine pipelines cables etc in addition the complex and variable stress history loading combinations on seabed cannot be completely simulated by indoor physical model test and numerical simulation analysis yang et al 2018 therefore more in situ tests and laboratory experiments on undisturbed seabed soil are essential for more accurate evaluation of its mechanical characteristics which helps to deepen the understanding of the influence of stress history on the mechanical behavior of soil and it is also very meaningful in predicting the long term mechanical properties of it shi et al 2017 5 conclusions the post liquefaction re compacted submarine strata are widely distributed in the yellow river subaqueous delta where offshore oil and gas exploration activities are frequent comparative studies on the monotonic and cyclic behaviours between non liquefied and post liquefied intact seabed silts were conducted for the first time through laboratory triaxial tests in the present study based on the analysis of test results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 after wave induced liquefaction and re compaction process the static shear strength of seabed silt was enhanced to some extent and the corresponding shear failure mode may transform from plastic to brittle pattern however more research was needed to further ascertain the effect of post liquefaction re compaction process on the mechanical behaviors of seabed silt quantitatively 2 the monotonic shear behavior of post liquefied seabed silt exhibited an overconsolidation characteristic in comparison to non liquefied silt 3 the development of pore water pressure of seabed silt in non liquefied and post liquefied areas could both be characterized by hyperbolic model while the pore pressure of post liquefied seabed silt accumulated more slowly than non liquefied silt under the same condition 4 the dynamic axial strain of both non liquefied and post liquefied seabed silts developed with number of cycles n in a power way while the growth rate of axial strain of post liquefied seabed silt was much smaller than non liquefied silt under the same condition 5 there was a definite empirical relationship between pore water pressure and dynamic axial strain for seabed silt in the yellow river delta 6 compared with non liquefied case an apparent improvement in liquefaction resistance could be expected due to re compaction after wave induced liquefaction in post liquefied seabed and the threshold csr increased too for post liquefied seabed silt in summary the results presented in this paper indicated an apparent influence of post liquefaction re compaction process on the static and cyclic behaviors of natural seabed silty soils in the yellow river delta they provided an excellent reference in the research area about mechanical behavior of soil experiencing previous cyclic loading history and also a good guide in the design and maintenance of platform foundations submarine pipelines and cables and other projects in offshore oil and gas development activities in the yellow river delta on the basis of accumulating more relevant research results in the future it may be feasible to establish empirical prediction models to predict the evolution of soil mechanical properties under long term complex wave loading history these models could be applied in numerical simulation analysis such as ocean engineering stability analysis under complex wave loading conditions and the simulation results could in turn guide the practice although this study was limited to the yellow river delta the research results could also provide good references for the study of wave induced liquefaction characteristics of seabed soil in other coastal areas

22293,this study presents the experimental results of 31 cantilevered flexible circular cylinders subjected to vortex induced vibrations with different materials diameters and lengths diameter and length ranges are 1 56 mm d 3 19 mm and 30 cm l 40 cm respectively tested materials are aluminum bronze copper and stainless steel a total of 1905 experimental points were obtained and processed with

results illustrate the existence of four different groups corresponding to different maximum amplitude behaviors as some of these behaviors are not yet reported in the literature each branch is distinguished and explained in detail one group presents two local maximum amplitudes and the global maximum is not located in the initial branch as usually expected in order to classify all the groups several parameters were analyzed the slope of reduced velocity vs reynolds number resulted in the best parameter this parameter and therefore the classification of a given cylinder can be

flexible structures subjected to fluid movement bridges transmission lines marine risers buildings chimneys among others viv could cause structural collapse attributable to fatigue damage the estimation of response amplitudes is important to avoid such problems and associated costs structural damage is not the only reason for studying this phenomenon a positive effect is also explored which consists of energy harvesting from viv an example of this is the recent research of viv resonant wind generators recent works on this field include the response of a cylinder undergoing viv the research reported by hsieh et al 2017 williamson and govardhan 2008 yu et al 2018 offer a well summarized literature review on theoretical and experimental research on this area the former hsieh et al 2017 gives particular attention to flow characteristics in the initial branch experiments are carried out using high resolution piv coupled with visualization techniques the formation of oblique jets streams of flow with high velocity and its influence on important variables during vibration are important discernments reported in this field the dynamic response of flexible cylinders in the in line and cross flow directions was reported by seyed aghazadeh and modarres sadeghi 2016 focused on a new technique to reconstruct the viv response from a limited number of experimental points the experimental results are given for a certain range of reduced velocity and re and include fluid forces phase difference and trajectories of motion the reconstruction technique was verified and compared with a conventional one showing significant effectiveness in wu et al 2016 the authors investigated the in line and cross flow vortex shedding forces interaction of a bare flexible cylinder using experimental data for different flow conditions results show that the trajectory of phase angles influences the hydrodynamic force coefficients xu et al 2018c give a good review regarding studies focused on multiple flexible cylinders they present flow induced vibration on three and four cylinder systems in a side by side arrangement varying re from 800 to 16 000 the experimental results are different for the two configurations regarding the maximum rms displacement amplitudes dominant frequencies and modes among others the displacement amplitudes and vibration frequencies of a flexible cylinder undergoing streamwise viv was investigated by xu et al 2018b experimental results are similar to those of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder except that a larger and shifted peak was observed in the second branch xu et al 2018a studied experimentally the flow induced vibrations of two long flexible cylinders in tandem and side by side arrangement the responses and dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder resulted to be poorly affected by the downstream cylinder huera huarte and gharib 2011 shows experimentally the interferences between two circular cylinders undergoing viv for flexible cylinders not in cantilever but pin jointed at the ends meng et al 2017a discussed the internal single phase flow effect on viv a simply supported pipe xie et al 2019 presented a similar work but the internal fluid has a variable density the external viv and the influence of the internal varying fluid density were considered on the viv of the pipe han et al 2018 studied numerically the viv of a cylinder with a fixed mass ratio and range of reduced velocity and compared it with experimental results obtained by jauvtis and williamson 2003 with good results they focused mainly on the lock in state super upper branch and offered results for the trajectory of the cylinder a review on damping parameters is presented by vandiver 2012 in which a dimensionless coefficient c is introduced for modeling viv of cylinders the results show a relationship between the lift coefficient cl the dimensionless response amplitude and the damping parameter this work was used by garcia and bernitsas 2018 to describe the effect of damping on added mass and lift based on three reported techniques including c and experimental data obtained from previous work they found a linear expression for the maximum non dimensional amplitude increasing behavior of the time averaged variable added mass coefficient with increasing damping and the value of oscillation frequency with variable added mass in order to obtain the maximum peak amplitude value yu et al 2018 characterized the responses of viv of a cylinder at low re 75 re 175 for the case of zero mass ratio and zero damping the basic conclusion is that the absolute peak amplitude is obtained for m 0 and xy vibrations similar work was carried out by étienne and pelletier 2012 assuming a zero mass cylinder and zero structural damping to get the low limit of vibrations in terms of re and reduced velocity soti et al 2018 presented experimentally the influence of damping on the viv of a circular cylinder but the mass ratio was fixed at 3 and re was varied from 1 200 to 11 000 the flow power extracted by the damper was also determined to show that higher damping causes a reduction of the synchronization region the data were gathered to plot the peak amplitude response as with the mass damping parameter in a griffin plot maximum power extraction occurs when optimal damping and reduced velocity are combined regarding research on viv of cantilevered flexible circular cylinders although there are few some reports can be summarized meng et al 2017b discussed theoretical studies for a cantilevered pipe carrying fluid and at the same time undergoing viv an elastic beam with fixed bottom was investigated by oviedo tolentino et al 2014 at reduced velocity range in which initial upper and lower branches were observed yamamoto et al 2004 studied numerically viv of a flexible cylinder in uniform flow implementing strip method they used air and the simulation outputs were compared with experimental data from a previous report with good results fujarra et al 2001 performed an experimental investigation of viv of a flexible cantilever with different stiffness they found a similar response for elastically mounted rigid cylinders and a high speed mode of large amplitude response outside the principal synchronization regime as mentioned above energy harvesting is an application of interest in the context of viv some works are based on the conversion of the kinetic energy of water into electrical energy based on viv recently ding et al 2018 presented a good literature review on this field they studied numerically the viv of three cylinders with a surface roughness on a circular cylinder and found among other things that the total converted power increases with reduced velocity pan et al 2017 simulated the performance of a piezoelectric energy harvesting system for powering small sensors a polyvinylidene fluoride beam is utilized for the use of a piezoelectric effect this group carried out experiments at low flow velocities showing good agreement with the simulation data corresponding to output voltages a similar work was presented by zhao et al 2017 in which a piezoelectric electromagnetic hybrid system using a copper cantilever beam is experimentally studied and compared with single piezoelectric or electromagnetic energy harvesters results indicated higher generating efficiency for the hybrid system the effects of water velocity and the diameter of the cylinder are illustrated showing optimum values to obtain maximum output power in the same way mutsuda et al 2017 studied a flexible device that uses piezoelectric layers and elastomer materials to achieve high electric performance and efficiency they analyzed the effect of amplitude frequency and aspect ratio among others in the electric power generated by the device results proved the potential of the highly flexible piezoelectric energy device to convert kinetic energy from viv into useful electrical energy other research efforts are focused on avoiding vibrations due to fatigue issues for instance huera huarte 2014 analyzed the use of splitter plates elastically mounted to the surface of the cylinder amplitudes of flexible cylinders could be reduced up to 90 and drag coefficients up to 50 this kind of device only works with known flow directions another research conducted by cicolin and assi 2017 uses a flexible shroud composed of a flexible net fitted with three dimensional bobbins to avoid vibrations in any direction data demonstrate that peak amplitude can be reduced as much as 40 drag was also reduced during the synchronization zone despite this a flexible shroud has a higher drag coefficient than a bare cylinder thereafter lock in and depending on geometry parameters it can develop an instability most works report similar behaviors regarding the description of the so called branches in general there is evidence of three typical branches to describe the response amplitude the works reported by chang et al 2011 and lee and bernitsas 2011 are examples that show the existence of different branches behavior these are analyzed for surface roughness effects and tested for energy harvesting respectively besides most research works use elastic cylinders in fernandes et al 2014 the vortex self induced vibration vsiv phenomenon was investigated it occurs on steel catenary risers connected to floating platforms in the deep offshore although vsiv is different from viv this work reports different amplitude behaviors varying the keulegan carpenter number despite previous researches a detailed experimental study with flexible cantilevered cylinders has not been done in the present work cylinders with combinations of three lengths three diameters and four materials are analyzed the effect of parameters as m ζ or k among others on maximum amplitude is analyzed by understanding the effect of parameters associated with a cylinder it will be easier to take advantage of the behavior of maximum amplitude outcomes are of concern to the oil industry where avoiding viv is important and energy harvesting in which viv is desirable to produce energy 2 experimental details to study the lock in region and therefore the viv phenomenon cantilevered uniform flexible circular cylinders were used fig 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus it consists of a 19 mm thick solid aluminum plate whose dimensions are shown in the figure to avoid flow perturbations one side was beveled at 30 external lighting was used to assure that the high speed video camera recorded the tip of the cylinder the lighting consisted of two 3 w and 250 lumen led lamps facing each other both pointing to the tip of the cylinder the high speed video camera was an edgertronic it is designed with a specialized 1280 1024 cmos image sensor ultra high speed electronics memory and image processing electronics this camera allows up to 17 791 frames per second at 192 96 pixels resolution a schematic diagram of the entire experimental setup is presented in fig 2 the experimental apparatus was placed in a water tunnel which has a test section of 0 381 m 0 508 m 1 5 m the operating velocity range varies between 0 01 and 0 3 m s levels of turbulence in the test section are less than 1 rms the aluminum plate was placed ensuring the in line flow direction was in the x axis and the cross flow direction corresponded to the y axis to measure the dynamic response of the cylinder the particle tracking velocimetry ptv technique was implemented the ptv technique consists of finding a specific figure in this case the tip of the cylinder represented in fig 3 and track its position along each frame of the video a code in matlab specifically developed for this study computed the x y location coordinates of the tip of the cylinder by using circular hough transform this allows getting the path of the cylinder over time in both axes separately the path can be processed by the discrete fourier transform the fourier analysis converts time into frequency by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies in this way the natural frequency of the system can be determined different cylinders were tested the different combinations of length diameter and material are presented in table 1 the mass ratio defined as the ratio of the cylinder to working fluid densities is used for the experimental campaign several repetitions were carried out according to the physical or geometric parameters for the case of mass m and diameter d three repetitions of each measurement for the damping ratio ζ frequency f w a t e r f v a c u u m and spring coefficient k six experiments were carried out finally each experimental point in the lock in region was repeated five times this means that five videos 8 s each were taken fig 4 illustrates the amplitude vs time corresponding to 5 repetitions for a specific point to obtain the error bars the standard error of the mean sem was used considering all data available to calculate the sem the error for this example is 0 0048 on the other hand if only the five maxima one per each replica values are used the sem is 0 0042 in both cases it is practically negligible considering another example fig 5 where the variability is bigger the sem is 8 1064e 04 if only the five maxima values are considered the sem is 0 0071 both cases are still negligible based on these results the error bars are calculated using the residual standard deviation rsd which uses the difference between predicted and actual values the predicted values are obtained from eq 1 in section 3 to calculate the rsd the expression below is used s r e s y i y e s t 2 n 1 where s r e s is the residual standard deviation y i is the experimental value y e s t is the estimated value and n is the amount of data fig 6 presents the experimental and estimated data corresponding to the case represented in fig 5 using this method the standard error of the residual is calculated by dividing the s r e s by the square root of n the resulting value is 0 0017 also negligible the described procedure was performed for each experimental point 3 analysis approach the mathematical model widely used to represent the cylinder dynamics in vortex induced vibrations is shown in eq 1 1 ρ a 2 w t 2 e i 4 w x 4 f x t with the following boundary conditions w 0 t 0 w x 0 t 0 2 w x 2 l t 0 e i 3 w x 3 l t c w t l t where the solutions are of the form given in eq 2 2 w x t w x e λ t w x is a complex function in general and λ is the eigenvalue of the system which is also complex in general the detailed solution for the free vibration response is carried out in gürgöze and erol 2006 when the beam vibrates at λ frequency the absolute values of w x represent the amplitude distribution over it in this work the amplitude is considered only at the tip of the cylinder i e y e s t w l t in order to solve the natural frequency at the tip of a cantilever cylinder eq 1 was used with its corresponding boundary conditions gürgöze and erol 2006 the eigenvalues are obtained by setting to zero the determinant of the dynamic stiffness matrix det k β μ 0 the dynamic stiffness matrix is shown in eq 3 3 k e i 1 e 2 i β 4 e 1 i β e 2 β e 2 2 i β α f α α α m where β 4 ρ a e i λ 2 β β l μ c λ e i β 3 α f β 3 1 i e 2 β 1 i μ e 2 2 i β 1 i μ μ 4 e 1 i β μ e 2 i β 1 i μ α i β 2 1 e 2 i β 1 e 2 β α m β 1 i 1 i e 2 i β i e 2 β e 2 2 i β where c is a lumped viscous damping parameter that represents the effect of water as the working fluid finally the natural frequencies are obtained by using eq 4 4 ω i 2 β i l 4 e i ρ a l 4 the path followed by the cylinder in x and y axes fig 7 a is processed by the discrete fourier transform the fourier analysis converts time into frequency by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies fig 7b therefore the experimental natural frequencies in both axes are known 4 results and discussion this section presents the experimental results obtained through the synchronization regime for all the cylinders tested by following the procedure described in section 3 the natural frequencies were obtained for the first mode the experimental and calculated values corresponding to natural frequencies in vacuum and water ωv and ωd are presented in table 2 all the cylinders are in their first mode of vibration this can be demonstrated by calculating the eigenvalues from eq 1 in vacuum the fourth boundary condition becomes 3 w x 3 l t 0 and for water remains as e i 3 w x 3 l t c w t l t the maximum amplitude as a function of re is illustrated in fig 8 a b based on the different behavior patterns four different groups are recognized and named groups 1 to 4 fig 8b is presented to point out the difference in magnitude order between the in line and cross flow direction it is important to highlight that in this work the amplitude of the in line oscillations differs by one order of magnitude with the amplitude of the cross flow oscillation which agrees with jauvtis and williamson 2003 therefore the results obtained only consider the cross flow direction results corresponding to the first group can be observed separately in fig 9 they correspond to slender cylinders with 1 58 0 05 mm diameter for the different lengths and materials two different zones or branches characterize this group the initial branch includes the first oscillations of the cylinder until it reaches its maximum amplitude a rapid increase in the amplitude is observed the lower branch includes the points from the maximum amplitude until the cylinder stops oscillating where the amplitude decreases constantly the re vs ay slope is constant the second group fig 10 comprises all ranges of different diameters and lengths this group is the most common amplitude pattern seen in the literature in concordance with cicolin and assi 2017 fujarra et al 2001 oviedo tolentino et al 2014 wang et al 2017 to name some govardhan and williamson 2000 defines this group for cylinders with low mass damping ratios showing three typical branches initial upper and lower according to govardhan and williamson 2000 the frequency of oscillation of the cylinder passes through the natural frequency of the cylinder in water in the transition from initial to upper branch in like manner the frequency of oscillation of the cylinder passes through the natural frequency of the cylinder in vacuum in the transition from upper to lower branch in this work frequency is not used as a way for classifying the branches instead the amplitude is the main criterion for categorizing the branches based on experimental results a slightly different description of the branches is proposed the initial branch which includes the start of the cylinder oscillations and ends at the point of maximum amplitude in this branch the amplitude increases rapidly the upper branch starts at the maximum amplitude and contains all points where the amplitude decreases rapidly at a practically constant slope the lower branch in which a change of slope is observed in the fall of the amplitude slightly lower or even constant until the cylinder stops oscillating the main difference between groups 1 and 2 lies in the behavior after the maximum amplitude is reached for group 1 most of the points in the lower branch fit in a single straight line see fig 11 a for group 2 a straight line with a negative slope can be visualized for points in the upper branch but a change in the slope indicating the beginning of the lower branch can be observed see fig 11b in the previous two groups the maximum amplitude value is always reached somewhere between the natural frequency in vacuum and the natural frequency in the working fluid water in this case an example of this can be seen in fig 11 for each group the maximum marked with an arrow will be named typical maximum hereafter fig 12 illustrates the third group this is characterized by an increase in the amplitude even after the typical maximum value observed in previous groups as well in the literature in general due to the operational limitations of the tunnel the entire lock in region of all the cylinders could not be obtained however the re range obtained is wide and sufficient to classify the data into two branches the initial branch from the starting point of the cylinder oscillations until its typical maximum amplitude is reached between the natural frequency in vacuum and water the final branch from the typical maximum amplitude until the cylinder stops oscillating in this last branch unlike groups 1 and 2 a gradual increase is observed after the typical maximum until it reaches a second maximum a global one in fig 12 for the case of an aluminum cylinder l 40 cm d 2 3 mm the amplitude in this last branch seems similar to a parabola concave downward for the case of the bronze cylinder l 30 cm d 2 3 mm the amplitude increases constantly until it leaves the lock in region similar behavior is found in yamamoto et al 2004 in which theoretically an amplitude that does not follow the classical conduct is reported for a cantilever flexible cylinder vicente ludlam et al 2018 also reported a notably similar behavior although they studied a slender elastically mounted circular cylinder with re ranges from 1500 to 10 000 this remarkable behavior is relevant due to the importance of the maximum global amplitude for some specific applications like harvesting energy it is desirable to have large oscillations the fourth group depicted in fig 13 includes cylinders that exhibit a notorious amplitude peak in the initial branch this peak is consistent with a jump in the response frequency this jump is shown in fig 11d where the vr number decreases its value and then jumps up again following the typical behavior in all cases the jump occurred before the response frequency reaches the natural frequency in the working fluid also in all cases the amplitude returns to normal behavior also before reaching the natural frequency in the working fluid in this group due to the mentioned operational restrictions the entire lock in region could not be achieved nevertheless the peak in the initial branch is clearly shown it is important to highlight that not always based on the experimental results the maximum amplitude is reached at the exact natural frequency in the working fluid or vacuum however in all the cylinders a local maximum exists in the amplitude between natural frequencies to find an adequate parameter for the classification of cylinders into groups 1 to 4 the influence of 15 different parameters were analyzed fig 14 shows the scatter plot matrix for material length diameter and groups represented with colors and markers a good classifying parameter should show as little dispersion as possible for instance focusing attention on the material there are four aluminum bronze copper and stainless steel for material 1 there are four different markers which means that all four groups are scattered here this is repeated for all materials therefore this parameter is not a good parameter to classify the groups otherwise all red circles group 1 would be gathered in a column over material 1 all blue squares over material 2 and so on the same behavior is observed for lengths which are three table 1 in the case of diameter this classifies correctly group 1 but not the other groups it must be clarified that each point represents one cylinder and that they can be overlapped in this figure therefore although the matrix allows appreciating the dispersion of the groups according to the analyzed parameter fig 15 is presented with the same analysis but expanding the points to avoid overlapping and detailing the values of parameters the y axis represents the groups without such overlapping to observe all the cylinders other parameters analyzed were mass damping ratio spring constant natural frequency in vacuum and in water among others figs 16 20 the mass ratio is not shown because is equivalent to fig 15a none of the parameters shown in figs 16 and 17 classifies the groups adequately for the same reasons explained in figs 14 and 15 as in the previous case fig 18 is presented for expanding the points to avoid overlapping and detailing the values of parameters in fig 18 the parameters were calculated considering vacuum values for frequency and damping ratio and without considering the added mass the parameters shown in figs 19 and 20 were calculated considering water as the working fluid however as shown even with these parameters there is not a good classification the analysis corresponding to the slope obtained between vr and re numbers is represented in fig 21 to appreciate the results in a better way in fig 22 a all points have the same height and in fig 22b each group has been separated the classification is almost perfect except for two cylinders a blue square group 2 and a green triangle group 3 located out of their corresponding ranges a closer analysis demonstrates that both cylinders have a jump in frequency which corresponds perfectly with the characteristic behavior of group 4 see fig 23 in fig 23a the cylinder amplitude exhibits behavior as described in group 2 but it shows a jump in frequency and amplitude at the initial branch as described in group 4 similarly in fig 23b the cylinder presents characteristics of group 3 but also shows a jump at the initial branch as group 4 in fig 24 all the cylinders tested are shown in the same plot this time each line represents one cylinder even so the groups are still well classified the cylinders labeled in fig 24 as cylinder a and cylinder b correspond to fig 23a and b respectively the experimental data obtained in this work can be classified according to this parameter as presented in table 3 these ranges are valid for flexible cylinders in cantilever vibrating at their first mode and operational conditions and geometrical ranges specified in section 2 to interpolate the results obtained in this work a 2d polynomial linear fit is presented in fig 25 the curve fitting equation is described by eq 5 with 95 confidence 5 v r re c 0 c 1 ω v c 2 l d the coefficient values are shown in table 4 resulting in a goodness of fit of r2 adj 0 8213 by only knowing the l d ratio and ωv before performing experiments through the entire synchronization zone eq 5 can be used to predict the maximum amplitude behavior for a given cylinder if a certain behavior is more useful for an application then the cylinder can be selected based on the vr re parameter to explain the existence of different groups a more detailed hydrodynamic study is required referring to an study carried out by vicente ludlam et al 2018 in which similar trends was observed first the results were obtained for a slender elastically mounted circular cylinder under the effect of imposed rotation for specific values where an amplitude type similar to group 3 appears f fresp fd reaches a near constant value after vr 10 according to the authors this result reinforces the idea that the cylinder undergoes galloping type oscillations although in the present work the f is also near constant the vr is around 6 for all the groups they conclude that a loss in synchronization between vortex shedding and oscillations is responsible for the distinct amplitude responses however in at least one cylinder included in group 3 this is not the case it is important to highlight the obviously differences between data for a flexible cylinder and for an elastic cylinder besides in this study there is no rotation in the cylinder however the authors mention that when a seems to adopt a quasi linear dependence on the reduced velocity it resembles the dependence of galloping type instability where motion induced forces are dominant in contrast for the case of viv fluid forces are mainly driven by vortex shedding this asseveration could apply to flexible cylinders but more detailed experiments in hydrodynamic response is necessary and still under development 5 conclusions in the present paper the maximum cross flow amplitude of a variety of flexible circular cylinders in cantilever was investigated at low reynolds numbers re 1100 analysis of amplitude and frequency measurements support the following conclusions for the first mode of vibration experimental results demonstrate the existence of four distinct groups corresponding to different behaviors of the maximum amplitude as a function of re o group 1 is observed mainly in the smallest diameter cylinders regardless of height and material it consists only of two branches o group 2 represents the most common response found in the literature it consists of three different branches contrary to the typical classification based in frequency here an amplitude based criterion is proposed o group 3 is rarely described in the literature and as far as the authors are aware no evidence of similar behavior in flexible cylinders has been reported earlier this group consists of two branches and has two local maxima one described in this work as typical maximum and other as global maximum o group 4 is characterized by a jump in frequency which corresponds with a peak in the maximum amplitude in the initial branch this peak is observed even in cylinders from groups 2 and 3 in all cases a local maximum amplitude named here typical maximum occurs at some point between natural frequency in vacuum and natural frequency in the working fluid several parameters were tested to classify the different groups the best results were obtained using the slope between vr and re number ranges corresponding to this slope and respective groups are offered in section 4 besides using a proposed polynomial fit the vr re slope can be calculated using l d and m ζ ratios this allows prediction of the maximum amplitude behavior for a given cylinder before performing any time consuming experiment although some researches have proposed that a loss in synchronization between vortex shedding and oscillations is responsible for the distinct amplitude responses at least in group 3 the hydrodynamics studied so far in this work has not offered conclusive evidence to continue this study the future work should be oriented to complete the hydrodynamic study for all the cylinders in the entire synchronization regime declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the

flexible structures subjected to fluid movement bridges transmission lines marine risers buildings chimneys among others viv could cause structural collapse attributable to fatigue damage the estimation of response amplitudes is important to avoid such problems and associated costs structural damage is not the only reason for studying this phenomenon a positive effect is also explored which consists of energy harvesting from viv an example of this is the recent research of viv resonant wind generators recent works on this field include the response of a cylinder undergoing viv the research reported by hsieh et al 2017 williamson and govardhan 2008 yu et al 2018 offer a well summarized literature review on theoretical and experimental research on this area the former hsieh et al 2017 gives particular attention to flow characteristics in the initial branch experiments are carried out using high resolution piv coupled with visualization techniques the formation of oblique jets streams of flow with high velocity and its influence on important variables during vibration are important discernments reported in this field the dynamic response of flexible cylinders in the in line and cross flow directions was reported by seyed aghazadeh and modarres sadeghi 2016 focused on a new technique to reconstruct the viv response from a limited number of experimental points the experimental results are given for a certain range of reduced velocity and re and include fluid forces phase difference and trajectories of motion the reconstruction technique was verified and compared with a conventional one showing significant effectiveness in wu et al 2016 the authors investigated the in line and cross flow vortex shedding forces interaction of a bare flexible cylinder using experimental data for different flow conditions results show that the trajectory of phase angles influences the hydrodynamic force coefficients xu et al 2018c give a good review regarding studies focused on multiple flexible cylinders they present flow induced vibration on three and four cylinder systems in a side by side arrangement varying re from 800 to 16 000 the experimental results are different for the two configurations regarding the maximum rms displacement amplitudes dominant frequencies and modes among others the displacement amplitudes and vibration frequencies of a flexible cylinder undergoing streamwise viv was investigated by xu et al 2018b experimental results are similar to those of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder except that a larger and shifted peak was observed in the second branch xu et al 2018a studied experimentally the flow induced vibrations of two long flexible cylinders in tandem and side by side arrangement the responses and dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder resulted to be poorly affected by the downstream cylinder huera huarte and gharib 2011 shows experimentally the interferences between two circular cylinders undergoing viv for flexible cylinders not in cantilever but pin jointed at the ends meng et al 2017a discussed the internal single phase flow effect on viv a simply supported pipe xie et al 2019 presented a similar work but the internal fluid has a variable density the external viv and the influence of the internal varying fluid density were considered on the viv of the pipe han et al 2018 studied numerically the viv of a cylinder with a fixed mass ratio and range of reduced velocity and compared it with experimental results obtained by jauvtis and williamson 2003 with good results they focused mainly on the lock in state super upper branch and offered results for the trajectory of the cylinder a review on damping parameters is presented by vandiver 2012 in which a dimensionless coefficient c is introduced for modeling viv of cylinders the results show a relationship between the lift coefficient cl the dimensionless response amplitude and the damping parameter this work was used by garcia and bernitsas 2018 to describe the effect of damping on added mass and lift based on three reported techniques including c and experimental data obtained from previous work they found a linear expression for the maximum non dimensional amplitude increasing behavior of the time averaged variable added mass coefficient with increasing damping and the value of oscillation frequency with variable added mass in order to obtain the maximum peak amplitude value yu et al 2018 characterized the responses of viv of a cylinder at low re 75 re 175 for the case of zero mass ratio and zero damping the basic conclusion is that the absolute peak amplitude is obtained for m 0 and xy vibrations similar work was carried out by étienne and pelletier 2012 assuming a zero mass cylinder and zero structural damping to get the low limit of vibrations in terms of re and reduced velocity soti et al 2018 presented experimentally the influence of damping on the viv of a circular cylinder but the mass ratio was fixed at 3 and re was varied from 1 200 to 11 000 the flow power extracted by the damper was also determined to show that higher damping causes a reduction of the synchronization region the data were gathered to plot the peak amplitude response as with the mass damping parameter in a griffin plot maximum power extraction occurs when optimal damping and reduced velocity are combined regarding research on viv of cantilevered flexible circular cylinders although there are few some reports can be summarized meng et al 2017b discussed theoretical studies for a cantilevered pipe carrying fluid and at the same time undergoing viv an elastic beam with fixed bottom was investigated by oviedo tolentino et al 2014 at reduced velocity range in which initial upper and lower branches were observed yamamoto et al 2004 studied numerically viv of a flexible cylinder in uniform flow implementing strip method they used air and the simulation outputs were compared with experimental data from a previous report with good results fujarra et al 2001 performed an experimental investigation of viv of a flexible cantilever with different stiffness they found a similar response for elastically mounted rigid cylinders and a high speed mode of large amplitude response outside the principal synchronization regime as mentioned above energy harvesting is an application of interest in the context of viv some works are based on the conversion of the kinetic energy of water into electrical energy based on viv recently ding et al 2018 presented a good literature review on this field they studied numerically the viv of three cylinders with a surface roughness on a circular cylinder and found among other things that the total converted power increases with reduced velocity pan et al 2017 simulated the performance of a piezoelectric energy harvesting system for powering small sensors a polyvinylidene fluoride beam is utilized for the use of a piezoelectric effect this group carried out experiments at low flow velocities showing good agreement with the simulation data corresponding to output voltages a similar work was presented by zhao et al 2017 in which a piezoelectric electromagnetic hybrid system using a copper cantilever beam is experimentally studied and compared with single piezoelectric or electromagnetic energy harvesters results indicated higher generating efficiency for the hybrid system the effects of water velocity and the diameter of the cylinder are illustrated showing optimum values to obtain maximum output power in the same way mutsuda et al 2017 studied a flexible device that uses piezoelectric layers and elastomer materials to achieve high electric performance and efficiency they analyzed the effect of amplitude frequency and aspect ratio among others in the electric power generated by the device results proved the potential of the highly flexible piezoelectric energy device to convert kinetic energy from viv into useful electrical energy other research efforts are focused on avoiding vibrations due to fatigue issues for instance huera huarte 2014 analyzed the use of splitter plates elastically mounted to the surface of the cylinder amplitudes of flexible cylinders could be reduced up to 90 and drag coefficients up to 50 this kind of device only works with known flow directions another research conducted by cicolin and assi 2017 uses a flexible shroud composed of a flexible net fitted with three dimensional bobbins to avoid vibrations in any direction data demonstrate that peak amplitude can be reduced as much as 40 drag was also reduced during the synchronization zone despite this a flexible shroud has a higher drag coefficient than a bare cylinder thereafter lock in and depending on geometry parameters it can develop an instability most works report similar behaviors regarding the description of the so called branches in general there is evidence of three typical branches to describe the response amplitude the works reported by chang et al 2011 and lee and bernitsas 2011 are examples that show the existence of different branches behavior these are analyzed for surface roughness effects and tested for energy harvesting respectively besides most research works use elastic cylinders in fernandes et al 2014 the vortex self induced vibration vsiv phenomenon was investigated it occurs on steel catenary risers connected to floating platforms in the deep offshore although vsiv is different from viv this work reports different amplitude behaviors varying the keulegan carpenter number despite previous researches a detailed experimental study with flexible cantilevered cylinders has not been done in the present work cylinders with combinations of three lengths three diameters and four materials are analyzed the effect of parameters as m ζ or k among others on maximum amplitude is analyzed by understanding the effect of parameters associated with a cylinder it will be easier to take advantage of the behavior of maximum amplitude outcomes are of concern to the oil industry where avoiding viv is important and energy harvesting in which viv is desirable to produce energy 2 experimental details to study the lock in region and therefore the viv phenomenon cantilevered uniform flexible circular cylinders were used fig 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus it consists of a 19 mm thick solid aluminum plate whose dimensions are shown in the figure to avoid flow perturbations one side was beveled at 30 external lighting was used to assure that the high speed video camera recorded the tip of the cylinder the lighting consisted of two 3 w and 250 lumen led lamps facing each other both pointing to the tip of the cylinder the high speed video camera was an edgertronic it is designed with a specialized 1280 1024 cmos image sensor ultra high speed electronics memory and image processing electronics this camera allows up to 17 791 frames per second at 192 96 pixels resolution a schematic diagram of the entire experimental setup is presented in fig 2 the experimental apparatus was placed in a water tunnel which has a test section of 0 381 m 0 508 m 1 5 m the operating velocity range varies between 0 01 and 0 3 m s levels of turbulence in the test section are less than 1 rms the aluminum plate was placed ensuring the in line flow direction was in the x axis and the cross flow direction corresponded to the y axis to measure the dynamic response of the cylinder the particle tracking velocimetry ptv technique was implemented the ptv technique consists of finding a specific figure in this case the tip of the cylinder represented in fig 3 and track its position along each frame of the video a code in matlab specifically developed for this study computed the x y location coordinates of the tip of the cylinder by using circular hough transform this allows getting the path of the cylinder over time in both axes separately the path can be processed by the discrete fourier transform the fourier analysis converts time into frequency by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies in this way the natural frequency of the system can be determined different cylinders were tested the different combinations of length diameter and material are presented in table 1 the mass ratio defined as the ratio of the cylinder to working fluid densities is used for the experimental campaign several repetitions were carried out according to the physical or geometric parameters for the case of mass m and diameter d three repetitions of each measurement for the damping ratio ζ frequency f w a t e r f v a c u u m and spring coefficient k six experiments were carried out finally each experimental point in the lock in region was repeated five times this means that five videos 8 s each were taken fig 4 illustrates the amplitude vs time corresponding to 5 repetitions for a specific point to obtain the error bars the standard error of the mean sem was used considering all data available to calculate the sem the error for this example is 0 0048 on the other hand if only the five maxima one per each replica values are used the sem is 0 0042 in both cases it is practically negligible considering another example fig 5 where the variability is bigger the sem is 8 1064e 04 if only the five maxima values are considered the sem is 0 0071 both cases are still negligible based on these results the error bars are calculated using the residual standard deviation rsd which uses the difference between predicted and actual values the predicted values are obtained from eq 1 in section 3 to calculate the rsd the expression below is used s r e s y i y e s t 2 n 1 where s r e s is the residual standard deviation y i is the experimental value y e s t is the estimated value and n is the amount of data fig 6 presents the experimental and estimated data corresponding to the case represented in fig 5 using this method the standard error of the residual is calculated by dividing the s r e s by the square root of n the resulting value is 0 0017 also negligible the described procedure was performed for each experimental point 3 analysis approach the mathematical model widely used to represent the cylinder dynamics in vortex induced vibrations is shown in eq 1 1 ρ a 2 w t 2 e i 4 w x 4 f x t with the following boundary conditions w 0 t 0 w x 0 t 0 2 w x 2 l t 0 e i 3 w x 3 l t c w t l t where the solutions are of the form given in eq 2 2 w x t w x e λ t w x is a complex function in general and λ is the eigenvalue of the system which is also complex in general the detailed solution for the free vibration response is carried out in gürgöze and erol 2006 when the beam vibrates at λ frequency the absolute values of w x represent the amplitude distribution over it in this work the amplitude is considered only at the tip of the cylinder i e y e s t w l t in order to solve the natural frequency at the tip of a cantilever cylinder eq 1 was used with its corresponding boundary conditions gürgöze and erol 2006 the eigenvalues are obtained by setting to zero the determinant of the dynamic stiffness matrix det k β μ 0 the dynamic stiffness matrix is shown in eq 3 3 k e i 1 e 2 i β 4 e 1 i β e 2 β e 2 2 i β α f α α α m where β 4 ρ a e i λ 2 β β l μ c λ e i β 3 α f β 3 1 i e 2 β 1 i μ e 2 2 i β 1 i μ μ 4 e 1 i β μ e 2 i β 1 i μ α i β 2 1 e 2 i β 1 e 2 β α m β 1 i 1 i e 2 i β i e 2 β e 2 2 i β where c is a lumped viscous damping parameter that represents the effect of water as the working fluid finally the natural frequencies are obtained by using eq 4 4 ω i 2 β i l 4 e i ρ a l 4 the path followed by the cylinder in x and y axes fig 7 a is processed by the discrete fourier transform the fourier analysis converts time into frequency by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies fig 7b therefore the experimental natural frequencies in both axes are known 4 results and discussion this section presents the experimental results obtained through the synchronization regime for all the cylinders tested by following the procedure described in section 3 the natural frequencies were obtained for the first mode the experimental and calculated values corresponding to natural frequencies in vacuum and water ωv and ωd are presented in table 2 all the cylinders are in their first mode of vibration this can be demonstrated by calculating the eigenvalues from eq 1 in vacuum the fourth boundary condition becomes 3 w x 3 l t 0 and for water remains as e i 3 w x 3 l t c w t l t the maximum amplitude as a function of re is illustrated in fig 8 a b based on the different behavior patterns four different groups are recognized and named groups 1 to 4 fig 8b is presented to point out the difference in magnitude order between the in line and cross flow direction it is important to highlight that in this work the amplitude of the in line oscillations differs by one order of magnitude with the amplitude of the cross flow oscillation which agrees with jauvtis and williamson 2003 therefore the results obtained only consider the cross flow direction results corresponding to the first group can be observed separately in fig 9 they correspond to slender cylinders with 1 58 0 05 mm diameter for the different lengths and materials two different zones or branches characterize this group the initial branch includes the first oscillations of the cylinder until it reaches its maximum amplitude a rapid increase in the amplitude is observed the lower branch includes the points from the maximum amplitude until the cylinder stops oscillating where the amplitude decreases constantly the re vs ay slope is constant the second group fig 10 comprises all ranges of different diameters and lengths this group is the most common amplitude pattern seen in the literature in concordance with cicolin and assi 2017 fujarra et al 2001 oviedo tolentino et al 2014 wang et al 2017 to name some govardhan and williamson 2000 defines this group for cylinders with low mass damping ratios showing three typical branches initial upper and lower according to govardhan and williamson 2000 the frequency of oscillation of the cylinder passes through the natural frequency of the cylinder in water in the transition from initial to upper branch in like manner the frequency of oscillation of the cylinder passes through the natural frequency of the cylinder in vacuum in the transition from upper to lower branch in this work frequency is not used as a way for classifying the branches instead the amplitude is the main criterion for categorizing the branches based on experimental results a slightly different description of the branches is proposed the initial branch which includes the start of the cylinder oscillations and ends at the point of maximum amplitude in this branch the amplitude increases rapidly the upper branch starts at the maximum amplitude and contains all points where the amplitude decreases rapidly at a practically constant slope the lower branch in which a change of slope is observed in the fall of the amplitude slightly lower or even constant until the cylinder stops oscillating the main difference between groups 1 and 2 lies in the behavior after the maximum amplitude is reached for group 1 most of the points in the lower branch fit in a single straight line see fig 11 a for group 2 a straight line with a negative slope can be visualized for points in the upper branch but a change in the slope indicating the beginning of the lower branch can be observed see fig 11b in the previous two groups the maximum amplitude value is always reached somewhere between the natural frequency in vacuum and the natural frequency in the working fluid water in this case an example of this can be seen in fig 11 for each group the maximum marked with an arrow will be named typical maximum hereafter fig 12 illustrates the third group this is characterized by an increase in the amplitude even after the typical maximum value observed in previous groups as well in the literature in general due to the operational limitations of the tunnel the entire lock in region of all the cylinders could not be obtained however the re range obtained is wide and sufficient to classify the data into two branches the initial branch from the starting point of the cylinder oscillations until its typical maximum amplitude is reached between the natural frequency in vacuum and water the final branch from the typical maximum amplitude until the cylinder stops oscillating in this last branch unlike groups 1 and 2 a gradual increase is observed after the typical maximum until it reaches a second maximum a global one in fig 12 for the case of an aluminum cylinder l 40 cm d 2 3 mm the amplitude in this last branch seems similar to a parabola concave downward for the case of the bronze cylinder l 30 cm d 2 3 mm the amplitude increases constantly until it leaves the lock in region similar behavior is found in yamamoto et al 2004 in which theoretically an amplitude that does not follow the classical conduct is reported for a cantilever flexible cylinder vicente ludlam et al 2018 also reported a notably similar behavior although they studied a slender elastically mounted circular cylinder with re ranges from 1500 to 10 000 this remarkable behavior is relevant due to the importance of the maximum global amplitude for some specific applications like harvesting energy it is desirable to have large oscillations the fourth group depicted in fig 13 includes cylinders that exhibit a notorious amplitude peak in the initial branch this peak is consistent with a jump in the response frequency this jump is shown in fig 11d where the vr number decreases its value and then jumps up again following the typical behavior in all cases the jump occurred before the response frequency reaches the natural frequency in the working fluid also in all cases the amplitude returns to normal behavior also before reaching the natural frequency in the working fluid in this group due to the mentioned operational restrictions the entire lock in region could not be achieved nevertheless the peak in the initial branch is clearly shown it is important to highlight that not always based on the experimental results the maximum amplitude is reached at the exact natural frequency in the working fluid or vacuum however in all the cylinders a local maximum exists in the amplitude between natural frequencies to find an adequate parameter for the classification of cylinders into groups 1 to 4 the influence of 15 different parameters were analyzed fig 14 shows the scatter plot matrix for material length diameter and groups represented with colors and markers a good classifying parameter should show as little dispersion as possible for instance focusing attention on the material there are four aluminum bronze copper and stainless steel for material 1 there are four different markers which means that all four groups are scattered here this is repeated for all materials therefore this parameter is not a good parameter to classify the groups otherwise all red circles group 1 would be gathered in a column over material 1 all blue squares over material 2 and so on the same behavior is observed for lengths which are three table 1 in the case of diameter this classifies correctly group 1 but not the other groups it must be clarified that each point represents one cylinder and that they can be overlapped in this figure therefore although the matrix allows appreciating the dispersion of the groups according to the analyzed parameter fig 15 is presented with the same analysis but expanding the points to avoid overlapping and detailing the values of parameters the y axis represents the groups without such overlapping to observe all the cylinders other parameters analyzed were mass damping ratio spring constant natural frequency in vacuum and in water among others figs 16 20 the mass ratio is not shown because is equivalent to fig 15a none of the parameters shown in figs 16 and 17 classifies the groups adequately for the same reasons explained in figs 14 and 15 as in the previous case fig 18 is presented for expanding the points to avoid overlapping and detailing the values of parameters in fig 18 the parameters were calculated considering vacuum values for frequency and damping ratio and without considering the added mass the parameters shown in figs 19 and 20 were calculated considering water as the working fluid however as shown even with these parameters there is not a good classification the analysis corresponding to the slope obtained between vr and re numbers is represented in fig 21 to appreciate the results in a better way in fig 22 a all points have the same height and in fig 22b each group has been separated the classification is almost perfect except for two cylinders a blue square group 2 and a green triangle group 3 located out of their corresponding ranges a closer analysis demonstrates that both cylinders have a jump in frequency which corresponds perfectly with the characteristic behavior of group 4 see fig 23 in fig 23a the cylinder amplitude exhibits behavior as described in group 2 but it shows a jump in frequency and amplitude at the initial branch as described in group 4 similarly in fig 23b the cylinder presents characteristics of group 3 but also shows a jump at the initial branch as group 4 in fig 24 all the cylinders tested are shown in the same plot this time each line represents one cylinder even so the groups are still well classified the cylinders labeled in fig 24 as cylinder a and cylinder b correspond to fig 23a and b respectively the experimental data obtained in this work can be classified according to this parameter as presented in table 3 these ranges are valid for flexible cylinders in cantilever vibrating at their first mode and operational conditions and geometrical ranges specified in section 2 to interpolate the results obtained in this work a 2d polynomial linear fit is presented in fig 25 the curve fitting equation is described by eq 5 with 95 confidence 5 v r re c 0 c 1 ω v c 2 l d the coefficient values are shown in table 4 resulting in a goodness of fit of r2 adj 0 8213 by only knowing the l d ratio and ωv before performing experiments through the entire synchronization zone eq 5 can be used to predict the maximum amplitude behavior for a given cylinder if a certain behavior is more useful for an application then the cylinder can be selected based on the vr re parameter to explain the existence of different groups a more detailed hydrodynamic study is required referring to an study carried out by vicente ludlam et al 2018 in which similar trends was observed first the results were obtained for a slender elastically mounted circular cylinder under the effect of imposed rotation for specific values where an amplitude type similar to group 3 appears f fresp fd reaches a near constant value after vr 10 according to the authors this result reinforces the idea that the cylinder undergoes galloping type oscillations although in the present work the f is also near constant the vr is around 6 for all the groups they conclude that a loss in synchronization between vortex shedding and oscillations is responsible for the distinct amplitude responses however in at least one cylinder included in group 3 this is not the case it is important to highlight the obviously differences between data for a flexible cylinder and for an elastic cylinder besides in this study there is no rotation in the cylinder however the authors mention that when a seems to adopt a quasi linear dependence on the reduced velocity it resembles the dependence of galloping type instability where motion induced forces are dominant in contrast for the case of viv fluid forces are mainly driven by vortex shedding this asseveration could apply to flexible cylinders but more detailed experiments in hydrodynamic response is necessary and still under development 5 conclusions in the present paper the maximum cross flow amplitude of a variety of flexible circular cylinders in cantilever was investigated at low reynolds numbers re 1100 analysis of amplitude and frequency measurements support the following conclusions for the first mode of vibration experimental results demonstrate the existence of four distinct groups corresponding to different behaviors of the maximum amplitude as a function of re o group 1 is observed mainly in the smallest diameter cylinders regardless of height and material it consists only of two branches o group 2 represents the most common response found in the literature it consists of three different branches contrary to the typical classification based in frequency here an amplitude based criterion is proposed o group 3 is rarely described in the literature and as far as the authors are aware no evidence of similar behavior in flexible cylinders has been reported earlier this group consists of two branches and has two local maxima one described in this work as typical maximum and other as global maximum o group 4 is characterized by a jump in frequency which corresponds with a peak in the maximum amplitude in the initial branch this peak is observed even in cylinders from groups 2 and 3 in all cases a local maximum amplitude named here typical maximum occurs at some point between natural frequency in vacuum and natural frequency in the working fluid several parameters were tested to classify the different groups the best results were obtained using the slope between vr and re number ranges corresponding to this slope and respective groups are offered in section 4 besides using a proposed polynomial fit the vr re slope can be calculated using l d and m ζ ratios this allows prediction of the maximum amplitude behavior for a given cylinder before performing any time consuming experiment although some researches have proposed that a loss in synchronization between vortex shedding and oscillations is responsible for the distinct amplitude responses at least in group 3 the hydrodynamics studied so far in this work has not offered conclusive evidence to continue this study the future work should be oriented to complete the hydrodynamic study for all the cylinders in the entire synchronization regime declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the

relies on the reaction force of water to generate thrust and has the advantages of high efficiency good maneuverability low noise strong anti cavitation ability and no appendage resistances waterjet propulsion is extensively used in high speed ships and submarines the performance of a waterjet system is generally affected by its hull shape and most of the flow is drawn from its hull boundary layer moreover the lift generated by a waterjet system can also change its trim angle and draft the mechanism of interactions between a waterjet system and its hull is very complicated model tests can accurately predict the flow characteristics of a waterjet system and its hull however they are very expensive and time consuming computational fluid dynamics cfd accurately predicts the hydrodynamic performance of a waterjet system and also clearly visualizes the details of a flow field eslamdoost et al 2014 2018 used cfd to address thrust deduction in waterjet propulsion the simulation based design sbd method has been proposed to apply cfd directly to hull shape design through hull geometric reconstruction hydrodynamic performance prediction and optimization researchers have carried out numerous studies on ship hydrodynamic performance optimization design based on sbd technology peri et al 2001 optimized the bulb bow of a tanker ship based on the bezier patch method to realize hull geometric reconstruction compared with the original design the test results showed that the total resistance was reduced by 3 campana et al 2002 optimized the bow wave amplitude of a surface combatant using sbd technology the test results showed that the bow wave amplitude of the optimal design was reduced by 71 while the bow wave amplitude of the expert modification scheme was reduced by 35 proving the superiority of sbd technology peri and campana 2003 and peri and campana 2005 tahara et al 2008 and campana et al 2009 carried out multi objective optimization for the dtmb 5415 model the surrogate model and multi objective global optimization algorithm were studied in detail the low fidelity model was applied in global optimization to obtain the optimal region and the high fidelity model was applied in local optimization this optimization strategy provided a way to solve the contradiction between the calculation time cost and calculation accuracy in the entire optimization process kim et al 2010 separately studied the lackenby method to realize global geometric reconstruction the radial basis function to realize the local geometric reconstruction and the combination of the aforementioned two methods the total resistances of the series 60 ship were optimized at three speeds the results showed that the combination of the two methods was better than one method used alone takai 2010 and takai et al 2011 studied the optimization of jhss barehull shape and waterjet intake duct shape the volume force method was used to simulate the effect of the pump the resistance was reduced approximately 8 by optimizing the bow shape the resistance was reduced by approximately 2 7 and the inlet efficiency was improved by approximately 16 by optimizing the upper curve and lip shape of the duct han et al 2012 carried out hydrodynamic optimizations of the fore body hull form of a lpg carrier by using parametric models different hull forms were obtained by transforming the transverse section area curve the total resistance of optimal design was reduced by 5 7 vernengo et al 2015 used global and local shape variations to reconstruct geometry of a semi small waterplane area twin hull ferry aiming at reducing resistance and improving seakeeping the multi objective genetic algorithm was used to optimize the hull form at two speeds the results showed that the drag was reduced by 15 at high speeds and vertical acceleration was reduced by 30 in most exposed passenger areas huang et al 2019 carried out a multi objective optimization of the flush type intake duct for a waterjet propulsion system the outflow quality and hydraulic efficiency of the optimized intake duct were greatly improved and the pressure distribution at the outlet plane of intake duct was more uniform researchers have also made corresponding studies on optimization strategies to minimize the computation cost of sbd optimization peri et al 2012 carried out an optimized design of a high speed waterjet catamaran finally the resistance was reduced by 6 and combining the high and low fidelity calculations can reduce the calculation cost by 54 huang et al 2015 and huang et al 2016 proposed an improved artificial bee colony iabc optimization algorithm the resistance results of the series 60 and the kcs hull were reduced by 13 5 and 14 1 respectively and the iabc algorithm had better performance than the abc algorithm by optimizing the layout of trimaran main body and side body the results showed that the iabc algorithm can reduce the calculation cost campana et al 2018 developed a hybrid algorithm by coupling a multi objective direct algorithm modir with an efficient derivative free local algorithm dfmo aiming at the minimum average resistance of a high speed catamaran in irregular waves the results showed that the new hybrid algorithm was better than the direct modir method alone feng et al 2018 proposed a surrogate model based support vector regression the surrogate model could provide sufficient precision and could be used to predict hydrodynamic performance instead of performing direct numerical simulations in the present paper the sbd technique was adopted to solve the multi objective optimization problem of a waterjet propelled trimaran in order to save the computational time and cost the entire optimization method was divided into three processes the

the main body and each waterjet consisted of 6 impeller blades and 11 guide vanes the principal dimensions of the hull and waterjets are presented in table 1 whereas the geometry of the hull and waterjets is displayed in fig 4 the numerical computational domain with boundary conditions for self propulsion calculations is exhibited in fig 5 due to the symmetrical geometry only half of the hull was modeled the length width and height of the computational domain were set to 13l pp 5l pp and 5l pp respectively no slip wall boundary conditions were applied to the hull and the waterjet the symmetric boundary of the domain was set to symmetry boundary conditions the inlet side top and bottom of the domain were set to velocity inlet boundary conditions whereas the outlet was set to pressure outlet boundary conditions moreover a wave absorbing region existed in front of the outlet and the wave damping length was set to 4l pp six layers of prism mesh with a growth ratio of 1 2 were generated for the hull boundary layer four levels of blocks were used to refine the mesh around the hull three levels of cones were used to capture kelvin waves better the mesh was also refined

the hull and waterjet the implicit unsteady solver with a physical time step of 0 02 s was used for calculations a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi rotational and translational motion model was applied to simulate the six degrees of freedom motion of the hull in the simulation the sinkage and the trim were set to free the reference frame of the dfbi was selected as the rotating reference frame of the mrf model furthermore by modifying the rotational speed of impellers the total resistance of the trimaran was balanced by the sum of the thrust and the external tow force f d the difference in frictional resistance coefficient at the model scale and the full scale was considered 5 f d 0 5 ρ s v 2 c f m c f s a mesh independence study of the bare hull resistance was carried out

a section of the fluid pumped from the bottom of the hull and located one duct diameter in front of the tangency point of the ramp of duct and the hull ittc 2005 the results showed that the γ transition turbulence model had little effect on the results the transition turbulence model was not used in following calculations 2 3 optimization processes in the current analysis the entire optimization method was divided into three processes the optimization of the waterjet system the optimization of the global hull shape and the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet as shown in fig 9 in the optimization of the waterjet system the geometry of the duct was reconstructed based on its shape characteristics that were controlled by seven design variables the unsteady flow problem was simplified into a steady problem by replacing the hull surface with a flat plate in the optimization of the global hull shape the lackenby method was applied to transform the global hull shape using only two design variables the design of experiment doe method was applied to distribute sample points uniformly in the design space during the calculations of the self propulsion optimization the resistance and thrust were not balanced to save computational time for satisfying the balance of the resistance and thrust need to change the rotational speed of impellers several times and it was unnecessary the difference between resistance and thrust was taken as an optimization objective and torque was considered as another optimization objective nsga ii was adopted to solve the proposed multi objective optimization problem based on the svr surrogate model in the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet the free form deformation method was applied to transform the bow and the stern hull shape whereas the delta curve was used to elevate the transom the transformation was controlled by three design variables and the arrangement of the waterjet was controlled by only one design variable after performing these three optimization processes the self propulsion performance of the optimal hull was analyzed at different sailing speeds 3 optimization of the waterjet system 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions the numerical computational domain with boundary conditions for the waterjet system is displayed in fig 10 the numerical domain was a combination of the waterjet system and a cuboid water tank and the top surface was used to replace the hull surface the length width and height of the water tank were 30d 10d and 8d respectively liu et al 2010 and its inlet was situated 25d in front of the intake duct where d is the diameter of the duct the inlet side and bottom of the water tank were set to velocity inlet boundary conditions and a boundary layer velocity profile was used to reflect the influences of the hull boundary layer the velocity distribution on the flat plate boundary layer at the model scale was calculated by eq 6 where v 0 is the designed hull speed δ is the thickness of the hull boundary layer l is the distance from the tank inlet to the bow l 0 415l pp and re is reynolds number 6 v v 0 z δ 1 7 z δ v v 0 z δ w h e r e δ 0 37 l r e 1 5 furthermore pressure outlet boundary conditions were applied to the tank outlet and no slip wall boundary conditions were applied to other boundaries the mrf model was applied to the rotating region to simulate the rotation of impellers in the mrf model the rotational speed of impellers was selected as the rotational speed of the original waterjet and hull system at self propulsion 3 2 design variables constraints and objectives the three dimensional geometry of the duct was prepared from its two dimensional longitudinal profile the intake duct consisted of five different sections horizontal straight section corner section inclined straight section ramp section and lip section the two dimensional geometric profile of the intake duct was described by 12 parameters as shown in fig 11 l intake h intake and r intake are the length height and radius of the intake duct respectively α intake is the inclined angle of the intake duct l straight is the length of the horizontal straight section l upper and l lower are the lengths of the upper and lower curves in the inclined straight section respectively r corner is the radius of the centerline in the corner section r ramp is the radius of the ramp r lip h lip and l lip are the radius height and length of the lip these parameters were geometrically constrained and satisfied eqs 7 9 7 r c o r n e r r i n t a k e r r a m p sin α i n t a k e l u p p e r cos α i n t a k e l s t r a i g h t l i n t a k e 8 r c o r n e r r i n t a k e r r a m p 1 cos α i n t a k e l

dimensional profile of the nozzle is displayed in fig 12 the angle of the hub was controlled by the parameter x hub and its control points could move in the x direction the shape of the nozzle was modified by the parameters x nozzle and z nozzle and its control points could move in both the x and z direction the principal dimensions of the intake duct l intake h intake and r intake were constant in the present analysis the principal dimensions of the lip section were calculated as r lip 0 07r intake h lip 0 23r intake and l lip 0 46r intake the values of l straight l upper and l lower were determined by eqs 7 9 the design parameters of the intake duct and the control points of the nozzle were selected as design variables and the range of these design variables is presented in table 4 the lower and upper bounds of the design variables were determined by geometric constraints to maintain the smoothness of the duct hub and nozzle the factors t k t o p t k t o r g 1 q k q o p t k q o r g 1 and e η o p t η o r g 1 were defined as optimization objectives to represent the changes in thrust torque and efficiency respectively the terms with subscripts opt and org represent the optimized and original values respectively 3 3 multi objective optimization and optimal solutions the variation trends of 7 design variables in the intake duct and the nozzle are exhibited in fig 13 it is noticeable that the influence of design parameters of the intake duct on optimization objectives was less than 0 5 hence the modification of the intake duct did not significantly improve the hydrodynamic performance of the waterjet system however the shape of the nozzle yielded great influences on optimization objectives the optimal values of design variables for the waterjet are tabulated in table 5 the original and optimal geometries of the intake duct and the hub are illustrated in fig 14 in comparison to the original duct design the inclined angle of the optimal intake duct increased from 27 to 32 and the inclination angle of the optimal hub decreased from 45 to 34 the change ratios for the propulsion performance of the waterjet system are presented in table 6 the overall efficiency η and the pump efficiency η pump were defined as η thrustv 0 2πntorque and η pump ρq jet h pump 2πntorque where q jet and h pump are the flow rate and the head of the pump respectively in comparison to original shape the values of t q and e increased by 2 53 0 08 and 2 45 respectively the thrust and the efficiency of the waterjet system were improved and the torque was not increased too much the flow rate of the pump decreased by 0 02 whereas the pump head and pump efficiency increased by 1 57 and 1 47 respectively the velocity distributions at the pump inlet and outlet are displayed in fig 15 the velocity distribution at the pump inlet remains the same however at the pump outlet section the velocity gradient increases significantly in the central region and the high velocity region becomes larger and more uniform the decrease of the hub angle changes the flow field near the nozzle contributing to increasing the head of the pump 4 optimization of the hull and the arrangement of the waterjet 4 1 svr based surrogate model the support vector regression svr vapkin 1995 algorithm is widely used in the field of machine learning and mining data and has the advantage of high accuracy with a small number of samples it can effectively shorten the time required to build a surrogate model for a given set of training samples t x 1 y 1 x l y l i 1 l with a positive regression accuracy of ε the regression problem was solved by the following optimization equations 10 min 1 2 w 2 s t w t x i b y i ε y i w t x i b ε in order to improve the applicability of the surrogate model and also to deal with numerical noise a slack variable ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ l ξ l and a penalty factor c were added to eq 10 11 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i s t w t x i b y i ε ξ i y i w t x i

α i α i x i x k ε 4 2 optimization algorithm and objectives in any multi objective optimization problem as the conflicts between objectives are not comparable it is very difficult to find a solution to make all objective functions optimal at the same time a non dominated solution or a pareto optimal solution was proposed in the current analysis and its main characteristic is that it is impossible to improve any objective function without weakening at least one other objective function based on the genetic algorithm ga the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm i nsga i was proposed to solve the pareto optimal solution deb 2001 proposed the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to improve the algorithm in three aspects a fast non dominated sorting method was implemented to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm the concept of crowding degree was used to improve the population diversity in the same dominant layer and an elite strategy was introduced to expand the sample space in order to achieve excellent convergence and robustness of the pareto optimal solution nsga ii was adopted to solve the proposed multi objective optimization problem the factor r r t o p t r t o r g 1 was used to represent the change in total resistance and r t o p t and r t o r g are the total resistances of the optimized hull and the original hull respectively as the rotational speed of the optimized hull was equal to that of the original hull at self propulsion the resistance and thrust of the optimized hull were not balanced during optimization the factor f r t was defined as one of the optimization objectives and smaller f values led to less resistance higher thrust and low consumption cost at self propulsion the factor q was defined as the second optimization objective the change ratios of displacement for the global and local hull shapes were limited within 0 01 and 0 02 respectively 15 min f obj 1 f min f obj 2 q s t 1 opt 0 01 f r 0 628 s t 2 opt 0 02 f r 0 628 4 3 optimization of the global hull shape the lackenby transformation and has been integrated into caeses software was applied to transform the global hull shape it is evident from fig 16 that the lackenby method generated a new hull shape by modifying the sectional area curve sac of the original hull and this process was controlled by adjusting two parameters the change in the prismatic coefficient c p and the change in the longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy x cb the variations in these two parameters were applied to form a b spline delta curve which defined the shift functions for the fore body and the aft body of the hull the upper and lower bounds of design variables were determined by a 2 change ratio of the prismatic coefficient and the center of buoyancy table 7 the optimal latin hypercube design opt lhd method was used as the doe method to distribute sample points uniformly in the design space and 20 sample points were generated for c p and x cb after hull transformation optimization objectives were obtained from the post processing of cfd calculations the surrogate model was used to represent the response relationship between variables and objectives the accuracy of the surrogate model was verified by the k fold cross validation method k 10 in the present study sample points were divided into ten datasets nine of them were used as training datasets and the remaining one was used as the testing dataset the coefficient of determination r 2 was employed to assess the consistency between predicted f i and actual values y i and the mean relative error e r was applied to estimate the accuracy of the surrogate model 16 r 2 1 i 1 10 y i f i 2 i 1 10 y i y i 2 17 e r i 1 10 y i f i y i 10 results of the 10 fold cross validation method are presented in table 8 the coefficients of determination were found to be above 0 9 and the values of the mean relative error were calculated as less than 1 thus suggesting the high accuracy of the surrogate model the population size the number of generations and the crossover probability for nsga ii were set to 20 50 and 0 9 respectively and the obtained pareto optimal solutions are presented in fig 17 it is observable that with increasing q values f values started to decrease and f values changed more than q values the optimal solution the optimal hull1 was artificially selected at the turning point of pareto front and with more consideration of f the response relationship between design variables and optimization objectives is displayed in fig 18 when the prismatic coefficient gradually decreased and the center of buoyancy moved toward the stem the resistance of the trimaran and the thrust of the waterjet system respectively decreased and increased however when the prismatic coefficient started to increase and the center of buoyancy moved toward the stern the torque of the waterjet system gradually decreased the c p and x cb values of the optimal hull1 were selected as 0 0074 and 0 0179 respectively the sac of the optimal hull1 was compared with that of the original hull in fig 19 the line plan of the optimal hull is illustrated in fig 20 at the fore body the line plan moved outward and the hull shape became fatter whereas at the aft body the line plan moved upward and the hull shape at the bottom became flatter the change ratios of the resistance performance for the optimal hull are depicted in table 9 and it is evident that after optimization the total resistance decreased by 2 7 due to the center of buoyancy moved toward the stem the significant reduction of the trim angle resulted in the decrease in pressure resistance of the hull the change ratios of the propulsion performance for the optimal hull are presented in table 10 after optimization a 3 65 increase in thrust and a 2 06 increase in torque were achieved a 3 04 decrease in ivr was noticed which resulted in the increase in thrust and torque the velocity distribution in the capture area is displayed in fig 21 the high velocity region of the capture area decreased and the low velocity region increased greatly the flattening of the bottom hull at the aft body was beneficial to the improvement of propulsion performance 4 4 optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet the free form deformation ffd method sederberg and parry 1986 was applied to transform the hull shape at the stem and the hull shape in front of the waterjet duct the basic principle of ffd is to map the undeformed geometry space into the deformed geometry space by bernstein polynomial a tensor product the relationship between a point x x y z in the cartesian coordinate system and the corresponding points s t u in the local coordinate system was expressed by eq 18 18 x x 0 s s t t u u s t u s t u x x 0 y y 0 z z 0 the b spline volume surrounding the hull geometry was divided into l m and n parts along the s t and u directions respectively fig 22 and the corresponding control vertices were expressed by eq 19 19 q i j k x 0 i l s j m t k n u the ffd method quickly modified the geometry by moving q i j k to q i j k after deformation the coordinates of s t u points in the local coordinate system were expressed as x ffd in the cartesian coordinate system 20 x f f d i 0 l j 0 m k 0 n b i l s b j m t b k n u q i j k b i l s l i l i s i 1 s l i b j m t m j m j t j 1 t m j b k n u n k n k u k 1 u n k two rectangular boxes were used to modify the hull shape at the stem and the stern one of them was located at the peak of the bow wave whereas the other was placed in front of the waterjet duct control points on the first and last lines of these boxes were fixed to ensure the continuity of the hull position whereas control points on the second and penultimate lines were fixed to ensure the continuity of the hull tangent two sets of control points were selected for the transformation fig 23 moreover control points could move along the y and z directions to modify the bow shape and the uv degree of the aft body in order to reduce the number of variables the displacement in the z direction was determined by the displacement in the y direction hence displacements in the y direction y stem and y stern were selected as design variables the transom was elevated by a delta shift transformation based on the delta curve function it is discernible from fig 24 that the transformation was controlled by the delta curve and the weight curve the delta value was applied to transform the hull and the weight curve was used to control the geometric constraints of the upper boundary the elevated value of the transom was defined as the third design variable z transom the trimaran was propelled by two waterjet systems installed on the main body the thickness of the hull boundary layer varied with the distance from the longitudinal section the flow velocity drawn from the hull boundary layer was affected by the position of the waterjet the distance between two waterjet systems was defined as the forth design variable b waterjet as shown in fig 25 fore design variables were used for the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet and the ranges of these variables are presented in table 11 the upper and lower bounds of design variables were determined by geometric constraints to maintain the smooth of the hull and by bounds of arrangement distance based on the opt lhd method 32 sample points were generated for these four variables validation results of the surrogate model are presented in table 12 and it is clear that it had high accuracy the obtained pareto optimal solutions from nsga ii are presented in fig 26 the decrease in two optimization objectives could not be satisfied at the same time hence a trade off solution the optimal hull2 was selected at the turning point of pareto front the response relationship between design variables and optimization objectives is displayed in fig 27 the interactions between design variables y stem y stern and z transom and the factor t caused the deviation of discrete pareto front solutions from trend lines fig 20 with the increase in y stem and y stern the resistance increased first and then gradually decreased the thrust decreased the horizontal force increased and the torque decreased with the increase in z transom the aft body varied from u type to more u type the resistance increased first and then decreased the thrust increased the horizontal force decreased and the torque decreased with the decrease in b waterjet the increase in thrust was much higher than the increase in resistance hence the horizontal force increased and the torque decreased the design variables of the optimal hull2 were selected as 0 039 0 068 0 042 and 0 13 the line plan of the optimal hull2 is illustrated in fig 28 the change ratios of the resistance performance for the optimal hull2 are depicted in table 13 after optimization the total resistance and the pressure resistance of the optimal hull2 decreased by 3 85 and 10 95 respectively the elevation of the transom can significantly reduce the pressure resistance the change ratios of the propulsion performance for the optimal hull2 are presented in table 14 and a 6 38 increase in thrust a 1 73 increase in torque and a 4 73 decrease in ivr were noticed the velocity distribution in the capture area is exhibited in fig 29 the shape of the capture area changed significantly and more fluids were absorbed from the low velocity region of the hull boundary layer better propulsion performance can be achieved by installing the waterjet system near the longitudinal section in the center plane 5 self propulsion performance of the optimal hull the self propulsion ability of the optimal hull2 was examined in the speed range of 0 196 fr 0 707 it is noticeable from fig 30 that the resistance performance of the optimal hull2 was considerably better than that of the original hull in the speed range of 0 275 fr 0 707 figs 31 and 32 indicate that the sinkage of the optimal hull2 was higher at fr 0 5 whereas its trim angle was lower at all froude numbers the percentage change rates of resistance power consumption and efficiency of the optimal hull2 at all sailing speeds are presented in fig 33 at the design speed a 3 85 reduction in resistance a 10 39 reduction in power consumption and a 7 03 increase in efficiency were achieved the maximum resistance reduction rate of 10 73 the maximum power consumption reduction rate of 22 79 and the maximum efficiency increase rate of 14 38 were obtained at fr 0 353 6 conclusions in the present study the multi objective optimization of a waterjet propelled trimaran was carried out based on cfd the rans solver was used for the numerical analysis of resistance thrust and torque and the obtained numerical results were validated with experimental data for one waterjet propulsor and the original hull the sbd optimization method was developed by integrating the parametric geometric reconstruction method the lackenby transformation the ffd transformation the opt lhd method the svr surrogate model and nsga ii in order to save the computational time and cost the entire optimization method was divided into three processes the optimization of the waterjet system the optimization of the global hull shape and the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet at the design speed pareto optimal solutions of the optimal hull indicated a 3 85 reduction in resistance a 6 38 increase in thrust and a 1 73 increase in torque finally the self propulsion capability of the trimaran was investigated at all sailing speeds the maximum resistance reduction rate the maximum power consumption reduction rate and the maximum efficiency increase rate were calculated as 10 73 22 79 and 14 38 respectively the main inferences are presented below 1 the modification of the inclined angle of the hub significantly improved the propulsion performance of the waterjet system 2 the decrease in the prismatic coefficient and the forward change of the center of buoyancy were beneficial to reduce the resistance and improve the thrust 3 when the transom was elevated the aft body varied from u type to more u type thus resulting in a decrease in resistance and torque and a increase in thrust at the same time 4 the reduction in the distance between two waterjet systems effectively improved the thrust and reduced the torque therefore it can be inferred that the sbd technique is effective to solve

relies on the reaction force of water to generate thrust and has the advantages of high efficiency good maneuverability low noise strong anti cavitation ability and no appendage resistances waterjet propulsion is extensively used in high speed ships and submarines the performance of a waterjet system is generally affected by its hull shape and most of the flow is drawn from its hull boundary layer moreover the lift generated by a waterjet system can also change its trim angle and draft the mechanism of interactions between a waterjet system and its hull is very complicated model tests can accurately predict the flow characteristics of a waterjet system and its hull however they are very expensive and time consuming computational fluid dynamics cfd accurately predicts the hydrodynamic performance of a waterjet system and also clearly visualizes the details of a flow field eslamdoost et al 2014 2018 used cfd to address thrust deduction in waterjet propulsion the simulation based

optimization method was divided into three processes the optimization of the waterjet system the optimization of the global hull shape and the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet as shown in fig 9 in the optimization of the waterjet system the geometry of the duct was reconstructed based on its shape characteristics that were controlled by seven design

transform the global hull shape using only two design variables the design of experiment doe method was applied to distribute sample points uniformly in the design space during the calculations of the self propulsion optimization the resistance and thrust were not balanced to save computational time for satisfying the balance of the resistance and thrust need to change the rotational speed of impellers several times and it was unnecessary the difference between resistance and thrust was taken as an optimization objective and torque was considered as another optimization objective nsga ii was adopted to solve the proposed multi objective optimization problem based on the svr surrogate model in the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet the free form deformation method was applied to transform the bow and the stern hull shape whereas the delta curve was used to elevate the transom the transformation was controlled by three design variables and the arrangement of the waterjet was controlled by only one design variable after performing these three optimization processes the self propulsion performance of the optimal hull was analyzed at different sailing speeds 3 optimization of the waterjet system 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions the numerical computational domain with boundary conditions for the waterjet system is displayed in fig 10 the numerical domain was a combination of the waterjet system and a cuboid water tank and the top surface was used to replace the hull surface the length width and height of the water tank were 30d 10d and 8d respectively liu et al 2010 and its inlet was situated 25d in front of the intake duct where d is the diameter of the duct the inlet side and bottom of the water tank were set to velocity inlet boundary conditions and a boundary layer velocity profile was used to reflect the influences of the hull boundary layer the velocity distribution on the flat plate boundary layer at the model scale was calculated by eq 6 where v 0 is the designed hull speed δ is the thickness of the hull boundary layer l is the distance from the tank inlet to the bow l 0 415l pp and re is reynolds number 6 v v 0 z δ 1 7 z δ v v 0 z δ w h e r e δ 0 37 l r e 1 5 furthermore pressure outlet boundary conditions were applied to the tank outlet and no slip wall boundary conditions were applied to other boundaries the mrf model was applied to the rotating region to simulate the rotation of impellers in the mrf model the rotational speed of impellers was selected as the rotational speed of the original waterjet and hull system at self propulsion 3 2 design variables constraints and objectives the three dimensional geometry of the duct was prepared from its two dimensional longitudinal profile the intake duct consisted of five different sections horizontal straight section corner section inclined straight section ramp section and lip section the two dimensional geometric profile of the intake duct was described by 12 parameters as shown in fig 11 l intake h intake and r intake are the length height and radius of the intake duct respectively α intake is the inclined angle of the intake duct l straight is the length of the horizontal straight section l upper and l lower are the lengths of the upper and lower curves in the inclined straight section respectively r corner is the radius of the centerline in the corner section r ramp is the radius of the ramp r lip h lip and l lip are the radius height and length of the lip these parameters were geometrically constrained and satisfied eqs 7 9 7 r c o r n e r r i n t a k e r r a m p sin α i n t a k e l u p p e r cos α i n t a k e l s t r a i g h t l i n t a k e 8 r c o r n e r r i n t a k e r r a m p 1 cos α i n t a k e l

dimensional profile of the nozzle is displayed in fig 12 the angle of the hub was controlled by the parameter x hub and its control points could move in the x direction the shape of the nozzle was modified by the parameters x nozzle and z nozzle and its control points could move in both the x and z direction the principal dimensions of the intake duct l intake h intake and r intake were constant in the present analysis the principal dimensions of the lip section were calculated as r lip 0 07r intake h lip 0 23r intake and l lip 0 46r intake the values of l straight l upper and l lower were determined by eqs 7 9 the design parameters of the intake duct and the control points of the nozzle were selected as design variables and the range of these design variables is presented in table 4 the lower and upper bounds of the design variables were determined by geometric constraints to maintain the smoothness of the duct hub and nozzle the factors t k t o p t k t o r g 1 q k q o p t k q o r g 1 and e η o p t η o r g 1 were defined as optimization objectives to represent the changes in thrust torque and efficiency respectively the terms with subscripts opt and org represent the optimized and original values respectively 3 3 multi objective optimization and optimal solutions the variation trends of 7 design variables in the intake duct and the nozzle are exhibited in fig 13 it is noticeable that the influence of design parameters of the intake duct on optimization objectives was less than 0 5 hence the modification of the intake duct did not significantly improve the hydrodynamic performance of the waterjet system however the shape of the nozzle yielded great influences on optimization objectives the optimal values of design variables for the waterjet are tabulated in table 5 the original and optimal geometries of the intake duct and the hub are illustrated in fig 14 in comparison to the original duct design the inclined angle of the optimal intake duct increased from 27 to 32 and the inclination angle of the optimal hub decreased from 45 to 34 the change ratios for the propulsion performance of the waterjet system are presented in table 6 the overall efficiency η and the pump efficiency η pump were defined as η thrustv 0 2πntorque and η pump ρq jet h pump 2πntorque where q jet and h pump are the flow rate and the head of the pump respectively in comparison to original shape the values of t q and e increased by 2 53 0 08 and 2 45 respectively the thrust and the efficiency of the waterjet system were improved and the torque was not increased too much the flow rate of the pump decreased by 0 02 whereas the pump head and pump efficiency increased by 1 57 and 1 47 respectively the velocity distributions at the pump inlet and outlet are displayed in fig 15 the velocity distribution at the pump inlet remains the same however at the pump outlet section the velocity gradient increases significantly in the central region and the high velocity region becomes larger and more uniform the decrease of the hub angle changes the flow field near the nozzle contributing to increasing the head of the pump 4 optimization of the hull and the arrangement of the waterjet 4 1 svr based surrogate model the support vector regression svr vapkin 1995 algorithm is widely used in the field of machine learning and mining data and has the advantage of high accuracy with a small number of samples it can effectively shorten the time required to build a surrogate model for a given set of training samples t x 1 y 1 x l y l i 1 l with a positive regression accuracy of ε the regression problem was solved by the following optimization equations 10 min 1 2 w 2 s t w t x i b y i ε y i w t x i b ε in order to improve the applicability of the surrogate model and also to deal with numerical noise a slack variable ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ l ξ l and a penalty factor c were added to eq 10 11 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i s t w t x i b y i ε ξ i y i w t x i

α i α i x i x k ε 4 2 optimization algorithm and objectives in any multi objective optimization problem as the conflicts between objectives are not comparable it is very difficult to find a solution to make all objective functions optimal at the same time a non dominated solution or a pareto optimal solution was proposed in the current analysis and its main characteristic is that it is impossible to improve any objective function without weakening at least one other objective function based on the genetic algorithm ga the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm i nsga i was proposed to solve the pareto optimal solution deb 2001 proposed the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to improve the algorithm in three aspects a fast non dominated sorting method was implemented to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm the concept of crowding degree was used to improve the population diversity in the same dominant layer and an elite strategy was introduced to expand the sample space in order to achieve excellent convergence and robustness of the pareto optimal solution nsga ii was adopted to solve the proposed multi objective optimization problem the factor r r t o p t r t o r g 1 was used to represent the change in total resistance and r t o p t and r t o r g are the total resistances of the optimized hull and the original hull respectively as the rotational speed of the optimized hull was equal to that of the original hull at self propulsion the resistance and thrust of the optimized hull were not balanced during optimization the factor f r t was defined as one of the optimization objectives and smaller f values led to less resistance higher thrust and low consumption cost at self propulsion the factor q was defined as the second optimization objective the change ratios of displacement for the global and local hull shapes were limited within 0 01 and 0 02 respectively 15 min f obj 1 f min f obj 2 q s t 1 opt 0 01 f r 0 628 s t 2 opt 0 02 f r 0 628 4 3 optimization of the global hull shape the lackenby transformation and has been integrated into caeses software was applied to transform the global hull shape it is evident from fig 16 that the lackenby method generated a new hull shape by modifying the sectional area curve sac of the original hull and this process was controlled by adjusting two parameters the change in the prismatic coefficient c p and the change in the longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy x cb the variations in these two parameters were applied to form a b spline delta curve which defined the shift functions for the fore body and the aft body of the hull the upper and lower bounds of design variables were determined by a 2 change ratio of the prismatic coefficient and the center of buoyancy table 7 the optimal latin hypercube design opt lhd method was used as the doe method to distribute sample points uniformly in the design space and 20 sample points were generated for c p and x cb after hull transformation optimization objectives were obtained from the post processing of cfd calculations the surrogate model was used to represent the response relationship between variables and objectives the accuracy of the surrogate model was verified by the k fold cross validation method k 10 in the present study sample points were divided into ten datasets nine of them were used as training datasets and the remaining one was used as the testing dataset the coefficient of determination r 2 was employed to assess the consistency between predicted f i and actual values y i and the mean relative error e r was applied to estimate the accuracy of the surrogate model 16 r 2 1 i 1 10 y i f i 2 i 1 10 y i y i 2 17 e r i 1 10 y i f i y i 10 results of the 10 fold cross validation method are presented in table 8 the coefficients of determination were found to be above 0 9 and the values of the mean relative error were calculated as less than 1 thus suggesting the high accuracy of the surrogate model the population size the number of generations and the crossover probability for nsga ii were set to 20 50 and 0 9 respectively and the obtained pareto optimal solutions are presented in fig 17 it is observable that with increasing q values f values started to decrease and f values changed more than q values the optimal solution the optimal hull1 was artificially selected at the turning point of pareto front and with more consideration of f the response relationship between design variables and optimization objectives is displayed in fig 18 when the prismatic coefficient gradually decreased and the center of buoyancy moved toward the stem the resistance of the trimaran and the thrust of the waterjet system respectively decreased and increased however when the prismatic coefficient started to increase and the center of buoyancy moved toward the stern the torque of the waterjet system gradually decreased the c p and x cb values of the optimal hull1 were selected as 0 0074 and 0 0179 respectively the sac of the optimal hull1 was compared with that of the original hull in fig 19 the line plan of the optimal hull is illustrated in fig 20 at the fore body the line plan moved outward and the hull shape became fatter whereas at the aft body the line plan moved upward and the hull shape at the bottom became flatter the change ratios of the resistance performance for the optimal hull are depicted in table 9 and it is evident that after optimization the total resistance decreased by 2 7 due to the center of buoyancy moved toward the stem the significant reduction of the trim angle resulted in the decrease in pressure resistance of the hull the change ratios of the propulsion performance for the optimal hull are presented in table 10 after optimization a 3 65 increase in thrust and a 2 06 increase in torque were achieved a 3 04 decrease in ivr was noticed which resulted in the increase in thrust and torque the velocity distribution in the capture area is displayed in fig 21 the high velocity region of the capture area decreased and the low velocity region increased greatly the flattening of the bottom hull at the aft body was beneficial to the improvement of propulsion performance 4 4 optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet the free form deformation ffd method sederberg and parry 1986 was applied to transform the hull shape at the stem and the hull shape in front of the waterjet duct the basic principle of ffd is to map the undeformed geometry space into the deformed geometry space by bernstein polynomial a tensor product the relationship between a point x x y z in the cartesian coordinate system and the corresponding points s t u in the local coordinate system was expressed by eq 18 18 x x 0 s s t t u u s t u s t u x x 0 y y 0 z z 0 the b spline volume surrounding the hull geometry was divided into l m and n parts along the s t and u directions respectively fig 22 and the corresponding control vertices were expressed by eq 19 19 q i j k x 0 i l s j m t k n u the ffd method quickly modified the geometry by moving q i j k to q i j k after deformation the coordinates of s t u points in the local coordinate system were expressed as x ffd in the cartesian coordinate system 20 x f f d i 0 l j 0 m k 0 n b i l s b j m t b k n u q i j k b i l s l i l i s i 1 s l i b j m t m j m j t j 1 t m j b k n u n k n k u k 1 u n k two rectangular boxes were used to modify the hull shape at the stem and the stern one of them was located at the peak of the bow wave whereas the other was placed in front of the waterjet duct control points on the first and last lines of these boxes were fixed to ensure the continuity of the hull position whereas control points on the second and penultimate lines were fixed to ensure the continuity of the hull tangent two sets of control points were selected for the transformation fig 23 moreover control points could move along the y and z directions to modify the bow shape and the uv degree of the aft body in order to reduce the number of variables the displacement in the z direction was determined by the displacement in the y direction hence displacements in the y direction y stem and y stern were selected as design variables the transom was elevated by a delta shift transformation based on the delta curve function it is discernible from fig 24 that the transformation was controlled by the delta curve and the weight curve the delta value was applied to transform the hull and the weight curve was used to control the geometric constraints of the upper boundary the elevated value of the transom was defined as the third design variable z transom the trimaran was propelled by two waterjet systems installed on the main body the thickness of the hull boundary layer varied with the distance from the longitudinal section the flow velocity drawn from the hull boundary layer was affected by the position of the waterjet the distance between two waterjet systems was defined as the forth design variable b waterjet as shown in fig 25 fore design variables were used for the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet and the ranges of these variables are presented in table 11 the upper and lower bounds of design variables were determined by geometric constraints to maintain the smooth of the hull and by bounds of arrangement distance based on the opt lhd method 32 sample points were generated for these four variables validation results of the surrogate model are presented in table 12 and it is clear that it had high accuracy the obtained pareto optimal solutions from nsga ii are presented in fig 26 the decrease in two optimization objectives could not be satisfied at the same time hence a trade off solution the optimal hull2 was selected at the turning point of pareto front the response relationship between design variables and optimization objectives is displayed in fig 27 the interactions between design variables y stem y stern and z transom and the factor t caused the deviation of discrete pareto front solutions from trend lines fig 20 with the increase in y stem and y stern the resistance increased first and then gradually decreased the thrust decreased the horizontal force increased and the torque decreased with the increase in z transom the aft body varied from u type to more u type the resistance increased first and then decreased the thrust increased the horizontal force decreased and the torque decreased with the decrease in b waterjet the increase in thrust was much higher than the increase in resistance hence the horizontal force increased and the torque decreased the design variables of the optimal hull2 were selected as 0 039 0 068 0 042 and 0 13 the line plan of the optimal hull2 is illustrated in fig 28 the change ratios of the resistance performance for the optimal hull2 are depicted in table 13 after optimization the total resistance and the pressure resistance of the optimal hull2 decreased by 3 85 and 10 95 respectively the elevation of the transom can significantly reduce the pressure resistance the change ratios of the propulsion performance for the optimal hull2 are presented in table 14 and a 6 38 increase in thrust a 1 73 increase in torque and a 4 73 decrease in ivr were noticed the velocity distribution in the capture area is exhibited in fig 29 the shape of the capture area changed significantly and more fluids were absorbed from the low velocity region of the hull boundary layer better propulsion performance can be achieved by installing the waterjet system near the longitudinal section in the center plane 5 self propulsion performance of the optimal hull the self propulsion ability of the optimal hull2 was examined in the speed range of 0 196 fr 0 707 it is noticeable from fig 30 that the resistance performance of the optimal hull2 was considerably better than that of the original hull in the speed range of 0 275 fr 0 707 figs 31 and 32 indicate that the sinkage of the optimal hull2 was higher at fr 0 5 whereas its trim angle was lower at all froude numbers the percentage change rates of resistance power consumption and efficiency of the optimal hull2 at all sailing speeds are presented in fig 33 at the design speed a 3 85 reduction in resistance a 10 39 reduction in power consumption and a 7 03 increase in efficiency were achieved the maximum resistance reduction rate of 10 73 the maximum power consumption reduction rate of 22 79 and the maximum efficiency increase rate of 14 38 were obtained at fr 0 353 6 conclusions in the present study the multi objective optimization of a waterjet propelled trimaran was carried out based on cfd the rans solver was used for the numerical analysis of resistance thrust and torque and the obtained numerical results were validated with experimental data for one waterjet propulsor and the original hull the sbd optimization method was developed by integrating the parametric geometric reconstruction method the lackenby transformation the ffd transformation the opt lhd method the svr surrogate model and nsga ii in order to save the computational time and cost the entire optimization method was divided into three processes the optimization of the waterjet system the optimization of the global hull shape and the optimization of the local hull shape and the arrangement of the waterjet at the design speed pareto optimal solutions of the optimal hull indicated a 3 85 reduction in resistance a 6 38 increase in thrust and a 1 73 increase in torque finally the self propulsion capability of the trimaran was investigated at all sailing speeds the maximum resistance reduction rate the maximum power consumption reduction rate and the maximum efficiency increase rate were calculated as 10 73 22 79 and 14 38 respectively the main inferences are presented below 1 the modification of the inclined angle of the hub significantly improved the propulsion performance of the waterjet system 2 the decrease in the prismatic coefficient and the forward change of the center of buoyancy were beneficial to reduce the resistance and improve the thrust 3 when the transom was elevated the aft body varied from u type to more u type thus resulting in a decrease in resistance and torque and a increase in thrust at the same time 4 the reduction in the distance between two waterjet systems effectively improved the thrust and reduced the torque therefore it can be inferred that the sbd technique is effective to solve
