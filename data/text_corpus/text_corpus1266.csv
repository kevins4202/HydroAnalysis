6330,physically based numerical modelling of surface processes in urban drainage such as pollutant wash off or the assessment of flood risks requires appropriate calibration and terrain elevation data to properly simulate the overland flows and thus to achieve useful results accordingly this study aims to obtain an accurate representation of the runoff generated by three different rain intensities 30 50 and 80 mm h in a full scale urban drainage physical model of 36 m2 the study focuses firstly on applying the structure from motion sfm photogrammetric technique to carry out a high resolution and accurate topographic survey this topography was implemented in a 2d shallow water model and the results were compared with those obtained using traditional data point measured topography negligible differences were found when comparing the two models with measured discharges at the physical model gully pots however significant differences were obtained in the velocity distributions especially in the shallowest flow areas where drainage channels of a few millimeters depth appeared in the high resolution topographic survey results from the numerical model were compared with overland flow velocities determined by applying a modified large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv methodology using fluorescent particles with the sfm topography the 2d model was able to obtain a better representation of the experimental data since small scale irregularities of the pavement surface could be represented in the model domain at the same time lspiv was presented as a very suitable tool for the accurate measurement of runoff velocities in urban drainage models avoiding the interference of raindrop features in the recorded images and with overland water depths in the order of few millimeters keywords lspiv large scale particle image velocimetry sfm structure from motion urban runoff physical model 2d shallow water model urban drainage 1 introduction physically based urban drainage models are commonly used tools to predict urban floods or sewer system discharges e g chen et al 2009 leandro et al 2009 neal et al 2009 the calibration of these models is often performed with data taken from the sewer network principally flow discharges and water depths e g seyoum et al 2011 hong et al 2016a nevertheless there are significant processes related to overland flows such as flood risk management e g martínez gomariz et al 2016 2017 2018 and the determination of the mobilization of the deposited pollutants over the street surface e g deletic et al 1997 egodawatta et al 2007 muthusamy et al 2018 in these applications a good characterization of the surface flow is essential to achieve useful and accurate results however the difficulty in obtaining data on velocity fields and depths in overland flows makes the calibration of models a difficult task leitão et al 2018 in addition to the need for appropriate hydraulic calibration data an accurate topography of the catchment is also required to simulate the urban runoff properly de almeida et al 2018 using inaccurate elevation maps for modelling the surface flow by means of a 2d shallow water model can lead to erroneous results regarding the determination of the extent of floods or flood risks hunter et al 2008 besides flood analysis in the study of sediment wash off during non extreme rain events the influence of the topography is also relevant in the model outputs thus sediment transport capacity is influenced by the small overland flows depths which may also hinder rainfall erosion capacity due to the impact of raindrops tomanovic and maksimocik 1996 these both factors increase the sensitivity of the model s results to the topography and at the same time make it more difficult to measure undisturbed water depths and overland flow velocities in order to calibrate the model furthermore in studies of this type such as the one developed by hong et al 2016a b an accurate spatial and temporal representation of the runoff is key to reducing the propagation of hydraulic uncertainties to the sediment transport equations since the hydraulic variables are used as an input for the flow driven erosion the transport and the eventual deposition of sediments hairsine and rose 1992a b the sensitivity to the model topography is greater in the case of small catchments or laboratory physical models where a reduced area is considered e g wijesiri et al 2015 naves et al 2017 muthusamy et al 2018 in typical urban flooding studies with 2d shallow water models the topography is usually derived from airborne lidar with a resolution of about 0 25 m to 1 00 m with root mean square errors rmse for elevations of about 5 15 cm hunter et al 2008 neal et al 2009 fraga et al 2016 this spatial resolution may be insufficiently accurate for a physically based approach of sediment wash off in which the elements of the digital terrain models are in the order of a few centimeters or even millimeters in such cases a terrestrial laser topography or on vehicle lidar hong et al 2016a combined with conventional topographic techniques can provide high resolution and precise elevation data but this implies a significant economic cost in this regard visualization techniques are presented as a possible low cost alternative to traditional methodologies for obtaining high resolution elevation grid data the photogrammetric technique structure from motion sfm which is based on stereoscopic principles allows the reconstruction of a 3d object by means of overlapping images traditional photogrammetric methods require the location and positioning of cameras or the location of ground control points to create a 3d object reconstruction in contrast sfm method solves the geometry and the position and orientation automatically using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping and offsetting of images westoby et al 2012 this greatly simplifies the methodology and makes it more affordable for non expert users although this technique is being used widely in river bathymetric applications see for instance the review in detert et al 2017 in the field of urban drainage the applications are still quite limited we can cite here only some previous studies developed by the current authors to determine the topography of sewer sediment deposits at the laboratory scale regueiro picallo et al 2018 as noted above a non adequate topography can lead to the erroneous modelling of spatial and temporal surface flow distributions but even with a very accurate digital terrain model measured data such as discharges water depth and flow velocities are required in order to calibrate and validate models and thus to obtain useful results hunter et al 2008 the measurement of shallow flows generated in urban catchment surfaces do not allow for the use of traditional methods since these techniques interfere with the observed flow likewise flow sensors used in pipe flows are often quite large and affect to the determination of the hydraulic variables the non intrusive particle image velocimetry piv techniques are considered a suitable solution and are commonly used in laboratory and field studies to obtain velocity field datasets adrian 1991 raffel et al 2007 piv determines the displacement of particles seeded in the flow using cross correlation methods on two image frames with a known time step between them large scale piv lspiv proposed by fujita et al 1998 uses particles or other traces on the surface of the water flow which are supposed to follow the same velocity this variant uses the surface of the flow as the measurable plane so it is easier to apply to field and realistic studies since the area under study can be much larger and expensive equipment such as complex lasers or cameras are not needed therefore lspiv methods are generally applied to measure surface velocities rather than depth averaged velocities and errors in the determination of depth averaged flow velocities may become more significant at higher flow depths lspiv is commonly used in river surveys le coz et al 2010 muste et al 2011 to determine river discharges in order to transform surface velocities into depth averaged velocities and subsequently the discharge a velocity index of 0 85 is typically used although this correction factor is not appropriate for all measurement situations and depends on flow nature flow regime steady or un steady and bed roughness muste et al 2011 furthermore the lspiv technique has also been used for measuring shallow water flows in laboratory studies weitbrecht et al 2002 for example kantoush et al 2008 and novak et al 2017 apply lspiv to investigate the flow field using artificial particles in a rectangular shallow reservoir and in an open channel flow respectively in the case of arques et al 2018 by synchronizing four cameras it was possible to resolve a large measurement area of 4 8 m 1 22 m with high resolution lspiv in the field of urban drainage some studies using lspiv in high water level conditions during flood events have recently been published guillén et al 2017 presented a new approach to the study of the vulnerability of vehicles and people where the lspiv method is used to obtain superficial velocities from a domestic video martins et al 2018 performed an extensive comparison between experimentally measured and numerically modelled flows for different manhole grate configurations for this purpose a detailed characterization of the velocity fields around these elements was performed by means of lspiv leitão et al 2018 presented the use of surveillance camera footage as a low maintenance and easy to install alternative to measure surface flow by means of this image velocimetry however in the case of very shallow depths in non extreme rain events only a very preliminary measurement of the velocity of a small area using artificial tracers was found branisavljević and prodanović 2006 because of its solid performance in the different studies cited above lspiv can be considered as a suitable technique for obtaining velocity field datasets with low water levels in urban areas nevertheless due to small water depths here commonly lower than 1 cm and the presence of raindrops which impact on the water surface and interfere in the surface flow and the recorded images the accurate measurement of the velocities is a highly challenging task this study aims to achieve an accurate representation of the overland runoff in a full scale urban drainage physical model to be used as the basis for an application of a physically based sediment wash off 2d shallow water model due to the low depths developed in the laboratory model and the size of the catchment this study focuses firstly on measuring a high resolution topographic data using a low cost photogrammetric technique allowing thus for the proper simulation of the surface flow with a 2d shallow water model then a hydraulic experimental characterization of the runoff is measured under controlled laboratory conditions to calibrate and assess the numeric results obtained the maximum depths of around 5 8 mm and the presence of raindrops that interfere in the visualization of the surface flow made it necessary to develop a modified lspiv methodology using fluorescent particles to the authors knowledge no previous urban drainage studies have applied lspiv during rainfall events therefore the present study is novel in the following ways the sfm technique is used to obtain a high resolution and accurate elevation map of an urban drainage physical model of 36 m2 extreme shallow surface flow is measured in the presence of raindrops with a modified lspiv methodology by means of fluorescent particles the photogrammetric topography and a traditional topographic survey using a gridded system have been implemented in a 2d shallow water model in order to validate both digital terrain models with the measured lspiv velocity fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 physical model description experimental testing was undertaken in the hydraulic laboratory of the centre of technological innovation in construction and civil engineering citeec at the university of a coruña the installation consists of a full scale street section with a rainfall simulator located 2 6 m over a 36 m2 concrete street surface divided into a tiled pavement and a roadway fig 1 the runoff generated by rain drains into a sewer drainage system by means of three gully pots two of these located along the curb and a third one at the end of a lateral outflow channel the gully pot grate was removed in the tests to allow sampling of water quality parameters in them in a series of wash off experiments not shown here the surface has an approximate transversal slope of 2 up to the 0 15 m high concrete curb and a 0 5 longitudinal slope up to the outflow channel a more detailed description of the physical model can be found in naves et al 2017 the rainfall simulator consists of two overlapped circuits of pipes with pressure compensating irrigation drippers pcj cnl netafimtm inserted in a grid layout the transversal and longitudinal distance between drippers in each circuit is 0 2 m 25 drippers per square meter and the flow generated by one dripper is 1 2 and 2 l h respectively this configuration makes it possible to simulate rainfall with a rain intensity of 30 mm h 50 mm h and if both circuits are used at the same time 80 mm h a metallic welded wire mesh with 3 mm square openings situated 0 6 m below the grids of drippers breaks and distributes the generated raindrops to achieve a suitable uniformity and drop size distribution the rain intensity distribution was measured from the volume collected in a 0 5 m 0 5 m grid of vessels for 5 min the obtained christiansen uniformity coefficients christiansen 1942 values for 30 mm h 50 m h and 80 mm h were 76 88 and 91 respectively hence the rain can be considered almost uniform 2 2 surface model topography 2 2 1 traditional point data survey the 3d coordinates of a total of 144 points were determined over the whole surface of the physical model in a 0 5 m 0 5 m grid the x and y coordinates of each point of the grid were determined by triangulation from two reference points while the z coordinate was obtained by measuring the distance to a horizontal reference laser plane with a point gage tape the error bounds of the measured horizontal coordinates were assumed to be approximately 1 cm for the horizontal coordinates and about 1 mm for the vertical coordinates boiten 2003 the position of the points used for the topographic survey was drawn over the street surface with red crosses see fig 4 these marks were also used as reference points in the visualization techniques carried out in this study 2 2 2 structure from motion survey the sfm photogrammetric technique was applied to obtain a high resolution elevations map of the physical model surface the first step was to take a total of 64 images from different positions around the surface with a lumix gh4 camera focal length equal to 28 mm and image resolution 3264 2448 pixels then the free license software visualsfm wu et al 2011 wu 2013 was used to perform the 3d reconstruction of the physical model surface this software uses triangulation to obtain the relative position of different features of the studied object which appear in several images at the same time therefore it is necessary to ensure an overlap of the images of around 60 to increase the number of resulting points in addition enough contrast in the surface of the measured object is also needed in order to distinguish and correlate the common points between the images in this particular case the concrete surface is very homogeneous and it was no possible to apply directly the sfm technique because the software cannot identify different features in the pictures to avoid this problem a colored and texturized image was projected over the surface of the model while the images were taken and in this way a sufficiently dense point cloud was obtained fig 2 a 976 000 elements dense point cloud in a relative coordinate system was obtained by means of the sfm technique a total number of 5 ground reference points previously determined in the traditional data topographic survey were used to scale and transform the point clouds to a coordinate system that was already known this procedure was carried out with the open source software meshlab cignoni et al 2008 the rmse resulting from the differences between the final coordinates and the calibration ground points was 2 2 mm finally the screened poisson surface reconstruction in meshlab kazhdan and hoppe 2013 and a 40 60 elements two dimensional median filter method was applied to the scaled and positioned point cloud in order to obtain a 5 mm squared despiked grid 2 3 numerical model the iber model www iberaula es was used to assess the effect of the different measured topographies in the overland flow velocity distribution and flow discharges into the model gully pots the surface drainage model solves the 2d shallow water equations including rainfall and infiltration terms with an explicit un structured finite volume solver the model has been validated in previous studies under overland flow conditions including rainfall runoff transformation cea et al 2010 cea and blade 2015 the surface runoff model iber has also been implemented in the dual drainage model of the authors research team which has already been validated in field applications fraga et al 2016 and in the same physical model presented in this study fraga et al 2015 a detailed and comprehensive description of the numerical model and solver can be found in the previously cited studies following fraga et al 2015 all the boundary conditions of the model were imposed as free critical depth discharge in the present study gully pots were not treated with any special stage discharge curve as the gully pots grates were removed 2 4 determination of overland flow velocity fields the lspiv technique was used to obtain the velocity field of the superficial flow within the first two meters of the pavement placed next to the curb of the physical model this area presents the highest depths and velocities due to the transversal slope of the street model and it is the most interesting part from an urban wash off point of view since it is known that most of the sediments build up in the first 0 5 m sartor and boyd 1972 grottker 1987 lspiv are based on the analysis of the frames obtained from a video recording of some type of tracer that is supposed to follow the velocities of the superficial flow so the selection of a suitable tracer and the correct way of recording the video are essential before beginning the experiments 2 4 1 experimental setup two lumix gh4 cameras were used to apply the lspiv technique both cameras used a focal length of 28 mm and were set to record video frames of size 3840x2178 pixels and a frame rate of 25 hz the cameras were positioned 2 2 m above the side of the pathway the camera configuration ensures the detection of small particles around 1 mm diameter and allows for the recording of an area large enough to capture the half length of the physical model curb fig 3 the conditions of the experiments must be taken into account in the selection of the particles used as a tracer first the particles have to be small and light enough to be transported by the flow considering the low depths developed in the surface of the physical model the maximum depths for the maximum rain intensity are below 10 mm next to the curb and around 3 mm on the rest of the surface furthermore the presence of raindrops between the cameras and the water surface and their impacts on it produces different image patterns that affect the accuracy of piv algorithms which are not able to distinguish between tracers and these other picture features to deal with this problem fluorescent ultraviolet uv particles and lamps were used to illuminate the physical model fluorescent particles have been used in the past in piv applications to improve the quality of the acquired images allowing measurements close to laser reflective surfaces such as sediment beds or free surfaces pedocchi et al 2008 in our study we produce inexpensive lspiv particles by cutting an extruded 3d printer fluorescent strand into pieces these fluorescent particles 0 85 mm mean size react with the shining uv light so that in dark conditions it is possible to highlight the particles distinguishing them from the rest of the disturbing features in the images such as raindrops or water reflections therefore five uv 100 led torches 390 nm wavelength were placed next to the cameras and pointing at the surface in order to illuminate homogeneously the measured surface during the experiments in the fig 3 a scheme of the experimental setup is shown 2 4 2 experimental procedure for each of the three rain intensities that the rainfall simulator can generate the measure of the superficial flow by means of the lspiv technique began by turning off the ambient laboratory lights while the cameras were recording then the uv torches were turned on and the rain started once steady conditions were reached after approximately 150 s particles were spread manually along the side of the roadway during the rest of the experiment which has a total rainfall duration of 300 s this allows the particles to be transported to the measurement area without causing disturbances in the flow or in the video and we ensure the recording of at least one minute of a suitable particles flow in steady conditions at the measurement area 2 4 3 image processing and lspiv data analysis once the experiment was finished 1500 frames 60 s were extracted from the video as recorded in steady flow conditions the frames were processed with the procedure schematized in fig 4 which consists of the following steps 2 4 3 1 spatial calibration the angle of view of the cameras and the lens distortion cause a deformation in the video frames recorded so the extracted frames from the video sequences were dewarped to correct image perspective and to convert the image units from pixels to real world metrics this procedure was performed using a spatial calibration of the images using the red cross marks drawn on the model surface during the gridded point data topographic survey the point coordinates were used as a reference to transform the camera frames to an orthogonal cartesian coordinate system in each experiment and for each camera the standard matlab algorithm fitgeotrans was applied to one frame recorded in normal light conditions a total number of 28 and 24 reference points with known 2d coordinates were identified in the calibration frame of each camera the software provided a rototranslation matrix to transform the frames recorded during the experiments in these new scaled and orthoreferenced images obtained by applying the matrix 1 pixel corresponds to 1 mm in real world coordinates finally the common referenced points between the cameras were used to crop and join the image a similar procedure for image calibration was performed by arques et al 2018 the final position of all the reference points in the calibrated image was compared with the known coordinates obtaining a maximum error of about 2 in the total displacement between marks this calibration procedure was applied for each experiment to avoid errors because of possible small movements or tilts of the cameras between experiments the time synchronization between cameras was done through identifying the frame at the moment that the lights of the laboratory was turned off the process is very fast and it is easy to identify the first frame recorded in dark conditions so this method provided the maximum possible accuracy which is equal to the time step between frames 0 04 s 2 4 3 2 piv data analysis before the application of the piv cross correlation algorithms to the recorded images the rectified and merged images were converted to grey scale and a moving sliding background with a 0 25 threshold filter was then applied thus in each frame those pixels with 25 of similarity in the grey value with the same pixel from the previous frame were transformed to black the application of the sliding background filter reduces the effect of background image features such as surface microtopography roughness or tracer particles that settled temporarily on the shallowest or dry flow regions the velocity of these particles would be zero and the mean velocity estimation in the interrogation area is biased for the determination of the instantaneous velocity maps the open source piv tool for matlab pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 was used an adaptive cross correlation procedure was performed using squared interrogation areas of 128 64 and 32 pixels resulting in a regular grid of velocity vectors of 3 2 cm and 0 04 s of resolution to estimate the cross correlation between frames an fft approach was used and in the final step a window deformation scheme was applied to increase piv accuracy raffel et al 2007 2 4 3 3 piv data post processing and velocity calculation once the velocity fields were obtained the possible outliers were detected with a temporal 2d filter using a phase space thresholding method developed by goring and nikora 2002 taking into account both velocity components in each point throughout the duration of the experiment the filter removes less than the 8 of the velocity vectors then these outliers were replaced by means of a linear interpolation following cea et al 2007 in fig 4 lower part a real example of the performance of the temporal 2d filter in a selected point in one experiment can be seen finally in the matlab toolbox pivmat environment moisy 2017 a spatial median filter of 3x3 elements was performance to all the frames the obtained velocity fields correspond to the surface flow velocity in order to obtain the mean depth averaged velocity value it is necessary to determine a velocity index or flow velocity correction factor in river surveys the determination of the velocity index is based on the application of the log law velocity profile to the streamwise velocities le coz et al 2010 for the complex shallow flows developed in urban surfaces this assumption may be questionable and some authors use different velocity index values ranging roughly from 0 6 to 1 e g leitão et al 2018 martins et al 2018 nevertheless due to the relatively shallow flow depths under consideration errors arising from this assumption are not expected to be significant since depth averaged velocities are relatively small and other uncertainties related to the methodology may be expected for instance due to the trapping of seeding particles in the shallowest areas taking all these considerations into account and from a practical point of view the classical index velocity value of 0 85 was applied in this study 2 5 determination of flow discharges in addition to the surface velocity field the inflow discharges in the gully pots were measured for the 3 rainfall intensities in order to calibrate the 2d shallow water model a triangular weir was installed in two underground tanks placed under the gully pots in each tank an ultrasonic distance sensor ub500 18gm75 i v15 pepperl and fuchs was installed in order to measure the flow discharge over the triangular weir first the spikes of the 10 hz raw signal were removed using a moving median filter of 5 s replacing the peaks that overcome the double of the deviation by the median of this range then the flow in the gully pots was obtained by means of a depth flow pre calibration and a volume compensation performed because of the changes of depth in the reservoir when the flow is increasing or decreasing this methodology was described in more detail in naves et al 2017 3 results and discussion in this section the surface models from the traditional topographic survey and sfm photogrammetric data are first presented section 3 1 then we describe how the 2d shallow water model was used to simulate the runoff for 30 mm h 50 mm h and 80 mm h rain intensities with both topographies section 3 2 the measured discharges in physical model gully pots were used to calibrate the numerical model and the simulated velocity maps are then presented finally the experimental velocities obtained using the lspiv technique in the physical model are presented and compared with the numerical results section 3 3 3 1 elevation data and model discretization the elevation maps of the physical model obtained from the data point and the sfm topographic surveys are shown in fig 5 both topographies consist of a regular gridded data at 50 cm spatial resolution and of an sfm topography at 5 mm spatial resolution the comparison between these elevation maps is focused on the area along the first two meters next to the curb x 0 m to x 2 m the elevation of 40 points placed in this region was obtained from both topographies the rmse of the elevations was 2 9 mm indicating a high correlation between the topographies therefore the sfm technique allows us to obtain a similar accuracy with a larger spatial resolution the point data surface is smoother than the sfm surface and as expected from the model description and building specifications the transversal slope is higher and more uniform than the longitudinal slope the sfm topography shows a more irregular contour line definition and the presence of small transversal valleys and crests which serve as drainage channels orthogonal to the curb of the model as will be shown below theses surface irregularities found between the traditional and sfm surveys affect the modelled runoff velocities particularly in the case of low depths both topographies were converted to a raster format decimated to a resolution of 5 cm the model domain discretization was performed using a structured mesh made with triangular elements with edge sizes ranging from 5 cm to 7 cm the number of cells of the model is about 58 000 elements and was automatically generated from the raster files using the iber software cea and blade 2015 to highlight the differences in the domain discretization fig 6 shows a transversal profile at y 3 75 m upstream of gully pot 2 and two longitudinal profiles placed at x 0 75 and x 0 10 m representing the surface morphology upstream and between the gully pots respectively the gridded data mesh presents a visible quantization error caused by the coarse 50 cm resolution of the original data points the averaged slope of the profiles determined from the gridded point data and the sfm approach are similar but the sfm longitudinal profiles show some depressions of few millimeters depth at y 2 4 m y 3 3 m x 4 m and y 4 8 m which act as drainage channels 3 2 application of the 2d shallow water model the topographies presented in the previous section have been implemented in iber 2d shallow water model to analyze their influence in modelling the runoff for the three rainfalls here of 30 50 and 80 mm h and 5 min duration a common calibration dataset for all six cases two topographies and three rain intensities was defined in light of the discharges measured in the gully pots of the physical model a non formal calibration procedure was performed changing the manning coefficient and the initial losses of the concrete surface of the model an initial loss of 0 6 mm was fixed to assure that modelled and measured runoff volumes were similar the manning coefficient was set at 0 016 this value accounts for the extra bed roughness induced by the rainfall although the numerical model incorporates a variable depth manning formulation slight improvements with variable roughness parametrization are achieved this mainly in the recession and rising hydrographs limbs fraga et al 2013 which are not compared with the lspiv results as will be shown below from a practical point of view a constant roughness parametrization produces results with a similar accuracy to the variable roughness dependent formulations for the smooth surfaces cea et al 2014 a visual inspection of fig 7 reveals a very good fit between the outputs of the numerical model with both topographies and the experimental results using the previous model s inputs therefore if we look only at the discharges into the gully pots the traditional measured topography has enough resolution to properly model the overland flows while the sfm topography does not improve model accuracy figs 8 and 9 present the depth averaged velocity maps obtained for both topographies in steady conditions e g after 200 s from the beginning of the rainfall as numerical and experimental data do not match exactly numerical data has been spatially interpolated therefore to clarify the representation of the velocity vectors a spatial resolution of 16 cm was selected for the graphics regarding the general flow patterns in both model domains the runoff drains towards the two gully pots and the curb due to the transversal and the longitudinal slope but some preferential channel flows orthogonal to the curb direction appear when the sfm elevation map is used fig 9 although these preferential channel flows could also be sensed by using the traditional measured topography the higher resolution of the sfm technique results in far better defined drainage channels where the velocities are roughly five times the velocities in the areas between them furthermore the width and mean velocity of these transversal channels increased with rainfall intensity another difference observed in the flow pattern determined using each topography is related to a velocity reduction of the curb channel flow at the junctions with the transversal drainage channels this effect is more pronounced in sfm model domain at y 4 m where the more defined orthogonal junction between transversal and longitudinal overland flows produces a decrease in the average velocity of the curb flow in addition to these differences the overland flow obtained with the sfm model domain presents some areas with dry fronts due to the high sensitivity to the surface elevations variability in the shallowest depth conditions presented far away from the model curb thus considering the suitable performance of the gridded point data and sfm topographies for modelling gully pot discharges it becomes necessary to asses with experimental velocity data which approach gives a better representation of the runoff flow patterns this assessment will be performed using lspiv data in the following section 3 3 application of lspiv to determine overland flow velocities as mentioned in the section on methodology the surface velocities determined by applying the lspiv technique with fluorescent particles were converted to depth averaged velocities by applying a velocity index of 0 85 fig 10 shows the vector field for the rainfall intensities of 30 50 and 80 mm h represented with the same spatial resolution as figs 8 and 9 the orthogonal channels to the curb which were found by using the sfm topography appear clearly in the experimental results furthermore the decrease in the velocities in the junctions between the main transversal and the longitudinal flow channels noted in the previous section is also well registered by the experimental data regarding the velocities it can be noted that the lspiv and numerical results for sfm are of the same order of magnitude from the results obtained in fig 10 it can be seen that the lspiv methodology developed in this study appears to be a suitable tool for measuring overland flow velocities over very shallow water depth conditions in an area larger than 10 m2 and avoiding the presence of raindrop features in the recorded images using fluorescent particles in addition the importance of the uv illumination is noted in the furthest regions from the camera and torch positions where the higher the rain intensity the less accurate are the measurements e g y 1 m x 1 6 m this is caused by the interference of the raindrops with the light from the torches and the video recording so a brighter uv illumination should be considered in the case of larger areas being measured the match between the experimental results and the velocity fields obtained using both topographies have been investigated in the comparison carried out for each velocity component in fig 11 the comparison was limited to the area between gully pots and up to 1 5 m from the curb this to avoid the area where the lspiv measurements are less accurate due to irregular illumination firstly a clearly different performance can be observed in the comparison of the lspiv x velocities with both numerical results these x velocities correspond to the flow transverse to the curb where the drainage channels have been measured with the lspiv technique while the numerical results obtained using the traditional point data topography have an almost constant value ranging from 0 05 to 0 08 m s for the three rain intensities studied the sfm topography results are distributed in the range of variation of the experimental velocities e g following the 1 1 slope relationship this bias in the velocity distribution using the conventional topography is due to the fact that with the lower resolution associated with this topography the model is not able to reproduce the drainage channels and a homogeneous velocity results for all of this area regarding y velocities which correspond roughly to the curb flow both implemented topographies showed similar results with a slight increase of the dispersion in the case of those obtained using the sfm topography fig 12 presents the results as a histogram for each velocity component of the experimental data and the empirical probability density function obtained with the point data and sfm topographies for the three different rainfall intensities it can be seen that the distribution of the x velocity component and mean velocities is better represented with the sfm numerical model when comparing the velocity histograms fig 12a and c we can see that they have a similar shape which points to a good relation between experimental and numerical results obtained with the sfm topography the velocity distribution obtained with the traditional topographic survey model is concentrated in the range of 0 05 0 10 m s due the inaccurate representation of the drainage channels placed in a transversal direction to the physical model curb for the longitudinal velocity component fig 12b both numerical probability density functions have a similar shape although the calculated sfm presents a slightly larger dispersion than the gridded data values as is shown in the lower part of fig 11 in order to check and understand the different results obtained in the comparison of numerical and experimental data depth averaged mean velocity has been plotted in three sections of the model in fig 13 the chosen sections are intended to represent the different types of flows over the physical model surface first a longitudinal section x 0 75 m has been selected to compare the velocities distribution in the region of the drainage channels and to check how the higher resolution of the sfm topography allows us to represent channel velocity variation in the transversal flow furthermore an additional longitudinal section x 0 10 m and a cross section in y 3 75 m have been used to assess the curb flow and investigate the higher dispersion shown in figs 11 and 12 in the case of the sfm topography despite its higher resolution the uncertainty in the lspiv experimental results has been included by plotting the standard deviation of the measured velocities in the recorded interval looking at the first section x 0 75 m for all the rain intensities in fig 13 it can be noted that the numeric results from the point data measured topography is not able to simulate the drainage channels and keep an almost constant velocity value over the cross section especially between y 5 5 m and y 2 m however the model with the sfm elevations shows a reasonable agreement with the experimental data and fits the peaks where the velocity increases in the drainage channels with the exception to region ranging from y 1 to y 2 m the standard deviation of the experimental velocity is about 0 01 0 02 m s except for the bounds of the visualization domain where higher experimental errors are expected due to insufficient illumination in the case of the second section x 0 10 m the influence of the topography in the numeric results is apparently lower due to the higher flow depth developed next to the curb but although both numeric results simulate satisfactorily the increasing tendency of the curb flow velocity between the gully pots the sfm model is able to follow the shape of the velocity changes produced in the junctions between the transversal channels with the curb flow a slight variation of position being observed in the velocity peak around y 3 5 m finally the last transversal section shows a limitation of the sfm technique measuring the elevations of roughly the first centimeters next to the curb in that we can see the reduction of the velocities around this area compared with the traditional topographic survey and the experimental results these two discrepancies observed in the curb flow could explain the higher disparity presented by the y velocities from the sfm topography with respect to the experimental data observed and commented on in fig 11 however the photogrammetric technique provides a better fit in the rest of the section confirming their better performance in modelling the runoff that has been shown above overall it can be concluded that the sfm model has a higher correlation with the experimental measurements the results obtained with the sfm domain represent accurately the qualitative flow behavior although some quantitative differences have been highlighted in the position of some of the peaks of the cross sectional velocity profiles these differences could be attributed to errors in the determination of the elevation maps or in the determination of the velocity fields the errors related to the topography are more relevant in the areas with lower depths and close to the curb edge the errors in the velocity determinations are mainly located in some specific areas of the model due to a poor local particle illumination or related to the shallow water conditions tested in this study commonly lower than 1 cm in these conditions tracer particles can eventually settle as they can be trapped by pavement surface irregularities thus affecting the determined magnitude of the velocity vectors 4 conclusions in this study novel techniques such as sfm photogrammetry and a modified lspiv were applied in order to obtain using a 2d shallow water model an accurate representation of the overland runoff generated by three different rain intensities of 30 50 and 80 mm h in an urban drainage physical model based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn the sfm photogrammetric technique provided a fast and effective way to obtain an elevation map that differed in a rmse error of 2 9 mm from the traditional topographic survey coordinates of a regular rectangular grid of 0 5 m 0 5 m but with a spatial resolution 100 times higher the modelled discharges into the gully pots obtained with a 2d shallow water model with gridded and with sfm topographies are almost identical however clear differences appear when the overland velocity fields are compared the differences are due to the far higher spatial resolution of the sfm survey revealing the existence of drainage channels of a few milimeters depth placed orthogonally to the model curb in these drainage channels the local velocities increased due to the small scale irregularities of the surface by means of fluorescent particles and uv illumination lspiv was presented as a very useful non intrusive tool to accurately measure surface flow velocities in shallow water conditions of few milimeters depth with a high spatial resolution including the longitudinal and transversal channel curb flow in a medium size area of around 10 m2 and avoiding the presence of raindrops that might interfere in the measurements thus this study highlights not only the great value of the topographic modelling of surface flow in shallow water conditions and the importance of a detailed elevation map but also the need for additional surface velocity calibration data as well as the register of hydraulic variables in the sewer network to achieve useful and accurate surface flow results furthermore the findings of this study are intended to contribute to the development and improvement of new affordable techniques to measure these essential data and to be able to obtain a suitable surface flow representation to be used as the basis for wash off and flood risk assessment studies in urban

6330,physically based numerical modelling of surface processes in urban drainage such as pollutant wash off or the assessment of flood risks requires appropriate calibration and terrain elevation data to properly simulate the overland flows and thus to achieve useful results accordingly this study aims to obtain an accurate representation of the runoff generated by three different rain intensities 30 50 and 80 mm h in a full scale urban drainage physical model of 36 m2 the study focuses firstly on applying the structure from motion sfm photogrammetric technique to carry out a high resolution and accurate topographic survey this topography was implemented in a 2d shallow water model and the results were compared with those obtained using traditional data point measured topography negligible differences were found when comparing the two models with measured discharges at the physical model gully pots however significant differences were obtained in the velocity distributions especially in the shallowest flow areas where drainage channels of a few millimeters depth appeared in the high resolution topographic survey results from the numerical model were compared with overland flow velocities determined by applying a modified large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv methodology using fluorescent particles with the sfm topography the 2d model was able to obtain a better representation of the experimental data since small scale irregularities of the pavement surface could be represented in the model domain at the same time lspiv was presented as a very suitable tool for the accurate measurement of runoff velocities in urban drainage models avoiding the interference of raindrop features in the recorded images and with overland water depths in the order of few millimeters keywords lspiv large scale particle image velocimetry sfm structure from motion urban runoff physical model 2d shallow water model urban drainage 1 introduction physically based urban drainage models are commonly used tools to predict urban floods or sewer system discharges e g chen et al 2009 leandro et al 2009 neal et al 2009 the calibration of these models is often performed with data taken from the sewer network principally flow discharges and water depths e g seyoum et al 2011 hong et al 2016a nevertheless there are significant processes related to overland flows such as flood risk management e g martínez gomariz et al 2016 2017 2018 and the determination of the mobilization of the deposited pollutants over the street surface e g deletic et al 1997 egodawatta et al 2007 muthusamy et al 2018 in these applications a good characterization of the surface flow is essential to achieve useful and accurate results however the difficulty in obtaining data on velocity fields and depths in overland flows makes the calibration of models a difficult task leitão et al 2018 in addition to the need for appropriate hydraulic calibration data an accurate topography of the catchment is also required to simulate the urban runoff properly de almeida et al 2018 using inaccurate elevation maps for modelling the surface flow by means of a 2d shallow water model can lead to erroneous results regarding the determination of the extent of floods or flood risks hunter et al 2008 besides flood analysis in the study of sediment wash off during non extreme rain events the influence of the topography is also relevant in the model outputs thus sediment transport capacity is influenced by the small overland flows depths which may also hinder rainfall erosion capacity due to the impact of raindrops tomanovic and maksimocik 1996 these both factors increase the sensitivity of the model s results to the topography and at the same time make it more difficult to measure undisturbed water depths and overland flow velocities in order to calibrate the model furthermore in studies of this type such as the one developed by hong et al 2016a b an accurate spatial and temporal representation of the runoff is key to reducing the propagation of hydraulic uncertainties to the sediment transport equations since the hydraulic variables are used as an input for the flow driven erosion the transport and the eventual deposition of sediments hairsine and rose 1992a b the sensitivity to the model topography is greater in the case of small catchments or laboratory physical models where a reduced area is considered e g wijesiri et al 2015 naves et al 2017 muthusamy et al 2018 in typical urban flooding studies with 2d shallow water models the topography is usually derived from airborne lidar with a resolution of about 0 25 m to 1 00 m with root mean square errors rmse for elevations of about 5 15 cm hunter et al 2008 neal et al 2009 fraga et al 2016 this spatial resolution may be insufficiently accurate for a physically based approach of sediment wash off in which the elements of the digital terrain models are in the order of a few centimeters or even millimeters in such cases a terrestrial laser topography or on vehicle lidar hong et al 2016a combined with conventional topographic techniques can provide high resolution and precise elevation data but this implies a significant economic cost in this regard visualization techniques are presented as a possible low cost alternative to traditional methodologies for obtaining high resolution elevation grid data the photogrammetric technique structure from motion sfm which is based on stereoscopic principles allows the reconstruction of a 3d object by means of overlapping images traditional photogrammetric methods require the location and positioning of cameras or the location of ground control points to create a 3d object reconstruction in contrast sfm method solves the geometry and the position and orientation automatically using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping and offsetting of images westoby et al 2012 this greatly simplifies the methodology and makes it more affordable for non expert users although this technique is being used widely in river bathymetric applications see for instance the review in detert et al 2017 in the field of urban drainage the applications are still quite limited we can cite here only some previous studies developed by the current authors to determine the topography of sewer sediment deposits at the laboratory scale regueiro picallo et al 2018 as noted above a non adequate topography can lead to the erroneous modelling of spatial and temporal surface flow distributions but even with a very accurate digital terrain model measured data such as discharges water depth and flow velocities are required in order to calibrate and validate models and thus to obtain useful results hunter et al 2008 the measurement of shallow flows generated in urban catchment surfaces do not allow for the use of traditional methods since these techniques interfere with the observed flow likewise flow sensors used in pipe flows are often quite large and affect to the determination of the hydraulic variables the non intrusive particle image velocimetry piv techniques are considered a suitable solution and are commonly used in laboratory and field studies to obtain velocity field datasets adrian 1991 raffel et al 2007 piv determines the displacement of particles seeded in the flow using cross correlation methods on two image frames with a known time step between them large scale piv lspiv proposed by fujita et al 1998 uses particles or other traces on the surface of the water flow which are supposed to follow the same velocity this variant uses the surface of the flow as the measurable plane so it is easier to apply to field and realistic studies since the area under study can be much larger and expensive equipment such as complex lasers or cameras are not needed therefore lspiv methods are generally applied to measure surface velocities rather than depth averaged velocities and errors in the determination of depth averaged flow velocities may become more significant at higher flow depths lspiv is commonly used in river surveys le coz et al 2010 muste et al 2011 to determine river discharges in order to transform surface velocities into depth averaged velocities and subsequently the discharge a velocity index of 0 85 is typically used although this correction factor is not appropriate for all measurement situations and depends on flow nature flow regime steady or un steady and bed roughness muste et al 2011 furthermore the lspiv technique has also been used for measuring shallow water flows in laboratory studies weitbrecht et al 2002 for example kantoush et al 2008 and novak et al 2017 apply lspiv to investigate the flow field using artificial particles in a rectangular shallow reservoir and in an open channel flow respectively in the case of arques et al 2018 by synchronizing four cameras it was possible to resolve a large measurement area of 4 8 m 1 22 m with high resolution lspiv in the field of urban drainage some studies using lspiv in high water level conditions during flood events have recently been published guillén et al 2017 presented a new approach to the study of the vulnerability of vehicles and people where the lspiv method is used to obtain superficial velocities from a domestic video martins et al 2018 performed an extensive comparison between experimentally measured and numerically modelled flows for different manhole grate configurations for this purpose a detailed characterization of the velocity fields around these elements was performed by means of lspiv leitão et al 2018 presented the use of surveillance camera footage as a low maintenance and easy to install alternative to measure surface flow by means of this image velocimetry however in the case of very shallow depths in non extreme rain events only a very preliminary measurement of the velocity of a small area using artificial tracers was found branisavljević and prodanović 2006 because of its solid performance in the different studies cited above lspiv can be considered as a suitable technique for obtaining velocity field datasets with low water levels in urban areas nevertheless due to small water depths here commonly lower than 1 cm and the presence of raindrops which impact on the water surface and interfere in the surface flow and the recorded images the accurate measurement of the velocities is a highly challenging task this study aims to achieve an accurate representation of the overland runoff in a full scale urban drainage physical model to be used as the basis for an application of a physically based sediment wash off 2d shallow water model due to the low depths developed in the laboratory model and the size of the catchment this study focuses firstly on measuring a high resolution topographic data using a low cost photogrammetric technique allowing thus for the proper simulation of the surface flow with a 2d shallow water model then a hydraulic experimental characterization of the runoff is measured under controlled laboratory conditions to calibrate and assess the numeric results obtained the maximum depths of around 5 8 mm and the presence of raindrops that interfere in the visualization of the surface flow made it necessary to develop a modified lspiv methodology using fluorescent particles to the authors knowledge no previous urban drainage studies have applied lspiv during rainfall events therefore the present study is novel in the following ways the sfm technique is used to obtain a high resolution and accurate elevation map of an urban drainage physical model of 36 m2 extreme shallow surface flow is measured in the presence of raindrops with a modified lspiv methodology by means of fluorescent particles the photogrammetric topography and a traditional topographic survey using a gridded system have been implemented in a 2d shallow water model in order to validate both digital terrain models with the measured lspiv velocity fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 physical model description experimental testing was undertaken in the hydraulic laboratory of the centre of technological innovation in construction and civil engineering citeec at the university of a coruña the installation consists of a full scale street section with a rainfall simulator located 2 6 m over a 36 m2 concrete street surface divided into a tiled pavement and a roadway fig 1 the runoff generated by rain drains into a sewer drainage system by means of three gully pots two of these located along the curb and a third one at the end of a lateral outflow channel the gully pot grate was removed in the tests to allow sampling of water quality parameters in them in a series of wash off experiments not shown here the surface has an approximate transversal slope of 2 up to the 0 15 m high concrete curb and a 0 5 longitudinal slope up to the outflow channel a more detailed description of the physical model can be found in naves et al 2017 the rainfall simulator consists of two overlapped circuits of pipes with pressure compensating irrigation drippers pcj cnl netafimtm inserted in a grid layout the transversal and longitudinal distance between drippers in each circuit is 0 2 m 25 drippers per square meter and the flow generated by one dripper is 1 2 and 2 l h respectively this configuration makes it possible to simulate rainfall with a rain intensity of 30 mm h 50 mm h and if both circuits are used at the same time 80 mm h a metallic welded wire mesh with 3 mm square openings situated 0 6 m below the grids of drippers breaks and distributes the generated raindrops to achieve a suitable uniformity and drop size distribution the rain intensity distribution was measured from the volume collected in a 0 5 m 0 5 m grid of vessels for 5 min the obtained christiansen uniformity coefficients christiansen 1942 values for 30 mm h 50 m h and 80 mm h were 76 88 and 91 respectively hence the rain can be considered almost uniform 2 2 surface model topography 2 2 1 traditional point data survey the 3d coordinates of a total of 144 points were determined over the whole surface of the physical model in a 0 5 m 0 5 m grid the x and y coordinates of each point of the grid were determined by triangulation from two reference points while the z coordinate was obtained by measuring the distance to a horizontal reference laser plane with a point gage tape the error bounds of the measured horizontal coordinates were assumed to be approximately 1 cm for the horizontal coordinates and about 1 mm for the vertical coordinates boiten 2003 the position of the points used for the topographic survey was drawn over the street surface with red crosses see fig 4 these marks were also used as reference points in the visualization techniques carried out in this study 2 2 2 structure from motion survey the sfm photogrammetric technique was applied to obtain a high resolution elevations map of the physical model surface the first step was to take a total of 64 images from different positions around the surface with a lumix gh4 camera focal length equal to 28 mm and image resolution 3264 2448 pixels then the free license software visualsfm wu et al 2011 wu 2013 was used to perform the 3d reconstruction of the physical model surface this software uses triangulation to obtain the relative position of different features of the studied object which appear in several images at the same time therefore it is necessary to ensure an overlap of the images of around 60 to increase the number of resulting points in addition enough contrast in the surface of the measured object is also needed in order to distinguish and correlate the common points between the images in this particular case the concrete surface is very homogeneous and it was no possible to apply directly the sfm technique because the software cannot identify different features in the pictures to avoid this problem a colored and texturized image was projected over the surface of the model while the images were taken and in this way a sufficiently dense point cloud was obtained fig 2 a 976 000 elements dense point cloud in a relative coordinate system was obtained by means of the sfm technique a total number of 5 ground reference points previously determined in the traditional data topographic survey were used to scale and transform the point clouds to a coordinate system that was already known this procedure was carried out with the open source software meshlab cignoni et al 2008 the rmse resulting from the differences between the final coordinates and the calibration ground points was 2 2 mm finally the screened poisson surface reconstruction in meshlab kazhdan and hoppe 2013 and a 40 60 elements two dimensional median filter method was applied to the scaled and positioned point cloud in order to obtain a 5 mm squared despiked grid 2 3 numerical model the iber model www iberaula es was used to assess the effect of the different measured topographies in the overland flow velocity distribution and flow discharges into the model gully pots the surface drainage model solves the 2d shallow water equations including rainfall and infiltration terms with an explicit un structured finite volume solver the model has been validated in previous studies under overland flow conditions including rainfall runoff transformation cea et al 2010 cea and blade 2015 the surface runoff model iber has also been implemented in the dual drainage model of the authors research team which has already been validated in field applications fraga et al 2016 and in the same physical model presented in this study fraga et al 2015 a detailed and comprehensive description of the numerical model and solver can be found in the previously cited studies following fraga et al 2015 all the boundary conditions of the model were imposed as free critical depth discharge in the present study gully pots were not treated with any special stage discharge curve as the gully pots grates were removed 2 4 determination of overland flow velocity fields the lspiv technique was used to obtain the velocity field of the superficial flow within the first two meters of the pavement placed next to the curb of the physical model this area presents the highest depths and velocities due to the transversal slope of the street model and it is the most interesting part from an urban wash off point of view since it is known that most of the sediments build up in the first 0 5 m sartor and boyd 1972 grottker 1987 lspiv are based on the analysis of the frames obtained from a video recording of some type of tracer that is supposed to follow the velocities of the superficial flow so the selection of a suitable tracer and the correct way of recording the video are essential before beginning the experiments 2 4 1 experimental setup two lumix gh4 cameras were used to apply the lspiv technique both cameras used a focal length of 28 mm and were set to record video frames of size 3840x2178 pixels and a frame rate of 25 hz the cameras were positioned 2 2 m above the side of the pathway the camera configuration ensures the detection of small particles around 1 mm diameter and allows for the recording of an area large enough to capture the half length of the physical model curb fig 3 the conditions of the experiments must be taken into account in the selection of the particles used as a tracer first the particles have to be small and light enough to be transported by the flow considering the low depths developed in the surface of the physical model the maximum depths for the maximum rain intensity are below 10 mm next to the curb and around 3 mm on the rest of the surface furthermore the presence of raindrops between the cameras and the water surface and their impacts on it produces different image patterns that affect the accuracy of piv algorithms which are not able to distinguish between tracers and these other picture features to deal with this problem fluorescent ultraviolet uv particles and lamps were used to illuminate the physical model fluorescent particles have been used in the past in piv applications to improve the quality of the acquired images allowing measurements close to laser reflective surfaces such as sediment beds or free surfaces pedocchi et al 2008 in our study we produce inexpensive lspiv particles by cutting an extruded 3d printer fluorescent strand into pieces these fluorescent particles 0 85 mm mean size react with the shining uv light so that in dark conditions it is possible to highlight the particles distinguishing them from the rest of the disturbing features in the images such as raindrops or water reflections therefore five uv 100 led torches 390 nm wavelength were placed next to the cameras and pointing at the surface in order to illuminate homogeneously the measured surface during the experiments in the fig 3 a scheme of the experimental setup is shown 2 4 2 experimental procedure for each of the three rain intensities that the rainfall simulator can generate the measure of the superficial flow by means of the lspiv technique began by turning off the ambient laboratory lights while the cameras were recording then the uv torches were turned on and the rain started once steady conditions were reached after approximately 150 s particles were spread manually along the side of the roadway during the rest of the experiment which has a total rainfall duration of 300 s this allows the particles to be transported to the measurement area without causing disturbances in the flow or in the video and we ensure the recording of at least one minute of a suitable particles flow in steady conditions at the measurement area 2 4 3 image processing and lspiv data analysis once the experiment was finished 1500 frames 60 s were extracted from the video as recorded in steady flow conditions the frames were processed with the procedure schematized in fig 4 which consists of the following steps 2 4 3 1 spatial calibration the angle of view of the cameras and the lens distortion cause a deformation in the video frames recorded so the extracted frames from the video sequences were dewarped to correct image perspective and to convert the image units from pixels to real world metrics this procedure was performed using a spatial calibration of the images using the red cross marks drawn on the model surface during the gridded point data topographic survey the point coordinates were used as a reference to transform the camera frames to an orthogonal cartesian coordinate system in each experiment and for each camera the standard matlab algorithm fitgeotrans was applied to one frame recorded in normal light conditions a total number of 28 and 24 reference points with known 2d coordinates were identified in the calibration frame of each camera the software provided a rototranslation matrix to transform the frames recorded during the experiments in these new scaled and orthoreferenced images obtained by applying the matrix 1 pixel corresponds to 1 mm in real world coordinates finally the common referenced points between the cameras were used to crop and join the image a similar procedure for image calibration was performed by arques et al 2018 the final position of all the reference points in the calibrated image was compared with the known coordinates obtaining a maximum error of about 2 in the total displacement between marks this calibration procedure was applied for each experiment to avoid errors because of possible small movements or tilts of the cameras between experiments the time synchronization between cameras was done through identifying the frame at the moment that the lights of the laboratory was turned off the process is very fast and it is easy to identify the first frame recorded in dark conditions so this method provided the maximum possible accuracy which is equal to the time step between frames 0 04 s 2 4 3 2 piv data analysis before the application of the piv cross correlation algorithms to the recorded images the rectified and merged images were converted to grey scale and a moving sliding background with a 0 25 threshold filter was then applied thus in each frame those pixels with 25 of similarity in the grey value with the same pixel from the previous frame were transformed to black the application of the sliding background filter reduces the effect of background image features such as surface microtopography roughness or tracer particles that settled temporarily on the shallowest or dry flow regions the velocity of these particles would be zero and the mean velocity estimation in the interrogation area is biased for the determination of the instantaneous velocity maps the open source piv tool for matlab pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 was used an adaptive cross correlation procedure was performed using squared interrogation areas of 128 64 and 32 pixels resulting in a regular grid of velocity vectors of 3 2 cm and 0 04 s of resolution to estimate the cross correlation between frames an fft approach was used and in the final step a window deformation scheme was applied to increase piv accuracy raffel et al 2007 2 4 3 3 piv data post processing and velocity calculation once the velocity fields were obtained the possible outliers were detected with a temporal 2d filter using a phase space thresholding method developed by goring and nikora 2002 taking into account both velocity components in each point throughout the duration of the experiment the filter removes less than the 8 of the velocity vectors then these outliers were replaced by means of a linear interpolation following cea et al 2007 in fig 4 lower part a real example of the performance of the temporal 2d filter in a selected point in one experiment can be seen finally in the matlab toolbox pivmat environment moisy 2017 a spatial median filter of 3x3 elements was performance to all the frames the obtained velocity fields correspond to the surface flow velocity in order to obtain the mean depth averaged velocity value it is necessary to determine a velocity index or flow velocity correction factor in river surveys the determination of the velocity index is based on the application of the log law velocity profile to the streamwise velocities le coz et al 2010 for the complex shallow flows developed in urban surfaces this assumption may be questionable and some authors use different velocity index values ranging roughly from 0 6 to 1 e g leitão et al 2018 martins et al 2018 nevertheless due to the relatively shallow flow depths under consideration errors arising from this assumption are not expected to be significant since depth averaged velocities are relatively small and other uncertainties related to the methodology may be expected for instance due to the trapping of seeding particles in the shallowest areas taking all these considerations into account and from a practical point of view the classical index velocity value of 0 85 was applied in this study 2 5 determination of flow discharges in addition to the surface velocity field the inflow discharges in the gully pots were measured for the 3 rainfall intensities in order to calibrate the 2d shallow water model a triangular weir was installed in two underground tanks placed under the gully pots in each tank an ultrasonic distance sensor ub500 18gm75 i v15 pepperl and fuchs was installed in order to measure the flow discharge over the triangular weir first the spikes of the 10 hz raw signal were removed using a moving median filter of 5 s replacing the peaks that overcome the double of the deviation by the median of this range then the flow in the gully pots was obtained by means of a depth flow pre calibration and a volume compensation performed because of the changes of depth in the reservoir when the flow is increasing or decreasing this methodology was described in more detail in naves et al 2017 3 results and discussion in this section the surface models from the traditional topographic survey and sfm photogrammetric data are first presented section 3 1 then we describe how the 2d shallow water model was used to simulate the runoff for 30 mm h 50 mm h and 80 mm h rain intensities with both topographies section 3 2 the measured discharges in physical model gully pots were used to calibrate the numerical model and the simulated velocity maps are then presented finally the experimental velocities obtained using the lspiv technique in the physical model are presented and compared with the numerical results section 3 3 3 1 elevation data and model discretization the elevation maps of the physical model obtained from the data point and the sfm topographic surveys are shown in fig 5 both topographies consist of a regular gridded data at 50 cm spatial resolution and of an sfm topography at 5 mm spatial resolution the comparison between these elevation maps is focused on the area along the first two meters next to the curb x 0 m to x 2 m the elevation of 40 points placed in this region was obtained from both topographies the rmse of the elevations was 2 9 mm indicating a high correlation between the topographies therefore the sfm technique allows us to obtain a similar accuracy with a larger spatial resolution the point data surface is smoother than the sfm surface and as expected from the model description and building specifications the transversal slope is higher and more uniform than the longitudinal slope the sfm topography shows a more irregular contour line definition and the presence of small transversal valleys and crests which serve as drainage channels orthogonal to the curb of the model as will be shown below theses surface irregularities found between the traditional and sfm surveys affect the modelled runoff velocities particularly in the case of low depths both topographies were converted to a raster format decimated to a resolution of 5 cm the model domain discretization was performed using a structured mesh made with triangular elements with edge sizes ranging from 5 cm to 7 cm the number of cells of the model is about 58 000 elements and was automatically generated from the raster files using the iber software cea and blade 2015 to highlight the differences in the domain discretization fig 6 shows a transversal profile at y 3 75 m upstream of gully pot 2 and two longitudinal profiles placed at x 0 75 and x 0 10 m representing the surface morphology upstream and between the gully pots respectively the gridded data mesh presents a visible quantization error caused by the coarse 50 cm resolution of the original data points the averaged slope of the profiles determined from the gridded point data and the sfm approach are similar but the sfm longitudinal profiles show some depressions of few millimeters depth at y 2 4 m y 3 3 m x 4 m and y 4 8 m which act as drainage channels 3 2 application of the 2d shallow water model the topographies presented in the previous section have been implemented in iber 2d shallow water model to analyze their influence in modelling the runoff for the three rainfalls here of 30 50 and 80 mm h and 5 min duration a common calibration dataset for all six cases two topographies and three rain intensities was defined in light of the discharges measured in the gully pots of the physical model a non formal calibration procedure was performed changing the manning coefficient and the initial losses of the concrete surface of the model an initial loss of 0 6 mm was fixed to assure that modelled and measured runoff volumes were similar the manning coefficient was set at 0 016 this value accounts for the extra bed roughness induced by the rainfall although the numerical model incorporates a variable depth manning formulation slight improvements with variable roughness parametrization are achieved this mainly in the recession and rising hydrographs limbs fraga et al 2013 which are not compared with the lspiv results as will be shown below from a practical point of view a constant roughness parametrization produces results with a similar accuracy to the variable roughness dependent formulations for the smooth surfaces cea et al 2014 a visual inspection of fig 7 reveals a very good fit between the outputs of the numerical model with both topographies and the experimental results using the previous model s inputs therefore if we look only at the discharges into the gully pots the traditional measured topography has enough resolution to properly model the overland flows while the sfm topography does not improve model accuracy figs 8 and 9 present the depth averaged velocity maps obtained for both topographies in steady conditions e g after 200 s from the beginning of the rainfall as numerical and experimental data do not match exactly numerical data has been spatially interpolated therefore to clarify the representation of the velocity vectors a spatial resolution of 16 cm was selected for the graphics regarding the general flow patterns in both model domains the runoff drains towards the two gully pots and the curb due to the transversal and the longitudinal slope but some preferential channel flows orthogonal to the curb direction appear when the sfm elevation map is used fig 9 although these preferential channel flows could also be sensed by using the traditional measured topography the higher resolution of the sfm technique results in far better defined drainage channels where the velocities are roughly five times the velocities in the areas between them furthermore the width and mean velocity of these transversal channels increased with rainfall intensity another difference observed in the flow pattern determined using each topography is related to a velocity reduction of the curb channel flow at the junctions with the transversal drainage channels this effect is more pronounced in sfm model domain at y 4 m where the more defined orthogonal junction between transversal and longitudinal overland flows produces a decrease in the average velocity of the curb flow in addition to these differences the overland flow obtained with the sfm model domain presents some areas with dry fronts due to the high sensitivity to the surface elevations variability in the shallowest depth conditions presented far away from the model curb thus considering the suitable performance of the gridded point data and sfm topographies for modelling gully pot discharges it becomes necessary to asses with experimental velocity data which approach gives a better representation of the runoff flow patterns this assessment will be performed using lspiv data in the following section 3 3 application of lspiv to determine overland flow velocities as mentioned in the section on methodology the surface velocities determined by applying the lspiv technique with fluorescent particles were converted to depth averaged velocities by applying a velocity index of 0 85 fig 10 shows the vector field for the rainfall intensities of 30 50 and 80 mm h represented with the same spatial resolution as figs 8 and 9 the orthogonal channels to the curb which were found by using the sfm topography appear clearly in the experimental results furthermore the decrease in the velocities in the junctions between the main transversal and the longitudinal flow channels noted in the previous section is also well registered by the experimental data regarding the velocities it can be noted that the lspiv and numerical results for sfm are of the same order of magnitude from the results obtained in fig 10 it can be seen that the lspiv methodology developed in this study appears to be a suitable tool for measuring overland flow velocities over very shallow water depth conditions in an area larger than 10 m2 and avoiding the presence of raindrop features in the recorded images using fluorescent particles in addition the importance of the uv illumination is noted in the furthest regions from the camera and torch positions where the higher the rain intensity the less accurate are the measurements e g y 1 m x 1 6 m this is caused by the interference of the raindrops with the light from the torches and the video recording so a brighter uv illumination should be considered in the case of larger areas being measured the match between the experimental results and the velocity fields obtained using both topographies have been investigated in the comparison carried out for each velocity component in fig 11 the comparison was limited to the area between gully pots and up to 1 5 m from the curb this to avoid the area where the lspiv measurements are less accurate due to irregular illumination firstly a clearly different performance can be observed in the comparison of the lspiv x velocities with both numerical results these x velocities correspond to the flow transverse to the curb where the drainage channels have been measured with the lspiv technique while the numerical results obtained using the traditional point data topography have an almost constant value ranging from 0 05 to 0 08 m s for the three rain intensities studied the sfm topography results are distributed in the range of variation of the experimental velocities e g following the 1 1 slope relationship this bias in the velocity distribution using the conventional topography is due to the fact that with the lower resolution associated with this topography the model is not able to reproduce the drainage channels and a homogeneous velocity results for all of this area regarding y velocities which correspond roughly to the curb flow both implemented topographies showed similar results with a slight increase of the dispersion in the case of those obtained using the sfm topography fig 12 presents the results as a histogram for each velocity component of the experimental data and the empirical probability density function obtained with the point data and sfm topographies for the three different rainfall intensities it can be seen that the distribution of the x velocity component and mean velocities is better represented with the sfm numerical model when comparing the velocity histograms fig 12a and c we can see that they have a similar shape which points to a good relation between experimental and numerical results obtained with the sfm topography the velocity distribution obtained with the traditional topographic survey model is concentrated in the range of 0 05 0 10 m s due the inaccurate representation of the drainage channels placed in a transversal direction to the physical model curb for the longitudinal velocity component fig 12b both numerical probability density functions have a similar shape although the calculated sfm presents a slightly larger dispersion than the gridded data values as is shown in the lower part of fig 11 in order to check and understand the different results obtained in the comparison of numerical and experimental data depth averaged mean velocity has been plotted in three sections of the model in fig 13 the chosen sections are intended to represent the different types of flows over the physical model surface first a longitudinal section x 0 75 m has been selected to compare the velocities distribution in the region of the drainage channels and to check how the higher resolution of the sfm topography allows us to represent channel velocity variation in the transversal flow furthermore an additional longitudinal section x 0 10 m and a cross section in y 3 75 m have been used to assess the curb flow and investigate the higher dispersion shown in figs 11 and 12 in the case of the sfm topography despite its higher resolution the uncertainty in the lspiv experimental results has been included by plotting the standard deviation of the measured velocities in the recorded interval looking at the first section x 0 75 m for all the rain intensities in fig 13 it can be noted that the numeric results from the point data measured topography is not able to simulate the drainage channels and keep an almost constant velocity value over the cross section especially between y 5 5 m and y 2 m however the model with the sfm elevations shows a reasonable agreement with the experimental data and fits the peaks where the velocity increases in the drainage channels with the exception to region ranging from y 1 to y 2 m the standard deviation of the experimental velocity is about 0 01 0 02 m s except for the bounds of the visualization domain where higher experimental errors are expected due to insufficient illumination in the case of the second section x 0 10 m the influence of the topography in the numeric results is apparently lower due to the higher flow depth developed next to the curb but although both numeric results simulate satisfactorily the increasing tendency of the curb flow velocity between the gully pots the sfm model is able to follow the shape of the velocity changes produced in the junctions between the transversal channels with the curb flow a slight variation of position being observed in the velocity peak around y 3 5 m finally the last transversal section shows a limitation of the sfm technique measuring the elevations of roughly the first centimeters next to the curb in that we can see the reduction of the velocities around this area compared with the traditional topographic survey and the experimental results these two discrepancies observed in the curb flow could explain the higher disparity presented by the y velocities from the sfm topography with respect to the experimental data observed and commented on in fig 11 however the photogrammetric technique provides a better fit in the rest of the section confirming their better performance in modelling the runoff that has been shown above overall it can be concluded that the sfm model has a higher correlation with the experimental measurements the results obtained with the sfm domain represent accurately the qualitative flow behavior although some quantitative differences have been highlighted in the position of some of the peaks of the cross sectional velocity profiles these differences could be attributed to errors in the determination of the elevation maps or in the determination of the velocity fields the errors related to the topography are more relevant in the areas with lower depths and close to the curb edge the errors in the velocity determinations are mainly located in some specific areas of the model due to a poor local particle illumination or related to the shallow water conditions tested in this study commonly lower than 1 cm in these conditions tracer particles can eventually settle as they can be trapped by pavement surface irregularities thus affecting the determined magnitude of the velocity vectors 4 conclusions in this study novel techniques such as sfm photogrammetry and a modified lspiv were applied in order to obtain using a 2d shallow water model an accurate representation of the overland runoff generated by three different rain intensities of 30 50 and 80 mm h in an urban drainage physical model based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn the sfm photogrammetric technique provided a fast and effective way to obtain an elevation map that differed in a rmse error of 2 9 mm from the traditional topographic survey coordinates of a regular rectangular grid of 0 5 m 0 5 m but with a spatial resolution 100 times higher the modelled discharges into the gully pots obtained with a 2d shallow water model with gridded and with sfm topographies are almost identical however clear differences appear when the overland velocity fields are compared the differences are due to the far higher spatial resolution of the sfm survey revealing the existence of drainage channels of a few milimeters depth placed orthogonally to the model curb in these drainage channels the local velocities increased due to the small scale irregularities of the surface by means of fluorescent particles and uv illumination lspiv was presented as a very useful non intrusive tool to accurately measure surface flow velocities in shallow water conditions of few milimeters depth with a high spatial resolution including the longitudinal and transversal channel curb flow in a medium size area of around 10 m2 and avoiding the presence of raindrops that might interfere in the measurements thus this study highlights not only the great value of the topographic modelling of surface flow in shallow water conditions and the importance of a detailed elevation map but also the need for additional surface velocity calibration data as well as the register of hydraulic variables in the sewer network to achieve useful and accurate surface flow results furthermore the findings of this study are intended to contribute to the development and improvement of new affordable techniques to measure these essential data and to be able to obtain a suitable surface flow representation to be used as the basis for wash off and flood risk assessment studies in urban

6331,structural parametric and measurement uncertainties are inherent in watershed hydrology models among these structural uncertainty results from simplified representation of reality in models and has proven to be particularly challenging to characterize often flow measurements are available at the outlet or a few other locations within a watershed and distributed model parameters are calibrated to replicate observed streamflow values subsequently one can quantify uncertainty in streamflow estimation at the measured locations the objective of this study is the quantification of structural and parametric uncertainty at unmeasured locations using a calibrated watershed hydrologic model while propagation of parametric uncertainty to unmeasured locations is a relatively simple task in a bayesian framework this study is focused on the problem of structural uncertainty propagation we propose to treat the hydrologic model as a stochastic function by treating the parameters of the model as random quantities even in the limit of infinite information through data thus enabling us to accommodate the uncertainty due to structural errors a mathematical formulation of the method and applications over two different watersheds using hourly and daily flow data are presented the structural uncertainty band at ungauged locations enveloped all the streamflow observations at daily scale and missed most of the observations at hourly scale structural uncertainty varies spatially at unmeasured locations within the watershed consequently streamflows estimated at unmeasured locations may be accompanied by wide uncertainty bands implying the need for caution when using them keywords parametric uncertainty structural uncertainty streamflow geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph generalized gaussian process covariance matrix 1 introduction modeling of hydrologic processes incurs errors due to uncertainty in various forms most hydrologic models have parameters that are estimated through calibration by matching observed streamflows at a measurement location typically the outlet of the watershed to model output streamflows at that location there may be more than one set of parameters that provide similar fits to the observed streamflows due to equifinality beven and binley 1992 also referred to as unidentifiability smith 2014 additionally parameter uncertainty exists due to limited number of observations hydrologic models are simplifications resulting in incomplete representation of reality this lack of our ability to perfectly model real world processes introduces structural uncertainty even if one knows the true parameters of the model streamflow estimation may deviate from true streamflow because of structural errors true parameter values of a model might refer to the best fitting or the actual physical values in hydrologic models some of the parameters don t have any physical significance since the best fitting parameter values compensate for structural errors true parameter value can be thought of as the ones that will reproduce streamflow observations if there are no structural errors and observations are error free other names for structural uncertainty are model inadequacy kennedy and o hagan 2001 and model discrepancy smith 2014 additionally errors in the measurements of streamflow and rainfall introduce measurement uncertainty uncertainty in streamflow and rainfall measurements are also referred to as output and input uncertainty although researchers nearing et al 2016 have argued that measurement uncertainty is in fact structural uncertainty we prefer to use the term measurement uncertainty because there is an important difference between the two a modeler cannot reduce measurement uncertainty while structural uncertainty may be reduced furthermore it is tempting to claim that the parameters of a model can be calibrated to compensate for structural errors and therefore it is not required to explicitly acknowledge structural errors in a model gaganis 2009 højberg and refsgaard 2005 madsen 2000 xu et al 2017 but this is true only if one wants to estimate best fitting parameters at a measurement location for a realistic quantification of total uncertainty in streamflow estimation explicit modeling of structural uncertainty is necessary maccallum and o hagan 2015 in a generic modeling framework as in 1 parametric uncertainty in streamflow estimation is quantified by propagating uncertainty in hydrologic model parameters to streamflow while structural and measurement uncertainties in streamflow estimation are derived from the error model there are many studies on the quantification of the different types of uncertainties at a measured location abbaspour et al 2004 ajami et al 2007 bulygina and gupta 2009 götzinger and bárdossy 2008 montanari and grossi 2008 renard et al 2010 schoups and vrugt 2010 thiemann et al 2001 thyer et al 2009 wilkinson et al 2011 however to the best of our knowledge there are no attempts to quantify the different kinds of uncertainty at unmeasured locations using streamflow data at a measured location the propagation of parametric uncertainty from measured to unmeasured locations is a comparatively simple task montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 lin and beck 2012 but a framework for propagation of structural uncertainty is lacking traditionally structural uncertainty has been modeled using gaussian processes gps that require specification of a functional form for the covariance function kennedy and o hagan 2001 also see lin and beck 2012 reichert and mieleitner 2009 for an alternate method the covariance function itself has a few parameters called hyper parameters hyper parameters are estimated to fit the observed residual series assuming that the obtained residual series is due to structural and measurement errors the key is the selection of an appropriate covariance function that is flexible enough to capture the relationship among residuals at different time steps a gaussian kernel is a popular choice to this end williams and rasmussen 2006 though gaussian covariance function is capable of modeling any kind of residual series obtained in hydrological modeling it cannot be used directly to propagate structural uncertainty from measured to unmeasured locations because the magnitude of structural uncertainty depends upon input rainfall as explained later in this section assuming the dependence of structural uncertainty on input rainfall and recognizing the fact that the rainfall in the drainage areas of different nodes in a watershed is different a gp with traditional covariance function calibrated to model structural uncertainty at a measured node cannot be used to estimate structural uncertainty at unmeasured nodes the following example illustrates this limitation consider the river networks as shown in fig 1 a and b where let us say we know the rainfall over the entire watershed and the corresponding streamflow at the outlet what can we say about the uncertainty in streamflows at other nodes if we know the exact model without any structural errors for converting rainfall into streamflow we can use a bayesian framework to estimate a posterior distribution over parameters and subsequently the uncertainty in streamflow at all the nodes we do not have the exact model in watershed hydrology which suggests that the simulated streamflow may be treated as a random process for a given set of model parameters we need to infer the parameters of streamflow distribution for example hyper parameters of a gp given the model parameters since the observations of streamflow are available only at the outlet the hyper parameters of the gp would be biased to fit the residuals at the outlet for estimation of parameters of streamflow distribution at other nodes a relationship between parameters at different nodes is required necessitating the relationship between hyper parameters of the gps at different locations to the best of our knowledge the dependence of structural uncertainty on input rainfall has rarely been explicitly mentioned in the literature see wilkinson et al 2011 for an exception the following arguments support the hypothesis of dependence of structural uncertainty on input rainfall a the processes that are missing from a hydrologic model would depend upon rainfall because rainfall drives hydrologic process directly or indirectly for example let us assume that a hydrologic model excludes the infiltration process and clearly the amount of infiltration is limited by amount of rainfall let the maximum rate of infiltration be i m a x then for two different rainfall rates r 1 i m a x and r 2 i m a x amount of extra rainfall that is added to excess rainfall would be r 1 and r 2 this error in excess rainfall will eventually propagate to streamflow b it is a well known fact that the errors in streamflow estimation are dependent upon magnitude of streamflow see sorooshian and dracup 1980 for an example of heteroscedasticity of measurement errors and the magnitude of streamflow values at the different locations in a watershed would be different because of different amount of rainfall in drainage areas of different locations therefore the magnitude of errors in streamflow at different locations would be different while often neglected there is a need for modeling structural uncertainty at both measured and unmeasured locations there are two major questions about the propagation of structural uncertainty 1 what is the model to be used for structural uncertainty that is dependent upon input to the model and 2 can we find a relationship between parameters of structural uncertainty models at different locations in a watershed none of the existing methods attempt to answer these two questions in this study we attempt to answer these two questions with a focus on the propagation of uncertainty especially structural uncertainty from a measured location to unmeasured locations 2 proposed solution in this section a potential method to address structural uncertainty propagation is formulated the vector quantities are denoted by small bold letters matrices are denoted by capital letters and scalar quantities are denoted by regular font 2 1 modeling structural uncertainty in the absence of equifinality the parameters of a model would converge to a point in the parameter space doherty and welter 2010 if infinite amount of information is available through data for the estimation of parameters therefore in this limit the model yields a deterministic streamflow time series for an observed rainfall time series however no amount of streamflow data can reduce the structural errors associated with the model beven 2005 an approximate equation would remain approximate also there are convincing arguments to support the conclusion that structural uncertainty should be modeled by treating the hydrologic model as a stochastic function see montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 therefore the idea is to introduce stochasticity in the model by perturbing the optimal parameters of the model this stochasticity should be irreducible by the data practically we always have finite amount of data available in that case stochasticity implies augmentation of existing uncertainty similarly in the presence of equifinality introduction of stochasticity implies augmentation of existing uncertainty this concept has similarities with the parameter uncertainty expansion concept of lin and beck 2012 they proposed to accommodate structural uncertainty by artificially increasing the variance of posterior parameter distribution to nine times the estimated variance however in this framework the estimated structural uncertainty would degenerate to zero when parametric uncertainty becomes zero which is an undesirable consequence 2 2 formulation a generic model has the form 1 y i w g i w x θ e i w where y i w and g i w are the observed and model output streamflows at the i t h time step at a node w in the watershed θ is the m vector of optimal model parameters x is the vector containing rainfall data at successive time steps and e i w is the random deviation of y i w from g i w in 1 generally g w is a deterministic function and e i w represents all sources of errors in estimation of y i w by g i w the typical assumptions in 1 are that e i w s are zero mean independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables these assumptions may be valid if g i w is the correct representation of y i w in which case the e i w would represent measurement errors and a gaussian distribution is often more appropriate for modeling measurement errors since the model g is a simplification of the watershed processes the residuals e i s may be dependent and heteroscedastic reichert and mieleitner 2009 sorooshian and dracup 1980 therefore in hydrological modeling the i i d assumption of additive error model 1 may not be valid smith et al 2015 there are studies suggesting that relaxing these assumptions makes the statistical analysis more reliable e g schoups and vrugt 2010 gómez et al 1998 streamflow observations at the outlet are aggregated over the entire watershed implying streamflow data at the outlet contain some information about streamflows at other nodes in the watershed adopting a bayesian framework a convenient approach is to treat the optimal parameters θ of the model as random variables even in the limit of infinite information through data which makes the function g stochastic in what follows the superscript w has been dropped for brevity this randomness in θ is different from parametric uncertainty in that we treat it is as a fundamental property of θ for a given model in the sense that it is not reducible using any amount of information through data parametric uncertainty arises due to limited number of observations or limited information in the observed quantity however it should be noted that the uncertainty in θ is still epistemic if the global optimal value of θ is θ m l we write 2 θ θ m l δ θ to accommodate structural uncertainty in 2 θ m l is the deterministic term random only due to lack of observations and δ θ is the random perturbation term θ m l can be thought of as the optimal parameter set obtained by maximizing the likelihood of observations or residuals and θ can be thought of as the set of random optimal parameters the specific formulation 2 was chosen so as to allow the propagation of structural uncertainty from measured to unmeasured locations expanding 1 in taylor series and neglecting higher order terms small perturbation expansion we obtain 3 y i g i x θ m l e i k 1 m g i x θ m l θ k δ θ k where the term k 1 m g i x θ m l θ k δ θ k in 3 is the proposed model for structural uncertainty with the total error at i t h time step as 4 i e i k 1 m g i x θ m l θ k δ θ k and m is the number of parameters of the hydrological model g the taylor series expansion in 3 allows the separation of structural uncertainty from the hydrologic model and retains the traditional additive error formulation a similar model for structural uncertainty was used by götzinger and bárdossy 2008 however instead of a perturbation term the authors had arbitrary random coefficients which did not have any physical significance the idea of a perturbation approach has also been described in smith 2014 albeit for quantification of parametric uncertainty this model is practical if the perturbations are small enough to neglect higher order terms in 3 in section 2 4 we provide an interpretation of model 4 as a way to compensate for bias in estimated parameters due to the presence of structural errors a standard approach to estimate θ m l and δ θ is to maximize the likelihood of the observations or the residuals suppose 1 2 n is the n vector of residuals and f is the likelihood or joint probability density of the objective would be to minimize l l n f further it is assumed that the e i 0 i 1 n which implies that e k 1 m g i θ k δ θ k e i 0 it is reasonable to assume that e e i 0 since it represents measurement errors thus 5 k 1 m g i θ k e δ θ k 0 i 1 n and consequently 6 e δ θ k 0 k 1 m the i j entry in the covariance matrix σ is 7 σ i j e k 1 m g i θ k δ θ k e i k 1 m g j θ k δ θ k e j by the assumption of independence of e i s with themselves and δ θ k s 7 simplifies to 8 σ i j k 1 m l 1 m g i θ k g j θ l e δ θ k δ θ l e e i e j δ i j where e δ θ k δ θ l is the covariance of the perturbation of the kth and lth model parameters and δ i j is the kronecker delta function thus the covariance matrix σ of residuals is a function of the covariance matrix c of parameter perturbations in a concise notation 9 σ j c j λ i n where j is the jacobian matrix of the model g with its i j entry equal to g i θ j 10 c k l e δ θ k δ θ l and λ is the variance of e i i 1 n to work with the proposed model we need to specify the entries of c however assuming a functional form for the distribution of restricts the possible functional forms for the distribution of perturbations as and σ are expressed in terms of model and error parameters the negative log likelihood l can be minimized to find optimal c and θ the following characteristics of the proposed method are relevant a one can use gps with covariance function as in 10 to model the matrix c and the parameter λ are the hyper parameters of this covariance function the hyper parameter c allows the model to adapt to the structure of the observed residual b the jacobian j in 9 is the function of input rainfall and is different at different nodes in the watershed it is a desirable property in a model of structural uncertainty c the proposed modeling scheme differs from traditional modeling scheme in its treatment of optimal parameter set as a random quantity even in the limit of infinite information through data d in practice the proposed model would collapse to the traditional model if the variance of δ θ becomes zero therefore the prior over the variance should be assigned so that structural uncertainty is represented appropriately 2 3 propagation of structural uncertainty once the optimal model and error parameters have been identified it is possible to propagate structural uncertainty from measured location s to unmeasured locations thus if observations of streamflow are available at node 1 in fig 1 one can evaluate the optimal model and error parameters such that the likelihood of the observations at node 1 is maximized then the structural uncertainty at any unmeasured node w at i t h time step can be represented as 11 l g i w θ l δ θ l i 1 2 n where l varies over the set of parameters affecting the streamflow at node w the mean is equal to zero in 11 and the variance is equal to l k g i w θ l g i w θ k e δ θ l δ θ k 2 4 an interpretation of the proposed model of structural uncertainty in this section an interpretation of the proposed model of structural uncertainty has been provided through an example consider a process governed by the equation brynjarsdóttir and o hagan 2014 12 ζ x κ x 1 x a where ζ x is amount of work delivered by a machine given that x is amount of effort put into it suppose that 11 pairs of x y observations with κ a 0 65 10 and y equal to ζ x with an added gaussian noise n 0 0 01 2 are available at equally spaced values of x between 0 2 4 assuming that the true equation governing the process is not known we choose to model the process by three different equations 13 m o d e l 1 η κ x κ x 14 m o d e l 2 η κ x κ x 1 x a 15 m o d e l 3 η κ x κ x 1 x a x 2 a 2 where a 10 is assumed known and κ is the parameter to be estimated the posterior pdfs of κ given the observations and the models 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 2 clearly posterior of κ is very different given different models and none of the posterior distributions included the true value of κ this simple example shows the effect of structural uncertainty on parameter estimation the estimated parameter values are centered on a location different from true parameter value and the wrong location depends upon structural uncertainty associated with the model to illustrate the implication of the proposed method we show its effect on model 3 the dotted green distributions show the different posteriors of κ as the perturbation term δ κ takes different values for example δ κ 0 05 yields the posterior distribution centered at a point between 0 57 0 60 δ κ 0 05 yields the posterior distribution centered at a point between 0 67 0 70 and δ κ 0 yields the posterior distribution without any perturbation since δ κ is treated as a random quantity with a distribution p δ κ true posterior is one of these distribution with probability density p δ κ therefore instead of one posterior distribution represented by solid green line we have a distribution over a space of posterior distributions if one has observations of runoff at the outlet only then the parameters of a distributed model after calibration would be biased to fit the observations at the outlet one may not be able to produce realistic estimates of streamflow at other unmeasured locations we propose to remedy this situation by acknowledging that the parameter vector of a model is the sum of the two components as in eq 2 the first component θ m l is random only in bayesian sense which becomes deterministic given that we have large amount of data and equifinality does not exist and the second component δ θ is fundamentally a vector of values that degenerate to zero only if there are no structural errors associated with the model if equifinality exists the posterior distribution of θ would converge to a region or regions instead of a point and δ θ would augment this region in effect the idea behind the proposed method is to include more streamflow outcomes in the sample space that would be excluded if structural uncertainty was not explicitly modeled 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall runoff model in this study the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh theory rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 chapter 7 gupta et al 1980 is used to model streamflow with excess rainfall as input primarily because it is one of the simplest and commonly used hydrological models and is grounded in theory with physically meaningful parameters however it should be noted that the method proposed in section 2 to quantify structural uncertainty does not depend upon which hydrological model is used except that it should be feasible to compute derivatives of the model with respect to its parameters in actual applications more complicated models might be used such as hec hms army corps of engineers 2006 however it should be noted that the model used should incorporate the relationship between streamflow time series at different locations as is the case for giuh giuh theory has two parameters 1 in stream drift velocity v s and 2 hillslope drift velocity v h of water drops and both the parameters must be estimated through calibration in this study we refer to these parameters as model parameters the major sources of structural uncertainty in the giuh theory are a assumption of watershed as a linear time invariant system b resolution of delineated stream network for the computation of geomorphological parameters of the watershed and c assumption that v s and v h are uniform over the watershed 3 2 error model for analysis an assumption about the distribution of is required and is typically assumed gaussian for analytical convenience for example götzinger and bárdossy 2008 smith et al 2015 the gaussian law was discovered by assuming that the expected value of squared error is an appropriate measure of uncertainty similarly the laplacian law was discovered by assuming that expected value of absolute error is an appropriate measure of uncertainty subbotin 1923 presented a general error law without the requirement of a measure of uncertainty known as generalized gaussian the gaussian and laplacian are special cases of the generalized gaussian in hydrology generalized gaussian has been considered a candidate for modeling the term schoups and vrugt 2010 however generalized gaussian can be used only if all the observations are independent which may not be a reasonable assumption when structural errors are present in a model doherty and welter 2010 gómez et al 1998 proposed a multivariate generalized gaussian distribution mggd with the functional form 16 f k s 1 2 exp 1 2 t s 1 β where the parameter s is proportional to the covariance matrix β is the shape parameter and 17 k n γ n 2 π n 2 γ 1 n 2 β 2 1 n 2 β clearly β 1 corresponds to multivariate gaussian and β 0 5 corresponds to multivariate laplacian distribution the benefit of using mggds instead of generalized gaussian is the ability to specify a covariance function explicitly through the parameter s and therefore the assumption of independence can be relaxed the covariance matrix σ and the parameter s are related by the equation 18 σ 2 1 β γ n 2 2 β n γ n 2 β s where n is the dimensionality of in 16 the negative log likelihood of residual s drawn from the mggd is 19 l ln k 1 2 ln s 1 2 t s 1 β 3 3 implementation for this study the posterior joint distribution of model parameters v s v h and error parameters σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ were estimated against streamflow observations at one of the nodes in the study watersheds here indicates the mean of the model parameters observations at other nodes were used to test the efficacy of the proposed method in estimating structural uncertainty here σ δ v s 2 and σ δ v h 2 are the variances of the perturbations in v s and v h both parametric and structural uncertainty can be quantified once the posterior joint distribution of model and error parameters is obtained the parametric uncertainty in streamflow estimation is captured in the posterior joint distribution of v s v h denoted by p v s v h d and structural uncertainty is captured in the posterior joint distribution denoted by p σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ d the posterior distribution of parameters p θ d can be computed using bayes theorem here θ v s v h σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β σ 2 p θ is the prior distribution over parameter set θ and d represents observations of streamflow and rainfall the total uncertainty in streamflow is captured by 20 p y d θ p y θ p θ d d θ where y is the vector containing streamflow values at different time steps and 21 p y θ f y g x v s v h σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ here f is same as in eq 16 and the parameter σ required to evaluate 16 is a function of σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ as in eq 9 where 22 c σ δ v s 2 0 0 σ δ v h 2 the expression in eq 21 captures the structural uncertainty given that the corresponding v s v h are optimal model parameters in this study structural uncertainty is represented by highest posterior density hpd 95 credible region berger 1985 the parametric uncertainty in streamflow is captured by 23 v s v h δ y g x v s v h p v s v h d d v s d v h where δ is the dirac delta function the computations involved in 20 23 are intractable by analytical methods therefore monte carlo methods were employed for these computations in this study differential evolution adaptive metropolis hastings dream vrugt 2016 algorithm was used to draw samples from p θ d a total of 10 000 samples were drawn in each of the 8 parallel chains to quantify parametric uncertainty streamflow was simulated for each of the 10 000 sets of model parameters in chain 1 drawn from p v s v h d the plots of metropolis chains and r diagnostic statistics gelman and rubin 1992 are shown in supplementary materials computations of hpd 95 credible region for a given set of model parameters v s v h were performed by drawing samples from the distribution represented by eq 21 ideally 95 credible region should be computed for each set of model parameters v s v h drawn from p v s v h d but this is computationally expensive and may not be feasible in practical applications therefore a set of near global optimal parameters was obtained using shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 method and the 95 credible region was computed only for this set of parameters an algorithm to draw samples from mggd is given in appendix 1 and parameters input to sce ua are listed in supplementary materials the prior distribution p θ was assumed to be uniform over pre defined bounds on different parameters the bounds on v s and v h were determined heuristically based on a combination of manual and automatic search for optimal parameters the range of variance of perturbation terms was kept 0 1 m 2 s 2 to respect the small perturbation assumption the range of β was kept 0 5 1 0 to allow the error distribution to vary between laplacian and gaussian the range of λ was set to 0 10 m 6 s 2 the minimization of l in 19 w r t θ and c is a high dimensional optimization problem which poses a challenge given that we often have a limited number of observations however the dimensionality reduces significantly if we assume c to be a diagonal matrix which implies that the perturbations in different components of parameter θ are independent of each other the minimization of l is a difficult problem especially when we need to optimize both the θ k m l and e δ θ k 2 k 1 m a strong prior on these parameters is often needed to obtain a meaningful solution 4 example applications 4 1 study areas and data the proposed method was implemented on two small watersheds upper wabash busseron watershed uwbw fig 1a with an area equal to 661 k m 2 located in indiana usa and lower des plaines watershed ldpw fig 1b with an area equal to 545 89 k m 2 located in illinois usa the stream networks shown in fig 1a and b were delineated on a 30 m 30 m digital elevation model dem u s geological survey 2013a b critical source area of 2 k m 2 for uwbw and ldpw was used for stream network delineation the critical source area was chosen so that locations of streamflow gauges coincided with the delineated stream networks mean daily streamflow data were available at four locations in the uwbw n1 n28 n54 and n59 fig 1a through usgs website u s geological survey 2016 hourly streamflow data were available at five locations in the ldpw n1 n15 n39 n75 and n109 fig 1b u s geological survey 2016 for both the watersheds hourly gridded rainfall data were downloaded from nasa land data assimilation system nldas xia et al 2012a b and areal average of rainfall was computed to get a single rainfall time series which was subsequently assumed uniform over the entire watershed surface runoff was computed from mean daily streamflow data using digital recursive filter technique arnold and allen 1999 implemented in matlab uploaded by qiao 2018 in ldpw dataset mean daily streamflow was computed from sub daily data further excess rainfall was computed using scs cn method chow et al 1988 with the constraint that the excess rainfall volume was equal to surface runoff the computed cn was 94 for uwbw and 72 for ldpw surface runoff time series with excess rainfall are shown in fig 3 a and b computed geomorphological parameters of the two watersheds are listed in the supplementary materials in this study the posterior distribution of model and error parameters in both the watersheds were estimated using streamflow observations at n1 only the observations at other nodes were treated as unknown and used only to test the effectiveness of the proposed method in quantification of uncertainty the observations at n54 in uwbw were not used because node n54 is a source node and its location is slightly off from delineated stream 4 2 results 4 2 1 upper wabash busseron watershed fig 4 shows the marginal posterior distribution of model parameters v s v h and error parameters σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ with uniform prior on each table 1 and mggd likelihood as in eq 16 again the posterior distribution was computed using streamflow observations at node n1 and the parameters σ δ v s 2 and σ δ v h 2 are variances of perturbation in v s and v h the support of the posterior of shape parameter β was 0 90 1 00 and the observation error variance λ was concentrated below 5 m 6 s 2 the posterior samples drawn from joint distribution of v s and v h were used to obtain the posterior realizations of streamflow the parametric uncertainty band so obtained fig 5 a c and e at three nodes was narrow and most of the observations were not enveloped by this band residual simulated observed associated with each of the streamflow realizations in parametric uncertainty band is shown in fig 5b d and f these residual time series may be interpreted as resulting due to structural errors the residuals at different time steps are correlated with each other and therefore the popular independence assumption is not valid in this case these residual plots also support the hypothesis that the magnitude of structural uncertainty depends upon input rainfall further a set of global optimal parameters was obtained by maximizing the likelihood of observations residuals in 19 the optimal parameters obtained were v s v h σ δv s 2 σ δv h 2 β λ 0 35 m s 1 0 14 m s 1 0 41 m 2 s 2 0 49 m 2 s 2 0 75 2 28 m 6 s 2 the mean of simulated streamflow obtained by optimal v s v h 0 35 m s 1 0 14 m s 1 is shown in fig 6 a c and e along with structural uncertainty band obtained by σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ 0 41 m 2 s 2 0 49 m 2 s 2 0 75 2 28 m 6 s 2 all the observations at the three nodes are enveloped by this uncertainty band however the band is very wide at all three nodes especially at high flow time steps the corresponding correlation matrices responsible for generating structural uncertainty bands are shown in fig 6b d and f these correlation matrices are adequate to model the residuals shown in fig 5 fig 7 shows the 100 and 95 credible regions of total uncertainty the 100 credible region is extremely wide at most of the time steps as is the 95 credible region though it is a tradition to show only 90 or 95 credible region to represent uncertainty we show 100 credible region also as it gives a more complete picture of possible streamflow values it may be noted that mcmc method was used to draw samples from the streamflow distribution therefore the samples in 100 credible region which are not there in 95 credible region are rare but still a possibility 4 2 2 lower des plaines watershed fig 8 shows the marginal posterior distribution of model and error parameters obtained using streamflow observations at n1 fig 1a with priors listed in table 1 the support of v s was 0 4 0 6 m s 1 and support of v h was 0 1 0 m s 1 the posterior of shape parameter β degenerated to 0 5 and the support of λ was 0 1 0 3 m 6 s 2 parametric uncertainty bands at different nodes are shown in fig 9 along with corresponding residuals the simulated hydrograph at all the five nodes seem to be shifted to the right delayed and most of the observations are not enveloped by the parametric uncertainty band the residuals have clear trends which again indicates that the assumption of independence of residuals at different time steps would be invalid global optimal parameters obtained were v s v h σ δv s 2 σ δv h 2 β λ 0 38 ms 1 0 63 ms 1 0 88 m 2 s 2 0 58 m 2 s 2 0 50 1 32 m 6 s 2 structural uncertainty bands 95 credible region corresponding to global optimal parameters are shown in fig 10 at n1 most of the observations are enveloped by the uncertainty band but at other nodes most of the observations are outside the band there is a strong correlation fig 10 between any two successive residuals in the time series since the global optimal parameters v s v h obtained by sce ua were not contained in the support of posterior distribution of v s v h the residual obtained by global optimal parameters is shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the 100 and 95 credible region of total uncertainty which are again very wide at most of the time steps there are notable differences between results for uwbw and ldpw a the parametric uncertainty band was closer to observations in ldpw b parametric uncertainty band was wider and structural uncertainty band was narrower in ldpw c structural uncertainty band contains all the observations in uwbw but misses most of the observations in ldpw and d gaussian was appropriate distribution for residuals in uwbw and laplacian was appropriate distribution for residuals in ldpw 4 3 discussion since the bias in estimation of streamflow by giuh model was assumed to be zero and a likelihood which is peaked at its mean 0 in this study was used maximum likelihood solution for v s and v h was ensured to be the one that fits the observed data the best provided that the optimization method attains a global optimal solution the optimal values obtained by sce ua were v s v h 0 35 m s 1 0 14 m s 1 in uwbw and v s v h 0 38 m s 1 0 64 m s 1 in ldpw but these values did not fit the observations very well especially the daily streamflow in uwbw this lack of fit may be partially attributed to errors made in baseflow separation and extraction of excess rainfall from total rainfall and partially attributed to structural errors in giuh model errors in baseflow separation and excess rainfall computations are also part of structural errors but these errors were not explicitly accounted for in this study the residuals shown in figs 5 and 9 are due to the structural and measurement errors in a strict sense not each of these realizations represents residual due to structural errors only the residual obtained by globally optimal parameters is due to structural errors for a given set of model parameters v s v h error parameters σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ are estimated so that likelihood of the residual series obtained is maximized since in uwbw the residuals obtained were large fig 5b d and f and likelihood used was symmetric about zero the structural uncertainty is expected to be large as was noted in fig 6a c e in ldpw the simulated streamflow could fit the observations relatively well therefore the structural uncertainty estimated was small fig 10a c e g i in other words the width of structural uncertainty band depends upon zero bias assumption ability of giuh theory to fit the observations and inherent assumption in the maximum likelihood theory that the residual obtained has high probability among different residuals in a population the total uncertainty band is very wide in both the watersheds which at first seems discouraging but it should be noted that these bands accurately represent our state of knowledge about streamflow at ungagged basins if we use giuh theory to model streamflow multivariate generalized gaussian law to model the residuals and uniform priors on parameters as given in table 1 the estimation of parametric uncertainty depends upon the likelihood chosen for modeling structural and measurement uncertainty and the amount of information available through the observations therefore in uwbw the narrow posterior of parameters obtained fig 4 was due to the assumption that the mggd is the appropriate likelihood which is sharply peaked within a narrow support for v s v h as shown in fig a4a in supplementary materials similarly in ldpw the parametric uncertainty band was relatively wider because likelihood was peaked over wider support for v s v h as shown in fig a4b in supplementary materials the width of structural uncertainty band also depends upon measurement uncertainty at any time step only the sum of measurement and structural errors is known therefore it is not possible to separate structural errors from measurement errors unless prior information is available one way to obtain strong prior information on measurement uncertainty could be the analysis of rating curve errors prior to hydrologic modeling see baldassarre and montanari 2009 the posterior of β had a support of 0 90 1 00 in uwbw indicating that the gaussian is an appropriate model for errors so long as residuals at successive time steps are not assumed independent the posterior of β degenerates to 0 5 in ldpw indicating laplacian is an appropriate model for errors so long as residuals at successive time steps are not assumed independent the nature of this distribution is not known prior to modeling therefore it seems better to always use generalized gaussian instead of gaussian or laplacian and let the data decide the appropriate distribution since residuals at daily scale are average of residuals at sub daily scale it seems reasonable that the residuals at daily scale are gaussian due to central limit theorem clt however it should be noted that clt is valid only if the random variables being summed are independent in ldpw the support of the variance of measurement errors λ is 0 1 0 3 m 6 s 2 which is surprisingly small it may due to the absorption of measurement uncertainty by parametric or structural uncertainty as noted by renard et al 2010 it is not possible to separate different kinds of uncertainties in a hydrologic model without strong priors on the parameter space the λ in 9 is the variance of the iid random error e i s one would desire the λ to be zero so that σ j c j since any valid covariance matrix must be positive semi definite the c must be chosen such that σ stays positive semi definite the positive semi definiteness of σ implies that w t σ w 0 w 0 24 w t j c j t w 0 w 0 j t w t c j t w 0 w 0 if c is a diagonal matrix with all the entries being positive then 24 would hold if 25 j t w 0 w 0 clearly 25 cannot hold for all non zero w s because j is usually a rectangular matrix which cannot be non singular however 28 would hold for all w which are not in the null space of matrix j 5 summary and conclusions the aim of this paper was to develop a method for propagation of uncertainty in simulated streamflow from a measured location to unmeasured locations often we use streamflow observations at one node to calibrate a distributed hydrologic model and estimate the streamflow at other nodes using the calibrated hydrologic model however hydrologic models have different kinds of uncertainties due to measurement errors structural errors and limited amount of information through data estimation of total uncertainty at measured location involves specification of a functional form for the distribution of residuals which is supposed to model measurement and structural uncertainties subsequently parameters of hydrologic and error models are calibrated against the observations however at unmeasured locations error model parameters cannot be estimated therefore to model structural uncertainty at unmeasured locations a relationship between error model parameters at different nodes is required in this paper we proposed that the treatment of optimal model parameters as random quantities in the limit of information through data is a convenient way to model structural uncertainty which also yields a relationship between error parameters at different nodes an interpretation of the proposed model as a way to compensate for bias in parameter estimation in the presence of structural errors was provided another feature of the proposed model for structural uncertainty is that it depends upon hydrologic model itself and still preserves the traditional additive error formulation the proposed scheme for modeling structural uncertainty utilizes a generalized gaussian process with zero mean and covariance function as in 9 the method was applied on upper wabash busseron watershed uwbw and lower des plaines watershed ldpw with mean daily and mean hourly streamflow data respectively the giuh theory was used as the hydrological model the following conclusions were drawn from this study a estimation of streamflow at ungauged locations the giuh model fitted the streamflow data at sub daily scale better than at daily scale as is clear from the results in ldpw figs 10 and 11 a model that emulates the streamflow observations at one node fairly well may not be able to emulate streamflow at other nodes it is necessary to explicitly model structural uncertainty at all the nodes where streamflow has to be estimated b structural uncertainty the width of structural uncertainty band depends upon how well the simulated streamflow fits the observations in uwbw the fit was poor which resulted in estimation of wide structural uncertainty band in ldpw the fit was relatively good which resulted in estimation of a relatively narrow structural uncertainty band therefore structural uncertainty band in uwbw was able to envelope all the observations even at unmeasured nodes and structural uncertainty band in ldpw missed most of the observations c assumption over error term the assumption of independence of residuals at successive time steps may be incorrect as is evident from covariance functions shown figs 6 and 10 the proposed method provides a way to relax this assumption the assumption of gaussian distribution of residuals is not always valid the use of a generalized gaussian distribution is recommended and the data should be allowed to decide the appropriate distribution d need for strong prior information the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters is challenged by scarcity of data this problem can be partly addressed by assigning an informative prior over the parameter space which demands an understanding of structural uncertainty in hydrological modeling even if one uses the entire posterior distribution instead of just maximum likelihood parameters an informative prior is required to reach a meaningful solution additionally through informative priors it is possible to separate different kinds of uncertainties present in a hydrologic model therefore it seems that future efforts should be directed towards formulating informative priors over model and error parameters one of the goals of uncertainty quantification is reduction of uncertainty by the identification of weaknesses in the process description though the proposed method can give an estimate of structural uncertainty the attribution of uncertainty to a set of missing processes or to inadequate representation of the included processes is not often possible because of model complexity inter dependency among processes model assumptions and data limitations one technique to reduce uncertainty is to test alternate representations of watershed processes see clark et al 2011 the following aspects may be helpful in reducing uncertainty a relaxing the assumption of linear time invariance of the watershed b better characterization of measurement uncertainty baldassarre and montanari 2009 and c an understanding of the statistical behavior of residuals due to structural errors this study has following limitations a the uniform priors used in this study may not be truly non informative therefore the posteriors distribution of parameters may be biased in an unknown way b this method requires computation of the derivatives of the model g in 1 which increases the computational cost and might make this method infeasible for complex models where derivatives would have to be computed numerically c number of perturbation parameters increases linearly with number of hydrologic parameters if the number of hydrologic parameters is large it might be wise to perturb only the few most sensitive parameters d uncertainty in available rainfall data has not been modeled e the functional form of the distribution of perturbation δ θ has not been discussed in present study ideally one can choose a functional form for δ θ and measurement error term e which will uniquely determine the functional form of the distribution of here we directly modeled by generalized gaussian which puts restrictions on functional form of how to determine the distribution of δ θ and e given the distribution of is an open question f global optimization methods yield a near optimal solution which is an added source of uncertainty its effects on the results presented in this study have not been evaluated g the value of estimated parameters depends upon structural errors present in a model and may be far from true values in presence of structural errors the proposed method simulates the effect of structural errors by augmenting the parameter set while this does not capture all the uncertainty due to structural errors it is a useful

6331,structural parametric and measurement uncertainties are inherent in watershed hydrology models among these structural uncertainty results from simplified representation of reality in models and has proven to be particularly challenging to characterize often flow measurements are available at the outlet or a few other locations within a watershed and distributed model parameters are calibrated to replicate observed streamflow values subsequently one can quantify uncertainty in streamflow estimation at the measured locations the objective of this study is the quantification of structural and parametric uncertainty at unmeasured locations using a calibrated watershed hydrologic model while propagation of parametric uncertainty to unmeasured locations is a relatively simple task in a bayesian framework this study is focused on the problem of structural uncertainty propagation we propose to treat the hydrologic model as a stochastic function by treating the parameters of the model as random quantities even in the limit of infinite information through data thus enabling us to accommodate the uncertainty due to structural errors a mathematical formulation of the method and applications over two different watersheds using hourly and daily flow data are presented the structural uncertainty band at ungauged locations enveloped all the streamflow observations at daily scale and missed most of the observations at hourly scale structural uncertainty varies spatially at unmeasured locations within the watershed consequently streamflows estimated at unmeasured locations may be accompanied by wide uncertainty bands implying the need for caution when using them keywords parametric uncertainty structural uncertainty streamflow geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph generalized gaussian process covariance matrix 1 introduction modeling of hydrologic processes incurs errors due to uncertainty in various forms most hydrologic models have parameters that are estimated through calibration by matching observed streamflows at a measurement location typically the outlet of the watershed to model output streamflows at that location there may be more than one set of parameters that provide similar fits to the observed streamflows due to equifinality beven and binley 1992 also referred to as unidentifiability smith 2014 additionally parameter uncertainty exists due to limited number of observations hydrologic models are simplifications resulting in incomplete representation of reality this lack of our ability to perfectly model real world processes introduces structural uncertainty even if one knows the true parameters of the model streamflow estimation may deviate from true streamflow because of structural errors true parameter values of a model might refer to the best fitting or the actual physical values in hydrologic models some of the parameters don t have any physical significance since the best fitting parameter values compensate for structural errors true parameter value can be thought of as the ones that will reproduce streamflow observations if there are no structural errors and observations are error free other names for structural uncertainty are model inadequacy kennedy and o hagan 2001 and model discrepancy smith 2014 additionally errors in the measurements of streamflow and rainfall introduce measurement uncertainty uncertainty in streamflow and rainfall measurements are also referred to as output and input uncertainty although researchers nearing et al 2016 have argued that measurement uncertainty is in fact structural uncertainty we prefer to use the term measurement uncertainty because there is an important difference between the two a modeler cannot reduce measurement uncertainty while structural uncertainty may be reduced furthermore it is tempting to claim that the parameters of a model can be calibrated to compensate for structural errors and therefore it is not required to explicitly acknowledge structural errors in a model gaganis 2009 højberg and refsgaard 2005 madsen 2000 xu et al 2017 but this is true only if one wants to estimate best fitting parameters at a measurement location for a realistic quantification of total uncertainty in streamflow estimation explicit modeling of structural uncertainty is necessary maccallum and o hagan 2015 in a generic modeling framework as in 1 parametric uncertainty in streamflow estimation is quantified by propagating uncertainty in hydrologic model parameters to streamflow while structural and measurement uncertainties in streamflow estimation are derived from the error model there are many studies on the quantification of the different types of uncertainties at a measured location abbaspour et al 2004 ajami et al 2007 bulygina and gupta 2009 götzinger and bárdossy 2008 montanari and grossi 2008 renard et al 2010 schoups and vrugt 2010 thiemann et al 2001 thyer et al 2009 wilkinson et al 2011 however to the best of our knowledge there are no attempts to quantify the different kinds of uncertainty at unmeasured locations using streamflow data at a measured location the propagation of parametric uncertainty from measured to unmeasured locations is a comparatively simple task montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 lin and beck 2012 but a framework for propagation of structural uncertainty is lacking traditionally structural uncertainty has been modeled using gaussian processes gps that require specification of a functional form for the covariance function kennedy and o hagan 2001 also see lin and beck 2012 reichert and mieleitner 2009 for an alternate method the covariance function itself has a few parameters called hyper parameters hyper parameters are estimated to fit the observed residual series assuming that the obtained residual series is due to structural and measurement errors the key is the selection of an appropriate covariance function that is flexible enough to capture the relationship among residuals at different time steps a gaussian kernel is a popular choice to this end williams and rasmussen 2006 though gaussian covariance function is capable of modeling any kind of residual series obtained in hydrological modeling it cannot be used directly to propagate structural uncertainty from measured to unmeasured locations because the magnitude of structural uncertainty depends upon input rainfall as explained later in this section assuming the dependence of structural uncertainty on input rainfall and recognizing the fact that the rainfall in the drainage areas of different nodes in a watershed is different a gp with traditional covariance function calibrated to model structural uncertainty at a measured node cannot be used to estimate structural uncertainty at unmeasured nodes the following example illustrates this limitation consider the river networks as shown in fig 1 a and b where let us say we know the rainfall over the entire watershed and the corresponding streamflow at the outlet what can we say about the uncertainty in streamflows at other nodes if we know the exact model without any structural errors for converting rainfall into streamflow we can use a bayesian framework to estimate a posterior distribution over parameters and subsequently the uncertainty in streamflow at all the nodes we do not have the exact model in watershed hydrology which suggests that the simulated streamflow may be treated as a random process for a given set of model parameters we need to infer the parameters of streamflow distribution for example hyper parameters of a gp given the model parameters since the observations of streamflow are available only at the outlet the hyper parameters of the gp would be biased to fit the residuals at the outlet for estimation of parameters of streamflow distribution at other nodes a relationship between parameters at different nodes is required necessitating the relationship between hyper parameters of the gps at different locations to the best of our knowledge the dependence of structural uncertainty on input rainfall has rarely been explicitly mentioned in the literature see wilkinson et al 2011 for an exception the following arguments support the hypothesis of dependence of structural uncertainty on input rainfall a the processes that are missing from a hydrologic model would depend upon rainfall because rainfall drives hydrologic process directly or indirectly for example let us assume that a hydrologic model excludes the infiltration process and clearly the amount of infiltration is limited by amount of rainfall let the maximum rate of infiltration be i m a x then for two different rainfall rates r 1 i m a x and r 2 i m a x amount of extra rainfall that is added to excess rainfall would be r 1 and r 2 this error in excess rainfall will eventually propagate to streamflow b it is a well known fact that the errors in streamflow estimation are dependent upon magnitude of streamflow see sorooshian and dracup 1980 for an example of heteroscedasticity of measurement errors and the magnitude of streamflow values at the different locations in a watershed would be different because of different amount of rainfall in drainage areas of different locations therefore the magnitude of errors in streamflow at different locations would be different while often neglected there is a need for modeling structural uncertainty at both measured and unmeasured locations there are two major questions about the propagation of structural uncertainty 1 what is the model to be used for structural uncertainty that is dependent upon input to the model and 2 can we find a relationship between parameters of structural uncertainty models at different locations in a watershed none of the existing methods attempt to answer these two questions in this study we attempt to answer these two questions with a focus on the propagation of uncertainty especially structural uncertainty from a measured location to unmeasured locations 2 proposed solution in this section a potential method to address structural uncertainty propagation is formulated the vector quantities are denoted by small bold letters matrices are denoted by capital letters and scalar quantities are denoted by regular font 2 1 modeling structural uncertainty in the absence of equifinality the parameters of a model would converge to a point in the parameter space doherty and welter 2010 if infinite amount of information is available through data for the estimation of parameters therefore in this limit the model yields a deterministic streamflow time series for an observed rainfall time series however no amount of streamflow data can reduce the structural errors associated with the model beven 2005 an approximate equation would remain approximate also there are convincing arguments to support the conclusion that structural uncertainty should be modeled by treating the hydrologic model as a stochastic function see montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 therefore the idea is to introduce stochasticity in the model by perturbing the optimal parameters of the model this stochasticity should be irreducible by the data practically we always have finite amount of data available in that case stochasticity implies augmentation of existing uncertainty similarly in the presence of equifinality introduction of stochasticity implies augmentation of existing uncertainty this concept has similarities with the parameter uncertainty expansion concept of lin and beck 2012 they proposed to accommodate structural uncertainty by artificially increasing the variance of posterior parameter distribution to nine times the estimated variance however in this framework the estimated structural uncertainty would degenerate to zero when parametric uncertainty becomes zero which is an undesirable consequence 2 2 formulation a generic model has the form 1 y i w g i w x θ e i w where y i w and g i w are the observed and model output streamflows at the i t h time step at a node w in the watershed θ is the m vector of optimal model parameters x is the vector containing rainfall data at successive time steps and e i w is the random deviation of y i w from g i w in 1 generally g w is a deterministic function and e i w represents all sources of errors in estimation of y i w by g i w the typical assumptions in 1 are that e i w s are zero mean independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables these assumptions may be valid if g i w is the correct representation of y i w in which case the e i w would represent measurement errors and a gaussian distribution is often more appropriate for modeling measurement errors since the model g is a simplification of the watershed processes the residuals e i s may be dependent and heteroscedastic reichert and mieleitner 2009 sorooshian and dracup 1980 therefore in hydrological modeling the i i d assumption of additive error model 1 may not be valid smith et al 2015 there are studies suggesting that relaxing these assumptions makes the statistical analysis more reliable e g schoups and vrugt 2010 gómez et al 1998 streamflow observations at the outlet are aggregated over the entire watershed implying streamflow data at the outlet contain some information about streamflows at other nodes in the watershed adopting a bayesian framework a convenient approach is to treat the optimal parameters θ of the model as random variables even in the limit of infinite information through data which makes the function g stochastic in what follows the superscript w has been dropped for brevity this randomness in θ is different from parametric uncertainty in that we treat it is as a fundamental property of θ for a given model in the sense that it is not reducible using any amount of information through data parametric uncertainty arises due to limited number of observations or limited information in the observed quantity however it should be noted that the uncertainty in θ is still epistemic if the global optimal value of θ is θ m l we write 2 θ θ m l δ θ to accommodate structural uncertainty in 2 θ m l is the deterministic term random only due to lack of observations and δ θ is the random perturbation term θ m l can be thought of as the optimal parameter set obtained by maximizing the likelihood of observations or residuals and θ can be thought of as the set of random optimal parameters the specific formulation 2 was chosen so as to allow the propagation of structural uncertainty from measured to unmeasured locations expanding 1 in taylor series and neglecting higher order terms small perturbation expansion we obtain 3 y i g i x θ m l e i k 1 m g i x θ m l θ k δ θ k where the term k 1 m g i x θ m l θ k δ θ k in 3 is the proposed model for structural uncertainty with the total error at i t h time step as 4 i e i k 1 m g i x θ m l θ k δ θ k and m is the number of parameters of the hydrological model g the taylor series expansion in 3 allows the separation of structural uncertainty from the hydrologic model and retains the traditional additive error formulation a similar model for structural uncertainty was used by götzinger and bárdossy 2008 however instead of a perturbation term the authors had arbitrary random coefficients which did not have any physical significance the idea of a perturbation approach has also been described in smith 2014 albeit for quantification of parametric uncertainty this model is practical if the perturbations are small enough to neglect higher order terms in 3 in section 2 4 we provide an interpretation of model 4 as a way to compensate for bias in estimated parameters due to the presence of structural errors a standard approach to estimate θ m l and δ θ is to maximize the likelihood of the observations or the residuals suppose 1 2 n is the n vector of residuals and f is the likelihood or joint probability density of the objective would be to minimize l l n f further it is assumed that the e i 0 i 1 n which implies that e k 1 m g i θ k δ θ k e i 0 it is reasonable to assume that e e i 0 since it represents measurement errors thus 5 k 1 m g i θ k e δ θ k 0 i 1 n and consequently 6 e δ θ k 0 k 1 m the i j entry in the covariance matrix σ is 7 σ i j e k 1 m g i θ k δ θ k e i k 1 m g j θ k δ θ k e j by the assumption of independence of e i s with themselves and δ θ k s 7 simplifies to 8 σ i j k 1 m l 1 m g i θ k g j θ l e δ θ k δ θ l e e i e j δ i j where e δ θ k δ θ l is the covariance of the perturbation of the kth and lth model parameters and δ i j is the kronecker delta function thus the covariance matrix σ of residuals is a function of the covariance matrix c of parameter perturbations in a concise notation 9 σ j c j λ i n where j is the jacobian matrix of the model g with its i j entry equal to g i θ j 10 c k l e δ θ k δ θ l and λ is the variance of e i i 1 n to work with the proposed model we need to specify the entries of c however assuming a functional form for the distribution of restricts the possible functional forms for the distribution of perturbations as and σ are expressed in terms of model and error parameters the negative log likelihood l can be minimized to find optimal c and θ the following characteristics of the proposed method are relevant a one can use gps with covariance function as in 10 to model the matrix c and the parameter λ are the hyper parameters of this covariance function the hyper parameter c allows the model to adapt to the structure of the observed residual b the jacobian j in 9 is the function of input rainfall and is different at different nodes in the watershed it is a desirable property in a model of structural uncertainty c the proposed modeling scheme differs from traditional modeling scheme in its treatment of optimal parameter set as a random quantity even in the limit of infinite information through data d in practice the proposed model would collapse to the traditional model if the variance of δ θ becomes zero therefore the prior over the variance should be assigned so that structural uncertainty is represented appropriately 2 3 propagation of structural uncertainty once the optimal model and error parameters have been identified it is possible to propagate structural uncertainty from measured location s to unmeasured locations thus if observations of streamflow are available at node 1 in fig 1 one can evaluate the optimal model and error parameters such that the likelihood of the observations at node 1 is maximized then the structural uncertainty at any unmeasured node w at i t h time step can be represented as 11 l g i w θ l δ θ l i 1 2 n where l varies over the set of parameters affecting the streamflow at node w the mean is equal to zero in 11 and the variance is equal to l k g i w θ l g i w θ k e δ θ l δ θ k 2 4 an interpretation of the proposed model of structural uncertainty in this section an interpretation of the proposed model of structural uncertainty has been provided through an example consider a process governed by the equation brynjarsdóttir and o hagan 2014 12 ζ x κ x 1 x a where ζ x is amount of work delivered by a machine given that x is amount of effort put into it suppose that 11 pairs of x y observations with κ a 0 65 10 and y equal to ζ x with an added gaussian noise n 0 0 01 2 are available at equally spaced values of x between 0 2 4 assuming that the true equation governing the process is not known we choose to model the process by three different equations 13 m o d e l 1 η κ x κ x 14 m o d e l 2 η κ x κ x 1 x a 15 m o d e l 3 η κ x κ x 1 x a x 2 a 2 where a 10 is assumed known and κ is the parameter to be estimated the posterior pdfs of κ given the observations and the models 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 2 clearly posterior of κ is very different given different models and none of the posterior distributions included the true value of κ this simple example shows the effect of structural uncertainty on parameter estimation the estimated parameter values are centered on a location different from true parameter value and the wrong location depends upon structural uncertainty associated with the model to illustrate the implication of the proposed method we show its effect on model 3 the dotted green distributions show the different posteriors of κ as the perturbation term δ κ takes different values for example δ κ 0 05 yields the posterior distribution centered at a point between 0 57 0 60 δ κ 0 05 yields the posterior distribution centered at a point between 0 67 0 70 and δ κ 0 yields the posterior distribution without any perturbation since δ κ is treated as a random quantity with a distribution p δ κ true posterior is one of these distribution with probability density p δ κ therefore instead of one posterior distribution represented by solid green line we have a distribution over a space of posterior distributions if one has observations of runoff at the outlet only then the parameters of a distributed model after calibration would be biased to fit the observations at the outlet one may not be able to produce realistic estimates of streamflow at other unmeasured locations we propose to remedy this situation by acknowledging that the parameter vector of a model is the sum of the two components as in eq 2 the first component θ m l is random only in bayesian sense which becomes deterministic given that we have large amount of data and equifinality does not exist and the second component δ θ is fundamentally a vector of values that degenerate to zero only if there are no structural errors associated with the model if equifinality exists the posterior distribution of θ would converge to a region or regions instead of a point and δ θ would augment this region in effect the idea behind the proposed method is to include more streamflow outcomes in the sample space that would be excluded if structural uncertainty was not explicitly modeled 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall runoff model in this study the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh theory rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 chapter 7 gupta et al 1980 is used to model streamflow with excess rainfall as input primarily because it is one of the simplest and commonly used hydrological models and is grounded in theory with physically meaningful parameters however it should be noted that the method proposed in section 2 to quantify structural uncertainty does not depend upon which hydrological model is used except that it should be feasible to compute derivatives of the model with respect to its parameters in actual applications more complicated models might be used such as hec hms army corps of engineers 2006 however it should be noted that the model used should incorporate the relationship between streamflow time series at different locations as is the case for giuh giuh theory has two parameters 1 in stream drift velocity v s and 2 hillslope drift velocity v h of water drops and both the parameters must be estimated through calibration in this study we refer to these parameters as model parameters the major sources of structural uncertainty in the giuh theory are a assumption of watershed as a linear time invariant system b resolution of delineated stream network for the computation of geomorphological parameters of the watershed and c assumption that v s and v h are uniform over the watershed 3 2 error model for analysis an assumption about the distribution of is required and is typically assumed gaussian for analytical convenience for example götzinger and bárdossy 2008 smith et al 2015 the gaussian law was discovered by assuming that the expected value of squared error is an appropriate measure of uncertainty similarly the laplacian law was discovered by assuming that expected value of absolute error is an appropriate measure of uncertainty subbotin 1923 presented a general error law without the requirement of a measure of uncertainty known as generalized gaussian the gaussian and laplacian are special cases of the generalized gaussian in hydrology generalized gaussian has been considered a candidate for modeling the term schoups and vrugt 2010 however generalized gaussian can be used only if all the observations are independent which may not be a reasonable assumption when structural errors are present in a model doherty and welter 2010 gómez et al 1998 proposed a multivariate generalized gaussian distribution mggd with the functional form 16 f k s 1 2 exp 1 2 t s 1 β where the parameter s is proportional to the covariance matrix β is the shape parameter and 17 k n γ n 2 π n 2 γ 1 n 2 β 2 1 n 2 β clearly β 1 corresponds to multivariate gaussian and β 0 5 corresponds to multivariate laplacian distribution the benefit of using mggds instead of generalized gaussian is the ability to specify a covariance function explicitly through the parameter s and therefore the assumption of independence can be relaxed the covariance matrix σ and the parameter s are related by the equation 18 σ 2 1 β γ n 2 2 β n γ n 2 β s where n is the dimensionality of in 16 the negative log likelihood of residual s drawn from the mggd is 19 l ln k 1 2 ln s 1 2 t s 1 β 3 3 implementation for this study the posterior joint distribution of model parameters v s v h and error parameters σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ were estimated against streamflow observations at one of the nodes in the study watersheds here indicates the mean of the model parameters observations at other nodes were used to test the efficacy of the proposed method in estimating structural uncertainty here σ δ v s 2 and σ δ v h 2 are the variances of the perturbations in v s and v h both parametric and structural uncertainty can be quantified once the posterior joint distribution of model and error parameters is obtained the parametric uncertainty in streamflow estimation is captured in the posterior joint distribution of v s v h denoted by p v s v h d and structural uncertainty is captured in the posterior joint distribution denoted by p σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ d the posterior distribution of parameters p θ d can be computed using bayes theorem here θ v s v h σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β σ 2 p θ is the prior distribution over parameter set θ and d represents observations of streamflow and rainfall the total uncertainty in streamflow is captured by 20 p y d θ p y θ p θ d d θ where y is the vector containing streamflow values at different time steps and 21 p y θ f y g x v s v h σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ here f is same as in eq 16 and the parameter σ required to evaluate 16 is a function of σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ as in eq 9 where 22 c σ δ v s 2 0 0 σ δ v h 2 the expression in eq 21 captures the structural uncertainty given that the corresponding v s v h are optimal model parameters in this study structural uncertainty is represented by highest posterior density hpd 95 credible region berger 1985 the parametric uncertainty in streamflow is captured by 23 v s v h δ y g x v s v h p v s v h d d v s d v h where δ is the dirac delta function the computations involved in 20 23 are intractable by analytical methods therefore monte carlo methods were employed for these computations in this study differential evolution adaptive metropolis hastings dream vrugt 2016 algorithm was used to draw samples from p θ d a total of 10 000 samples were drawn in each of the 8 parallel chains to quantify parametric uncertainty streamflow was simulated for each of the 10 000 sets of model parameters in chain 1 drawn from p v s v h d the plots of metropolis chains and r diagnostic statistics gelman and rubin 1992 are shown in supplementary materials computations of hpd 95 credible region for a given set of model parameters v s v h were performed by drawing samples from the distribution represented by eq 21 ideally 95 credible region should be computed for each set of model parameters v s v h drawn from p v s v h d but this is computationally expensive and may not be feasible in practical applications therefore a set of near global optimal parameters was obtained using shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 method and the 95 credible region was computed only for this set of parameters an algorithm to draw samples from mggd is given in appendix 1 and parameters input to sce ua are listed in supplementary materials the prior distribution p θ was assumed to be uniform over pre defined bounds on different parameters the bounds on v s and v h were determined heuristically based on a combination of manual and automatic search for optimal parameters the range of variance of perturbation terms was kept 0 1 m 2 s 2 to respect the small perturbation assumption the range of β was kept 0 5 1 0 to allow the error distribution to vary between laplacian and gaussian the range of λ was set to 0 10 m 6 s 2 the minimization of l in 19 w r t θ and c is a high dimensional optimization problem which poses a challenge given that we often have a limited number of observations however the dimensionality reduces significantly if we assume c to be a diagonal matrix which implies that the perturbations in different components of parameter θ are independent of each other the minimization of l is a difficult problem especially when we need to optimize both the θ k m l and e δ θ k 2 k 1 m a strong prior on these parameters is often needed to obtain a meaningful solution 4 example applications 4 1 study areas and data the proposed method was implemented on two small watersheds upper wabash busseron watershed uwbw fig 1a with an area equal to 661 k m 2 located in indiana usa and lower des plaines watershed ldpw fig 1b with an area equal to 545 89 k m 2 located in illinois usa the stream networks shown in fig 1a and b were delineated on a 30 m 30 m digital elevation model dem u s geological survey 2013a b critical source area of 2 k m 2 for uwbw and ldpw was used for stream network delineation the critical source area was chosen so that locations of streamflow gauges coincided with the delineated stream networks mean daily streamflow data were available at four locations in the uwbw n1 n28 n54 and n59 fig 1a through usgs website u s geological survey 2016 hourly streamflow data were available at five locations in the ldpw n1 n15 n39 n75 and n109 fig 1b u s geological survey 2016 for both the watersheds hourly gridded rainfall data were downloaded from nasa land data assimilation system nldas xia et al 2012a b and areal average of rainfall was computed to get a single rainfall time series which was subsequently assumed uniform over the entire watershed surface runoff was computed from mean daily streamflow data using digital recursive filter technique arnold and allen 1999 implemented in matlab uploaded by qiao 2018 in ldpw dataset mean daily streamflow was computed from sub daily data further excess rainfall was computed using scs cn method chow et al 1988 with the constraint that the excess rainfall volume was equal to surface runoff the computed cn was 94 for uwbw and 72 for ldpw surface runoff time series with excess rainfall are shown in fig 3 a and b computed geomorphological parameters of the two watersheds are listed in the supplementary materials in this study the posterior distribution of model and error parameters in both the watersheds were estimated using streamflow observations at n1 only the observations at other nodes were treated as unknown and used only to test the effectiveness of the proposed method in quantification of uncertainty the observations at n54 in uwbw were not used because node n54 is a source node and its location is slightly off from delineated stream 4 2 results 4 2 1 upper wabash busseron watershed fig 4 shows the marginal posterior distribution of model parameters v s v h and error parameters σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ with uniform prior on each table 1 and mggd likelihood as in eq 16 again the posterior distribution was computed using streamflow observations at node n1 and the parameters σ δ v s 2 and σ δ v h 2 are variances of perturbation in v s and v h the support of the posterior of shape parameter β was 0 90 1 00 and the observation error variance λ was concentrated below 5 m 6 s 2 the posterior samples drawn from joint distribution of v s and v h were used to obtain the posterior realizations of streamflow the parametric uncertainty band so obtained fig 5 a c and e at three nodes was narrow and most of the observations were not enveloped by this band residual simulated observed associated with each of the streamflow realizations in parametric uncertainty band is shown in fig 5b d and f these residual time series may be interpreted as resulting due to structural errors the residuals at different time steps are correlated with each other and therefore the popular independence assumption is not valid in this case these residual plots also support the hypothesis that the magnitude of structural uncertainty depends upon input rainfall further a set of global optimal parameters was obtained by maximizing the likelihood of observations residuals in 19 the optimal parameters obtained were v s v h σ δv s 2 σ δv h 2 β λ 0 35 m s 1 0 14 m s 1 0 41 m 2 s 2 0 49 m 2 s 2 0 75 2 28 m 6 s 2 the mean of simulated streamflow obtained by optimal v s v h 0 35 m s 1 0 14 m s 1 is shown in fig 6 a c and e along with structural uncertainty band obtained by σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ 0 41 m 2 s 2 0 49 m 2 s 2 0 75 2 28 m 6 s 2 all the observations at the three nodes are enveloped by this uncertainty band however the band is very wide at all three nodes especially at high flow time steps the corresponding correlation matrices responsible for generating structural uncertainty bands are shown in fig 6b d and f these correlation matrices are adequate to model the residuals shown in fig 5 fig 7 shows the 100 and 95 credible regions of total uncertainty the 100 credible region is extremely wide at most of the time steps as is the 95 credible region though it is a tradition to show only 90 or 95 credible region to represent uncertainty we show 100 credible region also as it gives a more complete picture of possible streamflow values it may be noted that mcmc method was used to draw samples from the streamflow distribution therefore the samples in 100 credible region which are not there in 95 credible region are rare but still a possibility 4 2 2 lower des plaines watershed fig 8 shows the marginal posterior distribution of model and error parameters obtained using streamflow observations at n1 fig 1a with priors listed in table 1 the support of v s was 0 4 0 6 m s 1 and support of v h was 0 1 0 m s 1 the posterior of shape parameter β degenerated to 0 5 and the support of λ was 0 1 0 3 m 6 s 2 parametric uncertainty bands at different nodes are shown in fig 9 along with corresponding residuals the simulated hydrograph at all the five nodes seem to be shifted to the right delayed and most of the observations are not enveloped by the parametric uncertainty band the residuals have clear trends which again indicates that the assumption of independence of residuals at different time steps would be invalid global optimal parameters obtained were v s v h σ δv s 2 σ δv h 2 β λ 0 38 ms 1 0 63 ms 1 0 88 m 2 s 2 0 58 m 2 s 2 0 50 1 32 m 6 s 2 structural uncertainty bands 95 credible region corresponding to global optimal parameters are shown in fig 10 at n1 most of the observations are enveloped by the uncertainty band but at other nodes most of the observations are outside the band there is a strong correlation fig 10 between any two successive residuals in the time series since the global optimal parameters v s v h obtained by sce ua were not contained in the support of posterior distribution of v s v h the residual obtained by global optimal parameters is shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the 100 and 95 credible region of total uncertainty which are again very wide at most of the time steps there are notable differences between results for uwbw and ldpw a the parametric uncertainty band was closer to observations in ldpw b parametric uncertainty band was wider and structural uncertainty band was narrower in ldpw c structural uncertainty band contains all the observations in uwbw but misses most of the observations in ldpw and d gaussian was appropriate distribution for residuals in uwbw and laplacian was appropriate distribution for residuals in ldpw 4 3 discussion since the bias in estimation of streamflow by giuh model was assumed to be zero and a likelihood which is peaked at its mean 0 in this study was used maximum likelihood solution for v s and v h was ensured to be the one that fits the observed data the best provided that the optimization method attains a global optimal solution the optimal values obtained by sce ua were v s v h 0 35 m s 1 0 14 m s 1 in uwbw and v s v h 0 38 m s 1 0 64 m s 1 in ldpw but these values did not fit the observations very well especially the daily streamflow in uwbw this lack of fit may be partially attributed to errors made in baseflow separation and extraction of excess rainfall from total rainfall and partially attributed to structural errors in giuh model errors in baseflow separation and excess rainfall computations are also part of structural errors but these errors were not explicitly accounted for in this study the residuals shown in figs 5 and 9 are due to the structural and measurement errors in a strict sense not each of these realizations represents residual due to structural errors only the residual obtained by globally optimal parameters is due to structural errors for a given set of model parameters v s v h error parameters σ δ v s 2 σ δ v h 2 β λ are estimated so that likelihood of the residual series obtained is maximized since in uwbw the residuals obtained were large fig 5b d and f and likelihood used was symmetric about zero the structural uncertainty is expected to be large as was noted in fig 6a c e in ldpw the simulated streamflow could fit the observations relatively well therefore the structural uncertainty estimated was small fig 10a c e g i in other words the width of structural uncertainty band depends upon zero bias assumption ability of giuh theory to fit the observations and inherent assumption in the maximum likelihood theory that the residual obtained has high probability among different residuals in a population the total uncertainty band is very wide in both the watersheds which at first seems discouraging but it should be noted that these bands accurately represent our state of knowledge about streamflow at ungagged basins if we use giuh theory to model streamflow multivariate generalized gaussian law to model the residuals and uniform priors on parameters as given in table 1 the estimation of parametric uncertainty depends upon the likelihood chosen for modeling structural and measurement uncertainty and the amount of information available through the observations therefore in uwbw the narrow posterior of parameters obtained fig 4 was due to the assumption that the mggd is the appropriate likelihood which is sharply peaked within a narrow support for v s v h as shown in fig a4a in supplementary materials similarly in ldpw the parametric uncertainty band was relatively wider because likelihood was peaked over wider support for v s v h as shown in fig a4b in supplementary materials the width of structural uncertainty band also depends upon measurement uncertainty at any time step only the sum of measurement and structural errors is known therefore it is not possible to separate structural errors from measurement errors unless prior information is available one way to obtain strong prior information on measurement uncertainty could be the analysis of rating curve errors prior to hydrologic modeling see baldassarre and montanari 2009 the posterior of β had a support of 0 90 1 00 in uwbw indicating that the gaussian is an appropriate model for errors so long as residuals at successive time steps are not assumed independent the posterior of β degenerates to 0 5 in ldpw indicating laplacian is an appropriate model for errors so long as residuals at successive time steps are not assumed independent the nature of this distribution is not known prior to modeling therefore it seems better to always use generalized gaussian instead of gaussian or laplacian and let the data decide the appropriate distribution since residuals at daily scale are average of residuals at sub daily scale it seems reasonable that the residuals at daily scale are gaussian due to central limit theorem clt however it should be noted that clt is valid only if the random variables being summed are independent in ldpw the support of the variance of measurement errors λ is 0 1 0 3 m 6 s 2 which is surprisingly small it may due to the absorption of measurement uncertainty by parametric or structural uncertainty as noted by renard et al 2010 it is not possible to separate different kinds of uncertainties in a hydrologic model without strong priors on the parameter space the λ in 9 is the variance of the iid random error e i s one would desire the λ to be zero so that σ j c j since any valid covariance matrix must be positive semi definite the c must be chosen such that σ stays positive semi definite the positive semi definiteness of σ implies that w t σ w 0 w 0 24 w t j c j t w 0 w 0 j t w t c j t w 0 w 0 if c is a diagonal matrix with all the entries being positive then 24 would hold if 25 j t w 0 w 0 clearly 25 cannot hold for all non zero w s because j is usually a rectangular matrix which cannot be non singular however 28 would hold for all w which are not in the null space of matrix j 5 summary and conclusions the aim of this paper was to develop a method for propagation of uncertainty in simulated streamflow from a measured location to unmeasured locations often we use streamflow observations at one node to calibrate a distributed hydrologic model and estimate the streamflow at other nodes using the calibrated hydrologic model however hydrologic models have different kinds of uncertainties due to measurement errors structural errors and limited amount of information through data estimation of total uncertainty at measured location involves specification of a functional form for the distribution of residuals which is supposed to model measurement and structural uncertainties subsequently parameters of hydrologic and error models are calibrated against the observations however at unmeasured locations error model parameters cannot be estimated therefore to model structural uncertainty at unmeasured locations a relationship between error model parameters at different nodes is required in this paper we proposed that the treatment of optimal model parameters as random quantities in the limit of information through data is a convenient way to model structural uncertainty which also yields a relationship between error parameters at different nodes an interpretation of the proposed model as a way to compensate for bias in parameter estimation in the presence of structural errors was provided another feature of the proposed model for structural uncertainty is that it depends upon hydrologic model itself and still preserves the traditional additive error formulation the proposed scheme for modeling structural uncertainty utilizes a generalized gaussian process with zero mean and covariance function as in 9 the method was applied on upper wabash busseron watershed uwbw and lower des plaines watershed ldpw with mean daily and mean hourly streamflow data respectively the giuh theory was used as the hydrological model the following conclusions were drawn from this study a estimation of streamflow at ungauged locations the giuh model fitted the streamflow data at sub daily scale better than at daily scale as is clear from the results in ldpw figs 10 and 11 a model that emulates the streamflow observations at one node fairly well may not be able to emulate streamflow at other nodes it is necessary to explicitly model structural uncertainty at all the nodes where streamflow has to be estimated b structural uncertainty the width of structural uncertainty band depends upon how well the simulated streamflow fits the observations in uwbw the fit was poor which resulted in estimation of wide structural uncertainty band in ldpw the fit was relatively good which resulted in estimation of a relatively narrow structural uncertainty band therefore structural uncertainty band in uwbw was able to envelope all the observations even at unmeasured nodes and structural uncertainty band in ldpw missed most of the observations c assumption over error term the assumption of independence of residuals at successive time steps may be incorrect as is evident from covariance functions shown figs 6 and 10 the proposed method provides a way to relax this assumption the assumption of gaussian distribution of residuals is not always valid the use of a generalized gaussian distribution is recommended and the data should be allowed to decide the appropriate distribution d need for strong prior information the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters is challenged by scarcity of data this problem can be partly addressed by assigning an informative prior over the parameter space which demands an understanding of structural uncertainty in hydrological modeling even if one uses the entire posterior distribution instead of just maximum likelihood parameters an informative prior is required to reach a meaningful solution additionally through informative priors it is possible to separate different kinds of uncertainties present in a hydrologic model therefore it seems that future efforts should be directed towards formulating informative priors over model and error parameters one of the goals of uncertainty quantification is reduction of uncertainty by the identification of weaknesses in the process description though the proposed method can give an estimate of structural uncertainty the attribution of uncertainty to a set of missing processes or to inadequate representation of the included processes is not often possible because of model complexity inter dependency among processes model assumptions and data limitations one technique to reduce uncertainty is to test alternate representations of watershed processes see clark et al 2011 the following aspects may be helpful in reducing uncertainty a relaxing the assumption of linear time invariance of the watershed b better characterization of measurement uncertainty baldassarre and montanari 2009 and c an understanding of the statistical behavior of residuals due to structural errors this study has following limitations a the uniform priors used in this study may not be truly non informative therefore the posteriors distribution of parameters may be biased in an unknown way b this method requires computation of the derivatives of the model g in 1 which increases the computational cost and might make this method infeasible for complex models where derivatives would have to be computed numerically c number of perturbation parameters increases linearly with number of hydrologic parameters if the number of hydrologic parameters is large it might be wise to perturb only the few most sensitive parameters d uncertainty in available rainfall data has not been modeled e the functional form of the distribution of perturbation δ θ has not been discussed in present study ideally one can choose a functional form for δ θ and measurement error term e which will uniquely determine the functional form of the distribution of here we directly modeled by generalized gaussian which puts restrictions on functional form of how to determine the distribution of δ θ and e given the distribution of is an open question f global optimization methods yield a near optimal solution which is an added source of uncertainty its effects on the results presented in this study have not been evaluated g the value of estimated parameters depends upon structural errors present in a model and may be far from true values in presence of structural errors the proposed method simulates the effect of structural errors by augmenting the parameter set while this does not capture all the uncertainty due to structural errors it is a useful

6332,spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture are important for explaining hydrological processes at the hillslope scale the fate of various hillslope flow paths can vary seasonally and their relationship with rainfall events can be nonstationary we collected high resolution in situ soil moisture datasets at 30 points 10 locations in three depths between march and november in a steep mountainous hillslope the wavelet coherence analysis of eco hydrometeorological factors and soil moistures indicated distinctive controls of rainfall and evapotranspiration over soil moisture at time scales of under a day the vertical flow in upslope areas can be explained by significant wavelet coherence in soil moisture profiles the appearance of lateral flow with vertical flow in the downslope is associated with even more significant wavelet coherence between identical depths the wavelet coherence analysis between two soil moisture time series both along hillslope layers and depth profiles provided good spatial and temporal representations of hillslope hydrological processes in terms of their timing and scale the distributions of soil moisture coherences showed distinctive characteristics for three different seasons the seasonally distinctive role of vegetation to infiltration was apparent for the upslope area but the combined impact of vegetation and topography controlled more complicated hydrological processes in the downslope area the phase angle analysis was introduced to show the profile difference of hydrological processes on various time scales

2014 mahmood and vivoni 2011 tavakoli and smedt 2013 finding possible relationships between multiple time series of hydrometric data can lead to a better inductive understanding for hydrologic systems kim 2016 young 2013 which can lead to more accurate characterizations of the soil moisture response in terms of the model structure the nonstationary relationships between hydrometeorological data and soil moisture as well as soil moisture time series need to be explored within the context of the time and the scale of a particular process the information in the frequency domain can be useful for identifying and understanding the response scales of different hydrological processes while the fourier transformation is only applicable to stationary signals the wavelet transformation allows for a nonstationary signal to be analyzed in other words the wavelet analysis provides both time and frequency domain information which can be useful for characterizing seasonally different soil moisture responses furthermore the signal in wavelet analysis can be disassembled into many components which makes it easier to decompose the signal or reconstruct it for a given wavelet transform therefore the wavelet transformation is suitable to detect nonstationary or transitory features of soil moisture such as patterns trends drift abrupt changes and beginnings and ends of hydrologic events at various time scales the wavelet analysis has been a useful approach for investigating not only the stochastic structure between two soil moisture time series particularly for a nonstationary system lauzon et al 2004 but also the multiple relationships with eco hydrological climate factors at specific scale ranges liu et al 2017 actually analyses of soil moisture with wavelet transforms have been widely conducted in many different hydrologic systems andrew et al 2017 liu et al 2017 su and ryu 2014 the relationship between soil moisture and eco hydrometeorological data e g rainfall and evapotranspiration as well as the inter relationship between soil moisture time series of depth profiles at different scales can be addressed effectively through the wavelet coherency creutzfeldt et al 2012 ding et al 2013 lauzon et al 2004 wu et al 2002 which is a measure of correlation between the time series obtained through estimating the coherence coefficient on both the time and frequency domain biswas and si 2011 however existing studies of wavelet analysis used daily or monthly soil moisture data wavelet coherence analysis using a fine time scale resolution of 2 h between soil moisture and eco hydrometric factors can provide a better understanding of hillslope hydrological processes during rainfall events and the subsequent periods the configuration of hydrological processes at a hillslope scale is important for characterizing the hydrologic responses and physically based modeling angermann et al 2017 loritz et al 2017 the occurrence of distinct hillslope flow paths can be explored within the context of season different time scales soil depth and location in this study we collected time series of soil moisture for 10 soil depth profiles at bi hourly intervals by using a multiplex time domain reflectometry tdr system the connectivity in the flow path determines the causality between two adjacent soil moisture series a coherence analysis between multiple time series of soil moisture can be used to effectively configure relationships between different hydrologic components as well as different temporal scales of hillslope hydrological processes we performed a wavelet analysis of soil moistures for different locations and depths to investigate the difference in hydrological fluxes between adjacent points both for upslope and downslope regoliths time series of hydrological components were decomposed and seasonal characteristics for soil moisture control were delineated the main research questions addressed in this paper are as follows 1 how can the relationship between soil moisture and eco hydrometric factors like rainfall and evapotranspiration be expressed 2 how was the time and scale of primary flow paths such as vertical flow and lateral flow distributed according to soil moisture measuring depths and locations 3 how were the hillslope hydrological processes distributed between the upslope and downslope areas at different depths during two dry seasons spring and autumn and a rainy season summer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is one of the headwaters of the sulmachun watershed located in the northwestern part of south korea in the sulmachun watershed a hydrologic monitoring area has been in operation for the past 25 years and hydrometric measurements such as rainfall streamflow soil tension and soil moisture as well as meteorological variables relative humidity solar radiation etc have been collected at seven stations fig 1 a we selected a steep hillslope for an intensive field monitoring campaign of soil moisture data with a sampling interval of 2 h and an error bound of 2 volumetric soil moisture refined digital elevation models dems with a 0 5 m resolution for surface and bedrock were obtained throughout an intensive topographical survey by using a theodolite dt 208p topcon and direct measurements of soil depth with iron poles the slope of surface and bedrock varied between 20 and 35 and annual temperature varied between 15 and 35 c the elevation of the hillslope ranged between 200 and 260 m above sea level the hillslope bedrock consisted of gneissic granite and fracture development was negligible leptosol was the dominant soil type and cambisol was found at greater depths the predominant soil textures were sandy loam and loamy sand we collected 15 soil samples for our analysis the mean bulk density of the soil samples was 1 36 g cm3 and the porosity varied between 25 and 49 the depth of the soil ranged between 25 and 95 cm and the depth of the root zone was approximately 20 30 cm the study area was covered by a mixture of polemoniales shrubby quercus and a coniferous canopy of pinus densiflora the leaf area indices lais which were measured by using an lai 2000 device li cor 2004 varied between 1 06 and 0 98 for november and between 2 98 and 3 97 for may the mean annual rainfall for the last five years was 1066 8 mm with a standard deviation of 268 mm and 70 of the total rainfall occurred between june and august which is the asian monsoon season the rainfall amount in 2016 was 1123 6 mm the mean annual evaporation for the last five years was 393 mm these data were collected at a flux tower located 50 m from the study area with a measurement interval of 30 min both rainfall and evapotranspiration were used for identifying the relationship with soil moisture which is important in evaluating the water budget in a hillslope graf et al 2014 2 2 data acquisition for soil moisture and rainfall a flow direction algorithm md8 multiple direction for 8 was applied to the surface and subsurface dems to obtain spatial distributions of the upslope contributing area and the topographic wetness indices quinn et al 1991 the monitoring locations 10 were determined based on the terrain analysis indicating negligible and substantial upslope contributing areas as shown in fig 1 b monitoring locations were distributed both upslope 5 and downslope 5 and three sensors were inserted horizontally in the upslope direction at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm while trying to minimize disturbance to the soil matrix a buriable waveguide with a length and diameter of 20 cm and 0 3 cm respectively and a multiplex minitrase 6050x3k1 were used soil moisture equipment corporation 2005 temporal variations of soil moisture content were recorded at bihourly intervals between april 1 and december 13 2016 a tipping bucket rain gauge te525mm campbell scientific inc was installed into the middle point of the hillslope and rainfall data were collected between april and early december 2016 fig 1 b rainfall data were recorded every 10 min and converted into a frequency of two hours 2 3 wavelet coherence analysis the wavelet analysis was introduced to obtain two dimensional expressions of time and frequency resolutions from the time series of soil moisture in this study the morlet wavelet a modulating function consisting of a gaussian function was used to identify the signal features because it provides a good balance between time and frequency scales grinsted et al 2004 we used a continuous wavelet transform cwt to expand the soil moisture time series into the time frequency space as follows 1 w n x s n 1 n 1 x n φ n n δ t s where x n is the soil moisture time series data that were measured at an equal time interval δ t with n 1 n 1 n is the number of points and n 3047 between march and november s is the wavelet scale and φ η π 0 25 e i ω η e 0 5 η 2 where ω and η represent the non dimensional frequency and time parameter respectively the relationships between soil moisture and other environmental factors were explored through the wavelet coherence method which provides a measure of how coherent the cross wavelet transform is in the time frequency domain biswas and si 2011 liu et al 2017 as the coherence becomes greater the similarity between two time series increases and the coherence between two soil moisture series can be expressed as 2 c o h e r e n c e s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where x and y are two time series s indicates the smoothing over both time and scale w n xy s w n x s w n y s is the cross wavelet spectrum of x and y and w n y s is the complex conjugate of w n y s wavelet transform analysis also indicates the phase shift across the time domain by defining an angle in an interval π π weigand et al 2017 the angle can be expressed as a phase difference this shows that the common cycles among the two time series are positively or negatively correlated this also shows which time series is leading in terms of the relationship between the time series at certain frequency values roesch and schmidbauer 2014 the relative phase difference between the two time series can be calculated as follows 3 n s tan 1 im s s 1 w n xy s re s s 1 w n xy s where im s f and re s f represent the imaginary and real part of s f respectively the phase differences are explained as the differences of both correlation and lagging relationships for example if the phase difference is zero two time series are perfectly correlated if the phase difference between the two time series is π then they are perfectly anti correlated the other ranges can be expressed by the lagging or lead in the relationship between two time series generally the phase difference between the spatial data has been explained using the correlation characteristics of positive or negative correlation biswas and si 2011 and that between temporal data had been expressed as the lagging or advancing relationship at specific periods grinsted et al 2004 wu et al 2002 in other words if the phase angle between the time series x and y has a small positive value 0 n s π 2 then the response pattern of time series x leads that of time series y and vice versa for a small negative phase angle 0 n s π 2 by applying a band pass filter to the morlet wavelet the original time series can be reconstructed by combining a set of reconstruction waves the reconstruction factor c δ was selected as 0 776 torrence and compo 1998 the reconstructed time series represents the summation of the real part of the wavelet transform over the selected scale ranges as follows 4 x t δ t δ t 1 2 c δ φ 0 j 1 j re w n s j s either full or partial ranges of the frequency can be used in composing reconstructed signals 2 4 statistical testing of significance in the coherence map the wavelet coherence is statistically tested to determine whether the relationship is statistically significant or not depending on data characteristics and the objective of the test there are several methods for testing the hypothesis of equal periodic components such as white noise series shuffling autoregressive series ar and so on both white noise and red noise with ar 1 have been widely used in hydrological and soil water datasets hu and si 2016 considering the red noise like behavior of soil properties and soil water storage biswas and si 2011 grinsted et al 2004 we used the null hypothesis of red noise processes as the significant periodic characteristics identical to those of a red noise generated by an ar with one lag ar 1 process the soil moisture time series of the study area had the memory effect which can be expressed in terms of an autoregressive model kim 2016 a first order memory structure is commonly used to interpret soil moisture fluctuations derived from climate simulations ghannam et al 2016 wu and dickinson 2004 the statistical test for significance of wavelet coherency was conducted by carrying out one thousand spatial realizations scale and time of paired series for 1000 spatial realizations wavelet coherencies at different times and on different scales were generated and sorted in ascending order in this study the 990th wavelet coherency value for time and scale provides 99 confidence level or the 1 significance level for a specific time and scale wu et al 2002 because the continuous wavelet transform is not completely localized in time it creates discontinuities at the edge side the cone of influence coi is introduced for determining the spectrum borders influenced by edge effects grinsted et al 2004 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorological data the time series of soil moisture and rainfall were both collected successfully between the end of march and the early part of december in 2016 fig 2 the soil moistures at a 10 cm depth in the upslope area showed prompt responses to rainfall events and the differences in the mean and variation between monitoring locations was substantial fig 2 a however soil moisture response patterns for the 30 and 60 cm depths in the upslope area were less sensitive to rainfall events fig 2 b and c and the differences between locations tended to be reduced at deeper depths there was a negligible response in soil moisture for rainfall events in june and august to september at the depth of 60 cm fig 2 c which indicates that the contribution of hillslope processes at the deeper soil layer in the upslope area was limited to significant rainfall events response features for the time series of soil moisture in the downslope area fig 2 d f were different than those for the upslope area substantial increases in soil moisture were found for three events between july and october and these data were indicative of the formation of saturation moreover the soil moisture response patterns to rainfall events at deeper depths such as the 60 cm depth in fig 2 f were more apparent than those for shallower depths and even stronger and longer formation periods of soil saturation were observed at deeper depths these findings indicate that the soil moisture determining mechanisms in the upslope and downslope areas were completely different 3 2 significant wavelet coherence between eco hydrological factors and soil moisture a statistical test could be used to analyze significant wavelet coherences and their scales between different hydrometeorological time series in order to investigate features of soil moisture in depth profiles for upslope and downslope areas soil moisture time series 5 points in identical depth were averaged for the upslope and downslope respectively and used for wavelet coherence analysis significant wavelet coherences between time series can be effectively delineated by using a confidence interval of 99 for the average wavelet coherence wavelet coherence between background noise from the ar 1 process red noise was compared to wavelet coherence between time series to determine the significant wavelet coherence grinsted et al 2004 the relationships between significant wavelet coherences and time scales were useful for identifying the effective time scales of particular hydrological components e g rainfall evapotranspiration infiltration and lateral flow in soil moisture responses figs 3 5 fig 3 presents significant wavelet coherences 99 confidence interval between eco hydrometeorologic time series and average soil moistures of different locations different depths and identical depths between upslope and downslope as shown in fig 3 significant coherences to rainfall were found for time scales of less than 4 h and those for evapotranspiration were identified for time scales of around 12 and 24 h the abrupt increase in soil moisture was mainly associated with the impact of rainwater input relatively slow recession in soil moisture can be explained by evapotranspiration on daily or half a day time scales the significant coherence range of a day period in the relationship with evapotranspiration was the same as that in previously reported studies ding et al 2013 two more significant coherences with rainfall amounts were found in the study period one was between 1 week and 1 month and other was after 2 months the appearance of significant coherence between soil moisture and rainfall on a time scale of 2000 h can be explained by the seasonal behavior of rainfall generation and its impact on soil moisture liu et al 2017 also showed two parts of significant coherence such as weekly to monthly periodicities and a 12 month periodicity 3 3 significant soil moisture coherence between measuring points the degree of wetness similarity between identical depths of different locations can be useful for understanding the impact of hydrological controls in several depths and that of different processes such as infiltration exfiltration and lateral flow in the spatial context fig 4 a and b present significant wavelet coherences 99 confidence level between soil moistures of identical depth for all measuring points on upslope and downslope areas scales of significant coherences were distributed between 4 0 and 10 h and appeared again near 24 h wavelet coherences between soil moistures were decreased between 4 0 and 4 5 h and then increased up to 10 h as illustrated in fig 3 the coherence between rainfall and soil moisture disappeared at about a scale of 4 h the changing points of slopes from negative to positive coherence fig 4 a and b can be explained by the time scale of process switching from infiltration to exfiltration two notable differences were found between fig 4 a and b one was that the significant coherences of less than 4 h appeared only at a 10 cm depth for upslope areas fig 4 a but those for downslope areas appeared at all depth relationships fig 4 b this can be explained by the fact that rainfall from vertical infiltration is responsible for the coherences on time scales less than 4 h at a 10 cm depth for upslope areas but those for downslope areas cannot be completely explained by the infiltration higher antecedent soil moistures for downslope areas fig 2 were responsible for more active soil moisture coherence between identical depths the other point was that while the significant coherences appeared around the scale of 12 h in upslope areas those for downslope areas did not show any notable coherence at the half day scale this may indicate that the impact of evapotranspiration for downslope areas is less apparent than that of upslope areas the development of vertical flow is responsible for significant wavelet coherences between different depths for an identical location the significant wavelet coherence between soil moistures along vertical profiles in identical locations can be explained by the development of the vertical flow fig 5 a and b show the development of soil moisture relationships along various depth profiles 10 cm 30 cm 10 cm 60 cm and 30 cm 60 cm for upslope and downslope areas respectively while the coherences less than a scale of 5 h existed for upslope areas fig 5 a those for downslope areas appeared only from the greater scale of 5 h fig 5 b the decreasing part of significant coherence existed only in upslope areas thus indicating apparent vertical infiltration by rain water however no coherence for the time scale of less than 5 h in downslope areas strongly indicated that the hydrological process during the rainfall event could not be explained by the vertical infiltration but lateral flow as illustrated from fig 4 b similar to fig 4 a and 4 b stronger coherences at the time scale of 12 h appeared in upslope areas than those for downslope areas fig 5 a and b which can be viewed as another demonstration of the different impacts of evapotranspiration between upslope and downslope areas 3 4 soil moisture wavelet coherence between identical soil depths and soil profiles the degree of wetness similarity between identical depths of different locations can be useful in understanding the impact of lateral flow in different seasons fig 6 a c present two dimensional significant coherence spaces of time and scale for two adjacent points up1 and up2 in the upslope area at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm the higher wavelet coherence is indicative of a more significant relationship between time series the area inside of black contours in fig 6 indicates statistical significance at the 1 level and white angles represent the phase difference between time series the coherence tended to decrease at deeper depths for the spring season but the opposite trend was observed for the autumn season fig 6 a c relationships between adjacent points identical depth in the upslope area all showed similar features as shown in fig 6 a c seasonal differences in the two dimensional space of coherence were even more apparent at the 60 cm depth as shown in fig 6 a c significant coherence was found at a depth of 60 cm and it was a longer period ranging from 2 to 512 than that for the other depths during the autumn season while the scales of meaningful coherence were between 16 and 256 periods in spring those for autumn were between the 2 and 512 periods fig 6 c this can be explained by the fact that the rate of infiltration during the autumn season was higher than that of spring the coherence between two points do1 and do2 in the downslope area showed features that were different than those in the upslope area fig 6 d f more significant wavelet coherence in the high frequency below the 126 period in the downslope area than that of the upslope area indicated that the soil response pattern in the downslope area could not be completely explained by the vertical flow the distinct seasonal pattern between spring and autumn in the upslope area was not apparent in the downslope coherence response at deeper depths the coherence at short periods tended to be weaker at both upslope and downslope areas but vice versa for long periods of both upslope and downslope areas this can be explained by the fact that soil moisture at shallow depths is more sensitive to precipitation and evapotranspiration loss but that at deeper depths is buffered by shallow soil and is not susceptible to climate factors liu et al 2017 the two dimensional coherence between soil moistures of different depths in an identical location indicates the degree of vertical flow development and its time and scale distribution while significant coherence appeared in the soil moisture relationship between 10 and 30 cm of the up2 point compared to the other combinations during the spring season wavelet coherence ranges for the three depth relationships 10 and 30 cm 30 and 60 cm 10 and 60 cm were similar to each other during the autumn season as shown in fig 7 a c while the scale of significant coherence during the autumn season was between 8 and 512 h in all combinations that for spring was for the period 16 and 256 with occasional discontinuity fig 7 a c the significant wavelet coherence of soil moisture between 30 and 60 cm was strongest for the rainy season in the period range from 128 to 512 fig 7 a c significant wavelet coherences of soil moisture profiles for the downslope area do2 were substantially greater than those for the upslope area up2 in terms of abundance in the high frequency distribution pattern for all relationships fig 7 d f the significant wavelet coherences between the 10 and 60 cm depth for location do2 were more widely spatially distributed than those of other pairs such as at 10 and 30 cm and 30 and 60 cm in the downslope area which was completely distinct from the findings in the upslope area fig 7 d f the development of bypass flow between two depths was found to be responsible for the more spatially significant wavelet coherences between 10 and 60 cm than those for other depths this trend appeared stronger during the rainy season than the trends in the other two dry seasons the abundance in macropore development in downslope areas was visually confirmed as well as with field tests of macropores gwak and kim 2013 3 5 phase difference analysis the phase differences between two time series were displayed as arrows in two dimensional coherence expressions and we used waveletcomp in r for comprehensively evaluating the phase difference in angles roesch and schmidbauer 2014 this application is available from the url http hs stat com waveletcomp the difference in phase can be converted to an angle that indicates which time series was leading in the relationship for a designated period the phase differences of five measuring points in upslope and downslope areas were averaged as shown in fig 8 considering the range of phase difference among soil moisture time series as between 3 8 π and 3 8 π the phase difference can be explained as the phase lagging or phase leading at specific periods the phase differences in the significant wavelet coherences between different depths for an identical location were classified into two parts one ranged between 3 8 π and 0 for deeper depths and the other ranged between 0 and 3 8 π for shallower depths at a specific period all values of phase difference were statistically significant with red noise and the outside of the coi p value 0 01 the significant phase differences p value 0 01 of soil moistures between shallow depths and deeper depths were evaluated for all datasets i e those for upslope and downslope areas in order to clarify the relationships between specific depths of soil moisture we evaluated phase angle distributions for three depths in the upslope and downslope areas as presented in fig 8 a and b the distribution of phase angles between the upslope and downslope areas was different the leading shallower depth was pronounced for all relationships in the upslope dataset in the range of a week and it substantially decreased in the range of a month fig 8 a the deeper depth leading pattern was dominant over the range of a month fig 8 b the relationship between 30 and 60 cm showed a distinct leading deeper depth for the time scale greater than one month the relationships both between 10 cm and 60 cm and 10 cm and 30 cm showed the deeper leading pattern after the period of a month in other words the short period range showed a shallower depth leading pattern and the long period range showed a deeper depth leading pattern the range of the shallower depth leading pattern by the period of a week at the downslope area was not apparent unlike that of the upslope area fig 8 b the relationship between 10 cm and 30 cm indicated that the dominant 10 cm leading pattern in all ranges of the period and deeper depth leading pattern was apparent for time scales greater than a week for the relationship between 30 cm and 60 cm fig 8 b 4 discussion 4 1 phase differences in coherence at longer periods in this study spatio temporal analysis was performed fig 8 to configure the relationship between temporal data and both lagging and correlation characteristics were considered together weigand et al 2017 a similar pattern of phase differences up1030 up1060 up3060 in fig 8 a at the upslope area indicated that the vertical relationships were controlled by similar hydrological processes in all the ranges while the phase difference between 1 day and 1 week were similar to each other those of the downslope were distinct for all three relationships fig 8 b which can be explained by more complicated hydrological processes vertical and lateral flows in the downslope the phase angle difference between the upslope and downslope areas in the short period throughout a day mainly was associated with hydrological processes driven by the eco hydrologic factors such as rainfall and evapotranspiration which can be explained by the vertical flow with a relatively quick response fig 3 the deeper depth leading pattern become dominant after a period of 1 month in the upslope area which can be attributed to the existence of hydrological processes near the bedrock boundary leading in phase differences for 10 cm and 60 cm depths over a 30 cm depth in the downslope area were associated with dominant flow along two boundaries surface and bedrock in downslope areas the lateral flow with a relatively slow response represents a potential explanation for the phase angle distributions at longer time scales the deeper depth leading trend deteriorated substantially after 2 months both in the upslope and downslope areas 4 2 hillslope hydrological processes and scales vertical flow seemed to represent the primary hydrological process in the upslope area while the maximum depth of vertical flow was limited to 30 cm for the spring season that of the autumn season extended to a depth of 60 cm the seasonal difference of water loss due to vegetation activity between spring and autumn was responsible for the seasonal differences in coherence and this phenomenon has been observed before in a monsoon climate ghimire et al 2014 measurements of the lai were between 1 06 and 0 98 in november and between 2 98 and 3 97 in may which indicates that there was a difference in evapotranspiration between the two seasons the estimated ranges for maximum canopy storage were between 0 6 mm day and 0 794 mm day and between 0 196 mm day and 0 212 mm day for may and november respectively this makes the rate of infiltration during the autumn season higher than the rates for other seasons the higher stability in soil moisture during the spring season than that for other seasons also supports the higher coherence in the spring at a depth of 10 cm as shown in fig 6 a stronger coherence in the high frequency range in the downslope area than that in the upslope area figs 6 and 7 was indicative of more complicated hydrological processes downslope the water from rainfall and lateral flow from upslope through the contributing area were responsible for soil moisture variation in the downslope area brocca et al 2007 mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 the impact of seasonally different vegetation on hydrological processes was substantially compensated for by the stationary impact of topography in the downslope area which was confirmed by the seasonally less varied coherence structures figs 6 and 7 a notable flow path pattern in the downslope area was the formation of two lateral boundary flows along the surface and bedrock layers in the rainy season which was reflected by the stronger coherence between 10 and 60 cm than that between other depths as shown in fig 7 e more complicated hydrological flow paths such as lateral flow and return flow in addition to vertical flow in the downslope area compared to that of the upslope area can be responsible for the high frequency distributions of coherence as shown in figs 6 and 7 5 conclusion an intensive field campaign of soil moisture monitoring was performed in the upslope and downslope areas of a steep mountainous hillslope the significant wavelet coherence between soil moisture and eco hydrological factors such as rainfall 4 h and evapotranspiration 10 13 h and 18 26 h for the short periods indicated that two drivers determine the quick soil moisture response the significant wavelet coherences were found only between 10 cm soil depths for the time scale of 4 h in upslope areas and those between soil moisture profiles for scales less than 5 h were not found in downslope areas thus indicating that vertical flow is a primary process for upslope and lateral flow is an important hydrological process in downslope areas the impact of evapotranspiration to soil moisture coherence was different between upslope and downslope areas soil moisture coherences were more similar than those between soil moisture and evapotranspiration in upslope than downslope areas both the soil moisture coherences between identical depths and those of soil profiles indicated that the infiltration rate during the autumn season was higher than that during the spring season significantly high frequencies in coherences during the rainy season in the downslope area were strongly associated with more complicated hydrological processes including preferential flow than those in the upslope area stronger coherence in soil moisture between 10 and 60 cm than the other relationships can be explained by the development of boundary flows along the surface and bedrock layers and the existence of bypass flows during the rainy season the seasonal difference in vegetation activity was responsible for the distinct infiltration rate between spring and autumn relatively less variable coherences downslope than those upslope could be explained by the impact of topography in addition to vegetation in the downslope area the phase difference angles between different depths showed a shallower depth leading pattern for the period of less than 1 month in the upslope area which can be explained by the vertical flow from shallow to deeper depths more complicated flows in the downslope area were responsible for 10 cm and 60 cm leading patterns over 30 cm for the period greater than 1 week a notable deeper depth leading pattern was found in relationships between 60 cm and the other depths for time scales greater than one month in both upslope and downslope areas which can be explained by the fact that lateral flow with a lower velocity is pronounced at deeper depths declaration of

6332,spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture are important for explaining hydrological processes at the hillslope scale the fate of various hillslope flow paths can vary seasonally and their relationship with rainfall events can be nonstationary we collected high resolution in situ soil moisture datasets at 30 points 10 locations in three depths between march and november in a steep mountainous hillslope the wavelet coherence analysis of eco hydrometeorological factors and soil moistures indicated distinctive controls of rainfall and evapotranspiration over soil moisture at time scales of under a day the vertical flow in upslope areas can be explained by significant wavelet coherence in soil moisture profiles the appearance of lateral flow with vertical flow in the downslope is associated with even more significant wavelet coherence between identical depths the wavelet coherence analysis between two soil moisture time series both along hillslope layers and depth profiles provided good spatial and temporal representations of hillslope hydrological processes in terms of their timing and scale the distributions of soil moisture coherences showed distinctive characteristics for three different seasons the seasonally distinctive role of vegetation to infiltration was apparent for the upslope area but the combined impact of vegetation and topography controlled more complicated hydrological processes in the downslope area the phase angle analysis was introduced to show the profile difference of hydrological processes on various time scales

corradini 2014 mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 teuling et al 2010 vereecken et al 2016 at the hillslope scale soil moisture plays an important role both in runoff

can be useful not only for evaluating the stability of ecosystems and the relationship between storage and discharge martinez carreras et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 but also for predictions of landslides and hydrological connectivity kim 2014 napolitano et al 2016 multi dimensional models for hillslopes have been applied to represent spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture cornelissen et al 2014 mahmood and vivoni 2011 tavakoli and smedt 2013 finding possible relationships between multiple time series of hydrometric data can lead to a better inductive understanding for hydrologic systems kim 2016 young 2013 which can lead to more accurate characterizations of the soil moisture response in terms of the model structure the nonstationary relationships between hydrometeorological data and soil moisture as well as soil moisture time series need to be explored within the context of the time and the scale of a particular process the information in the frequency domain can be useful for identifying and understanding the response scales of different hydrological processes while the fourier transformation is only applicable to stationary signals the wavelet transformation allows for a nonstationary signal to be analyzed in other words the wavelet analysis provides both time and frequency domain information which can be useful for characterizing seasonally different soil moisture responses furthermore the signal in wavelet analysis can be disassembled into many components which makes it easier to decompose the signal or reconstruct it for a given wavelet transform therefore the wavelet transformation is suitable to detect nonstationary or transitory features of soil moisture such as patterns trends drift abrupt changes and beginnings and ends of hydrologic events at various time scales the wavelet analysis has been a useful approach for investigating not only the stochastic structure between two soil moisture time series particularly for a nonstationary system lauzon et al 2004 but also the multiple relationships with eco hydrological climate factors at specific scale ranges liu et al 2017 actually analyses of soil moisture with wavelet transforms have been widely conducted in many different hydrologic systems andrew et al 2017 liu et al 2017 su and ryu 2014 the relationship between soil moisture and eco hydrometeorological data e g rainfall and evapotranspiration as well as the inter relationship between soil moisture time series of depth profiles at different scales can be addressed effectively through the wavelet coherency creutzfeldt et al 2012 ding et al 2013 lauzon et al 2004 wu et al 2002 which is a measure of correlation between the time series obtained through estimating the coherence coefficient on both the time and frequency domain biswas and si 2011 however existing studies of wavelet analysis used daily or monthly soil moisture data wavelet coherence analysis using a fine time scale resolution of 2 h between soil moisture and eco hydrometric factors can provide a better understanding of hillslope hydrological processes during rainfall events and the subsequent periods the configuration of hydrological processes at a hillslope scale is important for characterizing the hydrologic responses and physically based modeling angermann et al 2017 loritz et al 2017 the occurrence of distinct hillslope flow paths can be explored within the context of season different time scales soil depth and location in this study we collected time series of soil moisture for 10 soil depth profiles at bi hourly intervals by using a multiplex time domain reflectometry tdr system the connectivity in the flow path determines the causality between two adjacent soil moisture series a coherence analysis between multiple time series of soil moisture can be used to effectively configure relationships between different hydrologic components as well as different temporal scales of hillslope hydrological processes we performed a wavelet analysis of soil moistures for different locations and depths to investigate the difference in hydrological fluxes between adjacent points both for upslope and downslope regoliths time series of hydrological components were decomposed and seasonal characteristics for soil moisture control were delineated the main research questions addressed in this paper are as follows 1 how can the relationship between soil moisture and eco hydrometric factors like rainfall and evapotranspiration be expressed 2 how was the time and scale of primary flow paths such as vertical flow and lateral flow distributed according to soil moisture measuring depths and locations 3 how were the hillslope hydrological processes distributed between the upslope and downslope areas at different depths during two dry seasons spring and autumn and a rainy season summer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is one of the headwaters of the sulmachun watershed located in the northwestern part of south korea in the sulmachun watershed a hydrologic monitoring area has been in operation for the past 25 years and hydrometric measurements such as rainfall streamflow soil tension and soil moisture as well as meteorological variables relative humidity solar radiation etc have been collected at seven stations fig 1 a we selected a steep hillslope for an intensive field monitoring campaign of soil moisture data with a sampling interval of 2 h and an error bound of 2 volumetric soil moisture refined digital elevation models dems with a 0 5 m resolution for surface and bedrock were obtained throughout an intensive topographical survey by using a theodolite dt 208p topcon and direct measurements of soil depth with iron poles the slope of surface and bedrock varied between 20 and 35 and annual temperature varied between 15 and 35 c the elevation of the hillslope ranged between 200 and 260 m above sea level the hillslope bedrock consisted of gneissic granite and fracture development was negligible leptosol was the dominant soil type and cambisol was found at greater depths the predominant soil textures were sandy loam and loamy sand we collected 15 soil samples for our analysis the mean bulk density of the soil samples was 1 36 g cm3 and the porosity varied between 25 and 49 the depth of the soil ranged between 25 and 95 cm and the depth of the root zone was approximately 20 30 cm the study area was covered by a mixture of polemoniales shrubby quercus and a coniferous canopy of pinus densiflora the leaf area indices lais which were measured by using an lai 2000 device li cor 2004 varied between 1 06 and 0 98 for november and between 2 98 and 3 97 for may the mean annual rainfall for the last five years was 1066 8 mm with a standard deviation of 268 mm and 70 of the total rainfall occurred between june and august which is the asian monsoon season the rainfall amount in 2016 was 1123 6 mm the mean annual evaporation for the last five years was 393 mm these data were collected at a flux tower located 50 m from the study area with a measurement interval of 30 min both rainfall and evapotranspiration were used for identifying the relationship with soil moisture which is important in evaluating the water budget in a hillslope graf et al 2014 2 2 data acquisition for soil moisture and rainfall a flow direction algorithm md8 multiple direction for 8 was applied to the surface and subsurface dems to obtain spatial distributions of the upslope contributing area and the topographic wetness indices quinn et al 1991 the monitoring locations 10 were determined based on the terrain analysis indicating negligible and substantial upslope contributing areas as shown in fig 1 b monitoring locations were distributed both upslope 5 and downslope 5 and three sensors were inserted horizontally in the upslope direction at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm while trying to minimize disturbance to the soil matrix a buriable waveguide with a length and diameter of 20 cm and 0 3 cm respectively and a multiplex minitrase 6050x3k1 were used soil moisture equipment corporation 2005 temporal variations of soil moisture content were recorded at bihourly intervals between april 1 and december 13 2016 a tipping bucket rain gauge te525mm campbell scientific inc was installed into the middle point of the hillslope and rainfall data were collected between april and early december 2016 fig 1 b rainfall data were recorded every 10 min and converted into a frequency of two hours 2 3 wavelet coherence analysis the wavelet analysis was introduced to obtain two dimensional expressions of time and frequency resolutions from the time series of soil moisture in this study the morlet wavelet a modulating function consisting of a gaussian function was used to identify the signal features because it provides a good balance between time and frequency scales grinsted et al 2004 we used a continuous wavelet transform cwt to expand the soil moisture time series into the time frequency space as follows 1 w n x s n 1 n 1 x n φ n n δ t s where x n is the soil moisture time series data that were measured at an equal time interval δ t with n 1 n 1 n is the number of points and n 3047 between march and november s is the wavelet scale and φ η π 0 25 e i ω η e 0 5 η 2 where ω and η represent the non dimensional frequency and time parameter respectively the relationships between soil moisture and other environmental factors were explored through the wavelet coherence method which provides a measure of how coherent the cross wavelet transform is in the time frequency domain biswas and si 2011 liu et al 2017 as the coherence becomes greater the similarity between two time series increases and the coherence between two soil moisture series can be expressed as 2 c o h e r e n c e s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where x and y are two time series s indicates the smoothing over both time and scale w n xy s w n x s w n y s is the cross wavelet spectrum of x and y and w n y s is the complex conjugate of w n y s wavelet transform analysis also indicates the phase shift across the time domain by defining an angle in an interval π π weigand et al 2017 the angle can be expressed as a phase difference this shows that the common cycles among the two time series are positively or negatively correlated this also shows which time series is leading in terms of the relationship between the time series at certain frequency values roesch and schmidbauer 2014 the relative phase difference between the two time series can be calculated as follows 3 n s tan 1 im s s 1 w n xy s re s s 1 w n xy s where im s f and re s f represent the imaginary and real part of s f respectively the phase differences are explained as the differences of both correlation and lagging relationships for example if the phase difference is zero two time series are perfectly correlated if the phase difference between the two time series is π then they are perfectly anti correlated the other ranges can be expressed by the lagging or lead in the relationship between two time series generally the phase difference between the spatial data has been explained using the correlation characteristics of positive or negative correlation biswas and si 2011 and that between temporal data had been expressed as the lagging or advancing relationship at specific periods grinsted et al 2004 wu et al 2002 in other words if the phase angle between the time series x and y has a small positive value 0 n s π 2 then the response pattern of time series x leads that of time series y and vice versa for a small negative phase angle 0 n s π 2 by applying a band pass filter to the morlet wavelet the original time series can be reconstructed by combining a set of reconstruction waves the reconstruction factor c δ was selected as 0 776 torrence and compo 1998 the reconstructed time series represents the summation of the real part of the wavelet transform over the selected scale ranges as follows 4 x t δ t δ t 1 2 c δ φ 0 j 1 j re w n s j s either full or partial ranges of the frequency can be used in composing reconstructed signals 2 4 statistical testing of significance in the coherence map the wavelet coherence is statistically tested to determine whether the relationship is statistically significant or not depending on data characteristics and the objective of the test there are several methods for testing the hypothesis of equal periodic components such as white noise series shuffling autoregressive series ar and so on both white noise and red noise with ar 1 have been widely used in hydrological and soil water datasets hu and si 2016 considering the red noise like behavior of soil properties and soil water storage biswas and si 2011 grinsted et al 2004 we used the null hypothesis of red noise processes as the significant periodic characteristics identical to those of a red noise generated by an ar with one lag ar 1 process the soil moisture time series of the study area had the memory effect which can be expressed in terms of an autoregressive model kim 2016 a first order memory structure is commonly used to interpret soil moisture fluctuations derived from climate simulations ghannam et al 2016 wu and dickinson 2004 the statistical test for significance of wavelet coherency was conducted by carrying out one thousand spatial realizations scale and time of paired series for 1000 spatial realizations wavelet coherencies at different times and on different scales were generated and sorted in ascending order in this study the 990th wavelet coherency value for time and scale provides 99 confidence level or the 1 significance level for a specific time and scale wu et al 2002 because the continuous wavelet transform is not completely localized in time it creates discontinuities at the edge side the cone of influence coi is introduced for determining the spectrum borders influenced by edge effects grinsted et al 2004 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorological data the time series of soil moisture and rainfall were both collected successfully between the end of march and the early part of december in 2016 fig 2 the soil moistures at a 10 cm depth in the upslope area showed prompt responses to rainfall events and the differences in the mean and variation between monitoring locations was substantial fig 2 a however soil moisture response patterns for the 30 and 60 cm depths in the upslope area were less sensitive to rainfall events fig 2 b and c and the differences between locations tended to be reduced at deeper depths there was a negligible response in soil moisture for rainfall events in june and august to september at the depth of 60 cm fig 2 c which indicates that the contribution of hillslope processes at the deeper soil layer in the upslope area was limited to significant rainfall events response features for the time series of soil moisture in the downslope area fig 2 d f were different than those for the upslope area substantial increases in soil moisture were found for three events between july and october and these data were indicative of the formation of saturation moreover the soil moisture response patterns to rainfall events at deeper depths such as the 60 cm depth in fig 2 f were more apparent than those for shallower depths and even stronger and longer formation periods of soil saturation were observed at deeper depths these findings indicate that the soil moisture determining mechanisms in the upslope and downslope areas were completely different 3 2 significant wavelet coherence between eco hydrological factors and soil moisture a statistical test could be used to analyze significant wavelet coherences and their scales between different hydrometeorological time series in order to investigate features of soil moisture in depth profiles for upslope and downslope areas soil moisture time series 5 points in identical depth were averaged for the upslope and downslope respectively and used for wavelet coherence analysis significant wavelet coherences between time series can be effectively delineated by using a confidence interval of 99 for the average wavelet coherence wavelet coherence between background noise from the ar 1 process red noise was compared to wavelet coherence between time series to determine the significant wavelet coherence grinsted et al 2004 the relationships between significant wavelet coherences and time scales were useful for identifying the effective time scales of particular hydrological components e g rainfall evapotranspiration infiltration and lateral flow in soil moisture responses figs 3 5 fig 3 presents significant wavelet coherences 99 confidence interval between eco hydrometeorologic time series and average soil moistures of different locations different depths and identical depths between upslope and downslope as shown in fig 3 significant coherences to rainfall were found for time scales of less than 4 h and those for evapotranspiration were identified for time scales of around 12 and 24 h the abrupt increase in soil moisture was mainly associated with the impact of rainwater input relatively slow recession in soil moisture can be explained by evapotranspiration on daily or half a day time scales the significant coherence range of a day period in the relationship with evapotranspiration was the same as that in previously reported studies ding et al 2013 two more significant coherences with rainfall amounts were found in the study period one was between 1 week and 1 month and other was after 2 months the appearance of significant coherence between soil moisture and rainfall on a time scale of 2000 h can be explained by the seasonal behavior of rainfall generation and its impact on soil moisture liu et al 2017 also showed two parts of significant coherence such as weekly to monthly periodicities and a 12 month periodicity 3 3 significant soil moisture coherence between measuring points the degree of wetness similarity between identical depths of different locations can be useful for understanding the impact of hydrological controls in several depths and that of different processes such as infiltration exfiltration and lateral flow in the spatial context fig 4 a and b present significant wavelet coherences 99 confidence level between soil moistures of identical depth for all measuring points on upslope and downslope areas scales of significant coherences were distributed between 4 0 and 10 h and appeared again near 24 h wavelet coherences between soil moistures were decreased between 4 0 and 4 5 h and then increased up to 10 h as illustrated in fig 3 the coherence between rainfall and soil moisture disappeared at about a scale of 4 h the changing points of slopes from negative to positive coherence fig 4 a and b can be explained by the time scale of process switching from infiltration to exfiltration two notable differences were found between fig 4 a and b one was that the significant coherences of less than 4 h appeared only at a 10 cm depth for upslope areas fig 4 a but those for downslope areas appeared at all depth relationships fig 4 b this can be explained by the fact that rainfall from vertical infiltration is responsible for the coherences on time scales less than 4 h at a 10 cm depth for upslope areas but those for downslope areas cannot be completely explained by the infiltration higher antecedent soil moistures for downslope areas fig 2 were responsible for more active soil moisture coherence between identical depths the other point was that while the significant coherences appeared around the scale of 12 h in upslope areas those for downslope areas did not show any notable coherence at the half day scale this may indicate that the impact of evapotranspiration for downslope areas is less apparent than that of upslope areas the development of vertical flow is responsible for significant wavelet coherences between different depths for an identical location the significant wavelet coherence between soil moistures along vertical profiles in identical locations can be explained by the development of the vertical flow fig 5 a and b show the development of soil moisture relationships along various depth profiles 10 cm 30 cm 10 cm 60 cm and 30 cm 60 cm for upslope and downslope areas respectively while the coherences less than a scale of 5 h existed for upslope areas fig 5 a those for downslope areas appeared only from the greater scale of 5 h fig 5 b the decreasing part of significant coherence existed only in upslope areas thus indicating apparent vertical infiltration by rain water however no coherence for the time scale of less than 5 h in downslope areas strongly indicated that the hydrological process during the rainfall event could not be explained by the vertical infiltration but lateral flow as illustrated from fig 4 b similar to fig 4 a and 4 b stronger coherences at the time scale of 12 h appeared in upslope areas than those for downslope areas fig 5 a and b which can be viewed as another demonstration of the different impacts of evapotranspiration between upslope and downslope areas 3 4 soil moisture wavelet coherence between identical soil depths and soil profiles the degree of wetness similarity between identical depths of different locations can be useful in understanding the impact of lateral flow in different seasons fig 6 a c present two dimensional significant coherence spaces of time and scale for two adjacent points up1 and up2 in the upslope area at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm the higher wavelet coherence is indicative of a more significant relationship between time series the area inside of black contours in fig 6 indicates statistical significance at the 1 level and white angles represent the phase difference between time series the coherence tended to decrease at deeper depths for the spring season but the opposite trend was observed for the autumn season fig 6 a c relationships between adjacent points identical depth in the upslope area all showed similar features as shown in fig 6 a c seasonal differences in the two dimensional space of coherence were even more apparent at the 60 cm depth as shown in fig 6 a c significant coherence was found at a depth of 60 cm and it was a longer period ranging from 2 to 512 than that for the other depths during the autumn season while the scales of meaningful coherence were between 16 and 256 periods in spring those for autumn were between the 2 and 512 periods fig 6 c this can be explained by the fact that the rate of infiltration during the autumn season was higher than that of spring the coherence between two points do1 and do2 in the downslope area showed features that were different than those in the upslope area fig 6 d f more significant wavelet coherence in the high frequency below the 126 period in the downslope area than that of the upslope area indicated that the soil response pattern in the downslope area could not be completely explained by the vertical flow the distinct seasonal pattern between spring and autumn in the upslope area was not apparent in the downslope coherence response at deeper depths the coherence at short periods tended to be weaker at both upslope and downslope areas but vice versa for long periods of both upslope and downslope areas this can be explained by the fact that soil moisture at shallow depths is more sensitive to precipitation and evapotranspiration loss but that at deeper depths is buffered by shallow soil and is not susceptible to climate factors liu et al 2017 the two dimensional coherence between soil moistures of different depths in an identical location indicates the degree of vertical flow development and its time and scale distribution while significant coherence appeared in the soil moisture relationship between 10 and 30 cm of the up2 point compared to the other combinations during the spring season wavelet coherence ranges for the three depth relationships 10 and 30 cm 30 and 60 cm 10 and 60 cm were similar to each other during the autumn season as shown in fig 7 a c while the scale of significant coherence during the autumn season was between 8 and 512 h in all combinations that for spring was for the period 16 and 256 with occasional discontinuity fig 7 a c the significant wavelet coherence of soil moisture between 30 and 60 cm was strongest for the rainy season in the period range from 128 to 512 fig 7 a c significant wavelet coherences of soil moisture profiles for the downslope area do2 were substantially greater than those for the upslope area up2 in terms of abundance in the high frequency distribution pattern for all relationships fig 7 d f the significant wavelet coherences between the 10 and 60 cm depth for location do2 were more widely spatially distributed than those of other pairs such as at 10 and 30 cm and 30 and 60 cm in the downslope area which was completely distinct from the findings in the upslope area fig 7 d f the development of bypass flow between two depths was found to be responsible for the more spatially significant wavelet coherences between 10 and 60 cm than those for other depths this trend appeared stronger during the rainy season than the trends in the other two dry seasons the abundance in macropore development in downslope areas was visually confirmed as well as with field tests of macropores gwak and kim 2013 3 5 phase difference analysis the phase differences between two time series were displayed as arrows in two dimensional coherence expressions and we used waveletcomp in r for comprehensively evaluating the phase difference in angles roesch and schmidbauer 2014 this application is available from the url http hs stat com waveletcomp the difference in phase can be converted to an angle that indicates which time series was leading in the relationship for a designated period the phase differences of five measuring points in upslope and downslope areas were averaged as shown in fig 8 considering the range of phase difference among soil moisture time series as between 3 8 π and 3 8 π the phase difference can be explained as the phase lagging or phase leading at specific periods the phase differences in the significant wavelet coherences between different depths for an identical location were classified into two parts one ranged between 3 8 π and 0 for deeper depths and the other ranged between 0 and 3 8 π for shallower depths at a specific period all values of phase difference were statistically significant with red noise and the outside of the coi p value 0 01 the significant phase differences p value 0 01 of soil moistures between shallow depths and deeper depths were evaluated for all datasets i e those for upslope and downslope areas in order to clarify the relationships between specific depths of soil moisture we evaluated phase angle distributions for three depths in the upslope and downslope areas as presented in fig 8 a and b the distribution of phase angles between the upslope and downslope areas was different the leading shallower depth was pronounced for all relationships in the upslope dataset in the range of a week and it substantially decreased in the range of a month fig 8 a the deeper depth leading pattern was dominant over the range of a month fig 8 b the relationship between 30 and 60 cm showed a distinct leading deeper depth for the time scale greater than one month the relationships both between 10 cm and 60 cm and 10 cm and 30 cm showed the deeper leading pattern after the period of a month in other words the short period range showed a shallower depth leading pattern and the long period range showed a deeper depth leading pattern the range of the shallower depth leading pattern by the period of a week at the downslope area was not apparent unlike that of the upslope area fig 8 b the relationship between 10 cm and 30 cm indicated that the dominant 10 cm leading pattern in all ranges of the period and deeper depth leading pattern was apparent for time scales greater than a week for the relationship between 30 cm and 60 cm fig 8 b 4 discussion 4 1 phase differences in coherence at longer periods in this study spatio temporal analysis was performed fig 8 to configure the relationship between temporal data and both lagging and correlation characteristics were considered together weigand et al 2017 a similar pattern of phase differences up1030 up1060 up3060 in fig 8 a at the upslope area indicated that the vertical relationships were controlled by similar hydrological processes in all the ranges while the phase difference between 1 day and 1 week were similar to each other those of the downslope were distinct for all three relationships fig 8 b which can be explained by more complicated hydrological processes vertical and lateral flows in the downslope the phase angle difference between the upslope and downslope areas in the short period throughout a day mainly was associated with hydrological processes driven by the eco hydrologic factors such as rainfall and evapotranspiration which can be explained by the vertical flow with a relatively quick response fig 3 the deeper depth leading pattern become dominant after a period of 1 month in the upslope area which can be attributed to the existence of hydrological processes near the bedrock boundary leading in phase differences for 10 cm and 60 cm depths over a 30 cm depth in the downslope area were associated with dominant flow along two boundaries surface and bedrock in downslope areas the lateral flow with a relatively slow response represents a potential explanation for the phase angle distributions at longer time scales the deeper depth leading trend deteriorated substantially after 2 months both in the upslope and downslope areas 4 2 hillslope hydrological processes and scales vertical flow seemed to represent the primary hydrological process in the upslope area while the maximum depth of vertical flow was limited to 30 cm for the spring season that of the autumn season extended to a depth of 60 cm the seasonal difference of water loss due to vegetation activity between spring and autumn was responsible for the seasonal differences in coherence and this phenomenon has been observed before in a monsoon climate ghimire et al 2014 measurements of the lai were between 1 06 and 0 98 in november and between 2 98 and 3 97 in may which indicates that there was a difference in evapotranspiration between the two seasons the estimated ranges for maximum canopy storage were between 0 6 mm day and 0 794 mm day and between 0 196 mm day and 0 212 mm day for may and november respectively this makes the rate of infiltration during the autumn season higher than the rates for other seasons the higher stability in soil moisture during the spring season than that for other seasons also supports the higher coherence in the spring at a depth of 10 cm as shown in fig 6 a stronger coherence in the high frequency range in the downslope area than that in the upslope area figs 6 and 7 was indicative of more complicated hydrological processes downslope the water from rainfall and lateral flow from upslope through the contributing area were responsible for soil moisture variation in the downslope area brocca et al 2007 mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 the impact of seasonally different vegetation on hydrological processes was substantially compensated for by the stationary impact of topography in the downslope area which was confirmed by the seasonally less varied coherence structures figs 6 and 7 a notable flow path pattern in the downslope area was the formation of two lateral boundary flows along the surface and bedrock layers in the rainy season which was reflected by the stronger coherence between 10 and 60 cm than that between other depths as shown in fig 7 e more complicated hydrological flow paths such as lateral flow and return flow in addition to vertical flow in the downslope area compared to that of the upslope area can be responsible for the high frequency distributions of coherence as shown in figs 6 and 7 5 conclusion an intensive field campaign of soil moisture monitoring was performed in the upslope and downslope areas of a steep mountainous hillslope the significant wavelet coherence between soil moisture and eco hydrological factors such as rainfall 4 h and evapotranspiration 10 13 h and 18 26 h for the short periods indicated that two drivers determine the quick soil moisture response the significant wavelet coherences were found only between 10 cm soil depths for the time scale of 4 h in upslope areas and those between soil moisture profiles for scales less than 5 h were not found in downslope areas thus indicating that vertical flow is a primary process for upslope and lateral flow is an important hydrological process in downslope areas the impact of evapotranspiration to soil moisture coherence was different between upslope and downslope areas soil moisture coherences were more similar than those between soil moisture and evapotranspiration in upslope than downslope areas both the soil moisture coherences between identical depths and those of soil profiles indicated that the infiltration rate during the autumn season was higher than that during the spring season significantly high frequencies in coherences during the rainy season in the downslope area were strongly associated with more complicated hydrological processes including preferential flow than those in the upslope area stronger coherence in soil moisture between 10 and 60 cm than the other relationships can be explained by the development of boundary flows along the surface and bedrock layers and the existence of bypass flows during the rainy season the seasonal difference in vegetation activity was responsible for the distinct infiltration rate between spring and autumn relatively less variable coherences downslope than those upslope could be explained by the impact of topography in addition to vegetation in the downslope area the phase difference angles between different depths showed a shallower depth leading pattern for the period of less than 1 month in the upslope area which can be explained by the vertical flow from shallow to deeper depths more complicated flows in the downslope area were responsible for 10 cm and 60 cm leading patterns over 30 cm for the period greater than 1 week a notable deeper depth leading pattern was found in relationships between 60 cm and the other depths for time scales greater than one month in both upslope and downslope areas which can be explained by the fact that lateral flow with a lower velocity is pronounced at deeper depths declaration of

media through synchrotron x ray microtomography μct which suggest μct can yield reliable measurements costanza robinson et al 2011 however rev only was investigated for only a few parameters porosity permeability density moisture saturation and air water interfacial area etc the contaminants transport in porous media or multiphase flow such as dnapl flow in porous media are not usually considered in rev research these investigations indicate that the rev is difficult to determine for complex porous media and inner fluid in other words the complexity of physicochemical factors and aquifer characteristics make characterizing and determining the dnapls migration and state especially difficult while accurate description the dnapls distribution and its rev scale in aquifer is extremely important the objective of this study is to investigate the influences of permeability and ionic strength of water on the rev of perchloroethylene pce four experiments were designed and conducted to study pce migration in two dimensional 2d under different conditions the permeability and ionic strength of four experiments were varied translucent silica sand can be packed in sandbox to create homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media which similar to natural media of aquifer where the experiments of pce migration in sandbox is essential to understand contamination appeared in natural aquifers the pce content was measured through light transmission visualization ltv niemet and selker 2001 weisbrod et al 2003 bob et al 2008 during the entire experimental period afterward the revs of pce are estimated by a criterion the relative gradient error ε g i costanza robinson et al 2011 to analyze the changes of revs all the time results of four experiments are compared with analyze the effect of permeability and ionic strength on revs of pce during the long term experimental process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedure four experiments are designed to investigate pce migration in 2d sandbox under different conditions of permeability and ionic strength the sandboxes of experiments i and ii with the dimensions of 60 cm 45 cm and thickness of 1 4 cm which are packed by f20 30 mesh translucent silica sand fig 1a the dimensions of sandboxes used in experiments iii and iv are 20 cm 15 cm with thickness of 1 4 cm and inner porous media is f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand fig 1b before the experiment all sandboxes are saturated by deionized water and then flushed by sodium chloride nacl solutions to facilitate observation of pce behaviors and revs of pce affected by ionic strength difference two nacl solutions are used in experiments the concentrations of nacl in sandboxes of experiment i and experiment iii are 0 585 g l which corresponding to groundwater with low ionic strength 10 000 mm simultaneously the concentrations of nacl in sandboxes of experiment ii and experiment iv are 32 g l which corresponding to groundwater with high ionic strength 547 009 mm afterward 32 ml pce are injected into sandboxes from the middle needle at the top of sandbox fig 2 during t 0 64 min for experiment i and ii 9 ml pce are injected into sandboxes during 0 18 min for experiment iii and iv at the same injection rate of 0 5 ml min after pce entering into the sandboxes the experiments are continued about 24 h that pce infiltrates and migrates in sandboxes freely the permeability of f20 30 and f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand are 1 35 10 10 m2 and 4 25 10 11 m2 table 1 respectively what s more the density of pce nacl solution 10 000 mm and nacl solution 547 009 mm are 1 623 g ml 0 999 g ml and 1 02 g ml besides the viscosity of pce nacl solution 10 000 mm and nacl solution 547 009 mm are 0 90 10 3 pa s 0 955 10 3 pa s and 1 09 10 3 pa s 2 2 analytical methods a light source was placed in front of the sandboxes and the emergent light information was collected on the opposite side by means of a thermoelectrically air cooled charged coupled device ccd camera during the entire experiment light transmission visualization ltv niemet and selker 2001 weisbrod et al 2003 bob et al 2008 and light transmission micro tomography ltm wu et al 2017 are conducted to measure the pce saturation in every pixel and the porosity of every pixel of porous media packed in sandboxes were based on the emergent light intensity captured by ccd camera fig 1c bob et al 2008 achieved an rmse value of 0 56 ml for quantification of pce mass in 2d sandbox by ltv method simultaneously relative error of the quantification of translucent silica sand using

media i is the light intensity captured by ccd camera when pce is injected into the sandbox i s is the light intensity when sandbox is saturated by deionized water ioil is the light intensity when sandbox is saturated by pce γ and β are two parameters in ltm method obtained from experiment φ and η are the parameters obtained from the fractal method wu et al 2017 the pce water interfacial area aow is approximated by the surface area of pce phase in porous media and normalized using unit cm 1 wu et al 2017 the architecture of pce plume in 2d sandbox is quantified by a criteria of ganglia to pool ratio gtp which is defined as the ratio of the pce volume of ganglia state to the pce volume of pools accumulated in 2d porous media christ et al 2006 4 gtp v ganglia v pool where v ganglia is the volume of pce under ganglia state v pool is the volume of pce in pools accumulated in 2d sandbox after obtaining the dnapls content in 2d translucent porous media revs of dnapls can be estimated which is very important and can be used to represent effective properties of dnapls brown and hsieh 2000 al raoush and willson 2005 al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 costanza robinson et al 2011 wu et al 2017 the change of the properties of material or fluid can be represented by fig 1d the rev is determined through the criteria of the relative gradient error ε g i costanza robinson et al 2011 5 ε g i α i 1 α i 1 α i 1 α i 1 1 δ l where α is the property of material or fluid δl is the length increment unit is mm when measuring the property of material or fluid generally if ε g i is less than 0 2 costanza robinson et al 2011 the measured size has reached the rev scale spatial moments are important index which used to characterize the contaminant plume distribution and the spatial behavior of contaminant the definition of spatial moment m ij is natarajan and kumar 2018 6 m ij x 0 x 1 z 0 z 1 θ x z s o x z t x i z j d x d z where i and j are the orders of moments θ x z is the porosity at coordinates x z so x z t is pce saturation at time t x 0 and x 1 are the minimum and maximum limits along horizontal axis z 0 and z 1 are the minimum and maximum limits along vertical axis the first order moments and the second order moments are defined as follows lemke et al 2004 natarajan and kumar 2018 7 σ x m 10 m 00 8 σ z m 01 m 00 9 σ xx m 20 m 00 σ x 2 10 σ zz m 02 m 00 σ z 2 where σ x and σ z are the first order moments of contaminant plume along x and z directions σ xx and σ zz are the second order moments of contaminant plume along x and z directions 3 results and discussion 3 1 pce migration in different conditions using the ltm method the porosity of the 2d translucent porous media is quantified afterward the emergent light intensity of four experiments is captured when pce migrates in sandboxes the pce saturation in the 2d translucent silica sand is calculated by the help of ltv method the infiltration and redistribution of pce in the 2d sandboxes during 0 1523 min is shown in fig 3 associated analysis results of pce plume are presented in fig 4 a h in the case of experiment i fig 3 under the conditions of low ionic strength 10 000 mm and permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 pce infiltrates downward to the bottom of sandboxes and forms the pool when pce accumulates at the bottom of the sandbox the pce also migrates horizontally along the lateral water flow to the left side in experiment ii 547 009 mm while the horizontal migration of pce plume is not obvious in experiment i experiments iii and iv are conducted in sandboxes packed by f40 50 mesh silica sand with permeability of 4 25 10 11 m2 as a result pce infiltration rate of experiment i is larger than that of experiment iii fig 4h due to larger permeability of f20 30 mesh translucent silica simultaneously pce infiltration rate of experiment ii is larger than that of experiment iv caused by permeability meanwhile when the ionic strength of inner water increases to 547 009 mm pce infiltrates at a faster vertical speed and the pce plume touches the bottom using less time fig 4g pce infiltration speed is enhanced as ionic strength increases when pce plumes reach the bottom of sandbox experiments i iv spend 30 min 25 min 36 min and 34 min respectively fig 4h pce migrates in experiment iii with large plume and slow vertical infiltration speed however in groundwater at condition of high ionic strength 547 009 mm for experiment iv pce plume is smaller and vertically infiltrates faster the angle of the inclination of infiltration paths are 1 92 3 97 2 35 and 5 36 for experiments i iv respectively indicating the ionic strength of groundwater and permeability of porous media can affect the pce migration and distribution characteristics in aquifer the pce distribution and source zone architecture of four experiments are evaluated by moment analysis natarajan and kumar 2018 which results are shown in fig 4a f the center of pce plume in horizontal direction σ x of experiment i is bigger than experiment ii while σ x of experiments iii and iv have not obvious difference fig 4a the depth of pce plume center of experiment ii is bigger than experiment i over the entire experiment period fig 4b moreover the second moments of pce plume of four experiments all first increased rapidly over time fig 4c and d afterward the second moments tend to steady state during the following redistribution period from the results of moment analysis the second moments of experiments with higher ionic strength are bigger than the second moments of experiments with low ionic strength in addition increasing ionic strength can lower the pce plume area fig 4e and increase the gtp of pce mass fig 4f moreover the higher permeability also increases the gtp of pce plume that gtp of experiments i and ii are much bigger than the gtp of experiments iii and iv 3 2 the influence of permeability and ionic strength on pce revs the whole translucent silica sand packed in 2d boxes of four experiments is discretized into grid with dimensions of 0 015 m 0 015 m for every experiment five observation cells of the grid are selected to observe the pce properties varying with measured scale when pce plume tends to steady state at t 1523 min fig 3 that moments plume area and gtp will not change anymore fig 4a h the measured range is increased from the center of each cell and corresponding pce saturation is calculated according to pce saturation derived using ltv method niemet and selker 2001 weisbrod et al 2003 bob et al 2008 the variation curves of pce saturation of these observation cells from four experiments as a function of measured size are shown in fig 5 erratic fluctuations of pce saturation are observed at small measured size while fluctuations are minimized as measured size increases however the rev steady plateaus are not easy to be judged from the direct pce saturation curves so the relative gradient error of pce saturation is computed to quantify the rev scale of pce saturation the pce water interfacial area as a function of measured size also are derived based on light techniques for achieving high resolution for pce saturation and porosity wu et al 2017 fig 6 for all a ow curves of observation cells from four experiments their characteristic is very different from the s o curves shown in fig 5 there are many minor fluctuations when a ow changed as the measured scale however the rev scale of pce water interfacial area is also very hard to be quantified according to a ow curves on the contrary the relative gradient error ε g i of pce water interfacial area is computed which can be used to estimate the scaling effect of pce water interfacial area fig 6 when ε g i decreases the fluctuations appeared in a ow curves are also minimized the values of measured size have not obvious effect on the a ow values of the measured system the a ow values tend to steady state and this measured size has reached the rev scale using ε g i the revs of pce in four experiments are quantified to investigate the characteristic of rev when permeability and ionic strength are different the frequency and cumulative frequency of minimum rev sizes of pce saturation and pce water interfacial area of four experiments during the entire experiment periods are counted in figs 7 and 8 the rev sizes are divided by 15 classes in 0 15 mm to illustrate the rev sizes distribution for four experiments the frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation all are irregular at t 5 min during the first stage of experiment theoretical gaussian distributions are added in figs 7 and 8 to fit the frequency and cumulative frequency achieved from experiments in fig 7 as pce plumes in sandboxes expanding the frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation tends to gaussian distribution nevertheless four experiments are conducted under different conditions and corresponding frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation also show different characteristics for experiments i and ii with same permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 the shapes of frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation are very similar when ionic strength are different however the ionic strength has effect on the experiments iii and iv with lower permeability of 4 25 10 11 m2 the frequency of rev of pce saturation of experiment iii at t 1523 min tends to regular gaussian distribution in 0 0 mm 9 0 mm with mean value of so rev of 3 94 mm under condition of low ionic strength of 10 000 mm simultaneously the shape of frequency of rev of pce saturation of experiment iv at t 1523 min tend to irregular gaussian distribution in 0 0 mm 10 0 mm with mean value of so rev of 3 67 mm under condition of high ionic strength of 547 009 mm when the conditions of ionic strength are same the differences between f20 30 mesh translucent silica sand 1 35 10 10 m2 and f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand with 4 25 10 11 m2 are very remarkable the frequency of rev of pce saturation of experiment i with permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 and low ionic strength of 10 000 mm is close to theoretical gaussian distribution in 0 0 mm 15 0 mm with mean value of so rev size of 6 19 mm at t 1523 min when the permeability is lower the frequency of rev of pce saturation becomes narrower with distribution under conditions of high ionic strength 547 009 mm the same phenomenon is also observed between experiments ii and iv which suggests higher permeability of media can make the frequency of rev of pce saturation become wider and lower permeability can lead to narrow distribution of frequency of rev of pce saturation the frequencies of rev of pce water interfacial area of four experiments are illustrated in fig 8 the frequency of minimum aow rev size also changes from gaussian distribution with large mean value at the first stage of experiment to gaussian distribution with small mean value at the end of experiment only the a ow revs of experiments iii and iv follow bimodal distributions fig 8 as a matter of fact both s o revs of all experiments and a ow revs of experiments i and ii do not fit bimodal distribution implying that the bimodal distribution of a ow revs is the characteristic of pce migration in f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand for experiments i and iii with same lower ionic strength the permeability has great effect on the frequency of pce water interfacial area the frequency of minimum aow rev size of the experiment i with higher permeability shows gaussian distribution with low value of standard deviation and the frequency of minimum aow rev size of experiment iii with lower permeability tends to fitted gaussian distribution with high value of standard deviation under condition of higher ionic strength the permeability also has the similar effect on the frequency of rev of pce water interfacial area from the results of experiments ii and iv fig 8 in addition under the same condition of higher permeability experiments i and ii higher ionic strength makes the fitted gaussian distribution have big mean value and low standard deviation however when the permeability is lower experiments iii and iv increasing ionic strength can increase the standard deviation while ionic strength has no apparent effect on the mean value the mean value and standard deviation of so rev and aow rev sizes based on fitted theoretical gaussian distribution are shown in fig 9 a d the mean values of so rev for experiments i ii iii and iv are 5 74 mm 5 58 mm 4 39 mm and 2 87 mm respectively the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments i and ii are bigger than the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments iii and iv fig 9a with absolute errors of 1 35 mm and 2 71 mm implying higher permeability can increase mean value of so rev sizes greatly simultaneously the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments i and ii show slight increasing tendency as time goes on while the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments iii and iv show decreasing tendency fig 9a the mean values of a ow rev for experiments i ii iii and iv are 5 95 mm 7 44 mm 8 71 mm and 8 53 mm respectively indicating that higher permeability can reduce the mean value of aow rev sizes fig 9c moreover the permeability also has effect on the standard deviation of so rev and aow rev sizes fig 9b and d higher permeability has increased the standard deviation of so rev sizes fig 9b and decreased the standard deviation of aow rev sizes fig 9d ionic strength has no apparent influence on the mean value of so rev sizes absolute error is 0 16 mm under the condition of high permeability experiments i and ii while higher ionic strength has reduced the mean value of so rev sizes of experiment iv compared with experiment iii under condition of low permeability absolute error is 1 52 mm fig 9a for the mean of aow rev sizes ionic strength has different effect under conditions of high permeability and low permeability when permeability is high high ionic strength increased the mean of aow rev sizes of experiment ii compared with experiment i absolute error is 1 49 mm fig 9c however high ionic strength reduced the mean of aow rev sizes of experiment iv fig 9c significantly high ionic strength has reduced the standard deviation of so rev sizes fig 9b and increased the standard deviation of aow rev sizes fig 9d the standard deviation of so rev sizes of experiments i and iii are bigger than the standard deviation of experiments ii and iv fig 9b while the standard deviation of aow rev sizes of experiments i and iii are relatively lower fig 9d this study focuses on the rev of pce saturation and pce water interfacial areas at lab scale under different conditions of permeability and ionic strength the porous media used in experiments is translucent silica sand to simulate natural granular aquifer which contains rich groundwater resource and is rather susceptible to contamination the research results would be applicable in 2d saturated granular aquifer under similar conditions while the results at laboratory scale cannot be directly applicable at the aquifer scale caused by ubiquitous heterogeneity and anisotropy when consider real world application the upscaling problem must be considered simultaneously many previous studies are very important and interesting due to their research at real aquifer scale dagan et al 2013 bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the real world application related to the upscaling problem is beyond this research which will be explored in further study 4 conclusions the impact of ionic strength and permeability on the revs of dnapls properties is investigated in this research four experiments with different conditions of permeability and ionic strength were tested in 2d sandboxes the concentrations of nacl for experiments i and iii are 0 585 g l which can be treated as lower ionic strength 10 000 mm the concentrations of nacl for experiments ii and iv are 32 g l as higher ionic strength 547 009 mm f20 30 mesh translucent silica sand with higher permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 are used for experiments i and ii simultaneously f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand with lower permeability of 4 25 10 11 m2 are used for experiments iii and iv results indicate permeability and ionic strength have influences on moments of pce plume and pce distribution state higher ionic strength makes the pce plume vertically infiltrates in 2d porous media with higher velocity from the infiltration distance and vertical infiltration speed of pce plume fig 4g and h moreover the angle of the inclination of infiltration paths observed experiments i iv are 1 92 3 97 2 35 and 5 36 more importantly permeability and ionic strength have important influences on the revs of pce saturation and pce water interfacial area higher permeability makes the frequency of rev of pce saturation become wider and lower permeability makes the frequency narrow what s more ionic strength can change the shape of frequency of revs of pce saturation and pce water interfacial area from rev estimation rising permeability leads to larger average rev scales of pce saturation and smaller rev scales of pce water interfacial area furthermore ionic strength has decreased the mean value of so rev sizes under condition of low permeability while ionic strength has not obvious effect on so rev sizes when permeability is high however higher ionic strength increased the mean of aow rev sizes under condition of high permeability and decreased the rev of pce water interfacial area when permeability is low moreover both permeability and ionic strength also apparently affect the standard deviation of so rev and aow rev sizes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research is jointly

6333,dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls have led to widely distributed groundwater contamination due to their widespread applications and accidental spills to investigate influences of two factor ionic strength and permeability on the representative elementary volume rev of dnapl four experiments are conducted in two dimensional 2d porous media to investigate perchloroethylene pce migration and associated revs the permeability and ionic strength of four experiments are set as different schemes pce migration and revs are estimated by moment analysis and the criteria of the relative gradient error ε g i results suggest that the permeability and ionic strength are of significant effects on revs of pce higher permeability of porous media can promote the vertical infiltrate rate of pce in aquifer simultaneously higher ionic strength can lower the second moments of pce plume and increase the gtp of pce mass more importantly higher permeability has increased the rev of pce saturation so with absolute errors of 1 35 mm and 2 71 mm under conditions of low and high ionic strength besides higher permeability has decreased the rev of pce water interfacial area aow with absolute errors of 2 76 mm and 1 09 mm under conditions of low and high ionic strength what s more ionic strength has no apparent effects on so rev sizes when permeability is high absolute error equals to 0 16 mm between low and high ionic strength however high ionic strength can decrease the minimum rev sizes of so when permeability is low absolute error is 1 52 mm moreover high ionic strength can increase minimum rev sizes of a ow with absolute errors of 1 49 mm and 1 01 mm under conditions of high and low permeability these findings can improve the understanding of dnapls

organic compounds in petrochemical industry petrochemical products have performed important function on our daily life and economy gerhard et al 2007 ench 2011 baldwin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 maire et al 2018 especially dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls are worldwide contaminants which detected in soil groundwater systems threatening ecosystem environment and public health qiu 2011 di lorenzo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 weathers et al 2016 when dnapls are released accidently they will infiltrate the unsaturated zone and enter into saturated zone at last dnapls usually exist in aquifer as residual ganglia or pool state illangasekare et al 1995 which forms a persistent dissolved contaminant source and lead to long term pollution and persistent risk to groundwater resources

chemistry conditions including ionic strength due to natural and human impacts such as seawater intrusion may greatly affect the migration and distribution of dnapls in aquifer shi et al 2018 as a matter of fact modeling contaminants such as dnapl transport in aquifers is based on a continuum model where porous media exist a representative elementary volume rev wang et al 2016 to make the porous media be treated as a continuum media brown and hsieh 2000 müller and siegesmund 2010 teruel and rizwan uddin 2010 hendrick et al 2012 ukrainczyk and koenders 2014 in fact quantifying this micro scale characteristic rev is fundamental to improve our understanding of water flow dnapl transport and other processes al raoush 2012 brown and hsieh 2000 costanza robinson et al 2011 wu et al 2017 platinum nanoparticle catalyzed hydrogenation reactions presented strong size effect which may imply size effect widely exists in many other metals and reactions bai et al 2016 esfandiar et al 2017 found size effect exists in ion transport through angstrom scale slits which is essential to many process such as the angstrom size ion channels in cellular membranes and to suggest the size effect even existing in cell activity for dnapl migration in groundwater migration behavior and revs of dnapl is possibly influenced by the change of chemical conditions the migration and distribution of dnapls are influenced by many factors bradford et al 1999 hsu and demond 2007 molnar et al 2011 ryder and demond 2008 the gravitational force can affect dnapls migration due to the larger density of dnapls totten et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 the characteristics of aquifer such as permeability also has important effect on contaminants transport in porous media wang and huang 2011 gholizadeh ansari 2017 moreover the viscous and capillary forces interfacial tension and dnapls chemical characteristics also are important factors affecting dnapls migration in groundwater koch and nowak 2015 molnar et al 2011 suchomel et al 2007 totten et al 2007 groundwater chemistry geological structure and the wettability of porous media are the factors related to media properties the wettability and interfacial tension are recognized as important roles which governing the migration and fate of dnapls in groundwater ramsburg and pennell 2002 o carroll et al 2004 totten et al 2007 molnar et al 2011 in addition the scale of material and fluid is an important parameter to derive effective properties brown and hsieh 2000 costanza robinson et al 2011 singh 2017 the volume of the transition from the microscopic to macroscopic scale is referred as rev which is important for the behavior of effective parameters of complex heterogeneous media system al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 the rev definition is the range of scales or volumes for which averaged parameters are single valued functions of that spatial location and time while the sizes of revs of different properties may have different values brwon and hsieh 2000 classical change of properties of material or fluid is represented in fig 1 d in which the classical curve can be generally divided into three regions region i represent the property at small scale is affected by micro structure when measured size increases or bigger than minimum rev size lmin the measured value of property will tend to be steady and a relative flat plateau will be appeared region ii when measured size is larger than maximum rev size lmax the measured values of property become drastic which is affected by macroscopic heterogeneity fig 1d several investigations have tried to determine the rev using x ray γ ray and other techniques al raoush 2012 brown and hsieh 2000 costanza robinson et al 2011 manda and gross 2015 wu et al 2018 utilizing γ ray tomography brown and hsieh 2000 found density and macropore index of four dolomite cores show the characteristic of rev definition the rev of permeability of heterolithic sandstone was identified when using realistic 3d numerical lithofacies models nordahl and ringrose 2008 the rev estimation for porosity moisture saturation and air water interfacial area were conducted in unsaturated porous media through synchrotron x ray microtomography μct which suggest μct can yield reliable measurements costanza robinson et al 2011 however rev only was investigated for only a few parameters porosity permeability density moisture saturation and air water interfacial area etc the contaminants transport in porous media or multiphase flow such as dnapl flow in porous media are not usually considered in rev research these investigations indicate that the rev is difficult to determine for complex porous media and inner fluid in other words the complexity of physicochemical factors and aquifer characteristics make characterizing and determining the dnapls migration and state especially difficult while accurate description the dnapls distribution and its rev scale in aquifer is extremely important the objective of this study is to investigate the influences of permeability and ionic strength of water on the rev of perchloroethylene pce four experiments were designed and conducted to study pce migration in two dimensional 2d under different conditions the permeability and ionic strength of four experiments were varied translucent silica sand can be packed in sandbox to create homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media which similar to natural media of aquifer where the experiments of pce migration in sandbox is essential to understand contamination appeared in natural aquifers the pce content was measured through light transmission visualization ltv niemet and selker 2001 weisbrod et al 2003 bob et al 2008 during the entire experimental period afterward the revs of

during 0 18 min for experiment iii and iv at the same injection rate of 0 5 ml min after pce entering into the sandboxes the experiments are continued about 24 h that pce infiltrates and migrates in

migration in different conditions using the ltm method the porosity of the 2d translucent porous media is quantified afterward the emergent light intensity of four experiments is captured when pce migrates in sandboxes the pce saturation in the 2d translucent silica sand is calculated by the help of ltv method the infiltration and redistribution of pce in the 2d sandboxes during 0 1523 min is shown in fig 3 associated analysis results of pce plume are presented in fig 4 a h in the case of experiment i fig 3 under the conditions of low ionic strength 10 000 mm and permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 pce infiltrates downward to the bottom of sandboxes and forms the pool when pce accumulates at the bottom of the sandbox the pce also migrates horizontally along the lateral water flow to the left side in experiment ii 547 009 mm while the horizontal migration of pce plume is not obvious in experiment i experiments iii and iv are conducted in sandboxes packed by f40 50 mesh silica sand with permeability of 4 25 10 11 m2 as a result pce infiltration rate of experiment i is larger than that of experiment iii fig 4h due to larger permeability of f20 30 mesh translucent silica simultaneously pce infiltration rate of experiment ii is larger than that of experiment iv caused by permeability meanwhile when the ionic strength of inner water increases to 547 009 mm pce infiltrates at a faster vertical speed and the pce plume touches the bottom using less time fig 4g pce infiltration speed is enhanced as ionic strength increases when pce plumes reach the bottom of sandbox experiments i iv spend 30 min 25 min 36 min and 34 min respectively fig 4h pce migrates in experiment iii with large plume and slow vertical infiltration speed however in groundwater at condition of high ionic strength 547 009 mm for experiment iv pce plume is smaller and vertically infiltrates faster the angle of the inclination of infiltration paths are 1 92 3 97 2 35 and 5 36 for experiments i iv respectively indicating the ionic strength of groundwater and permeability of porous media can affect the pce migration and distribution characteristics in aquifer the pce distribution and source zone architecture of four experiments are evaluated by moment analysis natarajan and kumar 2018 which results are shown in fig 4a f the center of pce plume in horizontal direction σ x of experiment i is bigger than experiment ii while σ x of experiments iii and iv have not obvious difference fig 4a the depth of pce plume center of experiment ii is bigger than experiment i over the entire experiment period fig 4b moreover the second moments of pce plume of four experiments all first increased rapidly over time fig 4c and d afterward the second moments tend to steady state during the following redistribution period from the results of moment analysis the second moments of experiments with higher ionic strength are bigger than the second moments of experiments with low ionic strength in addition increasing ionic strength can lower the pce plume area fig 4e and increase the gtp of pce mass fig 4f moreover the higher permeability also increases the gtp of pce plume that gtp of experiments i and ii are much bigger than the gtp of experiments iii and iv 3 2 the influence of permeability and ionic strength on pce revs the whole translucent silica sand packed in 2d boxes of four experiments is discretized into grid with dimensions of 0 015 m 0 015 m for every experiment five observation cells of the grid are selected to observe the pce properties varying with measured scale when pce plume tends to steady state at t 1523 min fig 3 that moments plume area and gtp will not change anymore fig 4a h the measured range is increased from the center of each cell and corresponding pce saturation is calculated according to pce saturation derived using ltv method niemet and selker 2001 weisbrod et al 2003 bob et al 2008 the variation curves of pce saturation of these observation cells from four experiments as a function of measured size are shown in fig 5 erratic fluctuations of pce saturation are observed at small measured size while fluctuations are minimized as measured size increases however the rev steady plateaus are not easy to be judged from the direct pce saturation curves so the relative gradient error of pce saturation is computed to quantify the rev scale of pce saturation the pce water interfacial area as a function of measured size also are derived based on light techniques for achieving high resolution for pce saturation and porosity wu et al 2017 fig 6 for all a ow curves of observation cells from four experiments their characteristic is very different from the s o curves shown in fig 5 there are many minor fluctuations when a ow changed as the measured scale however the rev scale of pce water interfacial area is also very hard to be quantified according to a ow curves on the contrary the relative gradient error ε g i of pce water interfacial area is computed which can be used to estimate the scaling effect of pce water interfacial area fig 6 when ε g i decreases the fluctuations appeared in a ow curves are also minimized the values of measured size have not obvious effect on the a ow values of the measured system the a ow values tend to steady state and this measured size has reached the rev scale using ε g i the revs of pce in four experiments are quantified to investigate the characteristic of rev when permeability and ionic strength are different the frequency and cumulative frequency of minimum rev sizes of pce saturation and pce water interfacial area of four experiments during the entire experiment periods are counted in figs 7 and 8 the rev sizes are divided by 15 classes in 0 15 mm to illustrate the rev sizes distribution for four experiments the frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation all are irregular at t 5 min during the first stage of experiment theoretical gaussian distributions are added in figs 7 and 8 to fit the frequency and cumulative frequency achieved from experiments in fig 7 as pce plumes in sandboxes expanding the frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation tends to gaussian distribution nevertheless four experiments are conducted under different conditions and corresponding frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation also show different characteristics for experiments i and ii with same permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 the shapes of frequency of minimum rev of pce saturation are very similar when ionic strength are different however the ionic strength has effect on the experiments iii and iv with lower permeability of 4 25 10 11 m2 the frequency of rev of pce saturation of experiment iii at t 1523 min tends to regular gaussian distribution in 0 0 mm 9 0 mm with mean value of so rev of 3 94 mm under condition of low ionic strength of 10 000 mm simultaneously the shape of frequency of rev of pce saturation of experiment iv at t 1523 min tend to irregular gaussian distribution in 0 0 mm 10 0 mm with mean value of so rev of 3 67 mm under condition of high ionic strength of 547 009 mm when the conditions of ionic strength are same the differences between f20 30 mesh translucent silica sand 1 35 10 10 m2 and f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand with 4 25 10 11 m2 are very remarkable the frequency of rev of pce saturation of experiment i with permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 and low ionic strength of 10 000 mm is close to theoretical gaussian distribution in 0 0 mm 15 0 mm with mean value of so rev size of 6 19 mm at t 1523 min when the permeability is lower the frequency of rev of pce saturation becomes narrower with distribution under conditions of high ionic strength 547 009 mm the same phenomenon is also observed between experiments ii and iv which suggests higher permeability of media can make the frequency of rev of pce saturation become wider and lower permeability can lead to narrow distribution of frequency of rev of pce saturation the frequencies of rev of pce water interfacial area of four experiments are illustrated in fig 8 the frequency of minimum aow rev size also changes from gaussian distribution with large mean value at the first stage of experiment to gaussian distribution with small mean value at the end of experiment only the a ow revs of experiments iii and iv follow bimodal distributions fig 8 as a matter of fact both s o revs of all experiments and a ow revs of experiments i and ii do not fit bimodal distribution implying that the bimodal distribution of a ow revs is the characteristic of pce migration in f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand for experiments i and iii with same lower ionic strength the permeability has great effect on the frequency of pce water interfacial area the frequency of minimum aow rev size of the experiment i with higher permeability shows gaussian distribution with low value of standard deviation and the frequency of minimum aow rev size of experiment iii with lower permeability tends to fitted gaussian distribution with high value of standard deviation under condition of higher ionic strength the permeability also has the similar effect on the frequency of rev of pce water interfacial area from the results of experiments ii and iv fig 8 in addition under the same condition of higher permeability experiments i and ii higher ionic strength makes the fitted gaussian distribution have big mean value and low standard deviation however when the permeability is lower experiments iii and iv increasing ionic strength can increase the standard deviation while ionic strength has no apparent effect on the mean value the mean value and standard deviation of so rev and aow rev sizes based on fitted theoretical gaussian distribution are shown in fig 9 a d the mean values of so rev for experiments i ii iii and iv are 5 74 mm 5 58 mm 4 39 mm and 2 87 mm respectively the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments i and ii are bigger than the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments iii and iv fig 9a with absolute errors of 1 35 mm and 2 71 mm implying higher permeability can increase mean value of so rev sizes greatly simultaneously the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments i and ii show slight increasing tendency as time goes on while the mean value of so rev sizes of experiments iii and iv show decreasing tendency fig 9a the mean values of a ow rev for experiments i ii iii and iv are 5 95 mm 7 44 mm 8 71 mm and 8 53 mm respectively indicating that higher permeability can reduce the mean value of aow rev sizes fig 9c moreover the permeability also has effect on the standard deviation of so rev and aow rev sizes fig 9b and d higher permeability has increased the standard deviation of so rev sizes fig 9b and decreased the standard deviation of aow rev sizes fig 9d ionic strength has no apparent influence on the mean value of so rev sizes absolute error is 0 16 mm under the condition of high permeability experiments i and ii while higher ionic strength has reduced the mean value of so rev sizes of experiment iv compared with experiment iii under condition of low permeability absolute error is 1 52 mm fig 9a for the mean of aow rev sizes ionic strength has different effect under conditions of high permeability and low permeability when permeability is high high ionic strength increased the mean of aow rev sizes of experiment ii compared with experiment i absolute error is 1 49 mm fig 9c however high ionic strength reduced the mean of aow rev sizes of experiment iv fig 9c significantly high ionic strength has reduced the standard deviation of so rev sizes fig 9b and increased the standard deviation of aow rev sizes fig 9d the standard deviation of so rev sizes of experiments i and iii are bigger than the standard deviation of experiments ii and iv fig 9b while the standard deviation of aow rev sizes of experiments i and iii are relatively lower fig 9d this study focuses on the rev of pce saturation and pce water interfacial areas at lab scale under different conditions of permeability and ionic strength the porous media used in experiments is translucent silica sand to simulate natural granular aquifer which contains rich groundwater resource and is rather susceptible to contamination the research results would be applicable in 2d saturated granular aquifer under similar conditions while the results at laboratory scale cannot be directly applicable at the aquifer scale caused by ubiquitous heterogeneity and anisotropy when consider real world application the upscaling problem must be considered simultaneously many previous studies are very important and interesting due to their research at real aquifer scale dagan et al 2013 bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the real world application related to the upscaling problem is beyond this research which will be explored in further study 4 conclusions the impact of ionic strength and permeability on the revs of dnapls properties is investigated in this research four experiments with different conditions of permeability and ionic strength were tested in 2d sandboxes the concentrations of nacl for experiments i and iii are 0 585 g l which can be treated as lower ionic strength 10 000 mm the concentrations of nacl for experiments ii and iv are 32 g l as higher ionic strength 547 009 mm f20 30 mesh translucent silica sand with higher permeability of 1 35 10 10 m2 are used for experiments i and ii simultaneously f40 50 mesh translucent silica sand with lower permeability of 4 25 10 11 m2 are used for experiments iii and iv results indicate permeability and ionic strength have influences on moments of pce plume and pce distribution state higher ionic strength makes the pce plume vertically infiltrates in 2d porous media with higher velocity from the infiltration distance and vertical infiltration speed of pce plume fig 4g and h moreover the angle of the inclination of infiltration paths observed experiments i iv are 1 92 3 97 2 35 and 5 36 more importantly permeability and ionic strength have important influences on the revs of pce saturation and pce water interfacial area higher permeability makes the frequency of rev of pce saturation become wider and lower permeability makes the frequency narrow what s more ionic strength can change the shape of frequency of revs of pce saturation and pce water interfacial area from rev estimation rising permeability leads to larger average rev scales of pce saturation and smaller rev scales of pce water interfacial area furthermore ionic strength has decreased the mean value of so rev sizes under condition of low permeability while ionic strength has not obvious effect on so rev sizes when permeability is high however higher ionic strength increased the mean of aow rev sizes under condition of high permeability and decreased the rev of pce water interfacial area when permeability is low moreover both permeability and ionic strength also apparently affect the standard deviation of so rev and aow rev sizes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research is jointly

6334,a new stage discharge relationship is suggested for wide meandering streams ratio of floodplain width and that of main channel in excess of 5 5 and up to 30 with overbank flow the boundary shear data obtained from various data series with specified range of width ratio and channel sinuosity are analysed by regression technique new empirical relationships are derived between the channel dimensions and amount of shear generated for different flow conditions these new boundary shear models are then used to obtain the stage discharge relation in channels with given roughness characteristics the present method is then validated for its usefulness by applying the same to a number of data series of small scale and large scale flume experiments of other research projects from the literature the errors in discharge estimation are within limits for such methods as per practice i e around 10 for both smooth and rough meandering channels the method is also compared with a number of other methods from the literature by application to different data series the rmse root mean squared error value for all the data series validated is estimated as 9 6 and the method is found to be ranked third among all the methods the method is also able to predict satisfactorily the flow distribution in case of a number of homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened meandering channels of varying sinuosity with overbank flow for large scale flume experimental data sets the mean error for three available data series is estimated as 3 4 while the rmse error is 10 68 due to its ease of application and simple approach this 1d method may serve as a preliminary design tool for assessing stage discharge curve for wide two stage channels in field conditions for application in flood estimation and flood warning cum relief measures such a preliminary study might better decide the need for further refinement through any exhaustive deep study the more robust and expensive 2d

introduction compound or two stage channels has been a subject of intense scientific research over the period of last half a century flood forecasting floodplain protection embankment protection scour and deposition in channel bed and related issues arising out of channels flowing out of bank during periods of high flow have often kept the scientists and researchers interested on studies related to compound channels in both straight and sinuous reaches however despite advancement of our knowledge of flow physics in both straight and meandering compound channels supported by huge amount of research in laboratory and field conditions as well as by analytical and numerical research the simple task of getting a h q curve reliable enough for application in a meandering two stage channel still requires considerable research due to simultaneous complex interaction of a host of factors e g sinuosity sr of the main channel where it is defined as the ratio of the curvilinear length of main channel to the valley or straight length relative boundary roughness of floodplain main channel γ meander belt width relative to total flood way width mbr aspect ratio of the main channel δ defined as the ratio of main channel top width to its height side slopes of the main channel s cross sectional shape of the main channel trapezoidal rectangular or natural etc the relative overbank flow depth β defined as the ratio of depth of flow in floodplain to that in main channel region relative reynolds numbers re or ratio of floodplain main channel reynolds number longitudinal bed slope or slope of the valley s lateral slope of floodplain towards the main channel sl sinuosity of the upper floodplain banks etc rameshwaran et al 1999 there have been many attempts by various researchers in the field of river engineering toebes and sooky 1967 james and brown1977 shiono et al 1999 patra and kar 2000 ervine and ellis 1987 james and wark 1992 in past to find a solution to this basic problem and also to know various other related issues some of these issues are to identify and quantify energy losses due to friction only and those due to non friction factors like cross sectional shape of main channel and floodplains degree of meandering or curvature of flow through measure of sinuosity shape and size of curve through meander belt width channel width tightness of curve resistance due to bend flow secondary circulation slope of main channel and floodplains interaction of slow moving flow in floodplain and fast moving flow in deeper main channel mobile bed etc mc keogh and kiley 1989 ervine et al 1993 ervine and macleod 1999 etc the models for h q curve have been presented by researchers based on 1d 2d or 3d analysis of flow in various forms the 1d analysis while neglecting flow variations in both lateral and transverse directions to main flow direction offers mathematical formulations relating various flow parameters in main flow direction the analysis may be purely an empirical one toebes and sooky 1967 james and brown1977 shiono et al 1999 patra and kar 2000 etc or a semi empirical semi physical one ervine and ellis 1987 james and wark 1992 shiono and muto 1998 etc the 2d analysis is preferred to a 1d analysis with improved physics but at the expense of more computational effort ervine et al 2000 mc gahey and samuels 2003 shan et al 2015 however a 3d analysis shiono and muto 1993 de marchis and napoli 2008 sui liang 2009 liu et al 2015 is the most complete solution as it offers a full solution to complex problem of real time 3d variations of flow parameters especially the velocity of flow in all three directions still requiring a good number of assumptions or empirical constants to handle complex turbulence and roughness characteristics of real flow conditions in field notwithstanding the advancement of research and computational resources at present level the most reliable model capable of predicting velocity boundary shear stage discharge for all types of meandering two stage channels under all possible conditions of flow geometry and shape of channels as well as under varying roughness of floodplains and main channel boundaries is still not available primarily due to a prohibitive number of flow and geometry variables under complex interaction each influencing one or other flow results so one size fits all kind of any solution to this complex issue is simply ruled out in any foreseeable future additionally the 2d or 3d models are often more of research interest than are of any practical interest as especially they require very high computational resources and technical expertise prohibiting their regular application for routine estimation of stage discharge curves under field conditions so realizing the futility of such exhaustive process many times 1d analysis is also adopted by scientists and researchers for a quick easy yet as a reliable method of assessing flow in compound channels for both straight and meandering types at present the methods of ervine and ellis 1987 james and wark 1992 greenhill and sellin 1993 and patra and kar 2000 etc are some 1d models widely referred in literature as simple hand calculation methods offering easy and simple way of estimating h q relations in two stage meandering channels both among research community and among field engineers while the former three models are developed from flow behavior in various subdivisions of compound section divided into three or four subsections with separate discharge formula through application of appropriate energy loss mechanisms the fourth one i e the model of patra and kar 2000 has been developed by quantifying boundary shear stress the catch all response of compound channel wetted perimeter to fluid flow through which all energy losses from both friction and non friction sources occur on separate flow zones of compound channel subsequently through an empirical apparent shear stress model depicting the interaction mechanisms between fast moving main channel flow and slow moving floodplain flow an appropriate stage discharge relation was suggested in case of meandering compound channels however the problem often gets compounded due to dearth of quality data sets comprising velocity boundary shear stress etc either from field or from laboratory experiments there are far less number of meandering channel overbank flow data sets in literature in comparison to straight cases and also much more complexities exist in meandering case than for straight types due to the flow physics very few real data sets pertaining to the field cases are available in literature as collection of the velocity and boundary shear stress data in a meandering flooded river is very costly and tedious even with modern technology not to speak of the associated risk factors for personnel involved from above it is evident that any piecemeal solution to take care of a fraction of the whole issue is of great practical value and needs to be explored thus guided by research goal of finding a quick reliable h q relationships for meandering compound channels with wide floodplains where width ratio α ratio of width of floodplain to width of main channel is in range beyond 5 5 and up to 30 the present work just attempts to explore this possibility many rivers of asia and europe during flood times spread far into their floodplains so that the flow section can be easily assumed as a compound section with width ratio in excess of 11 adb project report 2010 thonon et al 2007 so for specifically addressing wide floodplain cases the current research is directed the research goal would also be to evolve a semi empirical and semi analytical methodology which would address the compound channels with as large range of width ratios and sinuosity as possible since it is nearly impossible to get boundary shear and velocity data in field condition during flood times in rivers of such gigantic proportion α 12 only source of any useful information lies in new experimental data sets or as available in literature to the best knowledge of authors only us army vicksburg 1956 experiments were conducted on large scale flumes consisting of compound meandering channels with width ratios in excess of 12 8 α 30 in past there are only a few laboratory flume experiments though with α value 12 i e large scale epsrc fcf series b sellin et al 1993 and national institute of rourkela india nitr experiments on compound meandering channels of mohanty 2014 by analyzing these limited data sets for very wide floodplains as well as a few other data available from literature for width ratio α 7 e g aberdeen data series of willetts and hardwick 1993 and bradford data series of shiono et al 1999 useful relationship would be explored between the channel dimensions and the boundary shear resistance first and subsequently new stage discharge model would be established khatua et al 2012 carried a regression analysis involving 09 nos of different straight compound channels with varying width ratios 2 0 α 6 67 and then developed a new method mdcm applying the apparent shear force method of khatua 2008 which was found to successfully predict discharge for varying flow depths in straight smooth wide compound channels with width ratio up to a value of 6 67 mohanty et al 2014 further extended the work of khatua et al 2012 by considering new boundary shear data from wider compound channel experiment of mohanty 2014 for straight wide compound channel with α 12 and developed a h q model successful enough in predicting flow in straight compound channels of even higher width ratio 6 67 α 12 mohanty and khatua 2014 however while following a new theory for zonal friction factors darcy s f for flow estimation applied the expressions for percentage boundary shear in floodplains from khatua et al 2012 in case of straight compound channels of width ratios in range 2 0 α 6 67 and those from mohanty et al 2014 for 6 67 α 12 they showed this approach to be very successful in case of straight compound channels 2 0 α up to 12 by validating their model with small scale large scale flume experimental data and field data published in literature the current research since concerned with only meandering compound channels of high width ratios and sinuosity in range of 1 1 sr 2 5 would therefore follow a similar theoretical approach as by mohanty and khatua 2014 albeit with a different boundary shear stress model developed purely from published data for similar channels of past researchers the newly developed approach would not only be valid for stage discharge curve for compound channels with sinuous main channels and wide floodplains both homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened cases but also would be able to predict zonal discharge or component discharge on various flow subsections 2 theory of new method ervine et al 2000 summed up the mechanisms present in a two stage meandering channel see fig 1 after analyzing the studies done by sellin et al 1993 in a meandering compound channel as a the presence of a horizontal shear layer near the bank full level in the crossover region b bulk exchange of fluid taking place between the floodplain and main channel and making the flow highly 3 dimensional due to such mixing c as a result of the momentum exchange with floodplain flow in the crossover region the channel flow enters the bend with a secondary circulation counter to that which is induced by the bend flow and decays rapidly after each bend apex and d water from the upstream floodplain plunging vigorously into the channel at the channel centerline producing strong secondary cells etc resistance to flow resulting in point boundary shear stress occurring across the flow perimeter is nothing but resultant energy loss effects from various factors as listed by ervine et al 1993 out of the enlisted factors the meander belt width ratio mbr i e ratio of width of meander belt to total floodplain width is an important parameter accounting for energy loss of different proportion depending upon its value when mbr value decreases from unity i e when the floodplain gets wider as compared to main channel width the influence of main channel sinuosity gradually diminishes in influencing the total magnitude of flow thus the present study addressed specifically to wide meandering compound channels is to be examined for possibility of any simple reliable stage discharge relationship taking a similar approach of quantifying boundary shear stress and considering a compound section abcdefgh of rectangular fig 2 a or trapezoidal fig 2b main channel section mc with adjoining rectangular floodplains fp on left lfp and right rfp resembling that of a meandering two stage channel cross section at bend apex it is evident that for a straight floodplain running in valley direction while main channel meanders the floodplain portions on either side are of unequal length fig 2 shows cross section for a meandering channel turning right looking downstream with lfp rfp drawing vertical imaginary lines on both junction points c and f between main channel and floodplains on either side of centerline of main channel the entire compound section can be subdivided this method is called vertical division method or simply vdm and is often applied for compound channel flow analysis into three zones namely c abcc as left floodplain c cdeff c as main channel and fghf f as right floodplain with the imaginary vertical lines cc and ff not considered as wetted perimeter for any calculation it is obvious that depending on energy loss occurring in different zones due to interaction of slower floodplain flow and faster main channel flow the actual distribution of boundary shear stress will be different in their magnitude from the magnitude of boundary shear stress obtained for respective zones by independent application of any uniform flow formula to them e g manning s formula or chezy s formula when the zones are considered separately the shear stress τ when integrated for entire flow boundary or any flow zone gives the values of total shear force sf or zonal shear force sz respectively 1 τ z f z 8 ρ u z 2 where fz is the average darcy s friction

channel cross section as 2 s fp p fp τ z where pfp is the floodplain wetted perimeter from eqs 1 and 2 an expression for average flood plain velocity can be found as 3a u fp 8 s fp p fp f fp ρ or in terms of percentage of shear force in the flood plain zone sfp where sfp is defined as the percentage of ratio of shear force per unit length carried by the floodplains to the total shear force per unit length carried by the whole compound section the above expression can be rewritten as 3b u fp s fp g a s 12 5 p fp f fp where the subscript fp denotes respective terms used for floodplain a is area of flow section and s is the valley slope similarly giving an expression for main channel 4a u mc 8 s mc p mc f mc ρ or in terms of percentage of shear force carried by main channel smc where smc is defined as the percentage of ratio of shear force per unit length carried by the main channel to the total shear force per unit length carried by the whole compound section 4b u mc s mc g a s 12 5 p mc f mc where the subscript mc denotes respective terms in main channel region for most of the channels normally the bed and wall roughness are given in terms of manning s roughness value n hence a suitable formula substituting f for n has to be used from yen 1991 darcy s friction factor f manning s roughness n and chezy s coefficient c are related by the relation 5 as 5 f 8 n g r 1 6 k n g c grs u where r is the hydraulic radius s the bed slope g the acceleration due to gravity and u the velocity in si units kn 1m1 2 s so from eq 5 we can find f as 6 f 8 n g r 1 6 2 from eqs 3 and 4 it is obvious that if sfp and smc can be determined in any compound channel flow then both ufp and umc and hence the zonal discharge qfp and qmc as well as the total discharge q can be found out by multiplying respective area occupied by different zones with corresponding zonal velocity and then adding for total flow discharge passing through the compound section the eqs 3 and 4 were successfully applied to straight compound channels with symmetrical floodplains for devising suitable stage discharge relationships in an earlier study mohanty and khatua 2014 where the left floodplain and right floodplain widths were same and the compound section was symmetrical about the central axis bisecting the flow cross section but for a meandering two stage channel where floodplains are in valley direction width of both adjoining floodplains on either side differs however only for doubly meandering compound channels they may be same from the measurement of the boundary shear stress at the bend apex of a meandering compound channel it is seen that mohanty 2014 total shear carried by the left floodplain is markedly higher than that carried by the right floodplain for a meandering main channel turning left looking towards d s end of the channel and vice versa for a meandering main channel turning right this variation needs to be accounted for while computing the average velocity uz thus separate equations are used for finding the average velocity in left floodplain ulfp and for that in right floodplain urfp instead of a single one as in case of straight compound sections with symmetrical floodplains the corresponding equations can be as 7 u lfp s lfp g a s 12 5 p lfp f lfp 8 u rfp s rfp g a s 12 5 p rfp f rfp so from eqs 4 7 and 8 it is quite evident that once the only unknown i e sz or percent of zonal shear force e g shear in main channel left floodplain or right floodplain respectively on the right side of these equations is determined from the known channel dimensions then the respective average zonal velocities can easily be determined using past researchers boundary shear data series of meandering channels with appropriate range of width ratios and sinuosity some empirical relationships between sz and az can be explored through appropriate mathematical regression technique accordingly by regression techniques two separate equations are determined one each for the shear force carried by the total floodplain as sfp and for the left floodplain as slfp by subtracting the slfp from sfp the shear force carried by right floodplain srfp can be found out and thus ulfp and urfp alternately any one of eqs 7 or 8 along with a similar one for main channel such as eq 4b can serve our purpose as subtracting any two of three shear force e g slfp srfp and smc from 100 as total shear carried by entire flow section is 100 the third unknown can always be determined finally qfp and qmc as well as the total discharge q can be found out for the whole meandering compound channel this method has advantages in easy way of estimating velocities and flows in each zone of a compound section the method is straight forward and simple and is quite easy to apply in various cases with just a little judgment as it directly applies fundamental roughness of different zones in compound section different values of f in rougher left and right floodplains and comparatively another value of f for smoother main channel the method is so designed that one is able to apply it for smooth case rough case having homogeneously roughened or otherwise compound sections with both symmetrical doubly meandering two stage channels i e in case of floodplains running parallel to main channel and unsymmetrical floodplains on both sides two floodplains having their downstream along valley direction and even applicable just for a main channel with floodplain on one side only running in valley direction or parallel to main channel asymmetrical sections only requirement is to develop suitable boundary shear models for different flow zones in compound channels of similar geometry and then to follow various steps as enumerated above however the scope of present work is limited only to homogeneously smooth and rough compound channels with floodplains running in valley direction only the reason is due to the availability of very limited data sets in literature suitable for wide meandering compound channel flume experiments including large scale and small scale 2 1 new boundary shear model many researchers in past have developed suitable relationships between percentage of shear force carried by floodplains sfp and the respective percentage of area occupied by the floodplains afp by application of nonlinear regression techniques in case of both straight compound channels e g knight and demetriou 1983 knight and hamed 1984 khatua and patra 2007 khatua 2008 and in meandering compound channels patra and kar 2000 regression analysis a statistical tool even though not a very sound mathematical theory for dealing with complete details of flow physics in particular the same has nevertheless been applied by researchers for stage discharge h q estimation in many cases for straight and meandering compound channel in past knight and demetriou 1983 shiono et al 1999 patra and kar 2000 khatua et al 2012 al khatib et al 2013 mohanty and khatua 2014 etc a similar technique for getting new boundary shear relationships is adopted in present work in any regression analysis the large number of data sets must be selected so that they constitute a family of similar physical variables so as to give a proper meaningful mathematical relationship for determining shear percentages in different flow zones in terms of the respective floodplain areas ideally a large number of shear data from flow cases in different channels but with similar width ratio and sinuosity range are to be used for regression analysis due to the limited availability of quality data sets in literature for boundary shear stress distribution in two stage meandering flume experimentation as well as in natural flooded rivers the conveyance estimation system ces hr wallingford defra 2003a b and http www river conveyance net software tool is used to extract reliable boundary shear stress data this ces software tool is chosen here because it is known to reliably estimate mcgahey et al 2006 2008 the depth averaged velocity and boundary shear percentage of shear force sfp apart from a host of other flow parameters e g stage discharge conveyance etc in channels of simple and compound section for both straight and meandering cases very close to their actual values channel geometry roughness values for both main channel and flood plain regions are given as input to ces so that different outputs including conveyance flow discharge boundary shear etc can be known for each flow depth or relative depths β where β is defined as ratio of flow depth on floodplain to that on main channel for the present study the stage discharge data from large scale flume experiments of fcf series b channel sellin et al 1993 the small scale channel experiments of willetts and hardwick 1993 and the channel experiments of shiono et al 1999 pl see table 1 for geometric and hydraulic details of the data sets used are considered for this study the earlier two data sets are considered benchmark data by researchers across the world in river engineering and have also been referred frequently by james and wark 1992 in devising their widely accepted james and wark 1992 jw and jw2 models for stage discharge prediction in meandering two stage channels project report for hr wallingford uk report sr329 while deriving the shear stress data even though the boundary shear distribution for fcf series b channel is reported in knight et al 1992 as well as is available in website of birmingham university https www birmingham ac uk but for maintaining uniformity among all the data series in respect of quality the quasi 1d software ces is used here to extract shear values for all three above data series since our interest lies in exploring empirical relation among total magnitude of shear force across various subsections with respective zonal flow areas rather in actual magnitude of boundary shear at specific points use of the software is all the more justified for calibration of ces the software is run repeatedly with different trial values of roughness to ascertain the exact values of roughness i e manning s n for different channels by matching measured discharge values with the ces produced discharge values as the back calculation of manning s n differs than nominal values applicable to smooth cases for all three series despite all the compound channels being reported as comprising of smooth main channels and smooth floodplains until the predicted discharge values matched with measured or actual discharge values then only the distribution of boundary shear stress across τb the flow perimeter is extracted integrated over each zone to find out zonal shear force sz values fig 3 a c shows the calibration process through matching of the ces predicted discharge and measured discharge for fcf b 60 trapezoidal channel and some other channels used in this study by trial n values after carefully scrutinizing by estimating correlation coefficient r2 obtained through successive trial regression analyses various combinations of data series from a total of 14 data sets including one for fcf b channel three channels of the willets and hardwick series and 11nos channels of the shiono et al series for shear force with respective flow area only four data sets viz fcf b 600 trapezoidal channel data two data sets of the willetts and hardwick 1993 series for sr values of 1 2 and 1 4 and only one data set having a trapezoidal main channel with α 7 27 and sr 1 372 from the shiono et al 1999 series are finally retained in this study for development of new boundary shear models as highest possible r2 value is obtained for combination of these four data sets out of several others the remaining data sets and some other small and large scale data series are retained however for validation purpose after the h q relation is determined thus total 56 nos of data for shear force representing boundary shear across various flow zones in channels of specific sinuosity sr and width ratio α range are made available from ces as all the boundary shear stress values are considered across the flow section at the bend apex with the particular meander bend turning left at the bend so the shear carried by the left floodplain zone is much larger in comparison with that carried by the right floodplain hence the regression analysis is done for all the data sets considered in this work the relation between the percentage shear carried by the left floodplain and percentage area of left floodplain along with the curve of best fit is shown in fig 4 further it is seen that a close empirical relation exists between percentage area of left floodplain and percentage shear carried by the main channel and the best fit curve is shown in fig 5 the equation for the best fit curve in case of shear in left floodplain slfp versus area of left floodplain alfp is a power relation and the same can be written as 9 s lfp 14 27 a lfp 0 396 with the r2 value as 0 953 however the equation for the best fit curve in case of shear carried by main channel sfp is a second order polynomial function of left floodplain area alfp of the compound channel and is described as 10 s mc 0 006 a lfp 2 0 989 a lfp 42 72 with the r2 value as 0 884 for non homogeneously roughened section with γ 1 where γ is differential roughness or ratio of floodplain roughness to main channel roughness above expressions in equations 9 and 10 can be modified by multiplying a factor as given in knight and hamed 1984 and followed later by many other researchers e g patra and kar 2000 mohanty and khatua 2014 etc so that differential roughness values can be factored into the boundary shear models also thus equations 9 and 10 are modified as 9a s lfp 14 27 a lfp 0 396 1 1 02 β l o g γ and 10a s mc 0 006 a lfp 2 0 989 a lfp 42 72 1 1 02 β l o g γ using the above expressions for eqs 9 and 10 the shear carried by the respective zones of left floodplain and main channel are computed from given dimensions of channel cross section and boundary roughness values for different wetted perimeter contained in various flow zones obtained through application of the vdm to the whole compound section then as explained before the discharge is computed for the different zones in the meandering compound channel the zonal discharges can then be added to estimate the total discharge carried by the entire flow section the error percentage in estimated discharge can then be found out by using equation 11 e r r o r 100 q calc q act q act where qcal calculated or estimated discharge in compound section and qact actual discharge passing in compound section 3 results and discussion the validation of the present method is presented here in three parts in first part the method is simply used to estimate discharge against various depth ratios or relative depth values β for well reported data series in literature specifically of high width ratios and sinuosity in moderate to medium range for which this study has been specifically aimed at in the second part this method is compared with some established methods in literature by applying them to a number of stage discharge data sets for having a reasonable assessment about the success of new method vis a vis those of other researchers in the concluding part the method is tested for its ability to predict flow distribution or component discharges in wide meandering channel with over bank flow for this flow distribution for both smooth and rough meandering channels with varying sinuosity from large scale us army 1956 data series are estimated by new method and then compared with their reported values 3 1 validation of present method for discharge prediction q for validation of the present method many small scale data sets from research projects of past authors comprising the earliest reported small scale laboratory meandering compound channel experiments from sooky 1964 to channel data of nit rourkela mohanty 2014 are selected from literature the other data series include compound channel of kiely 1989 aberdeen university data of willetts and hardwick 1993 bradford university data of shiono et al 1999 the new method is also applied to some well published large scale data series i e the us army vicksburg 1956 meandering compound channel experimental data and the fcf b series 600 trapezoidal meandering channel for overbank flow studies data all these are smooth compound channels with same nominal manning s roughness coefficient in main channel and floodplains though actual n value varies from series to series e g the value of n is 0 013 for shiono et al 1999 and 0 012 for us army 1956 please see table 2 for overview of the data sets regarding the geometric dimensions of channels and hydraulic conditions of experimentation used for the validation purpose in this research work using the procedure as enunciated before along with respective mathematical relations built through eqs 9 10 first the appropriate shear force for left floodplain and main channel region are determined with available geometric data of the compound section at bend apex and subsequently the discharge values are predicted against each overbank flow depth or relative depth β it is once again reiterated that here a simple vertical division method vdm of decomposing the compound section into 3 subsections has been adopted as against usual recommendation of 3 or 4 subsections by drawing horizontal lines i e by horizontal division method or hdm at bank full level of main channel and vertical or inclined lines at edge of mender belt width on floodplains recommended by other researchers e g ervine and ellis 1987 greenhill and sellin 1993 james and wark 1992 etc all discharge measurements are done at bend apex only and different quantities appearing in equations given for discharge predictions have been computed accordingly this method of vertical division has been adopted here to have a simple and easy hand calculation approach as has been done by many researchers for straight compound channels in past knight and hamed 1984 knight and demetriou 1983 khatua et al 2012 mohanty et al 2014 mohanty and khatua 2014 etc as well as patra and kar 2000 for meandering channels from error values shown in fig 6 i it is evident that predicted discharge values are within 5 of actual discharge for the most reliable benchmark data set of fcf b series 60 trapezoidal channel in fig 6 ii for aberdeen data series the discharge for channel with low sinuosity sr 1 2 is under predicted throughout with relatively high error 15 for low relative depth values i e till β 0 2 usually a critical region considered for flow prediction as flow has just gone out of bank however beyond this region the error is minimized similarly for the channel with high sinuosity sr 2 06 it is also seen that very high error persists for low flow depths β 0 1 but thereafter the error in discharge estimation remains very low within 3 to 3 for rest of the measurements the best discharge prediction though is achieved for medium sinuous channel sr 1 41 with discharge being under predicted throughout with maximum error just touching 7 once only in a compound channel when flow just goes over bank i e at low flow depths or low relative depth β value a sharp increase in wetted perimeter occurs with considerable decrease in velocity of flow due to reduction in hydraulic radius resulting in reduction for discharge passing through the compound section around β value of 0 1 0 3 and typically at 0 2 maximum interaction occurs between main channel faster flow and floodplain slower flow for straight compound channels knight and shamseldin 2006 ackers 1992 resulting in much of complex mechanisms sinuosity present in meandering main channels only complicates the flow mechanisms thereby further intensifying interaction as explained before in section i however only for a typical case of willets and hardwick series channels out of about two large scale series and five small scale series considered for validation with lots of variations in channel configurations regarding width ratio sinuosity and differential roughness etc very good results are observed for the medium sinuosity channel of sr 1 41 at low flow depths but not so good results or high errors are obtained in case of channels with low and high sinuosity it appears that the high intensity flow convergence divergence typically noticed in channels of medium sinuosity as a potential factor for such higher accuracy at low flow depths in comparison to low and high sinuosity channels in the willetts and hardwick 1993 series this is possibly due to the fact that the different flow mechanisms can have varying influence for streams of varying sinuosity which in turn might have some bearing in predicted results for flow or discharge assessment as reported here considering all channel data series however no typical pattern is observed across different data series to draw a specific conclusion about any trend in the series under question i e in w and h series barring stray occasion of good results for only such case considerable errors in discharge prediction are observed for most channel configurations of different authors at low flow depths i e for β 0 2 as compared to higher depths it is worth mentioning here that ideally the stage discharge models for meandering compound channels should as far as possible be error free or at least should under predict discharge for a given flow depth from safety consideration in any design process greenhill and sellin 1993 the same in fact holds for straight compound channels or any simple channel and as far as possible should be achieved while modeling h q relationship in any channel shiono et al 1999 have conducted a series of experiments on meandering compound channels at bradford university and presented data for around 11 data series for different channel configurations based on sinuosity aspect ratios meander belt width ratio cross sectional shape of main channel and valley slope etc on a small scale flume facility here measured stage discharge data for 9 different configurations are applied for validation of the present method from fig 6 iii it can be inferred that barring stray cases for low relative depths for r 1 092 0 001 r 1 372 0 001 and r 1 571 0 002 and higher relative depths for t 1 372 0 0005 and t 1 372 0 002 everywhere else the discharge is predicted with very small error again out of all flow depths considered for all configurations more times the discharge is under predicted than over predicted even though some reasons can be ascribed to variations occurring in errors for some channel configurations probably due to shape factor of channel cross section e g low relative depths producing high errors are in particular for rectangular channels whereas high relative depth high errors are due to trapezoidal channels yet exact reasons for such outliers can only be ascertained after further study in many more similar cases as explained earlier whereas low flow depths are usually problematic areas due to intense interaction between floodplain flows and main channel flow however nothing can be inferred conclusively from those stray cases of high errors in high flow depths occurring in the trapezoidal channel with sr value of 1 372 for the small scale data series of nitr one channel of low sinuosity of sr 1 1 by mohanty 2014 it is seen during validation process that fig 6 iv except in the lone case of high error of about 30 at low relative depth less than 0 2 discharge is predicted with error close to 10 in rest of all occasions the earliest large scale meandering channel experiments for overbank flow studies were undertaken by waterways experiment station vicksburg mississippi of us army 1956 for isolating various factors affecting floodways capacity for straight and meandering compound channels specific objectives were to determine the effects on floodway capacity of a radius of curvature of bends b sinuosity of channel c depth of overbank flow d ratio of overbank area to channel area and e overbank roughness there were different channel configurations for smooth and rough floodplains adjoined to smooth main channel the speciality of that studies was high width ratio values ranging from 8 to 30 highest floodplain width was 30 or 9 144 m for 1 or 0 3 m wide main channel the range of sinuosity widely varied from 1 17 to 2 54 and so did the meander belt width see table 2 fig 6 v presents discharge prediction for smaller floodplain width 16 or 4 877 m case and fig 6 vi presents those for larger floodplain width 30 or 9 144 m case separately for better view of the results first the results of smooth floodplains and main channel cases shown in fig 6v and vi are discussed and those for non homogeneously roughened i e smooth main channel and rough floodplains with γ 1 cases as shown in fig 7 i iv are discussed separately in the last part of current section all configurations were tested in that study for only three specific relative depths and accordingly each case has three predictions only out of possible 18 homogeneously smooth cases different predictions in smaller floodplain case only once the error of discharge estimation is beyond 10 and out of possible homogeneously smooth cases 21 different predictions in larger floodplain case only twice the same is beyond 10 showing overall high accuracy of the present method in its ability of discharge prediction in very wide homogeneously smooth compound channels notwithstanding range of sinuosity values varying widely from 1 17 to 2 54 as well as varying meander belt width i e tightness of the meandering curve fig 6 vii and fig 6 viii show the result of discharge prediction through the new method for two other small scale data series namely kiely 1989 and sooky 1964 respectively both series were for rectangular main channel and rectangular floodplains on either side with sinuosity value of 1 22 for kiely s main channel and that for sooky s being 1 1respectively while kiely 1989 used only one slope value 0 001 and one channel configuration sooky 1964 varied the main channel depth two different geometries with depths of 38 1 mm and 76 2 mm as well as valley slope widely between 0 0003 and 0 003 however sooky s channel of 78 2 mm depth and for different slopes as shown in fig 6 viii is used for validation purpose here in each case of kiely 1989 and sooky 1964 it is again found that the method performs reasonably well with error remaining close to 10 on most occasions fig 7 i iv show various cases of varying floodplain roughness with a smooth meandering channel under different width ratios it is noticed from fig 7 i that the present method returns high error at low relative depths due to lowest width ratio α 8 among all 4 cases fig 7 i iv whereas the best results are produced with highest width ratio α 30 i e for widest floodplains confirming our initial assumption of total flow is less influenced through a narrow meandering channel in all cases with varying sinuosity from 1 17 to 2 54 with very wide floodplains only except 6 times out of possible 42 flow predictions in fig 7 iii and iv the error in discharge estimation once again is around 10 which is very satisfactory again from fig 7 i and ii it is obvious that as α changes from 8 to 16 main channel width is half in second case compared to first the error in discharge estimation improves markedly with around 10 except at two lowest flow depths out of total 18 flow depths as in fig 7 ii from above results and discussion we can see that for wide meandering compound channels the present method is able to predict flow or conveyance in both smooth and rough floodplain cases with high precision 3 2 a comparative study of present method with other discharge estimation methods after showing the application of new method to a variety of floodplain main channel configurations a comparative study of the method with some of the best practices 1d conveyance estimation formulae of different authors as reported widely in literature is undertaken to get a fare idea of the efficacy of new one in its ability to predict flow or conveyance in wide two stage meandering channels for this the technical report designated sr329 of hr wallingford uk james and wark 1992 commissioned by national river authority uk to produce a hydraulic manual for meandering channels with in bank and overbank flow is referred which contains such a comparative study among various existing discharge estimation methods the said report carries extensive studies on different aspects of meandering compound channels including a comparative study of different models for stage discharge determination by various authors as well as by two methods suggested by the investigators themselves james and wark jw james and wark2 jw2 many large scale and small scale flume experimental data sets already validated by the present method in previous section are also used in same report for drawing a comparative picture among various existing models which include five most cited and accepted models in literature for meandering channels till date such as ee of ervine and ellis 1987 gh 4 and 5 methods of greenhill and sellin 1993 and j w and j w2 of james and wark 1992 apart from usual method of bed friction only bfo which neglects other energy losses while taking into account those due to bed friction only e g manning s or chezy s formula for uniform open channel flow application to overbank flow in meandering channels first five methods out of six mentioned models rely on drawing horizontal separation lines at bank full level separating main channel zone zone 1 and vertical lines at the both edges of meander belt the area of floodplain zone lying between bank full main channel and edges of meander belt width zone 2 and remaining portion of floodplains lying on either side of zone 1 as zones 3 and 4 and on subsequent application of various discharge assessment formulae based on empirical or semi empirical approach further details about these methods are available elsewhere ervine and ellis 1987 greenhill and sellin 1993 james and wark 1992 thus author s method and these six methods are applied for discharge assessment in some small scale and large scale flume experiments as reported in that report sr329 of james and wark 1992 as stated before these data series have been already validated here by present method in previous section so the mean error in discharge estimation as reported by various methods in said report for various smooth floodplain and main channel cases only are just reproduced here along with error statistics for present method to draw a comparative picture among the overall suitability of each method table 3 enlists series wise the performance of each method and final rmse value taking mean error of all data sets tested it is seen from table 3 that the bfo method fails in most of the cases with high error as expected due to neglect of other energy losses except from that by bed friction mechanism only the jw and jw2 methods are the top ranking ones among all the methods taking into consideration the mean error for different series and rms for mean of errors for different series as only the mean error for a particular series may be often misleading due to cancellation of error magnitude of opposite signs the original report sr329 carries only mean error for individual data series but rms for all such mean values are computed and shown in table 3 the ee and gh 4 and 5 methods are performing averagely whereas the author s method is better than them considering the range of error variation among various data series the author s method predicts the discharge with reasonable accuracy for all data series shown in table 3 the error limited to within a maximum value of 18 reached only once for one configuration of sooky s experiments but on average for all the series the mean hovers around 4 a value considered satisfactory as per practice for discharge prediction models in meandering compound channels the performance of author s method for us army channels shown in the table are for channels of only lowest width ratio total floodplain width 4 877 m or 16 and main channel width 0 61 m or 2 with α 8 among the different configurations tested there but its prediction ability is much improved for still wider channels as evident from fig 6 v and vi also noteworthy is its performance in case of large scale fcf b 60 trapezoidal channel as against those of other three methods overall the author s method ranks third best among all the seven methods studied on basis of rmse value it is 9 65 for author s method and hence is a satisfactory tool for prediction of stage discharge relationship in a range of channel configurations also it is much simpler and easier to handle by field engineers as compared to others including jw methods as in latter case a number of empirical equations are required to be applied to different zones requiring a more tedious process 3 3 validation of present method for flow distribution there are very limited data sets available in the literature regarding the flow distribution i e main channel discharge shown as a fraction or as a percentage of total discharge carried by whole meandering compound section to the best knowledge of authors after a thorough review of literature it is seen that for present case with vertically subdivided zones only three data sets of us army data series total floodplain width 16 or 4 877 m and main channel width 2 or 0 61 m with α 8 sinuosity sr 1 2 1 4 and 1 57 respectively in table no 4 and us army vicksburg 1956 are suitable for any meaningful comparison accordingly by following the steps first to calculate the component velocities and then component discharges in different zones as enunciated in section ii the discharge carried by the main channel qmc is estimated and zonal flow percentage qmc q calc for above three series are compared with qmc q act the results of such a comparative study are shown in table 4 and also through a scatter diagram given in fig 8 the data points also include discharge prediction for none homogeneously roughened floodplain main channel cases from us army series i e for floodplains manning s roughness coefficient nfp 0 025 and 0 023 while that for main channel nmc 0 012 which shows the ability of the present method in reliable prediction of discharge distribution for both smooth and rough cases the mean error for all three series is only 3 36 whereas the rms error of prediction is found to be 12 3 7 8 and 11 4 respectively for above three series of data the rmse for all data points considered is 10 68 it is evident from this limited comparative study that the present method is able to predict the flow distribution or component discharges carried by different zones in a compound meandering section satisfactorily the twin aspects of predictive ability of a model for both total flow and for distributed flow for both straight and meandering compound channels are always a pre requisite to justify its practical use myers 1987 knight and shamseldin 2006 4 conclusions a study of wide meandering compound channels is undertaken in this research work where the boundary shear data for some typical experimental cases of past researchers are analysed to explore mathematical relationships between shear force and flow area in different flow zones for channels with similar geometry and sinuosity from regression analysis separate mathematical expressions for left floodplain shear slfp and main channel shear smc are found each being independently related to percentage area of flow alfp occupied by left floodplain zone it is seen that slfp and alfp are related nonlinearly by a power relation with r2 0 953 whereas smc and alfp are related nonlinearly through a second order polynomial relation with r2 0 884 thereby indicating a definite correlation between shear force carried by different flow zones and the area occupied by them finally a new method to predict stage discharge relation in similar channels is devised and is verified through different validation studies the following conclusions can be drawn from the studies reported in this paper 1 the method is capable of predicting both total flow q in a two stage meandering compound channel as well as flow distribution i e flow carried by zones of main channel and each floodplain e g qmc q etc at different flow depths or relative depths under a range of geometric and sinuosity variations as well as both under homogeneously smooth or non homogeneously roughened 2 the method so developed is then validated for its accuracy with a number of large scale experimental data sets for two stage meandering channel with smooth floodplain and main channel the discharge for different flow depths in these channels are estimated with error in estimation remaining within 10 on most occasions when tested against large scale us army data series for non homogeneously roughened channels floodplain roughness differing from the main channel boundary roughness the method is also found to perform well with error in discharge estimation lying within 10 on most occasions as is for smooth cases 3 the new method is next compared with some well known 1d methods of past researchers bfo method ee method of ervine and ellis 1987 gh 4 and 5 methods of greenhill and sellin 1993 jw and jw 2 of james and wark 1992 methods etc it is seen that the author s method ranks third best after jw2 and jw methods on basis of root mean squared error rmse estimated as 9 65 it confirms the initial assumption while modeling the stage discharge curve that influence of inner main channel flow on total flow decreases in very wide compound channels with increased width ratio and sinuosity because the main channel contribution to total discharge goes on reducing because of wider floodplains and narrower main channel 4 the developed method is also applied for estimating flow distribution or component discharges in three available data series of large scale wide meandering compound channels two homogeneously smooth cases and one non homogeneously roughened case as available in literature for validation the results are quite good with rmse between predicted ratios of main channel flow to total flow and observed main channel flow to total flow for all cases is around 10 5 5 the method suggested is quite simple is easy to apply requiring less expertise and only basic channel data i e only geometric shape dimensions and roughness characteristics of channel and floodplains it is capable of estimating total flow and zonal flow for meandering sinuosity value ranging from 1 1 to 2 54 two stage channels with wide floodplains width ratio ranging from 5 5 to 30 with sufficient reliability as evidenced from error analysis it can serve as a handy tool for field engineers to estimate suitable h q relation for flooded meandering rivers under a range of geometrical conditions and hydraulic parameters 6 it is expected to serve as a preliminary design tool in field before any elaborate extensive and expensive conveyance estimation through 2d or 3d analysis is undertaken by river engineering experts the method has wide scope for further research to encompass new uncovered geometries such as channels of natural shape and for sediment laden flow declaration of competing

6334,a new stage discharge relationship is suggested for wide meandering streams ratio of floodplain width and that of main channel in excess of 5 5 and up to 30 with overbank flow the boundary shear data obtained from various data series with specified range of width ratio and channel sinuosity are analysed by regression technique new empirical relationships are derived between the channel dimensions and amount of shear generated for different flow conditions these new boundary shear models are then used to obtain the stage discharge relation in channels with given roughness characteristics the present method is then validated for its usefulness by applying the same to a number of data series of small scale and large scale flume experiments of other research projects from the literature the errors in discharge estimation are within limits for such methods as per practice i e around 10 for both smooth and rough meandering channels the method is also compared with a number of other methods from the literature by application to different data series the rmse root mean squared error value for all the data series validated is estimated as 9 6 and the method is found to be ranked third among all the methods the method is also able to predict satisfactorily the flow distribution in case of a number of homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened meandering channels of varying sinuosity with overbank flow for large scale flume experimental data sets the mean error for three available data series is estimated as 3 4 while the rmse error is 10 68 due to its ease of application and simple approach this 1d method may serve as a preliminary design tool for assessing stage discharge curve for wide two stage channels in field conditions for application in flood estimation and flood warning cum relief measures such a preliminary study might better decide the need for further refinement through any exhaustive deep study the more robust and expensive 2d

introduction compound or two stage channels has been a subject of intense scientific research over the period of last half a century flood forecasting floodplain protection embankment protection scour and deposition in channel bed and related issues arising out of channels flowing out of bank during periods of high flow have often kept the scientists and researchers interested on studies related to compound channels in both straight and sinuous reaches however despite advancement of our knowledge of flow physics in both straight and meandering compound channels supported by huge amount of research in laboratory and field conditions as well as by analytical and numerical research the simple task of getting a h q curve reliable enough for application in a meandering two stage channel still requires considerable research due to simultaneous complex interaction of a host of factors e g sinuosity sr of the main channel where it is defined as the ratio of the curvilinear length of main channel to the valley or straight length relative boundary roughness of floodplain main channel γ meander belt width relative to total flood way width mbr aspect ratio of the main channel δ defined as the ratio of main channel top width to its height side slopes of the main channel s cross sectional shape of the main channel trapezoidal rectangular or natural etc the relative overbank flow depth β defined as the ratio of depth of flow in floodplain to that in main channel region relative reynolds numbers re or ratio of floodplain main channel reynolds number longitudinal bed slope or slope of the valley s lateral slope of floodplain towards the main channel sl sinuosity of the upper floodplain banks etc rameshwaran et al 1999 there have been many attempts by various researchers in the field of river engineering toebes and sooky 1967 james and brown1977 shiono et al 1999 patra and kar 2000 ervine and ellis 1987 james and wark 1992 in past to find a solution to this basic problem and also to know various other related issues some of these issues are to identify and quantify energy losses due to friction only and those due to non friction factors like cross sectional shape of main channel and floodplains degree of meandering or curvature of flow through measure of sinuosity shape and size of curve through meander belt width channel width tightness of curve resistance due to bend flow secondary circulation slope of main channel and floodplains interaction of slow moving flow in floodplain and fast moving flow in deeper main channel mobile bed etc mc keogh and kiley 1989 ervine et al 1993 ervine and macleod 1999 etc the models for h q curve have been presented by researchers based on 1d 2d or 3d analysis of flow in various forms the 1d analysis while neglecting flow variations in both lateral and transverse directions to main flow direction offers mathematical formulations relating various flow parameters in main flow direction the analysis may be purely an empirical one toebes and sooky 1967 james and brown1977 shiono et al 1999 patra and kar 2000 etc or a semi empirical semi physical one ervine and ellis 1987 james and wark 1992 shiono and muto 1998 etc the 2d analysis is preferred to a 1d analysis with improved physics but at the expense of more computational effort ervine et al 2000 mc gahey and samuels 2003 shan et al 2015 however a 3d analysis shiono and muto 1993 de marchis and napoli 2008 sui liang 2009 liu et al 2015 is the most complete solution as it offers a full solution to complex problem of real time 3d variations of flow parameters especially the velocity of flow in all three directions still requiring a good number of assumptions or empirical constants to handle complex turbulence and roughness characteristics of real flow conditions in field notwithstanding the advancement of research and computational resources at present level the most reliable model capable of predicting velocity boundary shear stage discharge for all types of meandering two stage channels under all possible conditions of flow geometry and shape of channels as well as under varying roughness of floodplains and main channel boundaries is still not available primarily due to a prohibitive number of flow and geometry variables under complex interaction each influencing one or other flow results so one size fits all kind of any solution to this complex issue is simply ruled out in any foreseeable future additionally the 2d or 3d models are often more of research interest than are of any practical interest as especially they require very high computational resources and technical expertise prohibiting their regular application for routine estimation of stage discharge curves under field conditions so realizing the futility of such exhaustive process many times 1d analysis is also adopted by scientists and researchers for a quick easy yet as a reliable method of assessing flow in compound channels for both straight and meandering types at present the methods of ervine and ellis 1987 james and wark 1992 greenhill and sellin 1993 and patra and kar 2000 etc are some 1d models widely referred in literature as simple hand calculation methods offering easy and simple way of estimating h q relations in two stage meandering channels both among research community and among field engineers while the former three models are developed from flow behavior in various subdivisions of compound section divided into three or four subsections with separate discharge formula through application of appropriate energy loss mechanisms the fourth one i e the model of patra and kar 2000 has been developed by quantifying boundary shear stress the catch all response of compound channel wetted perimeter to fluid flow through which all energy losses from both friction and non friction sources occur on separate flow zones of compound channel subsequently through an empirical apparent shear stress model depicting the interaction mechanisms between fast moving main channel flow and slow moving floodplain flow an appropriate stage discharge relation was suggested in case of meandering compound channels however the problem often gets compounded due to dearth of quality data sets comprising velocity boundary shear stress etc either from field or from laboratory experiments there are far less number of meandering channel overbank flow data sets in literature in comparison to straight cases and also much more complexities exist in meandering case than for straight types due to the flow physics very few real data sets pertaining to the field cases are available in literature as collection of the velocity and boundary shear stress data in a meandering flooded river is very costly and tedious even with modern technology not to speak of the associated risk factors for personnel involved from above it is evident that any piecemeal solution to take care of a fraction of the whole issue is of great practical value and needs to be explored thus guided by research goal of finding a quick reliable h q relationships for meandering compound channels with wide floodplains where width ratio α ratio of width of floodplain to width of main channel is in range beyond 5 5 and up to 30 the present work just attempts to explore this possibility many rivers of asia and europe during flood times spread far into their floodplains so that the flow section can be easily assumed as a compound section with width ratio in excess of 11 adb project report 2010 thonon et al 2007 so for specifically addressing wide floodplain cases the current research is directed the research goal would also be to evolve a semi empirical and semi analytical methodology which would address the compound channels with as large range of width ratios and sinuosity as possible since it is nearly impossible to get boundary shear and velocity data in field condition during flood times in rivers of such gigantic proportion α 12 only source of any useful information lies in new experimental data sets or as available in literature to the best knowledge of authors only us army vicksburg 1956 experiments were conducted on large scale flumes consisting of compound meandering channels with width ratios in excess of 12 8 α 30 in past there are only a few laboratory flume experiments though with α value 12 i e large scale epsrc fcf series b sellin et al 1993 and national institute of rourkela india nitr experiments on compound meandering channels of mohanty 2014 by analyzing these limited data sets for very wide floodplains as well as a few other data available from literature for width ratio α 7 e g aberdeen data series of willetts and hardwick 1993 and bradford data series of shiono et al 1999 useful relationship would be explored between the channel dimensions and the boundary shear resistance first and subsequently new stage discharge model would be established khatua et al 2012 carried a regression analysis involving 09 nos of different straight compound channels with varying width ratios 2 0 α 6 67 and then developed a new method mdcm applying the apparent shear force method of khatua 2008 which was found to successfully predict discharge for varying flow depths in straight smooth wide compound channels with width ratio up to a value of 6 67 mohanty et al 2014 further extended the work of khatua et al 2012 by considering new boundary shear data from wider compound channel experiment of mohanty 2014 for straight wide compound channel with α 12 and developed a h q model successful enough in predicting flow in straight compound channels of even higher width ratio 6 67 α 12 mohanty and khatua 2014 however while following a new theory for zonal friction factors darcy s f for flow estimation applied the expressions for percentage boundary shear in floodplains from khatua et al 2012 in case of straight compound channels of width ratios in range 2 0 α 6 67 and those from mohanty et al 2014 for 6 67 α 12 they showed this approach to be very successful in case of straight compound channels 2 0 α up to 12 by validating their model with small scale large scale flume experimental data and field data published in literature the current research since concerned with only meandering compound channels of high width ratios and sinuosity in range of 1 1 sr 2 5 would therefore follow a similar theoretical approach as by mohanty and khatua 2014 albeit with a different boundary shear stress model developed purely from published data for similar channels of past researchers the newly developed approach would not only be valid for stage discharge curve for compound channels with sinuous main channels and wide floodplains both homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened cases but also would be able to predict zonal discharge or component discharge on various flow subsections 2 theory of new method ervine et al 2000 summed up the mechanisms present in a two stage meandering channel see fig 1 after analyzing the studies done by sellin et al 1993 in a meandering compound channel as a the presence of a horizontal shear layer near the bank full level in the crossover region b bulk exchange of fluid taking place between the floodplain and main channel and making the flow highly 3 dimensional due to such mixing c as a result of the momentum exchange with floodplain flow in the crossover region the channel flow enters the bend with a secondary circulation counter to that which is induced by the bend flow and decays rapidly after each bend apex and d water from the upstream floodplain plunging vigorously into the channel at the channel centerline producing strong secondary cells etc resistance to flow resulting in point boundary shear stress occurring across the flow perimeter is nothing but resultant energy loss effects from various factors as listed by ervine et al 1993 out of the enlisted factors the meander belt width ratio mbr i e ratio of width of meander belt to total floodplain width is an important parameter accounting for energy loss of different proportion depending upon its value when mbr value decreases from unity i e when the floodplain gets wider as compared to main channel width the influence of main channel sinuosity gradually diminishes in influencing the total magnitude of flow thus the present study addressed specifically to wide meandering compound channels is to be examined for possibility of any simple reliable stage discharge relationship taking a similar approach of quantifying boundary shear stress and considering a compound section abcdefgh of rectangular fig 2 a or trapezoidal fig 2b main channel section mc with adjoining rectangular floodplains fp on left lfp and right rfp resembling that of a meandering two stage channel cross section at bend apex it is evident that for a straight floodplain running in valley direction while main channel meanders the floodplain portions on either side are of unequal length fig 2 shows cross section for a meandering channel turning right looking downstream with lfp rfp drawing vertical imaginary lines on both junction points c and f between main channel and floodplains on either side of centerline of main channel the entire compound section can be subdivided this method is called vertical division method or simply vdm and is often applied for compound channel flow analysis into three zones namely c abcc as left floodplain c cdeff c as main channel and fghf f as right floodplain with the imaginary vertical lines cc and ff not considered as wetted perimeter for any calculation it is obvious that depending on energy loss occurring in different zones due to interaction of slower floodplain flow and faster main channel flow the actual distribution of boundary shear stress will be different in their magnitude from the magnitude of boundary shear stress obtained for respective zones by independent application of any uniform flow formula to them e g manning s formula or chezy s formula when the zones are considered separately the shear stress τ when integrated for entire flow boundary or any flow zone gives the values of total shear force sf or zonal shear force sz respectively 1 τ z f z 8 ρ u z 2 where fz is the average darcy s friction factor in a particular zone ρ the water density and uz the average zonal stream wise velocity for the floodplains one can write shear force sfp carried by it per unit length perpendicular to the channel cross section as 2 s fp p fp τ z where pfp is the floodplain wetted perimeter from eqs 1 and 2 an expression for average flood plain velocity can be found as 3a u fp 8 s fp p fp f fp ρ or in terms of percentage of shear force in the flood plain zone sfp where sfp is defined as the percentage of ratio of shear force per unit length carried by the floodplains to the total shear force per unit length carried by the whole compound section the above expression can be rewritten as 3b u fp s fp g a s 12 5 p fp f fp where the subscript fp denotes respective terms used for floodplain a is area of flow section and s is the valley slope similarly giving an expression for main channel 4a u mc 8 s mc p mc f mc ρ or in terms of percentage of shear force carried by main channel smc where smc is defined as the percentage of ratio of shear force per unit length carried by the main channel to the total shear force per unit length carried by the whole compound section 4b u mc s mc g a s 12 5 p mc f mc where the subscript mc denotes respective terms in main channel region for most of the channels normally the bed and wall roughness are given in terms of manning s roughness value n hence a suitable formula substituting f for n has to be used from yen 1991 darcy s friction factor f manning s roughness n and chezy s coefficient c are related by the relation 5 as 5 f 8 n g r 1 6 k n g c grs u where r is the hydraulic radius s the bed slope g the acceleration due to gravity and u the velocity in si units kn 1m1 2 s so from eq 5 we can find f as 6 f 8 n g r 1 6 2 from eqs 3 and 4 it is obvious that if sfp and smc can be determined in any compound channel flow then both ufp and umc and hence the zonal discharge qfp and qmc as well as the total discharge q can be found out by multiplying respective area occupied by different zones with corresponding zonal velocity and then adding for total flow discharge passing through the compound section the eqs 3 and 4 were successfully applied to straight compound channels with symmetrical floodplains for devising suitable stage discharge relationships in an earlier study mohanty and khatua 2014 where the left floodplain and right floodplain widths were same and the compound section was symmetrical about the central axis bisecting the flow cross section but for a meandering two stage channel where floodplains are in valley direction width of both adjoining floodplains on either side differs however only for doubly meandering compound channels they may be same from the measurement of the boundary shear stress at the bend apex of a meandering compound channel it is seen that mohanty 2014 total shear carried by the left floodplain is markedly higher than that carried by the right floodplain for a meandering main channel turning left looking towards d s end of the channel and vice versa for a meandering main channel turning right this variation needs to be accounted for while computing the average velocity uz thus separate equations are used for finding the average velocity in left floodplain ulfp and for that in right floodplain urfp instead of a single one as in case of straight compound sections with symmetrical floodplains the corresponding equations can be as 7 u lfp s lfp g a s 12 5 p lfp f lfp 8 u rfp s rfp g a s 12 5 p rfp f rfp so from eqs 4 7 and 8 it is quite evident that once the only unknown i e sz or percent of zonal shear force e g shear in main channel left floodplain or right floodplain respectively on the right side of these equations is determined from the known channel dimensions then the respective average zonal velocities can easily be determined using past researchers boundary shear data series of meandering channels with appropriate range of width ratios and sinuosity some empirical relationships between sz and az can be explored through appropriate mathematical regression technique accordingly by regression techniques two separate equations are determined one each for the shear force carried by the total floodplain as sfp and for the left floodplain as slfp by subtracting the slfp from sfp the shear force carried by right floodplain srfp can be found out and thus ulfp and urfp alternately any one of eqs 7 or 8 along with a similar one for main channel such as eq 4b can serve our purpose as subtracting any two of three shear force e g slfp srfp and smc from 100 as total shear carried by entire flow section is 100 the third unknown can always be determined finally qfp and qmc as well as the total discharge q can be found out for the whole meandering compound channel this method has advantages in easy way of estimating velocities and flows in each zone of a compound section the method is straight forward and simple and is quite easy to apply in various cases with just a little judgment as it directly applies fundamental roughness of different zones in compound section different values of f in rougher left and right floodplains and comparatively another value of f for smoother main channel the method is so designed that one is able to apply it for smooth case rough case having homogeneously roughened or otherwise compound sections with both symmetrical doubly meandering two stage channels i e in case of floodplains running parallel to main channel and unsymmetrical floodplains on both sides two floodplains having their downstream along valley direction and even applicable just for a main channel with floodplain on one side only running in valley direction or parallel to main channel asymmetrical sections only requirement is to develop suitable boundary shear models for different flow zones in compound channels of similar geometry and then to follow various steps as enumerated above however the scope of present work is limited only to homogeneously smooth and rough compound channels with floodplains running in valley direction only the reason is due to the availability of very limited data sets in literature suitable for wide meandering compound channel flume experiments including large scale and small scale 2 1 new boundary shear model many researchers in past have developed suitable relationships between percentage of shear force carried by floodplains sfp and the respective percentage of area occupied by the floodplains afp by application of nonlinear regression techniques in case of both straight compound channels e g knight and demetriou 1983 knight and hamed 1984 khatua and patra 2007 khatua 2008 and in meandering compound channels patra and kar 2000 regression analysis a statistical tool even though not a very sound mathematical theory for dealing with complete details of flow physics in particular the same has nevertheless been applied by researchers for stage discharge h q estimation in many cases for straight and meandering compound channel in past knight and demetriou 1983 shiono et al 1999 patra and kar 2000 khatua et al 2012 al khatib et al 2013 mohanty and khatua 2014 etc a similar technique for getting new boundary shear relationships is adopted in present work in any regression analysis the large number of data sets must be selected so that they constitute a family of similar physical variables so as to give a proper meaningful mathematical relationship for determining shear percentages in different flow zones in terms of the respective floodplain areas ideally a large number of shear data from flow cases in different channels but with similar width ratio and sinuosity range are to be used for regression analysis due to the limited availability of quality data sets in literature for boundary shear stress distribution in two stage meandering flume experimentation as well as in natural flooded rivers the conveyance estimation system ces hr wallingford defra 2003a b and http www river conveyance net software tool is used to extract reliable boundary shear stress data this ces software tool is chosen here because it is known to reliably estimate mcgahey et al 2006 2008 the depth averaged velocity and boundary shear percentage of shear force sfp apart from a host of other flow parameters e g stage discharge conveyance etc in channels of simple and compound section for both straight and meandering cases very close to their actual values channel geometry roughness values for both main channel and flood plain regions are given as input to ces so that different outputs including conveyance flow discharge boundary shear etc can be known for each flow depth or relative depths β where β is defined as ratio of flow depth on floodplain to that on main channel for the present study the stage discharge data from large scale flume experiments of fcf series b channel sellin et al 1993 the small scale channel experiments of willetts and hardwick 1993 and the channel experiments of shiono et al 1999 pl see table 1 for geometric and hydraulic details of the data sets used are considered for this study the earlier two data sets are considered benchmark data by researchers across the world in river engineering and have also been referred frequently by james and wark 1992 in devising their widely accepted james and wark 1992 jw and jw2 models for stage discharge prediction in meandering two stage channels project report for hr wallingford uk report sr329 while deriving the shear stress data even though the boundary shear distribution for fcf series b channel is reported in knight et al 1992 as well as is available in website of birmingham university https www birmingham ac uk but for maintaining uniformity among all the data series in respect of quality the quasi 1d software ces is used here to extract shear values for all three above data series since our interest lies in exploring empirical relation among total magnitude of shear force across various subsections with respective zonal flow areas rather in actual magnitude of boundary shear at specific points use of the software is all the more justified for calibration of ces the software is run repeatedly with different trial values of roughness to ascertain the exact values of roughness i e manning s n for different channels by matching measured discharge values with the ces produced discharge values as the back calculation of manning s n differs than nominal values applicable to smooth cases for all three series despite all the compound channels being reported as comprising of smooth main channels and smooth floodplains until the predicted discharge values matched with measured or actual discharge values then only the distribution of boundary shear stress across τb the flow perimeter is extracted integrated over each zone to find out zonal shear force sz values fig 3 a c shows the calibration process through matching of the ces predicted discharge and measured discharge for fcf b 60 trapezoidal channel and some other channels used in this study by trial n values after carefully scrutinizing by estimating correlation coefficient r2 obtained through successive trial regression analyses various combinations of data series from a total of 14 data sets including one for fcf b channel three channels of the willets and hardwick series and 11nos channels of the shiono et al series for shear force with respective flow area only four data sets viz fcf b 600 trapezoidal channel data two data sets of the willetts and hardwick 1993 series for sr values of 1 2 and 1 4 and only one data set having a trapezoidal main channel with α 7 27 and sr 1 372 from the shiono et al 1999 series are finally retained in this study for development of new boundary shear models as highest possible r2 value is obtained for combination of these four data sets out of several others the remaining data sets and some other small and large scale data series are retained however for validation purpose after the h q relation is determined thus total 56 nos of data for shear force representing boundary shear across various flow zones in channels of specific sinuosity sr and width ratio α range are made available from ces as all the boundary shear stress values are considered across the flow section at the bend apex with the particular meander bend turning left at the bend so the shear carried by the left floodplain zone is much larger in comparison with that carried by the right floodplain hence the regression analysis is done for all the data sets considered in this work the relation between the percentage shear carried by the left floodplain and percentage area of left floodplain along with the curve of best fit is shown in fig 4 further it is seen that a close empirical relation exists between percentage area of left floodplain and percentage shear carried by the main channel and the best fit curve is shown in fig 5 the equation for the best fit curve in case of shear in left floodplain slfp versus area of left floodplain alfp is a power relation and the same can be written as 9 s lfp 14 27 a lfp 0 396 with the r2 value as 0 953 however the equation for the best fit curve in case of shear carried by main channel sfp is a second order polynomial function of left floodplain area alfp of the compound channel and is described as 10 s mc 0 006 a lfp 2 0 989 a lfp 42 72 with the r2 value as 0 884 for non homogeneously roughened section with γ 1 where γ is differential roughness or ratio of floodplain roughness to main channel roughness above expressions in equations 9 and 10 can be modified by multiplying a factor as given in knight and hamed 1984 and followed later by many other researchers e g patra and kar 2000 mohanty and khatua 2014 etc so that differential roughness values can be factored into the boundary shear models also thus equations 9 and 10 are modified as 9a s lfp 14 27 a lfp 0 396 1 1 02 β l o g γ and 10a s mc 0 006 a lfp 2 0 989 a lfp 42 72 1 1 02 β l o g γ using the above expressions for eqs 9 and 10 the shear carried by the respective zones of left floodplain and main channel are computed from given dimensions of channel cross section and boundary roughness values for different wetted perimeter contained in various flow zones obtained through application of the vdm to the whole compound section then as explained before the discharge is computed for the different zones in the meandering compound channel the zonal discharges can then be added to estimate the total discharge carried by the entire flow section the error percentage in estimated discharge can then be found out by using equation 11 e r r o r 100 q calc q act q act where qcal calculated or estimated discharge in compound section and qact actual discharge passing in compound section 3 results and discussion the validation of the present method is presented here in three parts in first part the method is simply used to estimate discharge against various depth ratios or relative depth values β for well reported data series in literature specifically of high width ratios and sinuosity in moderate to medium range for which this study has been specifically aimed at in the second part this method is compared with some established methods in literature by applying them to a number of stage discharge data sets for having a reasonable assessment about the success of new method vis a vis those of other researchers in the concluding part the method is tested for its ability to predict flow distribution or component discharges in wide meandering channel with over bank flow for this flow distribution for both smooth and rough meandering channels with varying sinuosity from large scale us army 1956 data series are estimated by new method and then compared with their reported values 3 1 validation of present method for discharge prediction q for validation of the present method many small scale data sets from research projects of past authors comprising the earliest reported small scale laboratory meandering compound channel experiments from sooky 1964 to channel data of nit rourkela mohanty 2014 are selected from literature the other data series include compound channel of kiely 1989 aberdeen university data of willetts and hardwick 1993 bradford university data of shiono et al 1999 the new method is also applied to some well published large scale data series i e the us army vicksburg 1956 meandering compound channel experimental data and the fcf b series 600 trapezoidal meandering channel for overbank flow studies data all these are smooth compound channels with same nominal manning s roughness coefficient in main channel and floodplains though actual n value varies from series to series e g the value of n is 0 013 for shiono et al 1999 and 0 012 for us army 1956 please see table 2 for overview of the data sets regarding the geometric dimensions of channels and hydraulic conditions of experimentation used for the validation purpose in this research work using the procedure as enunciated before along with respective mathematical relations built through eqs 9 10 first the appropriate shear force for left floodplain and main channel region are determined with available geometric data of the compound section at bend apex and subsequently the discharge values are predicted against each overbank flow depth or relative depth β it is once again reiterated that here a simple vertical division method vdm of decomposing the compound section into 3 subsections has been adopted as against usual recommendation of 3 or 4 subsections by drawing horizontal lines i e by horizontal division method or hdm at bank full level of main channel and vertical or inclined lines at edge of mender belt width on floodplains recommended by other researchers e g ervine and ellis 1987 greenhill and sellin 1993 james and wark 1992 etc all discharge measurements are done at bend apex only and different quantities appearing in equations given for discharge predictions have been computed accordingly this method of vertical division has been adopted here to have a simple and easy hand calculation approach as has been done by many researchers for straight compound channels in past knight and hamed 1984 knight and demetriou 1983 khatua et al 2012 mohanty et al 2014 mohanty and khatua 2014 etc as well as patra and kar 2000 for meandering channels from error values shown in fig 6 i it is evident that predicted discharge values are within 5 of actual discharge for the most reliable benchmark data set of fcf b series 60 trapezoidal channel in fig 6 ii for aberdeen data series the discharge for channel with low sinuosity sr 1 2 is under predicted throughout with relatively high error 15 for low relative depth values i e till β 0 2 usually a critical region considered for flow prediction as flow has just gone out of bank however beyond this region the error is minimized similarly for the channel with high sinuosity sr 2 06 it is also seen that very high error persists for low flow depths β 0 1 but thereafter the error in discharge estimation remains very low within 3 to 3 for rest of the measurements the best discharge prediction though is achieved for medium sinuous channel sr 1 41 with discharge being under predicted throughout with maximum error just touching 7 once only in a compound channel when flow just goes over bank i e at low flow depths or low relative depth β value a sharp increase in wetted perimeter occurs with considerable decrease in velocity of flow due to reduction in hydraulic radius resulting in reduction for discharge passing through the compound section around β value of 0 1 0 3 and typically at 0 2 maximum interaction occurs between main channel faster flow and floodplain slower flow for straight compound channels knight and shamseldin 2006 ackers 1992 resulting in much of complex mechanisms sinuosity present in meandering main channels only complicates the flow mechanisms thereby further intensifying interaction as explained before in section i however only for a typical case of willets and hardwick series channels out of about two large scale series and five small scale series considered for validation with lots of variations in channel configurations regarding width ratio sinuosity and differential roughness etc very good results are observed for the medium sinuosity channel of sr 1 41 at low flow depths but not so good results or high errors are obtained in case of channels with low and high sinuosity it appears that the high intensity flow convergence divergence typically noticed in channels of medium sinuosity as a potential factor for such higher accuracy at low flow depths in comparison to low and high sinuosity channels in the willetts and hardwick 1993 series this is possibly due to the fact that the different flow mechanisms can have varying influence for streams of varying sinuosity which in turn might have some bearing in predicted results for flow or discharge assessment as reported here considering all channel data series however no typical pattern is observed across different data series to draw a specific conclusion about any trend in the series under question i e in w and h series barring stray occasion of good results for only such case considerable errors in discharge prediction are observed for most channel configurations of different authors at low flow depths i e for β 0 2 as compared to higher depths it is worth mentioning here that ideally the stage discharge models for meandering compound channels should as far as possible be error free or at least should under predict discharge for a given flow depth from safety consideration in any design process greenhill and sellin 1993 the same in fact holds for straight compound channels or any simple channel and as far as possible should be achieved while modeling h q relationship in any channel shiono et al 1999 have conducted a series of experiments on meandering compound channels at bradford university and presented data for around 11 data series for different channel configurations based on sinuosity aspect ratios meander belt width ratio cross sectional shape of main channel and valley slope etc on a small scale flume facility here measured stage discharge data for 9 different configurations are applied for validation of the present method from fig 6 iii it can be inferred that barring stray cases for low relative depths for r 1 092 0 001 r 1 372 0 001 and r 1 571 0 002 and higher relative depths for t 1 372 0 0005 and t 1 372 0 002 everywhere else the discharge is predicted with very small error again out of all flow depths considered for all configurations more times the discharge is under predicted than over predicted even though some reasons can be ascribed to variations occurring in errors for some channel configurations probably due to shape factor of channel cross section e g low relative depths producing high errors are in particular for rectangular channels whereas high relative depth high errors are due to trapezoidal channels yet exact reasons for such outliers can only be ascertained after further study in many more similar cases as explained earlier whereas low flow depths are usually problematic areas due to intense interaction between floodplain flows and main channel flow however nothing can be inferred conclusively from those stray cases of high errors in high flow depths occurring in the trapezoidal channel with sr value of 1 372 for the small scale data series of nitr one channel of low sinuosity of sr 1 1 by mohanty 2014 it is seen during validation process that fig 6 iv except in the lone case of high error of about 30 at low relative depth less than 0 2 discharge is predicted with error close to 10 in rest of all occasions the earliest large scale meandering channel experiments for overbank flow studies were undertaken by waterways experiment station vicksburg mississippi of us army 1956 for isolating various factors affecting floodways capacity for straight and meandering compound channels specific objectives were to determine the effects on floodway capacity of a radius of curvature of bends b sinuosity of channel c depth of overbank flow d ratio of overbank area to channel area and e overbank roughness there were different channel configurations for smooth and rough floodplains adjoined to smooth main channel the speciality of that studies was high width ratio values ranging from 8 to 30 highest floodplain width was 30 or 9 144 m for 1 or 0 3 m wide main channel the range of sinuosity widely varied from 1 17 to 2 54 and so did the meander belt width see table 2 fig 6 v presents discharge prediction for smaller floodplain width 16 or 4 877 m case and fig 6 vi presents those for larger floodplain width 30 or 9 144 m case separately for better view of the results first the results of smooth floodplains and main channel cases shown in fig 6v and vi are discussed and those for non homogeneously roughened i e smooth main channel and rough floodplains with γ 1 cases as shown in fig 7 i iv are discussed separately in the last part of current section all configurations were tested in that study for only three specific relative depths and accordingly each case has three predictions only out of possible 18 homogeneously smooth cases different predictions in smaller floodplain case only once the error of discharge estimation is beyond 10 and out of possible homogeneously smooth cases 21 different predictions in larger floodplain case only twice the same is beyond 10 showing overall high accuracy of the present method in its ability of discharge prediction in very wide homogeneously smooth compound channels notwithstanding range of sinuosity values varying widely from 1 17 to 2 54 as well as varying meander belt width i e tightness of the meandering curve fig 6 vii and fig 6 viii show the result of discharge prediction through the new method for two other small scale data series namely kiely 1989 and sooky 1964 respectively both series were for rectangular main channel and rectangular floodplains on either side with sinuosity value of 1 22 for kiely s main channel and that for sooky s being 1 1respectively while kiely 1989 used only one slope value 0 001 and one channel configuration sooky 1964 varied the main channel depth two different geometries with depths of 38 1 mm and 76 2 mm as well as valley slope widely between 0 0003 and 0 003 however sooky s channel of 78 2 mm depth and for different slopes as shown in fig 6 viii is used for validation purpose here in each case of kiely 1989 and sooky 1964 it is again found that the method performs reasonably well with error remaining close to 10 on most occasions fig 7 i iv show various cases of varying floodplain roughness with a smooth meandering channel under different width ratios it is noticed from fig 7 i that the present method returns high error at low relative depths due to lowest width ratio α 8 among all 4 cases fig 7 i iv whereas the best results are produced with highest width ratio α 30 i e for widest floodplains confirming our initial assumption of total flow is less influenced through a narrow meandering channel in all cases with varying sinuosity from 1 17 to 2 54 with very wide floodplains only except 6 times out of possible 42 flow predictions in fig 7 iii and iv the error in discharge estimation once again is around 10 which is very satisfactory again from fig 7 i and ii it is obvious that as α changes from 8 to 16 main channel width is half in second case compared to first the error in discharge estimation improves markedly with around 10 except at two lowest flow depths out of total 18 flow depths as in fig 7 ii from above results and discussion we can see that for wide meandering compound channels the present method is able to predict flow or conveyance in both smooth and rough floodplain cases with high precision 3 2 a comparative study of present method with other discharge estimation methods after showing the application of new method to a variety of floodplain main channel configurations a comparative study of the method with some of the best practices 1d conveyance estimation formulae of different authors as reported widely in literature is undertaken to get a fare idea of the efficacy of new one in its ability to predict flow or conveyance in wide two stage meandering channels for this the technical report designated sr329 of hr wallingford uk james and wark 1992 commissioned by national river authority uk to produce a hydraulic manual for meandering channels with in bank and overbank flow is referred which contains such a comparative study among various existing discharge estimation methods the said report carries extensive studies on different aspects of meandering compound channels including a comparative study of different models for stage discharge determination by various authors as well as by two methods suggested by the investigators themselves james and wark jw james and wark2 jw2 many large scale and small scale flume experimental data sets already validated by the present method in previous section are also used in same report for drawing a comparative picture among various existing models which include five most cited and accepted models in literature for meandering channels till date such as ee of ervine and ellis 1987 gh 4 and 5 methods of greenhill and sellin 1993 and j w and j w2 of james and wark 1992 apart from usual method of bed friction only bfo which neglects other energy losses while taking into account those due to bed friction only e g manning s or chezy s formula for uniform open channel flow application to overbank flow in meandering channels first five methods out of six mentioned models rely on drawing horizontal separation lines at bank full level separating main channel zone zone 1 and vertical lines at the both edges of meander belt the area of floodplain zone lying between bank full main channel and edges of meander belt width zone 2 and remaining portion of floodplains lying on either side of zone 1 as zones 3 and 4 and on subsequent application of various discharge assessment formulae based on empirical or semi empirical approach further details about these methods are available elsewhere ervine and ellis 1987 greenhill and sellin 1993 james and wark 1992 thus author s method and these six methods are applied for discharge assessment in some small scale and large scale flume experiments as reported in that report sr329 of james and wark 1992 as stated before these data series have been already validated here by present method in previous section so the mean error in discharge estimation as reported by various methods in said report for various smooth floodplain and main channel cases only are just reproduced here along with error statistics for present method to draw a comparative picture among the overall suitability of each method table 3 enlists series wise the performance of each method and final rmse value taking mean error of all data sets tested it is seen from table 3 that the bfo method fails in most of the cases with high error as expected due to neglect of other energy losses except from that by bed friction mechanism only the jw and jw2 methods are the top ranking ones among all the methods taking into consideration the mean error for different series and rms for mean of errors for different series as only the mean error for a particular series may be often misleading due to cancellation of error magnitude of opposite signs the original report sr329 carries only mean error for individual data series but rms for all such mean values are computed and shown in table 3 the ee and gh 4 and 5 methods are performing averagely whereas the author s method is better than them considering the range of error variation among various data series the author s method predicts the discharge with reasonable accuracy for all data series shown in table 3 the error limited to within a maximum value of 18 reached only once for one configuration of sooky s experiments but on average for all the series the mean hovers around 4 a value considered satisfactory as per practice for discharge prediction models in meandering compound channels the performance of author s method for us army channels shown in the table are for channels of only lowest width ratio total floodplain width 4 877 m or 16 and main channel width 0 61 m or 2 with α 8 among the different configurations tested there but its prediction ability is much improved for still wider channels as evident from fig 6 v and vi also noteworthy is its performance in case of large scale fcf b 60 trapezoidal channel as against those of other three methods overall the author s method ranks third best among all the seven methods studied on basis of rmse value it is 9 65 for author s method and hence is a satisfactory tool for prediction of stage discharge relationship in a range of channel configurations also it is much simpler and easier to handle by field engineers as compared to others including jw methods as in latter case a number of empirical equations are required to be applied to different zones requiring a more tedious process 3 3 validation of present method for flow distribution there are very limited data sets available in the literature regarding the flow distribution i e main channel discharge shown as a fraction or as a percentage of total discharge carried by whole meandering compound section to the best knowledge of authors after a thorough review of literature it is seen that for present case with vertically subdivided zones only three data sets of us army data series total floodplain width 16 or 4 877 m and main channel width 2 or 0 61 m with α 8 sinuosity sr 1 2 1 4 and 1 57 respectively in table no 4 and us army vicksburg 1956 are suitable for any meaningful comparison accordingly by following the steps first to calculate the component velocities and then component discharges in different zones as enunciated in section ii the discharge carried by the main channel qmc is estimated and zonal flow percentage qmc q calc for above three series are compared with qmc q act the results of such a comparative study are shown in table 4 and also through a scatter diagram given in fig 8 the data points also include discharge prediction for none homogeneously roughened floodplain main channel cases from us army series i e for floodplains manning s roughness coefficient nfp 0 025 and 0 023 while that for main channel nmc 0 012 which shows the ability of the present method in reliable prediction of discharge distribution for both smooth and rough cases the mean error for all three series is only 3 36 whereas the rms error of prediction is found to be 12 3 7 8 and 11 4 respectively for above three series of data the rmse for all data points considered is 10 68 it is evident from this limited comparative study that the present method is able to predict the flow distribution or component discharges carried by different zones in a compound meandering section satisfactorily the twin aspects of predictive ability of a model for both total flow and for distributed flow for both straight and meandering compound channels are always a pre requisite to justify its practical use myers 1987 knight and shamseldin 2006 4 conclusions a study of wide meandering compound channels is undertaken in this research work where the boundary shear data for some typical experimental cases of past researchers are analysed to explore mathematical relationships between shear force and flow area in different flow zones for channels with similar geometry and sinuosity from regression analysis separate mathematical expressions for left floodplain shear slfp and main channel shear smc are found each being independently related to percentage area of flow alfp occupied by left floodplain zone it is seen that slfp and alfp are related nonlinearly by a power relation with r2 0 953 whereas smc and alfp are related nonlinearly through a second order polynomial relation with r2 0 884 thereby indicating a definite correlation between shear force carried by different flow zones and the area occupied by them finally a new method to predict stage discharge relation in similar channels is devised and is verified through different validation studies the following conclusions can be drawn from the studies reported in this paper 1 the method is capable of predicting both total flow q in a two stage meandering compound channel as well as flow distribution i e flow carried by zones of main channel and each floodplain e g qmc q etc at different flow depths or relative depths under a range of geometric and sinuosity variations as well as both under homogeneously smooth or non homogeneously roughened 2 the method so developed is then validated for its accuracy with a number of large scale experimental data sets for two stage meandering channel with smooth floodplain and main channel the discharge for different flow depths in these channels are estimated with error in estimation remaining within 10 on most occasions when tested against large scale us army data series for non homogeneously roughened channels floodplain roughness differing from the main channel boundary roughness the method is also found to perform well with error in discharge estimation lying within 10 on most occasions as is for smooth cases 3 the new method is next compared with some well known 1d methods of past researchers bfo method ee method of ervine and ellis 1987 gh 4 and 5 methods of greenhill and sellin 1993 jw and jw 2 of james and wark 1992 methods etc it is seen that the author s method ranks third best after jw2 and jw methods on basis of root mean squared error rmse estimated as 9 65 it confirms the initial assumption while modeling the stage discharge curve that influence of inner main channel flow on total flow decreases in very wide compound channels with increased width ratio and sinuosity because the main channel contribution to total discharge goes on reducing because of wider floodplains and narrower main channel 4 the developed method is also applied for estimating flow distribution or component discharges in three available data series of large scale wide meandering compound channels two homogeneously smooth cases and one non homogeneously roughened case as available in literature for validation the results are quite good with rmse between predicted ratios of main channel flow to total flow and observed main channel flow to total flow for all cases is around 10 5 5 the method suggested is quite simple is easy to apply requiring less expertise and only basic channel data i e only geometric shape dimensions and roughness characteristics of channel and floodplains it is capable of estimating total flow and zonal flow for meandering sinuosity value ranging from 1 1 to 2 54 two stage channels with wide floodplains width ratio ranging from 5 5 to 30 with sufficient reliability as evidenced from error analysis it can serve as a handy tool for field engineers to estimate suitable h q relation for flooded meandering rivers under a range of geometrical conditions and hydraulic parameters 6 it is expected to serve as a preliminary design tool in field before any elaborate extensive and expensive conveyance estimation through 2d or 3d analysis is undertaken by river engineering experts the method has wide scope for further research to encompass new uncovered geometries such as channels of natural shape and for sediment laden flow declaration of competing
