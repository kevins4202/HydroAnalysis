5420,since professor paul g jarvis proposed a scheme in 1976 that relates stomatal conductance with environmental variables there have been numerous studies exploring the relationships for estimating transpiration ec vapor pressure deficit d and solar radiation r are dominant environmental factors influencing ec whilst air temperature t is deemed important but often neglected in model applications since d and t are exponentially correlated thus it is uncertain whether to construct the jarvis type ec models with both t and d included will improve model performance meanwhile it is worth mentioning that most jarvis type models cannot simulate nocturnal sap flow which has been observed across a wide range of species and climates therefore this study was firstly aimed at developing a generalized temperature stress function and testing its role in the jarvis type model and further improving the model by modifying a widely used radiation function for nocturnal sap flow simulations the results show that inclusion of a t stress function for hourly sap flow simulations can avoid overestimation of daily peaks and the modified jarvis type model was able to capture the nocturnal sap flow these improvements revive the model for ecohydrological applications in a future climate where enhanced temperature effects and increasing nocturnal transpiration resulting from rising nighttime vapor pressure deficits are likely keywords transpiration nocturnal sap flow environmental changes stomatal conductance jarvis type model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et returns approximately 65 75 of the total annual precipitation p to the atmosphere on a continental basis trenberth et al 2007 jung et al 2010 over land areas in temperate zones the et p ratio is around 67 and in arid regions it can be up to 90 or more wilcox et al 2006 wmo 2008 glenn et al 2015 transpiration ec from plants contributes over half of the total terrestrial et coenders gerrits et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 wei et al 2017 equivalent to more than one third of the total annual precipitation therefore et and its component ec play important roles in the terrestrial hydrological cycle dolman and de jeu 2010 and accurate quantification of et fluxes is important for land surface water and energy balance to aid water and environment management ec is regulated by leaf stomata that sense the changes in water potential gradients along the soil plant atmosphere continuum whitehead 1998 verhoef and egea 2014 many field studies have shown that variability in diurnal measurements of stomatal conductance gs is controlled by environmental variables including atmospheric conditions soil water supply and nutrients mitchell et al 2009 eller et al 2016 to simulate transpiration through mathematical realization of the stomata responses to environmental changes jarvis 1976 proposed a gs model that has been extended or modified by many others thereafter stewart 1988 tuzet et al 2003 wang et al 2016b among the environmental variables vapor pressure deficit d and solar radiation r are mostly deemed as the primary controlling atmospheric variables across different biomes and climates arneth et al 1996 bovard et al 2005 wang et al 2017 however the mechanism of how stomata regulate transpiration under environmental constraints is more complex than it seems monteith 1995 explored data from 52 sets of measurements on 16 species collected in many study sites and concluded a general linear dependence of gs on ec rate this implies that stomata responded to water loss from the leaf not to air vapor pressure deficit or leaf to air vapor pressure deficit the finding was consistent with mott and parkhurst 1991 and recently reviewed and confirmed by buckley 2019 meanwhile in some cases ec reached a maximum rate above which any further increase in d resulted in decreases in gs and ec due to partial stomata closure to conserve water ma et al 2017 from these studies it can be concluded that plant transpiration is constrained by both physiological and environmental factors which of the factors is dominant seems highly species dependent temperature t is another atmospheric factor influencing plant water use in addition to d and r the optimal temperature for transpiration is commonly thought between 20 c and 30 c as the stomatal aperture is generally widest in this temperature range moore et al 2003 temperature also influences water potential which determines the hydraulic gradient driving water flow in the soil plant atmosphere continuum philip 1966 carrasco et al 2015 and the relation between temperature and water potential can be mathematically formulated hopkins 1999 despite the importance of t its influence on ec is not always parameterized in the jarvis type ec models for example t was neglected in whitley et al 2009 lhomme et al 1998 and the references listed therein however the reason why it was neglected was rarely explicitly clarified one potential argument could be that d is a function of t and relative humidity thus using d in an ec model can have already included the effect of t wang et al 2016b temperature stress is often expressed as a downward parabolic function where ft 1 occurs at optimal temperature topt i e ft 1 kt t topt 2 dickinson 1984 jacquemin and noilhan 1990 however in a few reported cases of gs modeling ft was greater than 1 with calibrated kt 0 wang et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2016 bai et al 2017 xu et al 2018 which is against the physical meaning of a stress function i e ft 0 1 and related to the dependency between t and d and cross correlations among all response functions as a matter of fact it is found from the published data that this function is not always representative for the ec t relationship e g in zheng and wang 2015 ma et al 2017 zha et al 2017 whilst a sigmoid like shape of the data envelop is fairly common o brien et al 2004 tie et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 yet no study has explored the performance of such a ft in ec modeling so far another problem in jarvis type ec models lies in the formulation of the solar radiation stress function currently the two most commonly used ones are from stewart 1988 and from jacquemin and noilhan 1990 either of which gives zero nighttime transpiration as the stress function fr equals zero when radiation is zero at night although plants are generally expected to close their stomata at night to conserve water when carbon gain is not occurring there is growing evidence for nocturnal leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration in many species oren and pataki 2001 caird et al 2007 piao et al 2011 di et al 2019 which was found mainly driven by nighttime vapor pressure deficit domec et al 2012 and wind speed phillips et al 2010 with future projections of a warming climate temperature increase will inevitably affect the movement of water through plants and lead to higher d and ec rates at night that could potentially alter the global hydrological cycle huntington 2006 therefore the current fr is not adequate to capturing this phenomenon and needs improvement hence this study has two main purposes firstly it aims at revising the temperature function and examining its role in the jarvis type ec model in terms of whether it can be neglected in a model including already a vapor pressure deficit function secondly it aims at extending the model capability of simulating nocturnal transpiration by modifying a solar radiation stress function which will allow robust estimation of diurnal transpiration by the improved jarvis type model this study provides an explicit means of improving diurnal transpiration estimation with the widely used jarvis type transpiration and stomatal conductance model which will essentially improve the quantification of hydrological cycles 2 data and methods 2 1 data we used micrometeorological data and sap flow data collected from sites in different climate zones including mediterranean south australia adelaide boreal oceanic scotland aberdeen and humid continental china changsha a short summary of the site characteristics is given in table 1 more details of the sites can be found in wang et al 2014 2017 and liu et al 2019a accordingly six tree species were involved in this study allocasuarina verticillate eucalyptus leucoxylon at the adelaide site pinus sylvestris at the aberdeen site and osmmanthus fragrans cinnamonum camphora and liquidambar formosana at the changsha site the study therefore conveys phenomena raised from both the coniferous in adelaide and aberdeen sites and broadleaf in changsha sites tree species under different rainfall regimes with contrasting temperature and humidity ranges and seasonality these features give this study a broader context compared to many previous ones and the conclusions herein may be generalizable to other study sites 2 1 1 micrometeorological measurements micrometeorological data used in this study include air temperature vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation they were collected by automatic weather stations originally at 15 minute intervals and averaged to hourly values for the analysis the weather stations were installed 2 m above ground in open areas approximately 50 200 and 250 m from the experimental forest stands in changsha weather hawk xp 232 usa adelaide vantage pro2 davis instruments inc usa and aberdeen sites environmental measurement limited north shields uk respectively vapor pressure deficit was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity previous studies suggested soil moisture can be neglected in some cases where trees grow in riparian zones or have deep roots eamus and froend 2006 o grady et al 2006 while in other cases studies also showed success in ec modeling using only atmospheric variables bunce 2000 whitley et al 2013 in addition wang et al 2016b found that a soil water stress function is more important for daily scale ec modeling than hourly therefore this study focused only on the atmospheric controls on sub daily plant water use without soil water stress function in the model 2 1 2 sap flow measurements sap flow was measured at 30 minute intervals using heat pulse velocity sensors hpv from tranzflo nz ltd new zealand green and clothier 1988 at the adelaide and changsha sites respectively and at hourly intervals using the thermal dissipation probes tdp from dynamax inc usa granier 1987 at the aberdeen site details about the sap flow sensors and installation procedures are not given here but can be referred to wang et al 2014 liu et al 2019b and wang et al 2017 both methods are widely used with mature sap flow calculation algorithms and they have their own pros and cons steppe et al 2010 for example hpv can provide a radial profile of sap flux from the outer to inner wood with multiple point measurements but requires strict alignments of thermocouples in the sensor probes and auxiliary measurements of wood properties for wound corrections heat is tracked at both above and below the heater probe while tdp has only two probes which is easier for installation and it uses continuous heating rather than heat pulses and heat is only released in the downstream probe however it can only measure sap flux at one depth of the sapwood these differences may lead to uncertainty in whole tree water use estimation but apart from that when putting the data together they allow us to examine the universality of the revised stress functions of environmental variables sap flow sensors were installed at least on the north and south sides of each tree at a height of 1 3 m above ground sap flow rate per unit sapwood area sf in cm3 cm 2h 1 for each species was calculated as the sum of sap flow cm3 h 1 of all sampled trees divided by the sum of sapwood area cm2 of all sample tress sap flow of each sample tree is the product of mean sap flux density from sensors on that tree and the sapwood area of that tree sapwood area was measured using an incremental borer based on the wood translucency this method may not be the most accurate one compared to the coloring method the microscopic assessment method pfautsch et al 2012 or geophysical methods wang et al 2016a but it is the most convenient one and can be applied for all species here due to their wood texture sap flow data were aggregated to hourly from 30 minute intervals for further analysis all meteorological and sap flow data were quality checked to filter out the outliers and only those matched in time were kept at each site for analysis here 2 2 model construction the jarvis type stomata conductance model is given in the form of eq 1 1 g s g max f t f d f r f θ where gmax is the maximum stomatal conductance m s 1 ft fd fr and fθ ranging from 0 to 1 are stress functions of t temperature d vapor pressure deficit r solar radiation and θ soil water content originally leaf temperature was deployed in the model jarvis 1976 and replaced by air temperature later on stewart 1988 due to easier access of the latter data note that the stress function for each influencing factor has various forms in the literature wang et al 2016b liu et al 2019b by analogy of the gs formulation ec has also been linked directly with the environmental variables e g whitley et al 2013 wang et al 2016b this approach avoids the calculations of stomatal and aerodynamic conductance embedded in the penman monteith equation for ec calculation transpiration out of plant leaves is known to have time lags with sap flow at the sub daily scale kume et al 2008 ferraz et al 2015 due to processes like trunk water storage discharge and refilling phillips et al 2009 carrasco et al 2015 wang et al 2019 here we used sap flow rate per unit sapwood area sf cm3 cm 2h 1 to investigate the atmospheric controls using eq 2 where sfm is prescribe as the observed maximum value for each tree species during the study periods stress function of vapor pressure deficit fd was established in eq 3 based on a previous studies zheng and wang 2015 wang et al 2016b 2 sf s f m f t f d f r 3 f d e k d d k d 2 d 4 f t e k t t k t 2 t k t 5 f r r m k r r m r k r k r r k r after reviewing the literature on temperature controls on sap flow we suggested a new ft in eq 4 to replace the parabolic function ft 1 kt t topt 2 a comparison of the two ft for fitting sap flow data of three species from three sites respectively is given in fig 1 data from these three species were presented because the sf t relationship differs more obviously from a parabola than the other species refer to fig 2 in the results over the entire temperature range during the measurement period a sigmoid like curve derived from eq 4 appears to be better than a parabola especially at low temperatures where the parabolic function tends to obviously underestimate sap flow therefore for further model runs and discussion of results we focused solely on this sigmoid type temperature function to avoid zero flow values at r 0 induced by the model configuration whilst the actual nighttime sap flow exists we modified the radiation function whitley et al 2009 by adding an additional term kr kr in the numerator of the righthand side of eq 5 where kr ranges from 0 to 1 it is worth mentioning that sometimes the data noise can obscure the true nighttime flow because the latter is usually expected in a small magnitude but with well calibrated sensors this should not be a big problem and the data in this study show no apparent noise effect see results section in the radiation stress function rm w m 2 is the maximum radiation measured at each site during the study periods in eqs 3 5 k t kt kd kd and kr kr are fitting parameters that were estimated using the dream optimization method based on markov chain monte carlo simulations vrugt et al 2009 to test the effect of t in the jarvis type model in eq 2 we ran the model with and without ft and compared the simulation results in the same manner modeling results were compared before and after adding kr kr for nighttime sap flow simulations model performances were examined using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and slope of linear regression between observations and simulations 3 results 3 1 atmospheric controls on sap flow we divided sf by the maximum value for each species and plotted the normalized sf against temperature vapor pressure deficit and radiation in fig 2 to compare the shapes of the responses it shows that the temperature controls on sf differed clearly among species in terms of the shapes of scatterplots for the species liquidambar formosana and cinnamomum camphora the sf t relationship followed somewhat the parabolic function though most of the data presented did not fit the decreasing part of a parabolic curve after sf reached its maxima for the other species sap flow increased slowly i e with smaller slopes with increasing t and then increased rapidly when t is higher until sf reached its peak this demonstrates that a parabolic function is perhaps not the best to describe the relationship particularly at the low end of t and sf the response of sf to d and r shared a similar pattern across species and climates that is sf increased with d and r until d and r reached a certain threshold after which sf either stayed around the maximum value for r or decreased for d the threshold values for d varied across species but were generally below 2 kpa 3 2 the role of temperature stress function in the model to test the role of a temperature function in the development of a jarvis type model simulation results from models with and without ft were compared in fig 3 the model with a ft generally led to better simulations than the one without ft for most species with slightly higher r2 and lower rmse despite the effect of ft on sf simulations the models generally performed better for the three species in subtropical china the lower three plots in fig 3 which happened to be the hottest during the study period with a mean temperature of 28 3 5 9 26 5 3 7 and 25 0 4 8 for osmmanthus fragrans liquidambar formosana and cinnamomum camphora sites respectively model performance was the worst for allocasuarina verticillate in adelaide mean temperature of 21 2 6 1 followed by pinus sylvestris in aberdeen mean temperature of 11 3 3 6 from another angle the model performance was overall better for the four broadleaf tree species than the two coniferous tree species the difference in model performance among sites and species could be partly attributed to the sap flow measurement methods or physiology of trees of different functional types however it is difficult to evaluate this without concurrent measurements by different methods on the same trees or extended measurements on the same leaf type species it is well known that vapor pressure deficit is exponentially linked with temperature as shown in fig 4 the slope of the d t relationship increases as t increases i e the higher the temperature the more sensitive of vapor pressure deficit to temperature this infers that around midday a slight increase in t will cause a strong response of evaporative demand driven by d which can then result in temporary stomata closure to conserve water under atmospheric stress and this effect would be more evident in a warmer environment therefore use of ft and fd both ranging from 0 to 1 at the same time in the model would presumably lower the simulated daily peaks of sap flux in comparison with using fd alone in the model to test this hypothesis we checked the time series results of the simulations with and without ft in comparison with measurements with a focus particularly around the middays it is true that the daily sf peaks were overestimated without ft in the model while measurements were fitted better with both ft and fd included two selected examples were given in fig 5 to show this effect visually cinnamomum camphora is among the species for which the model performed best and eucalyptus leucoxylon is among the species for which the model performed relatively worse fig 3 generally both the models with ft included and excluded reproduced well the hourly sap flow fluctuations however the model excluding ft overestimated the peaks of sf around midday compared to the model including ft the deviation of simulations from measurements around midday supportss the hypothesis above 3 3 nocturnal sap flow simulation based on the diurnal sap flow data we can assume that nighttime sap flow existed from at least a few species although not in a large amount when ignoring the data noise effect if any thus the assumption of no flow during the night would result in an underestimation of the daily transpiration simulations with the modified and original fr were run for all six species and fig 6 gives two examples for liquidambar formosana and cinnamomum camphora these two species have contrast in the ratio of nighttime flow to daily totals i e the ratio was small for cinnamomum camphora and large for liquidambar formosana it shows that without the added term kr kr in the numerator of eq 5 the model failed to reproduce sap flow when solar radiation was zero on the contrary the model can fit better the measurements with the modified fr particularly at night parallel measurements with different techniques were not carried out on the trees in this study for a strong proof of nocturnal sap flow existence nevertheless the modified model performed better to capture the diurnal sap flow fluctuations especially the low flows simulation results for all species with the models using the modified fr and the original fr are summarized in table 2 it shows that for all species the model using the modified fr outperformed the one using the original fr reflected by higher r2 and lower rmse by the former it is noticed that although the model performance was better when the modified fr was in use the improvement was not significant regarding the limited improvements in r2 and rmse this can be attributed to the relatively small proportion of nighttime sap flow in the daily totals to be precise setting r 0 as the energy threshold to divide day and night the average nocturnal sap flow was calculated to account for 11 2 6 0 28 1 13 4 11 4 9 6 6 8 5 2 29 1 8 2 and 13 1 7 0 of total sap flow for a verticillate p sylvestris e leucoxylon o fragrans l formosana and c camphora respectively it should be stressed that although the improvement seems relatively small in amount at the hourly time step it is important for long term sap flow or transpiration estimations because of the propagation of sub daily discrepancies we summed up the hourly data to obtain daily sap flow and calculated the regression slopes between simulations and observations to examine the cumulative effects as depicted in fig 7 daily sap flow was mostly more underestimated compared to hourly simulations indicated by longer positive bars in the figure which can reflect the cumulative underestimation from hourly to daily scale as to whether including a ft will improve simulation accuracy the comparisons did not show consistent patterns across species less underestimation of daily sf was only observed for eucalyptus leucoxylon and liquidambar formosana with model excluding ft than including ft the opposite existed for osmmanthus fragrans difference was indistinguishable for the rest of the species 4 discussion 4 1 responses of sap flow to atmospheric conditions we explored the atmospheric controls on sap flow across 6 species in 3 climate zones and found difference and similarity in sap flow responses sap flow increased with increasing radiation r until a threshold was reached i e light saturation after which sap flow rate kept relatively constant this pattern occurred in response to vapor pressure deficit d as well except that the sap flow rate decreased after the threshold of d was reached for some species which could be a result of partial stomata closure under high evaporative demand buckley 2019 oren et al 1999 the d threshold has been reported to be 1 5 kpa zheng and wang 2015 li et al 2016 and in this study it was generally 2 0 kpa for all species the response of sap flow to d is complex because intuitively an increase in d will increase the evaporative demand which will in turn result in a tendency for plants to meet the demand by increasing transpiration on the other hand in response to increasing d plants are capable of declining transpiration by partially closing their stomata which of these processes is prevailing depends on species and environments massmann et al 2018 examined this on different functional types of vegetation worldwide and concluded that transpiration more frequently decreases than increases with rising d for most plant types and environments while transpiration from plants that prioritize production over water conservation like crops is more likely to be atmospheric demand driven in our study the decreasing sap flow with a rising d above the threshold was observed particularly for two species allocasuarina verticillate eucalyptus leucoxylon located in a mediterranean area where the physiological controls on transpiration seemed prevailing over environmental controls at high evaporative demand the controlling role may switch across seasons tie et al 2017 but was not observed in this study due to the limited length of study periods regarding the temperature t controls on sap flow this study showed two distinct response patterns for the 6 species for example for pinus sylvestris eucalyptus leucoxylon and osmmanthus fragrans the response apparently followed a sigmoid like curve i e the initial sap flow rate increased slowly and then fast as t increased from low values to the optimal range moore et al 2003 this pattern of environmental controls on transpiration has also been reported by o brien et al 2004 using a so called evaporative demand index representing the atmospheric conditions for the other species the change in sap flow with t can be roughly described by the commonly used parabolic function without introducing enhanced errors though the decreasing part of the parabola curve after the maximum js was not necessarily always shown this calls for a better parameterization of t stress on sap flow especially for vegetation and ecosystems whose water use is primarily temperature driven the function applied in this study fitted the data better than the parabolic function especially at the lower t range fig 1 however comparison of models using this ft resulted in limited improvements in hourly sap flow simulations for example for species shown in fig 1 the r2 was just 0 02 0 05 higher than models using a parabolic function this can be attributable to two reasons firstly the major difference of sf t relationship existed at the lower sf range figs 1 2 likely during the night when t was low secondly the effects of different t functions could be compensated by other predicting variables like d for they were correlated leuning 1995 whitehead 1998 nonetheless the application of eq 4 generated improved results as it fitted the data better than a parabolic function this improvement is regarded significant when considering for long term water balance studies based on sub daily simulations this is supported by the results that the cumulative underestimation with the parabolic function was enlarged even just from hourly to daily scales in addition behind the diverse model performances among sites and species there is a general feature that model worked better for the broadleaf trees than the needleleaf trees as shown in fig 3 and table 2 this can be a coincidence or a fact however with the differences also in sap flow sensors and climate types it is barely possible to evaluate this here but will be worth further tests for extended vegetation functional types 4 2 defects of the jarvis type model for transpiration estimation the jarvis type model was developed more than 40 years ago and regularly applied for stomatal conductance or transpiration estimation in a wide range of species and climates and even incorporated in land surface models for water fluxes simulations e g cai et al 2016 previous studies claimed good model performances for land surface hydrological processes however the land surface models have many parameters to calibrate usually against streamflow and this can weaken the role of parameterization of the jarvis type transpiration model therefore it is still worth looking at the jarvis scheme individually for possible improvement firstly the stress functions have various forms and are highly species dependent for instance the aforementioned linear and exponential functions for d the parabolic linear and sigmoid functions for t dickinson 1984 stewart 1988 zheng and wang 2015 the existence of these diverse formulations hinders unifying the parameterization of environmental controls across species for a wider application in land surface models in this sense the way of integrating environmental effects like in o brien et al 2004 is perhaps a plausible means to push forward the parameterization scheme secondly many studies using the jarvis scheme defined the emax theoretically as the maximum transpiration rate for a certain species as a parameter in the model and the estimated parameter values were often smaller than the actual observed maximum transpiration e g wang et al 2014 liu et al 2019a this phenomenon is apparently contradictory to the meaning of emax alternatively emax is prescribed by the observed maximum transpiration rate but this will likely fail to work beyond the measurement period because the observed maximum transpiration rate can change intra and inter annually wang et al 2016b additionally it was noticed that even with the prescribed emax the model usually could not simulate the full range of ec or in this study sf macfarlane et al 2004 liu et al 2019a because the stress functions ft fd fr can hardly equal to 1 at the same time one possible solution to this problem would be using a potential evapotranspiration rate to replace emax in the model structure niu et al 2011 cai et al 2016 potential et can be calculated from the penman monteith equation with readily available meteorological measurements allen et al 1998 allowing for a dynamic potential rate to be deducted for actual ec estimations at every time step thirdly most of the current jarvis type models are not capable of simulating nocturnal transpiration en en is evident for many species dawson et al 2007 howard et al 2009 although zero flow at night is often assumed because of the closure of leaf stomata in the absence of sunlight the en occurrences can be related to biotic and abiotic factors phillips et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 among which nighttime d is found to be the responsible factor phillips et al 2010 domec et al 2012 it is reported that en can be typically 5 15 of daily total ec and sometimes can be up to 30 or more feild and holbrook 2000 bucci et al 2005 caird et al 2007 scholz et al 2007 and the ratio varies with phenophases because of different water use strategies howard and donovan 2006 zhao et al 2019 en is also linked to plant hydraulic redistribution and internal water storage change howard et al 2009 domec et al 2012 therefore accounting for the nocturnal transpiration in models is crucial for understanding the water flow and storage change in the soil plant atmosphere continuum for accurate water balance calculations the current approach of quantifying nocturnal ec is primarily based on gas exchange measurements of individual leaves whole plant sap flow and lysimeters unfortunately there are few models available to simulate the nocturnal transpiration buckley et al 2012 empirical modification of the radiation function in this work can serve as a modest spur to induce more advanced studies towards improvement of the ec models 5 conclusions the well known jarvis type transpiration model was tested for temperature effect and improved for nocturnal flow simulation across species and climates results show convergent and divergent responses of sap flow to radiation vapor pressure deficit and temperature the divergence can be induced by plant physiology i e species dependent outweighing environmental factors during the study periods for at least two species in the mediterranean site but can also be related to vegetation functional types a new temperature stress function ft was proposed for fitting a full range of sap flow and its role in sap flow simulation was rigorously examined the results show that inclusion of a ft in the model can fit well the hourly sap flow while the model excluding a ft tended to overestimate the daily peaks this infers that the influence of ft in the jarvis type model can propagate from hourly to daily and longer time scales for plant water use estimation the jarvis type model was further modified by adding a simple term into the original radiation function for effective nocturnal sap flow simulations which would increase the simulation accuracy although the nighttime flow is only a small proportion of the daily totals the overall improvements seem not relatively small at hourly steps but can be significant for long term water balance studies and the modified model covers the full range of sap flow rates that most previous models are not capable of the findings based on those species across sites may be more widely applicable but this transferability needs more rigorous testing with similar datasets credit authorship

5420,since professor paul g jarvis proposed a scheme in 1976 that relates stomatal conductance with environmental variables there have been numerous studies exploring the relationships for estimating transpiration ec vapor pressure deficit d and solar radiation r are dominant environmental factors influencing ec whilst air temperature t is deemed important but often neglected in model applications since d and t are exponentially correlated thus it is uncertain whether to construct the jarvis type ec models with both t and d included will improve model performance meanwhile it is worth mentioning that most jarvis type models cannot simulate nocturnal sap flow which has been observed across a wide range of species and climates therefore this study was firstly aimed at developing a generalized temperature stress function and testing its role in the jarvis type model and further improving the model by modifying a widely used radiation function for nocturnal sap flow simulations the results show that inclusion of a t stress function for hourly sap flow simulations can avoid overestimation of daily peaks and the modified jarvis type model was able to capture the nocturnal sap flow these improvements revive the model for ecohydrological applications in a future climate where enhanced temperature effects and increasing nocturnal transpiration resulting from rising nighttime vapor pressure deficits are likely keywords transpiration nocturnal sap flow environmental changes stomatal conductance jarvis type model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et returns approximately 65 75 of the total annual precipitation p to the atmosphere on a continental basis trenberth et al 2007 jung et al 2010 over land areas in temperate zones the et p ratio is around 67 and in arid regions it can be up to 90 or more wilcox et al 2006 wmo 2008 glenn et al 2015 transpiration ec from plants contributes over half of the total terrestrial et coenders gerrits et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 wei et al 2017 equivalent to more than one third of the total annual precipitation therefore et and its component ec play important roles in the terrestrial hydrological cycle dolman and de jeu 2010 and accurate quantification of et fluxes is important for land surface water and energy balance to aid water and environment management ec is regulated by leaf stomata that sense the changes in water potential gradients along the soil plant atmosphere continuum whitehead 1998 verhoef and egea 2014 many field studies have shown that variability in diurnal measurements of stomatal conductance gs is controlled by environmental variables including atmospheric conditions soil water supply and nutrients mitchell et al 2009 eller et al 2016 to simulate transpiration through mathematical realization of the stomata responses to environmental changes jarvis 1976 proposed a gs model that has been extended or modified by many others thereafter stewart 1988 tuzet et al 2003 wang et al 2016b among the environmental variables vapor pressure deficit d and solar radiation r are mostly deemed as the primary controlling atmospheric variables across different biomes and climates arneth et al 1996 bovard et al 2005 wang et al 2017 however the mechanism of how stomata regulate transpiration under environmental constraints is more complex than it seems monteith 1995 explored data from 52 sets of measurements on 16 species collected in many study sites and concluded a general linear dependence of gs on ec rate this implies that stomata responded to water loss from the leaf not to air vapor pressure deficit or leaf to air vapor pressure deficit the finding was consistent with mott and parkhurst 1991 and recently reviewed and confirmed by buckley 2019 meanwhile in some cases ec reached a maximum rate above which any further increase in d resulted in decreases in gs and ec due to partial stomata closure to conserve water ma et al 2017 from these studies it can be concluded that plant transpiration is constrained by both physiological and environmental factors which of the factors is dominant seems highly species dependent temperature t is another atmospheric factor influencing plant water use in addition to d and r the optimal temperature for transpiration is commonly thought between 20 c and 30 c as the stomatal aperture is generally widest in this temperature range moore et al 2003 temperature also influences water potential which determines the hydraulic gradient driving water flow in the soil plant atmosphere continuum philip 1966 carrasco et al 2015 and the relation between temperature and water potential can be mathematically formulated hopkins 1999 despite the importance of t its influence on ec is not always parameterized in the jarvis type ec models for example t was neglected in whitley et al 2009 lhomme et al 1998 and the references listed therein however the reason why it was neglected was rarely explicitly clarified one potential argument could be that d is a function of t and relative humidity thus using d in an ec model can have already included the effect of t wang et al 2016b temperature stress is often expressed as a downward parabolic function where ft 1 occurs at optimal temperature topt i e ft 1 kt t topt 2 dickinson 1984 jacquemin and noilhan 1990 however in a few reported cases of gs modeling ft was greater than 1 with calibrated kt 0 wang et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2016 bai et al 2017 xu et al 2018 which is against the physical meaning of a stress function i e ft 0 1 and related to the dependency between t and d and cross correlations among all response functions as a matter of fact it is found from the published data that this function is not always representative for the ec t relationship e g in zheng and wang 2015 ma et al 2017 zha et al 2017 whilst a sigmoid like shape of the data envelop is fairly common o brien et al 2004 tie et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 yet no study has explored the performance of such a ft in ec modeling so far another problem in jarvis type ec models lies in the formulation of the solar radiation stress function currently the two most commonly used ones are from stewart 1988 and from jacquemin and noilhan 1990 either of which gives zero nighttime transpiration as the stress function fr equals zero when radiation is zero at night although plants are generally expected to close their stomata at night to conserve water when carbon gain is not occurring there is growing evidence for nocturnal leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration in many species oren and pataki 2001 caird et al 2007 piao et al 2011 di et al 2019 which was found mainly driven by nighttime vapor pressure deficit domec et al 2012 and wind speed phillips et al 2010 with future projections of a warming climate temperature increase will inevitably affect the movement of water through plants and lead to higher d and ec rates at night that could potentially alter the global hydrological cycle huntington 2006 therefore the current fr is not adequate to capturing this phenomenon and needs improvement hence this study has two main purposes firstly it aims at revising the temperature function and examining its role in the jarvis type ec model in terms of whether it can be neglected in a model including already a vapor pressure deficit function secondly it aims at extending the model capability of simulating nocturnal transpiration by modifying a solar radiation stress function which will allow robust estimation of diurnal transpiration by the improved jarvis type model this study provides an explicit means of improving diurnal transpiration estimation with the widely used jarvis type transpiration and stomatal conductance model which will essentially improve the quantification of hydrological cycles 2 data and methods 2 1 data we used micrometeorological data and sap flow data collected from sites in different climate zones including mediterranean south australia adelaide boreal oceanic scotland aberdeen and humid continental china changsha a short summary of the site characteristics is given in table 1 more details of the sites can be found in wang et al 2014 2017 and liu et al 2019a accordingly six tree species were involved in this study allocasuarina verticillate eucalyptus leucoxylon at the adelaide site pinus sylvestris at the aberdeen site and osmmanthus fragrans cinnamonum camphora and liquidambar formosana at the changsha site the study therefore conveys phenomena raised from both the coniferous in adelaide and aberdeen sites and broadleaf in changsha sites tree species under different rainfall regimes with contrasting temperature and humidity ranges and seasonality these features give this study a broader context compared to many previous ones and the conclusions herein may be generalizable to other study sites 2 1 1 micrometeorological measurements micrometeorological data used in this study include air temperature vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation they were collected by automatic weather stations originally at 15 minute intervals and averaged to hourly values for the analysis the weather stations were installed 2 m above ground in open areas approximately 50 200 and 250 m from the experimental forest stands in changsha weather hawk xp 232 usa adelaide vantage pro2 davis instruments inc usa and aberdeen sites environmental measurement limited north shields uk respectively vapor pressure deficit was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity previous studies suggested soil moisture can be neglected in some cases where trees grow in riparian zones or have deep roots eamus and froend 2006 o grady et al 2006 while in other cases studies also showed success in ec modeling using only atmospheric variables bunce 2000 whitley et al 2013 in addition wang et al 2016b found that a soil water stress function is more important for daily scale ec modeling than hourly therefore this study focused only on the atmospheric controls on sub daily plant water use without soil water stress function in the model 2 1 2 sap flow measurements sap flow was measured at 30 minute intervals using heat pulse velocity sensors hpv from tranzflo nz ltd new zealand green and clothier 1988 at the adelaide and changsha sites respectively and at hourly intervals using the thermal dissipation probes tdp from dynamax inc usa granier 1987 at the aberdeen site details about the sap flow sensors and installation procedures are not given here but can be referred to wang et al 2014 liu et al 2019b and wang et al 2017 both methods are widely used with mature sap flow calculation algorithms and they have their own pros and cons steppe et al 2010 for example hpv can provide a radial profile of sap flux from the outer to inner wood with multiple point measurements but requires strict alignments of thermocouples in the sensor probes and auxiliary measurements of wood properties for wound corrections heat is tracked at both above and below the heater probe while tdp has only two probes which is easier for installation and it uses continuous heating rather than heat pulses and heat is only released in the downstream probe however it can only measure sap flux at one depth of the sapwood these differences may lead to uncertainty in whole tree water use estimation but apart from that when putting the data together they allow us to examine the universality of the revised stress functions of environmental variables sap flow sensors were installed at least on the north and south sides of each tree at a height of 1 3 m above ground sap flow rate per unit sapwood area sf in cm3 cm 2h 1 for each species was calculated as the sum of sap flow cm3 h 1 of all sampled trees divided by the sum of sapwood area cm2 of all sample tress sap flow of each sample tree is the product of mean sap flux density from sensors on that tree and the sapwood area of that tree sapwood area was measured using an incremental borer based on the wood translucency this method may not be the most accurate one compared to the coloring method the microscopic assessment method pfautsch et al 2012 or geophysical methods wang et al 2016a but it is the most convenient one and can be applied for all species here due to their wood texture sap flow data were aggregated to hourly from 30 minute intervals for further analysis all meteorological and sap flow data were quality checked to filter out the outliers and only those matched in time were kept at each site for analysis here 2 2 model construction the jarvis type stomata conductance model is given in the form of eq 1 1 g s g max f t f d f r f θ where gmax is the maximum stomatal conductance m s 1 ft fd fr and fθ ranging from 0 to 1 are stress functions of t temperature d vapor pressure deficit r solar radiation and θ soil water content originally leaf temperature was deployed in the model jarvis 1976 and replaced by air temperature later on stewart 1988 due to easier access of the latter data note that the stress function for each influencing factor has various forms in the literature wang et al 2016b liu et al 2019b by analogy of the gs formulation ec has also been linked directly with the environmental variables e g whitley et al 2013 wang et al 2016b this approach avoids the calculations of stomatal and aerodynamic conductance embedded in the penman monteith equation for ec calculation transpiration out of plant leaves is known to have time lags with sap flow at the sub daily scale kume et al 2008 ferraz et al 2015 due to processes like trunk water storage discharge and refilling phillips et al 2009 carrasco et al 2015 wang et al 2019 here we used sap flow rate per unit sapwood area sf cm3 cm 2h 1 to investigate the atmospheric controls using eq 2 where sfm is prescribe as the observed maximum value for each tree species during the study periods stress function of vapor pressure deficit fd was established in eq 3 based on a previous studies zheng and wang 2015 wang et al 2016b 2 sf s f m f t f d f r 3 f d e k d d k d 2 d 4 f t e k t t k t 2 t k t 5 f r r m k r r m r k r k r r k r after reviewing the literature on temperature controls on sap flow we suggested a new ft in eq 4 to replace the parabolic function ft 1 kt t topt 2 a comparison of the two ft for fitting sap flow data of three species from three sites respectively is given in fig 1 data from these three species were presented because the sf t relationship differs more obviously from a parabola than the other species refer to fig 2 in the results over the entire temperature range during the measurement period a sigmoid like curve derived from eq 4 appears to be better than a parabola especially at low temperatures where the parabolic function tends to obviously underestimate sap flow therefore for further model runs and discussion of results we focused solely on this sigmoid type temperature function to avoid zero flow values at r 0 induced by the model configuration whilst the actual nighttime sap flow exists we modified the radiation function whitley et al 2009 by adding an additional term kr kr in the numerator of the righthand side of eq 5 where kr ranges from 0 to 1 it is worth mentioning that sometimes the data noise can obscure the true nighttime flow because the latter is usually expected in a small magnitude but with well calibrated sensors this should not be a big problem and the data in this study show no apparent noise effect see results section in the radiation stress function rm w m 2 is the maximum radiation measured at each site during the study periods in eqs 3 5 k t kt kd kd and kr kr are fitting parameters that were estimated using the dream optimization method based on markov chain monte carlo simulations vrugt et al 2009 to test the effect of t in the jarvis type model in eq 2 we ran the model with and without ft and compared the simulation results in the same manner modeling results were compared before and after adding kr kr for nighttime sap flow simulations model performances were examined using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and slope of linear regression between observations and simulations 3 results 3 1 atmospheric controls on sap flow we divided sf by the maximum value for each species and plotted the normalized sf against temperature vapor pressure deficit and radiation in fig 2 to compare the shapes of the responses it shows that the temperature controls on sf differed clearly among species in terms of the shapes of scatterplots for the species liquidambar formosana and cinnamomum camphora the sf t relationship followed somewhat the parabolic function though most of the data presented did not fit the decreasing part of a parabolic curve after sf reached its maxima for the other species sap flow increased slowly i e with smaller slopes with increasing t and then increased rapidly when t is higher until sf reached its peak this demonstrates that a parabolic function is perhaps not the best to describe the relationship particularly at the low end of t and sf the response of sf to d and r shared a similar pattern across species and climates that is sf increased with d and r until d and r reached a certain threshold after which sf either stayed around the maximum value for r or decreased for d the threshold values for d varied across species but were generally below 2 kpa 3 2 the role of temperature stress function in the model to test the role of a temperature function in the development of a jarvis type model simulation results from models with and without ft were compared in fig 3 the model with a ft generally led to better simulations than the one without ft for most species with slightly higher r2 and lower rmse despite the effect of ft on sf simulations the models generally performed better for the three species in subtropical china the lower three plots in fig 3 which happened to be the hottest during the study period with a mean temperature of 28 3 5 9 26 5 3 7 and 25 0 4 8 for osmmanthus fragrans liquidambar formosana and cinnamomum camphora sites respectively model performance was the worst for allocasuarina verticillate in adelaide mean temperature of 21 2 6 1 followed by pinus sylvestris in aberdeen mean temperature of 11 3 3 6 from another angle the model performance was overall better for the four broadleaf tree species than the two coniferous tree species the difference in model performance among sites and species could be partly attributed to the sap flow measurement methods or physiology of trees of different functional types however it is difficult to evaluate this without concurrent measurements by different methods on the same trees or extended measurements on the same leaf type species it is well known that vapor pressure deficit is exponentially linked with temperature as shown in fig 4 the slope of the d t relationship increases as t increases i e the higher the temperature the more sensitive of vapor pressure deficit to temperature this infers that around midday a slight increase in t will cause a strong response of evaporative demand driven by d which can then result in temporary stomata closure to conserve water under atmospheric stress and this effect would be more evident in a warmer environment therefore use of ft and fd both ranging from 0 to 1 at the same time in the model would presumably lower the simulated daily peaks of sap flux in comparison with using fd alone in the model to test this hypothesis we checked the time series results of the simulations with and without ft in comparison with measurements with a focus particularly around the middays it is true that the daily sf peaks were overestimated without ft in the model while measurements were fitted better with both ft and fd included two selected examples were given in fig 5 to show this effect visually cinnamomum camphora is among the species for which the model performed best and eucalyptus leucoxylon is among the species for which the model performed relatively worse fig 3 generally both the models with ft included and excluded reproduced well the hourly sap flow fluctuations however the model excluding ft overestimated the peaks of sf around midday compared to the model including ft the deviation of simulations from measurements around midday supportss the hypothesis above 3 3 nocturnal sap flow simulation based on the diurnal sap flow data we can assume that nighttime sap flow existed from at least a few species although not in a large amount when ignoring the data noise effect if any thus the assumption of no flow during the night would result in an underestimation of the daily transpiration simulations with the modified and original fr were run for all six species and fig 6 gives two examples for liquidambar formosana and cinnamomum camphora these two species have contrast in the ratio of nighttime flow to daily totals i e the ratio was small for cinnamomum camphora and large for liquidambar formosana it shows that without the added term kr kr in the numerator of eq 5 the model failed to reproduce sap flow when solar radiation was zero on the contrary the model can fit better the measurements with the modified fr particularly at night parallel measurements with different techniques were not carried out on the trees in this study for a strong proof of nocturnal sap flow existence nevertheless the modified model performed better to capture the diurnal sap flow fluctuations especially the low flows simulation results for all species with the models using the modified fr and the original fr are summarized in table 2 it shows that for all species the model using the modified fr outperformed the one using the original fr reflected by higher r2 and lower rmse by the former it is noticed that although the model performance was better when the modified fr was in use the improvement was not significant regarding the limited improvements in r2 and rmse this can be attributed to the relatively small proportion of nighttime sap flow in the daily totals to be precise setting r 0 as the energy threshold to divide day and night the average nocturnal sap flow was calculated to account for 11 2 6 0 28 1 13 4 11 4 9 6 6 8 5 2 29 1 8 2 and 13 1 7 0 of total sap flow for a verticillate p sylvestris e leucoxylon o fragrans l formosana and c camphora respectively it should be stressed that although the improvement seems relatively small in amount at the hourly time step it is important for long term sap flow or transpiration estimations because of the propagation of sub daily discrepancies we summed up the hourly data to obtain daily sap flow and calculated the regression slopes between simulations and observations to examine the cumulative effects as depicted in fig 7 daily sap flow was mostly more underestimated compared to hourly simulations indicated by longer positive bars in the figure which can reflect the cumulative underestimation from hourly to daily scale as to whether including a ft will improve simulation accuracy the comparisons did not show consistent patterns across species less underestimation of daily sf was only observed for eucalyptus leucoxylon and liquidambar formosana with model excluding ft than including ft the opposite existed for osmmanthus fragrans difference was indistinguishable for the rest of the species 4 discussion 4 1 responses of sap flow to atmospheric conditions we explored the atmospheric controls on sap flow across 6 species in 3 climate zones and found difference and similarity in sap flow responses sap flow increased with increasing radiation r until a threshold was reached i e light saturation after which sap flow rate kept relatively constant this pattern occurred in response to vapor pressure deficit d as well except that the sap flow rate decreased after the threshold of d was reached for some species which could be a result of partial stomata closure under high evaporative demand buckley 2019 oren et al 1999 the d threshold has been reported to be 1 5 kpa zheng and wang 2015 li et al 2016 and in this study it was generally 2 0 kpa for all species the response of sap flow to d is complex because intuitively an increase in d will increase the evaporative demand which will in turn result in a tendency for plants to meet the demand by increasing transpiration on the other hand in response to increasing d plants are capable of declining transpiration by partially closing their stomata which of these processes is prevailing depends on species and environments massmann et al 2018 examined this on different functional types of vegetation worldwide and concluded that transpiration more frequently decreases than increases with rising d for most plant types and environments while transpiration from plants that prioritize production over water conservation like crops is more likely to be atmospheric demand driven in our study the decreasing sap flow with a rising d above the threshold was observed particularly for two species allocasuarina verticillate eucalyptus leucoxylon located in a mediterranean area where the physiological controls on transpiration seemed prevailing over environmental controls at high evaporative demand the controlling role may switch across seasons tie et al 2017 but was not observed in this study due to the limited length of study periods regarding the temperature t controls on sap flow this study showed two distinct response patterns for the 6 species for example for pinus sylvestris eucalyptus leucoxylon and osmmanthus fragrans the response apparently followed a sigmoid like curve i e the initial sap flow rate increased slowly and then fast as t increased from low values to the optimal range moore et al 2003 this pattern of environmental controls on transpiration has also been reported by o brien et al 2004 using a so called evaporative demand index representing the atmospheric conditions for the other species the change in sap flow with t can be roughly described by the commonly used parabolic function without introducing enhanced errors though the decreasing part of the parabola curve after the maximum js was not necessarily always shown this calls for a better parameterization of t stress on sap flow especially for vegetation and ecosystems whose water use is primarily temperature driven the function applied in this study fitted the data better than the parabolic function especially at the lower t range fig 1 however comparison of models using this ft resulted in limited improvements in hourly sap flow simulations for example for species shown in fig 1 the r2 was just 0 02 0 05 higher than models using a parabolic function this can be attributable to two reasons firstly the major difference of sf t relationship existed at the lower sf range figs 1 2 likely during the night when t was low secondly the effects of different t functions could be compensated by other predicting variables like d for they were correlated leuning 1995 whitehead 1998 nonetheless the application of eq 4 generated improved results as it fitted the data better than a parabolic function this improvement is regarded significant when considering for long term water balance studies based on sub daily simulations this is supported by the results that the cumulative underestimation with the parabolic function was enlarged even just from hourly to daily scales in addition behind the diverse model performances among sites and species there is a general feature that model worked better for the broadleaf trees than the needleleaf trees as shown in fig 3 and table 2 this can be a coincidence or a fact however with the differences also in sap flow sensors and climate types it is barely possible to evaluate this here but will be worth further tests for extended vegetation functional types 4 2 defects of the jarvis type model for transpiration estimation the jarvis type model was developed more than 40 years ago and regularly applied for stomatal conductance or transpiration estimation in a wide range of species and climates and even incorporated in land surface models for water fluxes simulations e g cai et al 2016 previous studies claimed good model performances for land surface hydrological processes however the land surface models have many parameters to calibrate usually against streamflow and this can weaken the role of parameterization of the jarvis type transpiration model therefore it is still worth looking at the jarvis scheme individually for possible improvement firstly the stress functions have various forms and are highly species dependent for instance the aforementioned linear and exponential functions for d the parabolic linear and sigmoid functions for t dickinson 1984 stewart 1988 zheng and wang 2015 the existence of these diverse formulations hinders unifying the parameterization of environmental controls across species for a wider application in land surface models in this sense the way of integrating environmental effects like in o brien et al 2004 is perhaps a plausible means to push forward the parameterization scheme secondly many studies using the jarvis scheme defined the emax theoretically as the maximum transpiration rate for a certain species as a parameter in the model and the estimated parameter values were often smaller than the actual observed maximum transpiration e g wang et al 2014 liu et al 2019a this phenomenon is apparently contradictory to the meaning of emax alternatively emax is prescribed by the observed maximum transpiration rate but this will likely fail to work beyond the measurement period because the observed maximum transpiration rate can change intra and inter annually wang et al 2016b additionally it was noticed that even with the prescribed emax the model usually could not simulate the full range of ec or in this study sf macfarlane et al 2004 liu et al 2019a because the stress functions ft fd fr can hardly equal to 1 at the same time one possible solution to this problem would be using a potential evapotranspiration rate to replace emax in the model structure niu et al 2011 cai et al 2016 potential et can be calculated from the penman monteith equation with readily available meteorological measurements allen et al 1998 allowing for a dynamic potential rate to be deducted for actual ec estimations at every time step thirdly most of the current jarvis type models are not capable of simulating nocturnal transpiration en en is evident for many species dawson et al 2007 howard et al 2009 although zero flow at night is often assumed because of the closure of leaf stomata in the absence of sunlight the en occurrences can be related to biotic and abiotic factors phillips et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 among which nighttime d is found to be the responsible factor phillips et al 2010 domec et al 2012 it is reported that en can be typically 5 15 of daily total ec and sometimes can be up to 30 or more feild and holbrook 2000 bucci et al 2005 caird et al 2007 scholz et al 2007 and the ratio varies with phenophases because of different water use strategies howard and donovan 2006 zhao et al 2019 en is also linked to plant hydraulic redistribution and internal water storage change howard et al 2009 domec et al 2012 therefore accounting for the nocturnal transpiration in models is crucial for understanding the water flow and storage change in the soil plant atmosphere continuum for accurate water balance calculations the current approach of quantifying nocturnal ec is primarily based on gas exchange measurements of individual leaves whole plant sap flow and lysimeters unfortunately there are few models available to simulate the nocturnal transpiration buckley et al 2012 empirical modification of the radiation function in this work can serve as a modest spur to induce more advanced studies towards improvement of the ec models 5 conclusions the well known jarvis type transpiration model was tested for temperature effect and improved for nocturnal flow simulation across species and climates results show convergent and divergent responses of sap flow to radiation vapor pressure deficit and temperature the divergence can be induced by plant physiology i e species dependent outweighing environmental factors during the study periods for at least two species in the mediterranean site but can also be related to vegetation functional types a new temperature stress function ft was proposed for fitting a full range of sap flow and its role in sap flow simulation was rigorously examined the results show that inclusion of a ft in the model can fit well the hourly sap flow while the model excluding a ft tended to overestimate the daily peaks this infers that the influence of ft in the jarvis type model can propagate from hourly to daily and longer time scales for plant water use estimation the jarvis type model was further modified by adding a simple term into the original radiation function for effective nocturnal sap flow simulations which would increase the simulation accuracy although the nighttime flow is only a small proportion of the daily totals the overall improvements seem not relatively small at hourly steps but can be significant for long term water balance studies and the modified model covers the full range of sap flow rates that most previous models are not capable of the findings based on those species across sites may be more widely applicable but this transferability needs more rigorous testing with similar datasets credit authorship

5421,in semi arid regions groundwater dependent ecosystems rely on stable hydro thermal regimes where refugia have supported aquatic biota for millennia in karst systems springs provide consistent

as a case study the following questions were addressed 1 what are key factors influencing instream temperatures proximal and distal to spring discharge 2 what long term trends exist in riverine thermal regimes upstream and downstream of spring complexes 3 what are the critical thermal and or hydrological regimes that should trigger water management intervention this study presents several unique field and modeling approaches to characterize surface groundwater interactions within an arid karst gde remote watersheds are inherently difficult to monitor let alone assess long term trends or controls we developed novel techniques to predict instream temperatures from hydroclimatic data and then used long term weather forcing data from the nldas land surface models to construct extended 30 year water temperature records using these reconstructed records decadal scale temperature trends were developed for habitat temperature duration thresholds by quantifying the frequency and duration of continuous events above specified temperatures castelli et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was a section of the perennial reach of the semi arid groundwater dependent devils river within the devils river state natural area sna and the nature conservancy tnc dolan falls preserve fig 1 figs s1 s3 in supporting information in val verde county texas the study site focused on the finegan springs complex and the confluence of the devils river and dolan creek 60 km north of the city of del rio this reach is considered an ecologically significant stream segment nominee due to its relatively intact ecosystem and high species diversity el hage and moulton 2001 the uniqueness of the aquatic ecosystem is in large part due to perennial water in a relatively arid climate with average annual precipitation of 50 cm and mean annual temperature of 18 20 c prism 2018 the watershed provides a range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats attributed to its location at the convergence of the chihuahuan desert edwards plateau and southern texas plains ecoregions twpd 2012 the devils river is a major tributary to the rio grande terminating in amistad reservoir which began impounding flows from the rio grande devils and pecos rivers in 1968 fig s7 now it is jointly managed by the united states and mexico through the international boundary and water commission the devils river is 145 km long but only the lower 95 km are perennial primarily due to consistent groundwater inputs from numerous springs green et al 2014 abolt et al 2018 these springs are particularly clear with consistent flow and temperatures providing thermal stability some distance downstream as these spring runs become exposed to ambient air temperatures the thermal stability decreases downstream hubbs 1995 springer and stevens 2009 the perennial reach of the devils river began near juno tx until 1970 when groundwater development for irrigation lowered the regional water table barker and bush 1994 today pecan springs 10 km downstream of juno marks the start of the perennial reach which is now the upper range of the devils river minnow the devils river perhaps the least developed and most scenic river in texas is one of the last strongholds for multiple species of regionally endemic freshwater fishes and mussels the watershed provides a diversity of habitat types supporting numerous aquatic and terrestrial species including several regional endemics classified as threatened or endangered at both the state and federal levels robertson et al 2019a the devils river and its tributary dolan creek are habitat to five texas state threatened aquatic species including the proserpine shiner cyprinella proserpina conchos pupfish cyprinodon eximius rio grande darter etheostoma grahami devils river minnow dionda diaboli and texas hornshell popenaias popeii el hage and moulton 2001 d diaboli also listed as federally threatened has a narrow distribution hubbs and brown 1956 and has faced a number of threats including the 1950 s drought across the midwest and texas the construction of amistad reservoir which eliminated suitable habitat in part of its range and anthropogenic alteration of tributaries in mexico usfws 2005 since inundation in 1968 goodenough spring once one of the very large springs of texas has had a consistent discharge of 2 03 m3 s 1 kamps et al 2009 groundwater discharge from springs at the finegan and blue hole spring complex support important habitat of d diaboli and the heterogeneous structure of riverine fishes kollaus and bonner 2012 development of groundwater that potentially changes spring discharge is a specific threat to this habitat the same is true for texas hornshell a regional endemic that is currently listed as federally endangered and like other unionids is thought to be sensitive to extreme warm water temperatures especially in early life stages land use in the devils river watershed comprises shrub scrub 96 grasslands herbaceous 2 2 deciduous evergreen forest 1 2 and minimally developed land 0 2 fig s5 mrlc 2018 developed land historically included conventional oil and gas production primarily from the lower ellenburger group horizontal wells for hydraulic fracturing have recently expanded to the upper devils river basin and surrounding area fig s6 today the devils river is threatened by large inter basin water transfer projects to arid west texas and by encroaching development of wind energy motivated by the threat of proposed groundwater extraction the primary driving factor of this research was to assess the influence of spring discharge on instream temperatures relative to critical habitats 2 2 hydrology of the devils river watershed the devils river has incised into the edwards plateau creating steep canyons and ephemeral drainages inset into the relatively flat carbonaceous bedrock which gently dips to the southeast unlike the adjacent pecos river watershed the devils river is entirely underlain by low permeability limestone resulting in a nearly synchronous response of its tributaries during extreme rainfall events kochel et al 1982 the underlying karstic edwards trinity aquifer abbott 1975 is present throughout the study area and discharges at springs and seeps into the devils river which maintains base flows during dry seasons the potentiometric surface is a subdued expression of surface topography and water flows from higher elevations on the edwards plateau to amistad reservoir and the rio grande fig s7 within the study area the aquifer comprises two formations of the lower cretaceous edwards group the unconfined segovia and the underlying fort terrett formations recharge in karst terrain such as this occurs primarily through episodic flows in drainage channels such as dolan creek the dry devils river and the upper devils river groundwater flows from north to south along preferential flow paths parallel to the devils river green et al 2014 natural spring discharge occurs as rheocrene or hillslope spring types following the nomenclature of springer and stevens 2009 where drainage channels have eroded down since development of the distal balcones fault system in the early miocene and intersected the water table abbott 1975 in our study area springs discharge at the segovia fort terrett contact where limestone dissolution along this horizon possibly the kirschberg evaporite zone allows preferential groundwater flow to discharge forming the finegan blue hole dolan spring complex which essentially doubles the river discharge downstream 2 3 river stage discharge spring contribution and groundwater levels river stage was measured at locations upstream and downstream of the finegan spring complex fig 1 by installing absolute pressure transducers 9 m range 0 1 full scale rugged troll 100 in situ fort collins co in a mount affixed to the limestone stream bottom stage and temperature were sampled every 15 min river stage was corrected using barometric pressure data section 2 5 recorded on site instantaneous discharge q was periodically measured at both locations using an acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker sontek san diego ca to develop a stage discharge relationship rantz 1982 our rating curve used instantaneous discharge measurements and a 24 hour mean centered around the time of the discharge measurement stage measurement as 1 q p g e n where g is recorded stage height at the gage e is gauge height of effective zero flow p is discharge when g e is 1 and n is the slope of the rating curve for the downstream location e was set to zero for the upstream location graphical methods were used to determine any changes in e by observing a parallel shift in the rating curve the spring complex discharge was calculated as the difference between downstream and upstream discharge groundwater levels were measured at two existing wells using absolute pressure loggers 11 m range 0

high plateau 120 m above the channel and 5 km east of dolan creek groundwater levels were sampled at 1 hour intervals 2 4 instream water temperatures tw water temperatures tw and specific conductance were measured in the orifice of three springs fig 1 finegan blue hole and rock art with an accuracy of 0 1 c and 5 µs cm 1 respectively u24 onset corp bourne ma tw was measured along two lateral and two longitudinal transects below the spring complex using tidbit temperature loggers 0 2 c onset corp bourne ma both lateral transects had five sensors housed in a protective vinyl cap affixed with a concrete anchor to a rock on the bottom of the stream spanning the channel from one bank into the thalweg and to the other side fig 1 1 10 longitudinal tw measurements were collected down the devils river and from blue hole 14 16 and down dolan creek fig 1 17 20 to the confluence for longitudinal transects loggers were attached to the downstream side of boulders in the stream channel isaak and horan 2013 four fiber optic dts surveys of varying duration 10 20 15 26 h 02 24 16 40 h 9 27 16 14 h and 2 8 17 25 h were conducted when spring and stream temperatures were expected to have the largest separation i e summer and winter for each survey the dts was positioned in the thalweg below the finegan springs complex using two fiber optic cables 400 m upstream and the other 600 m downstream fig 1 the dts n4386b agilent technologies böblingen germany sends discrete laser pulses down a continuous looped 2 km optical fiber brusens temperature 85c mobile 4 6 mm brugg kabel ag switzerland where it scatters and returns to the detector the incidental ramen and brillouin backscattering allow us to estimate stream temperature along the entire length of the cable selker et al 2006 the agilent dts allows a 1 m spatial sampling with 0 1 c resolution double ended dts measurements were collected every 90 s and averaged every 6 minutes at 1 m intervals differential attenuation along the fiber optic cable was directly measured using double ended measurement configuration in the instrument software the dynamic offset of the dts was corrected using controlled water baths with 25 m of cable coiled in each two water baths one ambient and one ice were constantly mixed using an aquarium bubbler during data collection water temperatures in each bath were monitored using platinum resistance thermometers and used to correct raw temperature trace files van de giesen et al 2012 corrected temperature vectors upstream and downstream were concatenated and averaged over the collection period to produce a continuous longitudinal mean and standard deviation of 1 m stream temperatures 2 5 meteorological data we established a weather station fig 1 to monitor air temperature ta and relative humidity hc2s3 rotronic instrument corp hauppauge ny soil temperature ts p107 campbell scientific logan ut at 10 cm depth short wave solar radiation model 8 48 eppley laboratory inc newport ri wind speed and direction model 03002 r m young co traverse city mi and precipitation te525 texas electronics dallas tx a self contained barometric pressure sensor barotroll in situ fort collin co was used for post processing non vented pressure transducers each sensor was sampled every 5 s and averaged every 30 min daily potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using a modified penman equation based on maximum and minimum ta and relative humidity mean wind speed and solar radiation 3 thermal modeling and data analysis 3 1 instream temperature modeling linear correlations between environmental covariates e g ta or ts and tw are used to obtain an empirical model of the climatic influence on instream temperatures mohseni and stefan 1999 the general formulae are 2 t w t a b t a t o r t w t a b t s t where water temperature tw is linearly dependent on either air temperature ta and soil temperature ts c averaged over some specified time interval t least squares linear regression was used to determine the constant a and slope b of this relationship which generally proves to be linear above freezing and below 30 c the slope of this relationship b represents the thermal sensitivity of tw at a given site to either ta or ts kelleher et al 2012 thermal sensitivity tends to be lower when groundwater inputs are higher beaufort et al 2019 for shorter time intervals t 1 day time lags can be incorporated stefan and preudhomme 1993 here eq 2 was used to model each instream location at hourly and daily mean maximum and minimum intervals statistical significance p 0 05 was determined from a parametric student t test and model performance by means of the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse we also developed a more complex multiple linear regressive mlr model that incorporated both the daily mean stage at our lower gage gl and daily mean solar radiation rs 3 t w t c 0 c 1 t a t c 2 t s t c 3 g l c 4 r s where the additive combination of these five parameters c0 to c4 is determined again by least squares regression and gl was only used because its more stable limestone channel lastly a stepwise sw linear regression was developed which iteratively adds and removes predictor variables ta ts gl and rs as the p value of the f statistic either improves or degrades model performance the final model may include interactions products and power functions of these predictors thus the sw model is indicative of our lowest possible rmse that empirically predicts tw given all other measurement predictor variables however it was explicitly trained for the entire study period and is not useful outside of these bounds it is essentially our best achievable fit over our data collection period for comparison to other models 3 2 long term trend analysis as with most field based studies we were only able to monitor environmental data over a relatively short 3 year period jan 2016 dec 2018 sensor failures data loss and other inconsistencies that come with field data collection in remote locations were common however data collection could be supplemented if there were consistent and statistically significant relationships with other long term climate reanalysis products the nldas data archive consists of a primary forcing data set from 1979 to present which is used to drive four independent land surface models lsm over the conterminous united states mitchell et al 2004 the primary forcing data set consists of 11 hourly climatic variables including precipitation ta long and short wave radiation and absolute humidity at 2 m xia et al 2012 these data are gridded at 1 8 12 km spatial resolution and available at http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings the devils river hydrologic unit codes huc for huc8 huc10 and huc12 was used to extract by mask ta and rs from the nldas data and ts from the noah lsm note the huc number is inversely proportional to watershed area fig s8 and a huc8 huc10 and huc12 references 23 7 and 3 nldas cells respectively each cell was averaged into an hourly value then calculated the daily mean max and minimum ta and ts and daily mean rs for each huc size next like the mlr tw ta ts rs model we replaced the observed weather data with nldas ta ts and rs and derived optimal coefficients over the study period finally the mlr was applied to a 30 year nldas record 1988 2018 to model tw at each instream location creating daily time series of mean maximum and minimum tw for trend analysis we assumed that the mlr developed was applicable over the past 30 years and that spring flow spring temperature and vegetation shading etc were relatively consistent this assumption seems reasonable given the pristine conditions within the watershed but it remains intrinsic to our trend analysis for each location the 30 year daily mean maximum and minimum were calculated for each thermal model these data were binned incrementally by day of year doy in intervals i 1 30 days to assess temporal autocorrelation i e verify time independent data once the minimum i was determined i e where autocorrelation is insignificant at a given i lag an annual climatology was calculated by averaging each doy bin over the 30 year record the temperature anomaly tanom was then determined by subtracting this climatology from each predicted tw averaged over i serial correlation was reduced r 0 2 when i 5d fig s9 ljung box q test p 0 05 for lags of 1i 5i and even 10i thus the data were binned weekly i 7 and monthly i 30 the latter is preferred in the climate literature however critical above threshold temperatures are generally less than 30 days section 3 3 so we attempted to preserve enough data to maintain persistent summer extremes while also minimizing statistical issues in the trend analysis in essence the tanom removes covariance and seasonal signal allowing the long term linear trend to be calculated with least squares linear regression and statistical significance p 0 05 from a parametric student t test which assumes the data are normally distributed and the residuals have a zero mean with constant variance however a non parametric mann kendall test was performed which determines the monotonic significance p 0 05 of any trend that may be linear or non linear and makes no assumption about the residuals 3 3 thermal habitat thresholds the thermal tolerance of fishes reflects a combination of biotic and abiotic factors that include acclimation temperature and thermal history chung 2001 the frequency and duration of thermal events was determined from time series analysis by uniform continuous above threshold ucat analysis castelli et al 2012 originally applied to environmental flow conditions under a given threshold capra et al 1995 parasiewicz 2008 ucat analysis essentially counts events over a given temperature threshold computing each event duration and taking its ratio to total length of time series e g see fig s10 these ratios are shown as the cumulative frequency versus the cumulative duration the y axis on a ucat plot indicates event duration while the x axis indicates cumulative time during which an event of that duration or longer occurred we repeated this procedure in 1 c increments for daily maximum tw at the upstream and downstream locations using data between june 1 and september 30 from the 30 year modeled time series mentioned previously inflection or breakpoints between catastrophic and critical threshold days were determined using piece wise linear regression these points demarcate rapid changes in frequency of continuous durations where persistent or rare conditions may affect one generation while catastrophic events are longer duration and can impact multiple generations castelli et al 2012 4 results results are presented first over the 3 year monitoring period from 1 january 2016 to 30 december 2018 and modeled over 30 years 1989 2018 the former is termed the study period and the latter long term similarly we use spring complex as the contribution of spring discharge which includes multiple sources e g finegan and blue hole complexes all of which are bound by the upstream and downstream monitoring locations 4 1 meteorological conditions over the study period maximum daily air temperatures ta exceeded 40 c each year in late summer while minimum ta dropped below freezing most winter months with january 2017 being particularly cold table s1 late summer and early fall tend to have more rainfall often exceeding 100 mm measured annual precipitation totaled 739 mm in 2016 and 560 mm in 2017 the thirty year normal 1981 2010 mean annual precipitation is 517 mm at finegan springs prism 2018 making both years slightly wetter than normal precipitation was generally less than pet demand given the aridity index ai ppt pet of 0 44 in 2016 and 0 34 in 2017 which classifies the devils river observations as semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 however the monthly ai was 1 during four months of the study period october 2015 august 2016 december 2016 and may 2017 4 2 river and spring discharge discharge measurements table 1 above the spring complex upstream ranged from 0 32 to 4 27 m3 s 1 11 to 151 ft3 s 1 while below downstream ranged from 1 09 to 5 56 m3 s 1 38 to 196 ft3 s 1 the residual is spring discharge which ranged from 0 77 to 1 29 m3 s 1 or 71 to 23 of total river discharge the median measured discharges upstream spring and downstream were 1 28 0 99 and 2 31 m3 s 1 respectively relative stages during discharge measurements ranged from 0 50 to 0 64 m at the upstream location producing a discharge rating curve with an rmse of 0 51 m3 s 1 an r2 of 0 88 and two changes in effective gage height fig s11a while stage at the downstream location ranged from 0 40 to 0 54 m producing a rating curve with an rmse of 0 39 m3 s 1 an r2 of 0 95 and no adjustment in effective gage height fig s11b continuous monitoring of stage showed dynamic and short term peaks reaching 1 8 m and quickly returning to 0 4 m fig 2 a downstream discharge was consistently greater than upstream discharge indicating a gaining reach fig 2b from spring inputs fig 2c following rantz 1982 the spring discharge record was constrained to periods when the observed stages were within the bounds of the rating curve and determined the average finegan springs complex contribution was 43 to total river discharge fig 2d flow duration analysis over these periods indicates that median discharges upstream spring complex and downstream were 2 11 1 53 and 2 41 m3 s 1 respectively 4 3 spring groundwater and river temperatures water temperatures tw at discrete springs including finegan spring fs blue hole bh and rock art ra were relatively constant with minimal seasonal fluctuations 0 5 c and deviations that were correlated positively with larger precipitation events in summer and negatively in winter fig 3 a site 16 fig 1 was in a pool just below blue hole and had substantially larger diurnal variability specific conductance not shown at these springs was also relatively constant 500 μs cm 1 and decreased to 200 μs cm 1 following major precipitation events as fresher water entered the catchment the static groundwater elevations of the shallow 440 masl and deep 436 masl wells were 30 m above the river elevation of 404 masl at dolan creek usgs gauge 08449100 this potentiometric difference provided the hydraulic head needed to maintain consistent spring discharge during high discharge events in dolan creek groundwater levels in the shallow well increased rapidly by 10 m the deep well maintained a constant level until the borehole partially collapsed in march 2018 despite the high dynamic range of head in the shallow well tw remained stable at 22 6 c tw in the deep well was 22 9 c fig 3b river tw fig 3c revealed the importance of spring discharge when comparing the difference between downstream and upstream temperatures δt fig 3d downstream tw was nearly 4 c warmer in the winter and up to 3 c cooler in the summer spring discharge which was about half of the downstream discharge and originated from groundwater with a nearly constant tw of 23 c thus providing thermal buffering for this gde 4 4 instream water temperatures instream tw from the longitudinal transect fig s12a spans 2 8 km upstream tw amplitudes were attenuated by spring inputs along the entire length of this transect the lateral upper and lower transects began on the eastern bank spring side and progressed to the far bank the middle positions 7 8 9 and 2 4 reached 23 c in summer with little diurnal variability fig s12b and c in winter stream temperatures were highly correlated to each other and much more dynamic regardless of lateral position the sensors were placed on the streambed under water depths ranging from 0 5 m on or near the banks to 2 m in the thalweg in summer cooler spring waters descended to the thalweg and warmer more dynamic river waters remained near the surface in winter the upstream input was colder and dynamically linked to ta and the warmer spring water essentially floated on top abolt et al 2018 the cumulative distribution functions f x of measured tw at the springs indicate nearly constant temperatures of 23 c fig 4 a while upstream has a wider distribution both laterally with more extreme tw variations on the far bank fig 1 10 than the downstream lateral transect the f x for both ta and ts fig 4d were essentially buffered by inputs from the springs as shown longitudinally in fig 4e finally the short transect down dolan creek ending in the lower devils river fig 1 20 17 had consistently cooler tw upstream fig 4f four dts surveys were conducted under two different thermal regimes warm 20 october 2015 and 28 september 2016 when river water was generally warmer than spring waters 23 c and cold 2 february 2014 and 8 february 2017 when river waters 15 c were cooler than springs we attempted to reposition the dts cable in the thalweg either resting on the limestone or vegetated stream bottom the upstream end distance 400 m extended just below the spring complex ending distance 600 m upstream of bh spring see fig 1 data collection times varied but all were sampled over the course of at least one diurnal cycle with the goal to define spring inputs which should be areas of low variance over a 24 hr period in both warm situations a strikingly low variance was found along the entire 1 km of cable fig 5 a and c regardless of position or time of day the dts temperatures were essential 23 c and equivalent to spring waters conversely during cold surveys fig 5b and d dts temperatures were cooler upstream fiber section 200 400 m then warmed to 17 c below finegan and blue hole but the variance of 3 c similarly in 2017 s cold survey fig 5d a warming downstream 100 m was observed with cooler temperatures upstream and high variance along the entire cable length during our final cold survey thermal infrared temperature tir data was collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle abolt et al 2018 tir captured the skin temperature of the water clearly cooler upstream river water mixed with two warmer spring inputs downstream the dts distance of 400 m upstream is in these cooler river waters the warmer spring water inputs essentially float atop the river water with only modest mixing considering that the dts thalweg temperatures show high diurnal variance i e river water this would imply instream stratification conversely the warm surveys show little diurnal variation implying the spring waters remain in the thalweg and do not fully mix within this reach although it certainly mixes below dolan falls this stratification is notable at the upper transect fig 6 a just below the spring complex when the spring side bottom temperatures fig 1 6 remain constant at 23 c until the first large flood pulse arrives on 11 november 2015 this event mixes water on the stream surface lowering tw below 23 c this surface water temperature signal remains on the river bottom all winter as noted in the 2016 cold dts survey 20160224 fig 5b the first warm survey 20151020 was synchronous with a period when all the instream temperatures converged the lower transect fig 6b is 150 m downstream of the upper transect the bottom tw records are warmer until a modest cold front arrives a few days prior to our second warm survey 20160928 which homogenized tw of the dts measurement period at the lower transect unfortunately the upper transect sensors malfunctioned during this dts survey however it seems plausible that thermal stratification in the devils river is common below the spring complex where laminar flow exists fig s2 until dolan falls fully mixes these waters fig s3 4 5 empirical modeling of instream water temperature and long term trends qualitatively tw has strong seasonality that is overprinted with random diurnal variability mimicking ta in all non spring locations generally tw lagged ta ts also lagged ta correlations with tw were particularly high r 0 8 for both ta and ts but at nearly all locations it was higher with ts using hourly data a lagged correlation matrix was implemented from 24 to 24 h preserving the highest correlation coefficient r and its lag period fig s13 the lag between ta and tw at nearly all instream locations was only 2 3 h and between 0 to 1 lag hours for ts note negative lags indicate earlier arrival at the independent location than the dependent location correlation between instream sensors was particularly high for all locations except for the dolan transect fig 1 17 20 spring locations were excluded here due to low thermal sensitivity b 0 4 the linear relationships between tw and ta has a higher slope b values upstream and much lower slopes typically near zero at spring locations table s2 in general ta explained over 70 of the variability in tw although each location had a unique relationship the relationship tw ts ta rs and gl was used to develop four predictive models of tw based on 1 2 linear regression with either ta or ts 3 multiple linear regression mlr and 4 stepwise sw non linear models for all locations table 2 at hourly time steps averaged over all instream locations the tw ts had a lower rmse 1 2 c and higher r2 0 74 than tw ta which was likely due to the reduced time offset in ts at daily times steps combining ta ts and rs into the mlr model resulted in a mean rmse of 1 c for daily mean and minimum tw the rmse for the daily maximum was slightly over 1 c the addition of downstream river stage gl improved our model reducing the rmse by 0 1 c the sw regression reduced the rmse to 0 63 c and increased r2 of 0 91 for daily mean tw this was essentially the most parameterized model given the 0 5 c accuracy of our temperature sensors uncertainties in the predictions are acceptable but limited to calibration period however if a similar correspondence is found to longer duration measurements e g nldas forcing data we can significantly increase the time duration first each nldas variable was aggregated to huc12 huc10 and huc8 and compared against meteorological observations regardless of aggregation size the nldas ta corresponds well to measured ta fig 7 a the huc12 daily mean ta had an adjusted r2 of 0 96 an rmse of 1 57 c a slope of 0 95 and an intercept of 0 1 c for ts observations were consistently warmer 4 6 c again regardless of huc size fig 7b the daily mean rs fig 7c from nldas was consistently higher 1 6 mj m 2 d 1 however the weather station was located on the valley bottom and likely shaded by the surrounding hills at low sun angles at the ⅛ scale the nldas rs was less affected by topography and may represent the watershed better than the measured data next the predictor variables e g ta ts rs from the weather station data was replaced with nldas aggregated huc12 values and developed a new coefficient for eqs 2 and 3 note river stage at the lower gage gl was not available over the long term so it was omitted hereafter the performance of each model is presented in fig s14 like the results for measured data the use of ts had a lower rmse than ta however the mlr clearly outperformed both table 2 and appears robust over the 1000 days we present a summertime snapshot of 2017 modeled daily maximum tw results using nldas ta ts and mlr models from the upstream to downstream locations in fig 8 all three models tend to capture the warming trend through july when a frontal pattern drops temperatures given the prior assumptions 30 years of tw data was simulated for each instream location using the huc12 mlr model driven by nldas forcing data and calculated the 7 day anomalies the residuals of the linear trend are normally distributed with a zero mean which improves the robustness of least squares regression for trend detection both the daily maximum ta and ts increased by 0 35 and 0 30 c per decade respectively over the huc12 area fig s15 given that the models were explicitly based on these it was not surprising that tw also has an increasing trend over the past 30 years particularly where thermal sensitivity b was greater assuming spring temperatures and discharge had remained consistent instream locations with greater temperature sensitivity e g higher b will also have greater trends in tw as illustrated by the highest b upstream at 0 16 c per decade s15c and a lower b from the downstream at 0 12 c per decade all correlations to daily maximum ta ts and predicted tw are significant p 0 05 based on either t test or mann kendall trend test table s3 no significant trend was detected for daily minimum temperatures and only daily mean ta and 19 fig 1 at the dolan creek outflow were significant based on mann kendall tests given that the springs buffer this system from temperature extremes any change to spring discharge could significantly amplify the climate change signal 0 35 c per decade 4 6 thermal habitat thresholds the magnitude frequency and duration of instream tw was quantified using ucat analysis that determined the cumulative time values of tw exceeding an inflection threshold the ucat curves are essentially a three dimensional space of duration x axis frequency y axis and maximum daily tw z axis where common versus uncommon events are denoted by rapid changes in slope from persistent to catastrophic parasiewicz 2008 e g fig s10 the upstream location had higher summer temperatures than the downstream resulting from 44 of the downstream flow being derived from spring discharge as an example there was a 20 chance in the maximum tw reaching 28 c for 60 continuous days upstream fig 9 a while only a 10 probability downstream fig 9b over the past 30 years to evaluate persistent and catastrophic conditions we focused on extreme temperatures and their inflections in the continuous duration curves which mark periods of rapid departure castelli et al 2012 for upstream fig 9c tw at 30 c was persistent for 13 days and catastrophic for 43 days while downstream fig 9d critical thresholds were 6 days and catastrophic at 12 days table s4 thus spring discharge reduced the time above these thresholds by 50 and 70 respectively without direct measurements of species dependent lethality from laboratory experiments or field data these thresholds only provide reasonable criteria for management action 5 discussion discrete discharge from karst aquifers from springs maintains the thermal and hydrological regimes needed to support aquatic life in the devils river a strong thermal sensitivity of water temperatures to air was found but an even stronger sensitivity to soil temperatures little research has shown such a connection burns et al 2017 found that at the decadal scale land surface temperatures are translated to groundwater temperatures the vulnerability of these species to changes in stream temperature is thus difficult to ascertain without long term observations protection of gde is hampered by a general lack of information on such systems howard and merrifield 2010 and acquiring such data was particularly challenging in the remote and harsh field site a temporally sparse yet spatially diverse tw dataset from instream sensors and dts fo in various geomorphic positions along a karst spring complex was used to fill and extend our period of record using 30 years of climatic forcing data from nldas and then assess trends and the magnitude frequency and duration of ucat thermal events even with decadal increases in air and soil temperatures springs provide a consistent thermal buffer and heterogenous aquatic habitat our analysis assumed consistent groundwater discharge over 30 years we measured 30 m of hydraulic head above these spring complexes providing a stable hydrological regime for the gde however the preferential flow paths through the carbonate aquifer system and rapid response to local recharge events suggest a system that is highly susceptible to perturbation from either drought or groundwater abstraction green et al 2014 thus impacts of climate change on instream temperatures may be significantly outweighed by reductions in discharge from groundwater abstraction that may alter the ucat inflection thermal regime thresholds point obtained current research suggests chronic water temperatures over 27 c may increase the mortality of the devils river minnow with lethality likely near 30 c fries and gibson 2013 along the remote devils river neither land use nor riparian structure has changed significantly however environmental drivers such as ta and ts were found to be increasing through the modeling we estimate that daily maximum tw has also increased at 0 01 0 16 c per decade with higher rates in locations more sensitive to thermally driven heat advection cold water fisheries such as the lower klamath river in southern oregon and northern california have seen a more dramatic temperature increases of 0 5 c per decade bartholow 2005 groundwater discharge can be the dominant control on thermal refugia for the endangered dwarf wedgemussel aslasmidonta heterodon of new england briggs et al 2013 recently the texas hornshell popenaias popeii which is a medium sized freshwater mussel endemic to the rio grande river and its tributaries has been listed as endangered usfws 2018 with only four populations remaining randklev et al 2018b two texas hornshell mussel beds were identified within our study reach both on discrete gravel beds in shallow riffles one bed near the upstream location was subaerially exposed following the 2011 state wide drought which led to predation by raccoons procyon lotor morphologic channel features i e pool riffle run are important mesohabitats for endemic threatened species robertson and winemiller 2003 many arid fisheries are relict species highly endemic and threatened by human expansion into these unique habitats rolston 1991 refugia both thermal and evolutionary have been suggested as priority sites for conservation under climate change because of their ability to facilitate survival of biota under extreme conditions davis et al 2013 many fisheries are suffering from both anthropogenic changes to their habitats i e dams flood control etc and increasing water temperatures resulting from changes to riparian structure and climate thus excessive groundwater withdrawals drought and climate change underscore the need for environmental flow standards to protect habitat for these species opdyke et al 2014 randklev et al 2018a unionid mussels such as the texas horshell are sensitive to high water temperatures especially during early life stages maloney et al 2012 the texas hornshell evolved at the same time as dionda diaboli and the larger native fish communtiy thus reduced spring discharge from either drought or groundwater extraction along with increasing instream water temperatures related to climate change could adversely affect thermal buffering and potentially eliminate aquatic habitats for these threatened and endangered species while ongoing research seeks to understand thermal tolerances of p popeii glochidia freshwater mussel larvae of unionid species in central and east texas streams have median lethal temperatures ld50 of 26 9 36 4 c and a mean of 32 4 c khan et al 2019 the extent of the economic impact of maintaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem for mussels and any other species of conservation interest would depend on the implementation of water laws which could regulate groundwater pumping to maintain environmental flows particularly given the aridity and karstic nature of the devils river watershed wolaver et al 2014 there is a paucity of studies on environmental flows and gde in arid lands and many significant gaps in basic data collection mott lacroix et al 2017 the springs and caves associated gde in karst aquifers are hotspots of biodiversity goldscheider 2019 a synergistic hydrogeologic and ecologic approach is needed to derive the basic operations of these gde in order to understand their future trajectory cantonati et al 2020 future research should assess climate projections on the thermal regimes in the devils river watershed and how it may impact environmental flows the shallow monitoring well is too close to springs to make an effective sentinel well per harrington and rainville 2017 we anticipate expanding the well monitoring network upgradient of the gde ideally collection of hydrogeologic data over a larger area may allow a possible trigger well further afield from the study area at which regional scale fluctuations in groundwater levels are well correlated with longer term spring discharge trends in addition an airborne light detection and ranging lidar bathymetric and topographic survey data were acquired in march 2018 along the devils river from lake amistad to its headwaters 70 km upstream near juno texas the bathymetric and topographic lidar elevation models will provide input to aquatic habitat models used to assess habitat suitability for a suite of aquatic species including d diaboli and p popeii under a range of instream flow scenarios and be used to classify stream mesohabitats and map aquatic vegetation ultimately the physical habitat model could be used in conjunction with a groundwater model to understand how instream flows may change in response to groundwater development scenarios in the basin while this approach was applied to aquatic habitats in the devils river of texas this research approach may be used to inform conservation in other semi arid highly groundwater dependent streams with important species of state and federal conservation interest 6 conclusions the 3 year monitoring shows that stable discharge from the spring complex provided 40 of downstream discharge in the devils river and buffered river temperatures by 50 by correlating short term monitoring data with modeled long term temperature data the surface water temperature records were extended to 30 years revealing a long term warming trend with daily maximum water temperature increasing 0 16 c per decade model derived daily maximum air temperature also increased by 0 35 c per decade our uniform continuous above threshold analysis shows that the consistent spring temperatures of 22 6 0 3 c reduced the duration of above 30 c temperature days by 50 70 downstream of the spring complex this long term air and water temperature evaluation suggests susceptibility to climate change however extreme drought and groundwater depletion represent more acute problems in the near term for such karst environments given the lack of regulations to protect groundwater unsustainable groundwater development poses a particular threat to spring discharge this study underscores the need for developing a suitable monitoring program with basin wide sentinel groundwater wells and establish threshold groundwater pumping levels to maintain spring flows and temperatures needed to preserve aquatic habitats for protected species to this end ongoing development of groundwater and surface water models will inform this process although the approach developed in this study was applied to the devils river of texas the techniques could be widely applied to gde in similar regions globally the monitoring and modeling analysis provide the science needed to understand the aquifer spring stream interconnections to manage groundwater development at a level that maintains spring discharge

5421,in semi arid regions groundwater dependent ecosystems rely on stable hydro thermal regimes where refugia have supported aquatic biota for millennia in karst systems springs provide consistent flows and stenothermal conditions that buffer extremes our objective was to assess the impacts of spring discharge on instream temperatures using the pristine devils river in texas as a case study where climate change and groundwater development threaten to reduce spring flows and aquatic habitats of protected species devils river minnow and texas hornshell mussel instream temperatures and discharge were monitored for three years above and below the finegan spring complex these time series were extended back 30 years using temperature data from north american land data assimilation system nldas land surface models monitoring data revealed that springs contributed 40 of total river discharge spring temperatures were consistently 22 6 0 3 c providing thermal refugia to 200 m of river cooling the streamflow in summer and warming it in winter with a noted stratification overturning each winter high correlations between nldas air and soil temperatures and instream temperatures allowed the water temperature record to be extended over 30 years while air and soil temperatures increased 0 35 c and 0 30 c per decade spring inputs from karst aquifer buffer downstream temperature increases to 0 12 c per decade furthermore spring discharge reduced the duration of extreme thermal habitat thresholds by 50 70 a similar approach could be applied to other groundwater dependent ecosystems with sparse temperature data the results underscore the importance of spring discharge in maintaining heterogeneous aquatic habitats in karst terrain keywords groundwater dependent ecosystems karst hydrology springs refugia climate change fisheries 1 introduction groundwater discharge to streams generally plays a critical role in stabilizing flows mediating water temperatures

physiologic processes are dictated by the temperature of the ambient environment atkinson 1994 poole and berman 2001 colinet et al 2015 when stream temperatures exceed critical thresholds reproduction and biological functions of aquatic species can be impaired or mortality can occur the sensitivity of biota to stream temperature has motivated many studies to investigate the impact of climate change mohseni and stefan 1999 and establish physical thresholds for events influencing the survivability of threatened species capra et al 1995 castelli et al 2012 briggs et al 2013 davis et al 2013 for

dominant component of the river heat budget webb and zhang 1997 advective heat fluxes from groundwater and rainfall and sensible heat transfer between air and water are the next most important inputs

ecosystems gde include wetlands lakes rivers and springs that rely on groundwater inputs to support both terrestrial and subterranean ecosystems brown et al 2011 many are under threat from the compound effects of groundwater exploitation and changing climate particularly in arid and semi arid regions globally and the western u s rohde et al 2017 springs represent particularly unique gde occurring at the groundwater and land atmosphere water interface springer and stevens 2009 springs tend to be focused areas of aquifer discharge where the groundwater table is at or above the land surface elevation spring fed gde in drylands are generally recharged by a combination of relict groundwater with long regional flow paths and localized flow paths that more quickly respond to mesoscale precipitation events robertson et al 2019b understanding groundwater dynamics and their effects on spring discharge and thermal refugia are essential to developing effective instream flow

kurylyk et al 2014 snyder et al 2015 hausner et al 2016 kaandorp et al 2019 furthermore groundwater is a critical component of instream flows providing stable water levels temperatures and nutrients for riverine ecosystems power et al 1999 in critical habitats of texas instream flows are required to meet a sound ecological environment including a suite of measurable basin specific ecological

such gde are poorly understood particularly in karst aquifer systems where spring discharge predominantly supports perennial surface waters and riverine habitats the interaction between instream

et al 2019 regardless of the method there are inherent difficulties and challenges to sustaining field measurements over prolonged times in remote areas burt and mcdonnell 2015 the objective of this study was to evaluate linkages between the karst aquifer spring stream systems to assess their influence on thermal buffering of groundwater dependent riverine habitats using the devils river in texas as a case study the following questions were addressed 1 what are key factors influencing instream temperatures proximal and distal to spring discharge 2 what long term trends exist in riverine thermal regimes upstream and downstream of spring complexes 3 what are the critical thermal and or hydrological regimes that should trigger water management intervention this study presents several unique field and modeling approaches to characterize surface groundwater interactions within an arid karst gde remote watersheds are inherently difficult to monitor let alone assess long term trends or controls we developed novel techniques to predict instream temperatures from hydroclimatic data and then used long term weather forcing data from the nldas land surface models to construct extended 30 year water temperature records using these reconstructed records decadal scale temperature trends were developed for habitat temperature duration thresholds by quantifying the frequency and duration of continuous events above specified temperatures castelli et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was a section of the perennial reach of the semi arid groundwater dependent devils river within the devils river state natural area sna and the nature conservancy tnc dolan falls preserve fig 1 figs s1 s3 in supporting information in val verde county texas the study site focused on the finegan springs complex and the confluence of the devils river and dolan creek 60 km north of the city of del rio this reach is considered an ecologically significant stream segment nominee due to its relatively intact ecosystem and high species diversity el hage and moulton 2001 the uniqueness of the aquatic ecosystem is in large part due to perennial water in a relatively arid climate with average annual precipitation of 50 cm and mean annual temperature of 18 20 c prism 2018 the watershed provides a range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats attributed to its location at the convergence of the chihuahuan desert edwards plateau and southern texas plains ecoregions twpd 2012 the devils river is a major tributary to the rio grande terminating in amistad reservoir which began impounding flows from the rio grande devils and pecos rivers in 1968 fig s7 now it is jointly managed by the united states and mexico through the international boundary and water commission the devils river is 145 km long but only the lower 95 km are perennial primarily due to consistent groundwater inputs from numerous springs green et al 2014 abolt et al 2018 these springs are particularly clear with consistent flow and temperatures providing thermal stability some distance downstream as these spring runs become exposed to ambient air temperatures the thermal stability decreases downstream hubbs 1995 springer and stevens 2009 the perennial reach of the devils river began near juno tx until 1970 when groundwater development for irrigation lowered the regional water table barker and bush 1994 today pecan springs 10 km downstream of juno marks the start of the perennial reach which is now the upper range of the devils river minnow the devils river perhaps the least developed and most scenic river in texas is one of the last strongholds for multiple species of regionally endemic freshwater fishes and mussels the watershed provides a diversity of habitat types supporting numerous aquatic and terrestrial species including several regional endemics classified as threatened or endangered at both the state and federal levels robertson et al 2019a the devils river and its tributary dolan creek are habitat to five texas state threatened aquatic species including the proserpine shiner cyprinella proserpina conchos pupfish cyprinodon eximius rio grande darter etheostoma grahami devils river minnow dionda diaboli and texas hornshell popenaias popeii el hage and moulton 2001 d diaboli also listed as federally threatened has a narrow distribution hubbs and brown 1956 and has faced a number of threats including the 1950 s drought across the midwest and texas the construction of amistad reservoir which eliminated suitable habitat in part of its range and anthropogenic alteration of tributaries in mexico usfws 2005 since inundation in 1968 goodenough spring once one of the very large springs of texas has had a consistent discharge of 2 03 m3 s 1 kamps et al 2009 groundwater discharge from springs at the finegan and blue hole spring complex support important habitat of d diaboli and the heterogeneous structure of riverine fishes kollaus and bonner 2012 development of groundwater that potentially changes spring discharge is a specific threat to this habitat the same is true for texas hornshell a regional endemic that is currently listed as federally endangered and like other unionids is thought to be sensitive to extreme warm water temperatures especially in early life stages land use in the devils river watershed comprises shrub scrub 96 grasslands herbaceous 2 2 deciduous evergreen forest 1 2 and minimally developed land 0 2 fig s5 mrlc 2018 developed land historically included conventional oil and gas production primarily from the lower ellenburger group horizontal wells for hydraulic fracturing have recently expanded to the upper devils river basin and surrounding area fig s6 today the devils river is threatened by large inter basin water transfer projects to arid west texas and by encroaching development of wind energy motivated by the threat of proposed groundwater extraction the primary driving factor of this research was to assess the influence of spring discharge on instream temperatures relative to critical habitats 2 2 hydrology of the devils river watershed the devils river has incised into the edwards plateau creating steep canyons and ephemeral drainages inset into the relatively flat carbonaceous bedrock which gently dips to the southeast unlike the adjacent pecos river watershed the devils river is entirely underlain by low permeability limestone resulting in a nearly synchronous response of its tributaries during extreme rainfall events kochel et al 1982 the underlying karstic edwards trinity aquifer abbott 1975 is present throughout the study area and discharges at springs and seeps into the devils river which maintains base flows during dry seasons the potentiometric surface is a subdued expression of surface topography and water flows from higher elevations on the edwards plateau to amistad reservoir and the rio grande fig s7 within the study area the aquifer comprises two formations of the lower cretaceous edwards group the unconfined segovia and the underlying fort terrett formations recharge in karst terrain such as this occurs primarily through episodic flows in drainage channels such as dolan creek the dry devils river and the upper devils river groundwater flows from north to south along preferential flow paths parallel to the devils river green et al 2014 natural spring discharge occurs as rheocrene or hillslope spring types following the nomenclature of springer and stevens 2009 where drainage channels have eroded down since development of the distal balcones fault system in the early miocene and intersected the water table abbott 1975 in our study area springs discharge at the segovia fort terrett contact where limestone dissolution along this horizon possibly the kirschberg evaporite zone allows preferential groundwater flow to discharge forming the finegan blue hole dolan spring complex which essentially doubles the river discharge downstream 2 3 river stage discharge spring contribution and groundwater levels river stage was measured at locations upstream and downstream of the finegan spring complex

velocimeter flowtracker sontek san diego ca to develop a stage discharge relationship rantz 1982 our rating curve used instantaneous discharge measurements and a 24 hour mean centered around the time of the discharge measurement stage measurement as 1 q p g e n where g is recorded stage height at the gage e is gauge height of effective zero flow p is discharge when g e is 1 and n is the slope of the rating curve for the downstream location e was set to zero for the upstream location graphical methods were used to determine any changes in e by observing a parallel shift in the rating curve the spring complex discharge was calculated as the difference between downstream and upstream discharge groundwater levels were measured at two existing wells using absolute pressure loggers 11 m range 0

high plateau 120 m above the channel and 5 km east of dolan creek groundwater levels were sampled at 1 hour intervals 2 4 instream water temperatures tw water temperatures tw and specific conductance were measured in the orifice of three springs fig 1 finegan blue hole and rock art with an accuracy of 0 1 c and 5 µs cm 1 respectively u24 onset corp bourne ma tw was measured along two lateral and two longitudinal transects below the spring complex using tidbit temperature loggers 0 2 c onset corp bourne ma both lateral transects had five sensors housed in a protective vinyl cap affixed with a concrete anchor to a rock on the bottom of the stream spanning the channel from one bank into the thalweg and to the other side fig 1 1 10 longitudinal tw measurements were collected down the devils river and from blue hole 14 16 and down dolan creek fig 1 17 20 to the confluence for longitudinal transects loggers were attached to the downstream side of boulders in the stream channel isaak and horan 2013 four fiber optic dts surveys of varying duration 10 20 15 26 h 02 24 16 40 h 9 27 16 14 h and 2 8 17 25 h were conducted when spring and stream temperatures were expected to have the largest separation i e summer and winter for each survey the dts was positioned in the thalweg below the finegan springs complex using two fiber optic cables 400 m upstream and the other 600 m downstream fig 1 the dts n4386b agilent technologies böblingen germany sends discrete laser pulses down a continuous looped 2 km optical fiber brusens temperature 85c mobile 4 6 mm brugg kabel ag switzerland where it scatters and returns to the detector the incidental ramen and brillouin backscattering allow us to estimate stream temperature along the entire length of the cable selker et al 2006 the agilent dts allows a 1 m spatial sampling with 0 1 c resolution double ended dts measurements were collected every 90 s and averaged every 6 minutes at 1 m intervals differential attenuation along the fiber optic cable was directly measured using double ended measurement configuration in the instrument software the dynamic offset of the dts was corrected using controlled water baths with 25 m of cable coiled in each two water baths one ambient and one ice were constantly mixed using an aquarium bubbler during data collection water temperatures in each bath were monitored using platinum resistance thermometers and used to correct raw temperature trace files van de giesen et al 2012 corrected temperature vectors upstream and downstream were concatenated and averaged over the collection period to produce a continuous longitudinal mean and standard deviation of 1 m stream temperatures 2 5 meteorological data we established a weather station fig 1 to monitor air temperature

modified penman equation based on maximum and minimum ta and relative humidity mean wind speed and solar radiation 3 thermal modeling and data analysis 3 1 instream temperature modeling linear correlations between environmental covariates e g ta or ts and tw are used to obtain an empirical model of the climatic influence on instream temperatures mohseni and stefan 1999 the general formulae are 2 t w t a b t a t o r t w t a b t s t where water temperature tw is linearly dependent on either air temperature ta and soil temperature ts c averaged over some specified time interval t least squares linear regression was used to determine the constant a and slope b of this relationship which generally proves to be linear above freezing and below 30 c the slope of this relationship b represents the thermal sensitivity of tw at a given site to either ta or ts kelleher et al 2012 thermal sensitivity tends to be lower when groundwater inputs are higher beaufort et al 2019 for shorter time intervals t 1 day time lags can be incorporated stefan and preudhomme 1993 here eq 2 was used to model each instream location at hourly and daily mean maximum and minimum intervals statistical significance p 0 05 was determined from a parametric student t test and model performance by means of the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse we also developed a more complex multiple linear regressive mlr model that incorporated both the daily mean stage at our lower gage gl and daily mean solar radiation rs 3 t w t c 0 c 1 t a t c 2 t s t c 3 g l c 4 r s where the additive combination of these five parameters c0 to c4 is determined again by least squares regression and gl was only used because its more stable limestone channel lastly a stepwise sw linear regression was developed which iteratively adds and removes predictor variables ta ts gl and rs as the p value of the f statistic either improves or degrades model performance the final model may include interactions products and power functions of these predictors thus the sw model is indicative of our lowest possible rmse that empirically predicts tw given all other measurement predictor variables however it was explicitly trained for the entire study period and is not useful outside of these bounds it is essentially our best achievable fit over our data collection period for comparison to other models 3 2 long term trend analysis as with most field based studies we were only able to monitor environmental data over a relatively short 3 year period jan 2016 dec 2018 sensor failures data loss and other inconsistencies that come with field data collection in remote locations were common however data collection could be supplemented if there were consistent and statistically significant relationships with other long term climate reanalysis products the nldas data archive consists of a primary forcing data set from 1979 to present which is used to drive four independent land surface models lsm over the conterminous united states mitchell et al 2004 the primary forcing data set consists of 11 hourly climatic variables including precipitation ta long and short wave radiation and absolute humidity at 2 m xia et al 2012 these data are gridded at 1 8 12 km spatial resolution and available at http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings the devils river hydrologic unit codes huc for huc8 huc10 and huc12 was used to extract by mask ta and rs from the nldas data and ts from the noah lsm note the huc number is inversely proportional to watershed area fig s8 and a huc8 huc10 and huc12 references 23 7 and 3 nldas cells respectively each cell was averaged into an hourly value then calculated the daily mean max and minimum ta and ts and daily mean rs for each huc size next like the mlr tw ta ts rs model we replaced the observed weather data with nldas ta ts and rs and derived optimal coefficients over the study period finally the mlr was applied to a 30 year nldas record 1988 2018 to model tw at each instream location creating daily time series of mean maximum and minimum tw for trend analysis we assumed that the mlr developed was applicable over the past 30 years and that spring flow spring temperature and vegetation shading etc were relatively consistent this assumption seems reasonable given the pristine conditions within the watershed but it remains intrinsic to our trend analysis for each location the 30 year daily mean maximum and minimum were calculated for each thermal model these data were binned incrementally by day of year doy in intervals i 1 30 days to assess temporal autocorrelation i e verify time independent data once the minimum i was determined i e where autocorrelation is insignificant at a given i lag an annual climatology was calculated by averaging each doy bin over the 30 year record the temperature anomaly tanom was then determined by subtracting this climatology from each predicted tw averaged over i serial correlation was reduced r 0 2 when i 5d fig s9 ljung box q test p 0 05 for lags of 1i 5i and even 10i thus the data were binned weekly i 7 and monthly i 30 the latter is preferred in the climate literature however critical above threshold temperatures are generally less than 30 days section 3 3 so we attempted to preserve enough data to maintain persistent summer extremes while also minimizing statistical issues in the trend analysis in essence the tanom removes covariance and seasonal signal allowing the long term linear trend to be calculated with least squares linear regression and statistical significance p 0 05 from a parametric student t test which assumes the data are normally distributed and the residuals have a zero mean with constant variance however a non parametric mann kendall test was performed which determines the monotonic significance p 0 05 of any trend that may be linear or non linear and makes no assumption about the residuals 3 3 thermal habitat thresholds the thermal tolerance of fishes reflects a combination of biotic and abiotic factors that include acclimation temperature and thermal history chung 2001 the frequency and duration of thermal events was determined from time series analysis by uniform continuous above threshold ucat analysis castelli et al 2012 originally applied to environmental flow conditions under a given threshold capra et al 1995 parasiewicz 2008 ucat analysis essentially counts events over a given temperature threshold computing each event duration and taking its ratio to total length of time series e g see fig s10 these ratios are shown as the cumulative frequency versus the cumulative duration the y axis on a ucat plot indicates event duration while the x axis indicates cumulative time during which an event of that duration or longer occurred we repeated this procedure in 1 c increments for daily maximum tw at the upstream and downstream locations using data between june 1 and september 30 from the 30 year modeled time series mentioned previously inflection or breakpoints between catastrophic and critical threshold days were determined using piece wise linear regression these points demarcate rapid changes in frequency of continuous durations where persistent or rare conditions may affect one generation while catastrophic events are longer duration and can impact multiple generations castelli et al 2012 4 results results are presented first over the 3 year monitoring period from 1 january 2016 to 30 december 2018 and modeled over 30 years 1989 2018 the former is termed the study period and the latter long term similarly we use spring complex as the contribution of spring discharge which includes multiple sources e g finegan and blue hole complexes all of which are bound by the upstream and downstream monitoring locations 4 1 meteorological conditions over the study period maximum daily air temperatures ta exceeded 40 c each year in late summer while minimum ta dropped below freezing most winter months with january 2017 being particularly cold table s1 late summer and early fall tend to have more rainfall often exceeding 100 mm measured annual precipitation totaled 739 mm in 2016 and 560 mm in 2017 the thirty year normal 1981 2010 mean annual precipitation is 517 mm at finegan springs prism 2018 making both years slightly wetter than normal precipitation was generally less than pet demand given the aridity index ai ppt pet of 0 44 in 2016 and 0 34 in 2017 which classifies the devils river observations as semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 however the monthly ai was 1 during four months of the study period october 2015 august 2016 december 2016 and may 2017 4 2 river and spring discharge discharge measurements table 1 above the spring complex upstream ranged from 0 32 to 4 27 m3 s 1 11 to 151 ft3 s 1 while below downstream ranged from 1 09 to 5 56 m3 s 1 38 to 196 ft3 s 1 the residual is spring discharge which ranged from 0 77 to 1 29 m3 s 1 or 71 to 23 of total river discharge the median measured discharges upstream spring and downstream were 1 28 0 99 and 2 31 m3 s 1 respectively relative stages during discharge measurements ranged from 0 50 to 0 64 m at the upstream location producing a discharge rating curve with an rmse of 0 51 m3 s 1 an r2 of 0 88 and two changes in effective gage height fig s11a while stage at the downstream location ranged from 0 40 to 0 54 m producing a rating curve with an rmse of 0 39 m3 s 1 an r2 of 0 95 and no adjustment in effective gage height fig s11b continuous monitoring of stage showed dynamic and short term peaks reaching 1 8 m and quickly returning to 0 4 m fig 2 a downstream discharge was consistently greater than upstream discharge indicating a gaining reach fig 2b from spring inputs fig 2c following rantz 1982 the spring discharge record was constrained to periods when the observed stages were within the bounds of the rating curve and determined the average finegan springs complex contribution was 43 to total river discharge fig 2d flow duration analysis over these periods indicates that median discharges upstream spring complex and downstream were 2 11 1 53 and 2 41 m3 s 1 respectively 4 3 spring groundwater and river temperatures water temperatures tw at discrete springs including finegan spring fs blue hole bh and rock art ra were relatively constant with minimal seasonal fluctuations 0 5 c and deviations that were correlated positively with larger precipitation events in summer and negatively in winter fig 3 a site 16 fig 1 was in a pool just below blue hole and had substantially larger diurnal variability specific conductance not shown at these springs was also relatively constant 500 μs cm 1 and decreased to 200 μs cm 1 following major precipitation events as fresher water entered the catchment the static groundwater elevations of the shallow 440 masl and deep 436 masl wells were 30 m above the river elevation of 404 masl at dolan creek usgs gauge 08449100 this potentiometric difference provided the hydraulic head needed to maintain consistent spring discharge during high discharge events in dolan creek groundwater levels in the shallow well increased rapidly by 10 m the deep well maintained a constant level until the borehole partially collapsed in march 2018 despite the high dynamic range of head in the shallow well tw remained stable at 22 6 c tw in the deep well was 22 9 c fig 3b river tw fig 3c revealed the importance of spring discharge when comparing the difference between downstream and upstream temperatures δt fig 3d downstream tw was nearly 4 c warmer in the winter and up to 3 c cooler in the summer spring discharge which was about half of the downstream discharge and originated from groundwater with a nearly constant tw of 23 c thus providing thermal buffering for this gde 4 4 instream water temperatures instream tw from the longitudinal transect fig s12a spans 2 8 km upstream tw amplitudes were attenuated by spring inputs along the entire length of this transect the lateral upper and lower transects began on the eastern bank spring side and progressed to the far bank the middle positions 7 8 9 and 2 4 reached 23 c in summer with little diurnal variability fig s12b and c in winter stream temperatures were highly correlated to each other and much more dynamic regardless of lateral position the sensors were placed on the streambed under water depths ranging from 0 5 m on or near the banks to 2 m in the thalweg in summer cooler spring waters descended to the thalweg and warmer more dynamic river waters remained near the surface in winter the upstream input was colder and dynamically linked to ta and the warmer spring water essentially floated on top abolt et al 2018 the cumulative distribution functions f x of measured tw at the springs indicate nearly constant temperatures of 23 c fig 4 a while upstream has a wider distribution both laterally with more extreme tw variations on the far bank fig 1 10 than the downstream lateral transect the f x for both ta and ts fig 4d were essentially buffered by inputs from the springs as shown longitudinally in fig 4e finally the short transect down dolan creek ending in the lower devils river fig 1 20 17 had consistently cooler tw upstream fig 4f four dts surveys were conducted under two different thermal regimes warm 20 october 2015 and 28 september 2016 when river water was generally warmer than spring waters 23 c and cold 2 february 2014 and 8 february 2017 when river waters 15 c were cooler than springs we attempted to reposition the dts cable in the thalweg either resting on the limestone or vegetated stream bottom the upstream end distance 400 m extended just below the spring complex ending distance 600 m upstream of bh spring see fig 1 data collection times varied but all were sampled over the course of at least one diurnal cycle with the goal to define spring inputs which should be areas of low variance over a 24 hr period in both warm situations a strikingly low variance was found along the entire 1 km of cable fig 5 a and c regardless of position or time of day the dts temperatures were essential 23 c and equivalent to spring waters conversely during cold surveys fig 5b and d dts temperatures were cooler upstream fiber section 200 400 m then warmed to 17 c below finegan and blue hole but the variance of 3 c similarly in 2017 s cold survey fig 5d a warming downstream 100 m was observed with cooler temperatures upstream and high variance along the entire cable length during our final cold survey thermal infrared temperature tir data was collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle abolt et al 2018 tir captured the skin temperature of the water clearly cooler upstream river water mixed with two warmer spring inputs downstream the dts distance of 400 m upstream is in these cooler river waters the warmer spring water inputs essentially float atop the river water with only modest mixing considering that the dts thalweg temperatures show high diurnal variance i e river water this would imply instream stratification conversely the warm surveys show little diurnal variation implying the spring waters remain in the thalweg and do not fully mix within this reach although it certainly mixes below dolan falls this stratification is notable at the upper transect fig 6 a just below the spring complex when the spring side bottom temperatures fig 1 6 remain constant at 23 c until the first large flood pulse arrives on 11 november 2015 this event mixes water on the stream surface lowering tw below 23 c this surface water temperature signal remains on the river bottom all winter as noted in the 2016 cold dts survey 20160224 fig 5b the first warm survey 20151020 was synchronous with a period when all the instream temperatures converged the lower transect fig 6b is 150 m downstream of the upper transect the bottom tw records are warmer until a modest cold front arrives a few days prior to our second warm survey 20160928 which homogenized tw of the dts measurement period at the lower transect unfortunately the upper transect sensors malfunctioned during this dts survey however it seems plausible that thermal stratification in the devils river is common below the spring complex where laminar flow exists fig s2 until dolan falls fully mixes these waters fig s3 4 5 empirical modeling of instream water temperature and long term trends qualitatively tw has strong seasonality that is overprinted with random diurnal variability mimicking ta in all non spring locations generally tw lagged ta ts also lagged ta correlations with tw were particularly high r 0 8 for both ta and ts but at nearly all locations it was higher with ts using hourly data a lagged correlation matrix was implemented from 24 to 24 h preserving the highest correlation coefficient r and its lag period fig s13 the lag between ta and tw at nearly all instream locations was only 2 3 h and between 0 to 1 lag hours for ts note negative lags indicate earlier arrival at the independent location than the dependent location correlation between instream sensors was particularly high for all locations except for the dolan transect fig 1 17 20 spring locations were excluded here due to low thermal sensitivity b 0 4 the linear relationships between tw and ta has a higher slope b values upstream and much lower slopes typically near zero at spring locations table s2 in general ta explained over 70 of the variability in tw although each location had a unique relationship the relationship tw ts ta rs and gl was used to develop four predictive models of tw based on 1 2 linear regression with either ta or ts 3 multiple linear regression mlr and 4 stepwise sw non linear models for all locations table 2 at hourly time steps averaged over all instream locations the tw ts had a lower rmse 1 2 c and higher r2 0 74 than tw ta which was likely due to the reduced time offset in ts at daily times steps combining ta ts and rs into the mlr model resulted in a mean rmse of 1 c for daily mean and minimum tw the rmse for the daily maximum was slightly over 1 c the addition of downstream river stage gl improved our model reducing the rmse by 0 1 c the sw regression reduced the rmse to 0 63 c and increased r2 of 0 91 for daily mean tw this was essentially the most parameterized model given the 0 5 c accuracy of our temperature sensors uncertainties in the predictions are acceptable but limited to calibration period however if a similar correspondence is found to longer duration measurements e g nldas forcing data we can significantly increase the time duration first each nldas variable was aggregated to huc12 huc10 and huc8 and compared against meteorological observations regardless of aggregation size the nldas ta corresponds well to measured ta fig 7 a the huc12 daily mean ta had an adjusted r2 of 0 96 an rmse of 1 57 c a slope of 0 95 and an intercept of 0 1 c for ts observations were consistently warmer 4 6 c again regardless of huc size fig 7b the daily mean rs fig 7c from nldas was consistently higher 1 6 mj m 2 d 1 however the weather station was located on the valley bottom and likely shaded by the surrounding hills at low sun angles at the ⅛ scale the nldas rs was less affected by topography and may represent the watershed better than the measured data next the predictor variables e g ta ts rs from the weather station data was replaced with nldas aggregated huc12 values and developed a new coefficient for eqs 2 and 3 note river stage at the lower gage gl was not available over the long term so it was omitted hereafter the performance of each model is presented in fig s14 like the results for measured data the use of ts had a lower rmse than ta however the mlr clearly outperformed both table 2 and appears robust over the 1000 days we present a summertime snapshot of 2017 modeled daily maximum tw results using nldas ta ts and mlr models from the upstream to downstream locations in fig 8 all three models tend to capture the warming trend through july when a frontal pattern drops temperatures given the prior assumptions 30 years of tw data was simulated for each instream location using the huc12 mlr model driven by nldas forcing data and calculated the 7 day anomalies the residuals of the linear trend are normally distributed with a zero mean which improves the robustness of least squares regression for trend detection both the daily maximum ta and ts increased by 0 35 and 0 30 c per decade respectively over the huc12 area fig s15 given that the models were explicitly based on these it was not surprising that tw also has an increasing trend over the past 30 years particularly where thermal sensitivity b was greater assuming spring temperatures and discharge had remained consistent instream locations with greater temperature sensitivity e g higher b will also have greater trends in tw as illustrated by the highest b upstream at 0 16 c per decade s15c and a lower b from the downstream at 0 12 c per decade all correlations to daily maximum ta ts and predicted tw are significant p 0 05 based on either t test or mann kendall trend test table s3 no significant trend was detected for daily minimum temperatures and only daily mean ta and 19 fig 1 at the dolan creek outflow were significant based on mann kendall tests given that the springs buffer this system from temperature extremes any change to spring discharge could significantly amplify the climate change signal 0 35 c per decade 4 6 thermal habitat thresholds the magnitude frequency and duration of instream tw was quantified using ucat analysis that determined the cumulative time values of tw exceeding an inflection threshold the ucat curves are essentially a three dimensional space of duration x axis frequency y axis and maximum daily tw z axis where common versus uncommon events are denoted by rapid changes in slope from persistent to catastrophic parasiewicz 2008 e g fig s10 the upstream location had higher summer temperatures than the downstream resulting from 44 of the downstream flow being derived from spring discharge as an example there was a 20 chance in the maximum tw reaching 28 c for 60 continuous days upstream fig 9 a while only a 10 probability downstream fig 9b over the past 30 years to evaluate persistent and catastrophic conditions we focused on extreme temperatures and their inflections in the continuous duration curves which mark periods of rapid departure castelli et al 2012 for upstream fig 9c tw at 30 c was persistent for 13 days and catastrophic for 43 days while downstream fig 9d critical thresholds were 6 days and catastrophic at 12 days table s4 thus spring discharge reduced the time above these thresholds by 50 and 70 respectively without direct measurements of species dependent lethality from laboratory experiments or field data these thresholds only provide reasonable criteria for management action 5 discussion discrete discharge from karst aquifers from springs maintains the thermal and hydrological regimes needed to support aquatic life in the devils river a strong thermal sensitivity of water temperatures to air was found but an even stronger sensitivity to soil temperatures little research has shown such a connection burns et al 2017 found that at the decadal scale land surface temperatures are translated to groundwater temperatures the vulnerability of these species to changes in stream temperature is thus difficult to ascertain without long term observations protection of gde is hampered by a general lack of information on such systems howard and merrifield 2010 and acquiring such data was particularly challenging in the remote and harsh field site a temporally sparse yet spatially diverse tw dataset from instream sensors and dts fo in various geomorphic positions along a karst spring complex was used to fill and extend our period of record using 30 years of climatic forcing data from nldas and then assess trends and the magnitude frequency and duration of ucat thermal events even with decadal increases in air and soil temperatures springs provide a consistent thermal buffer and heterogenous aquatic habitat our analysis assumed consistent groundwater discharge over 30 years we measured 30 m of hydraulic head above these spring complexes providing a stable hydrological regime for the gde however the preferential flow paths through the carbonate aquifer system and rapid response to local recharge events suggest a system that is highly susceptible to perturbation from either drought or groundwater abstraction green et al 2014 thus impacts of climate change on instream temperatures may be significantly outweighed by reductions in discharge from groundwater abstraction that may alter the ucat inflection thermal regime thresholds point obtained current research suggests chronic water temperatures over 27 c may increase the mortality of the devils river minnow with lethality likely near 30 c fries and gibson 2013 along the remote devils river neither land use nor riparian structure has changed significantly however environmental drivers such as ta and ts were found to be increasing through the modeling we estimate that daily maximum tw has also increased at 0 01 0 16 c per decade with higher rates in locations more sensitive to thermally driven heat advection cold water fisheries such as the lower klamath river in southern oregon and northern california have seen a more dramatic temperature increases of 0 5 c per decade bartholow 2005 groundwater discharge can be the dominant control on thermal refugia for the endangered dwarf wedgemussel aslasmidonta heterodon of new england briggs et al 2013 recently the texas hornshell popenaias popeii which is a medium sized freshwater mussel endemic to the rio grande river and its tributaries has been listed as endangered usfws 2018 with only four populations remaining randklev et al 2018b two texas hornshell mussel beds were identified within our study reach both on discrete gravel beds in shallow riffles one bed near the upstream location was subaerially exposed following the 2011 state wide drought which led to predation by raccoons procyon lotor morphologic channel features i e pool riffle run are important mesohabitats for endemic threatened species robertson and winemiller 2003 many arid fisheries are relict species highly endemic and threatened by human expansion into these unique habitats rolston 1991 refugia both thermal and evolutionary have been suggested as priority sites for conservation under climate change because of their ability to facilitate survival of biota under extreme conditions davis et al 2013 many fisheries are suffering from both anthropogenic changes to their habitats i e dams flood control etc and increasing water temperatures resulting from changes to riparian structure and climate thus excessive groundwater withdrawals drought and climate change underscore the need for environmental flow standards to protect habitat for these species opdyke et al 2014 randklev et al 2018a unionid mussels such as the texas horshell are sensitive to high water temperatures especially during early life stages maloney et al 2012 the texas hornshell evolved at the same time as dionda diaboli and the larger native fish communtiy thus reduced spring discharge from either drought or groundwater extraction along with increasing instream water temperatures related to climate change could adversely affect thermal buffering and potentially eliminate aquatic habitats for these threatened and endangered species while ongoing research seeks to understand thermal tolerances of p popeii glochidia freshwater mussel larvae of unionid species in central and east texas streams have median lethal temperatures ld50 of 26 9 36 4 c and a mean of 32 4 c khan et al 2019 the extent of the economic impact of maintaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem for mussels and any other species of conservation interest would depend on the implementation of water laws which could regulate groundwater pumping to maintain environmental flows particularly given the aridity and karstic nature of the devils river watershed wolaver et al 2014 there is a paucity of studies on environmental flows and gde in arid lands and many significant gaps in basic data collection mott lacroix et al 2017 the springs and caves associated gde in karst aquifers are hotspots of biodiversity goldscheider 2019 a synergistic hydrogeologic and ecologic approach is needed to derive the basic operations of these gde in order to understand their future trajectory cantonati et al 2020 future research should assess climate projections on the thermal regimes in the devils river watershed and how it may impact environmental flows the shallow monitoring well is too close to springs to make an effective sentinel well per harrington and rainville 2017 we anticipate expanding the well monitoring network upgradient of the gde ideally collection of hydrogeologic data over a larger area may allow a possible trigger well further afield from the study area at which regional scale fluctuations in groundwater levels are well correlated with longer term spring discharge trends in addition an airborne light detection and ranging lidar bathymetric and topographic survey data were acquired in march 2018 along the devils river from lake amistad to its headwaters 70 km upstream near juno texas the bathymetric and topographic lidar elevation models will provide input to aquatic habitat models used to assess habitat suitability for a suite of aquatic species including d diaboli and p popeii under a range of instream flow scenarios and be used to classify stream mesohabitats and map aquatic vegetation ultimately the physical habitat model could be used in conjunction with a groundwater model to understand how instream flows may change in response to groundwater development scenarios in the basin while this approach was applied to aquatic habitats in the devils river of texas this research approach may be used to inform conservation in other semi arid highly groundwater dependent streams with important species of state and federal conservation interest 6 conclusions the 3 year monitoring shows that stable discharge from the spring complex provided 40 of downstream discharge in the devils river and buffered river temperatures by 50 by correlating short term monitoring data with modeled long term temperature data the surface water temperature records were extended to 30 years revealing a long term warming trend with daily maximum water temperature increasing 0 16 c per decade model derived daily maximum air temperature also increased by 0 35 c per decade our uniform continuous above threshold analysis shows that the consistent spring temperatures of 22 6 0 3 c reduced the duration of above 30 c temperature days by 50 70 downstream of the spring complex this long term air and water temperature evaluation suggests susceptibility to climate change however extreme drought and groundwater depletion represent more acute problems in the near term for such karst environments given the lack of regulations to protect groundwater unsustainable groundwater development poses a particular threat to spring discharge this study underscores the need for developing a suitable monitoring program with basin wide sentinel groundwater wells and establish threshold groundwater pumping levels to maintain spring flows and temperatures needed to preserve aquatic habitats for protected species to this end ongoing development of groundwater and surface water models will inform this process although the approach developed in this study was applied to the devils river of texas the techniques could be widely applied to gde in similar regions globally the monitoring and modeling analysis provide the science needed to understand the aquifer spring stream interconnections to manage groundwater development at a level that maintains spring discharge and buffer temperatures in aquatic habitats of conservation interest credit authorship contribution statement todd g caldwell conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft

5422,tidal flows in addition to the vegetation introduce considerable complexity into the transport of contaminants in wetland flows under the hypothesis that wetlands can be treated as porous media we apply the phase averaging technique to obtain the apparently continuous concentration distribution at the macro phase average scale in tidal wetland flows rather than the extremely complex concentration distribution at the micro plant scale to meet the requirements of precise concentration in terms of peak concentration position and value for strict environmental and health risk assessments this work studied the lateral concentration distribution rather than the generally studied approximate longitudinally distributed mean concentration the lateral concentration functions for tidal wetland flows are concretely derived to support the first order series expansion of the generalized dispersion model we show that the lateral concentration nonuniformity can be qualitatively altered as the contaminant cloud is carried back upstream by tidal flows the peak concentration position periodically appears at the center line or at the wall depending on the tidal flows and the peak concentration value can even be increased in the transport process due to its analytical features this work provides a model with low computational cost for effective environmental management keywords contaminant transport tidal wetland flows lateral concentration distribution phase averaging technique 1 introduction a wide range of tidal wetlands including unvegetated tidal flats salt marshes and mangroves are ubiquitously scattered along the world s shallow water coastlines eisma et al 1998 tidal wetlands are sites for the accumulation of sediment nutrients and contaminants and they also play an important role in coastal defense by offering protection from waves tidal bores and tsunamis alongi 2008 an awareness of the mass transport process in tidal wetlands is imperative for coastal management and it is important for environmental and ecological studies costanza et al 1997 neumeier and ciavola 2004 wu et al 2012 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017 zeng and pedley 2018 numerous works have investigated mass transport in tidal or oscillatory flows since taylor s canonical work on solute transport in a tube flow taylor 1953 taylor dispersion refers to the process in which a solute is transported longitudinally in flows under the combined effect of flow advection and molecular or turbulent diffusion with an enhanced virtual diffusion coefficient that is several orders of magnitude larger than the molecular or turbulent diffusivity taylor 1953 taylor 1954 the theory was applied to explore dispersion experimentally for wide channels by elder 1959 and for natural rivers by fischer 1967 fischer et al 1979 theoretically derived the longitudinal dispersion coefficient which is the sum of a steady component and an oscillatory component in an oscillatory flow the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can occasionally be negative if the flow oscillations are rapid relative to the timescale for transverse mixing fischer 1972 which had been verified by smith 1983 for dispersion in an oscillatory tube flow for factors contributing to the dispersion in an estuary flow including the transverse velocity variation and vertical velocity variation the former may cause the longitudinal dispersion coefficient to be orders of magnitude greater than it would be if only the vertical variations were considered which is mainly due to the enhanced mixing effect of transverse gravitational circulation holley et al 1970 yotsukura et al 1970 aquatic vegetation significantly alters the flow and dispersion processes in tidal meadows and it acts as a damping factor and reduces oscillatory velocities by as much as approximately 30 luhar et al 2013 for dense submerged vegetation the drag discontinuity at the top of the vegetation generates canopy scale vortices that dominate the mass and momentum exchange between the vegetation and overflow taking the vegetation flexibility into account the vegetation swings under the effect of canopy scale vortices generated in the shear flow around the vegetation and overflow interface called a monami nepf 2012 this swing motion will be more significant in tidal or oscillatory flows patil and singh 2009 conducted a flume experiment to investigate the flow and dispersion in submerged vegetation under wave conditions water waves increase the turbulence and vertical diffusivity between the vegetation and overflow and these effects help to release the contaminants trapped within the stem wakes thereby facilitating the contaminants over cross sections becoming more uniformly distributed some numerical works explored the dispersion models for tidal or oscillatory wetlands for example arega and sanders 2004 used depth integrated conservation equations for flow and solute transport models because the tidal wetland flows with horizontal dimensions that are substantially larger than the vertical extent can be treated as shallow flows in shallow flows transverse mixing is of particular importance under the effects of tidal flow and vegetation the longitudinal dispersion coefficient oscillates with a similar frequency as the tidal flow additionally the dispersivities are enhanced at low water depths with a small submergence ratio s r water depth vegetation height s r 5 which is attributed to the canopy scale turbulence occurring around the interface and caused by submerged vegetation and the turbulent diffusivity has a peak value at the top of the submerged vegetation huang et al 2015 nepf 2012 given the crucial role of wetlands in degrading contaminants it is quite important to predict the solute transport and determine the concentration distributions after a chemical discharge which will support decision making related to environmental and human health risk assessments barros and fiori 2014 for example for toxic substances accidentally discharged into rivers estuaries or coastal waters during water transportation predicting the concentration distribution in terms of the peak concentration position and value of the contaminant cloud under given environmental or health standards is of extreme and urgent significance wu and chen 2014 wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2017 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 this problem is more at the macro scale as considered by environmental engineers and governments rather than at the micro branch or plant scale wang and chen 2015 rubol et al 2016 in this regard models at the macro scale that remove the complex flow and transport processes in the vicinity of a single branch or plant need to be constructed to support environmental and ecological management the real flow and transport processes in wetland flows are extremely complex and are characterized by multiscale problems ranging from individual branches and blades on a single plant to the community of plants nepf 2012 vegetation significantly alters the flow by introducing additional drag and producing wakes behind the plant for practical applications the transport process at the large environmental scale is often considered rather than the complex details of the real water flow or mass transport at the micro scale on individual branches and blades in this regard some researchers studied the mass transport process in vegetated flows by treating the vegetation as porous media battiato and her co researchers modeled the vegetation as porous media in a two domain approach to capture the velocity profile and solute dispersion in submerged vegetated flows battiato 2012 battiato and rubol 2014 rubol et al 2016 larmaei and mahdi 2012 simulated heat and fluid flows in rigid vegetation through porous media science in which the porosity of a vegetated region is used in the governing equations chen and his co researchers among others obtained the continuum superficial fields of flow and concentration by using the phase averaging technique to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of solid vegetation and water wu et al 2012 luo et al 2016 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017 wang et al 2018 phase averaging technique provides a continuum model that is valid at the phase average scale for both the superficial water flow and superficial mass transport in the entire domain of the wetland whitaker 1999 it is a basic method for dealing with flow and mass transport in wetland flows it introduces a new perspective to explore the flow and transport in wetland flows and provides the frame of governing equations the theoretical model has also been verified through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations luo et al 2016 zeng et al 2014 wang et al 2020 for tidal wetlands the water depth is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the horizontal scale thus the tidal flows can be characterized as shallow flows with negligible vertical water movement and hydrostatic pressure arega 2013 under the reasonable assumption of shallow water the contaminant can be treated as being uniformly distributed along the depth from the perspective of a large spatial scale therefore what is of the greatest concern in environmental and ecological management is the horizontal mixing process at the large scale i e the longitudinal spreading and transverse mixing understanding these transport processes and accurately predicting the contaminant concentration distribution play a crucial role in environmental and human health risk assessments wastewater treatment engineering and ecological restoration barros and fiori 2014 wang and chen 2015 by treating the wetlands as porous media and using the phase averaging technique this work presents a theoretical study of the lateral concentration distribution of contaminant transport in tidal wetland flows by extending the generalized dispersion model the specific objectives of this paper are as follows i to give the transport model and tidal velocity profile in wetland flows at the phase average scale ii to analytically derive the lateral concentration distribution functions and dispersion coefficient and iii to characterize the lateral concentration evolution and demonstrate the effects of tidal wetland flows this work will provide a concise model with low computational cost for effective environmental management in tidal wetlands 2 methods and analyses 2 1 formulations at the phase average

where ψ is the dimensionless velocity as a function of ζ and τ at the coordinate moving at the period and lateral averaged flow velocity zeng et al 2011 2 2 tidal velocity profile flows in tidal wetlands are mainly turbulent and the transverse mixing is due to the molecular diffusion advection and mechanical dispersion in contrast to the complex microscopic transport process this work focuses on the macroscopic mixing process by using the phase averaging technique to smear out the microscopic discontinuity and to obtain the superficial flow field which is the space and time averaged velocity at the phase average scale the work wang and chen 2015 analyzed the dispersion process in tidal wetland flows however it focused on the mean concentration distribution with the assumption of uniform transverse concentration distribution limited to the understanding at that time the transverse concentration distribution was not explored this work is parallel with the previous wang and chen 2015 which is on the transverse average mean concentration while the present on the transverse concentration distribution regarding the study of wetland flows using the phase averaging technique chen

proposed the generalized dispersion model by relating the concentration to its mean and higher order longitudinal derivatives as 21 c k 0 f k ζ τ k c η k where f k ζ τ represents the k th order lateral concentration distribution functions based on the longitudinal derivatives of the mean substituting eq 21 into the lateral averaged equation of eq 11 the generalized dispersion equation is

obtain the lateral concentration distribution has been recognized in the very recent work of wang and chen 2016 in the present work the lateral concentration evolution in the tidal wetland flows will be analyzed by using eq 21 in the generalized dispersion model regarding the fourth order series expansion model in wang and chen 2016 it has been demonstrated in recent works that the first order expansion dominates the transverse concentration distribution and orders higher than the first can be truncated without causing many errors wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2017 to more concisely and essentially determine the lateral concentration evolution in tidal wetland flows we only pursue up to the first order transverse function f 1 the detailed derivation is provided in appendix b it is clear from eq 39 that 25 f 0 1 k 0 0 the coefficient f 0 represents the lateral concentration distribution reshaped by the wall condition such as contaminant sink or source wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2016 and no contaminant flux across the walls leads to f 0 1 then coefficient k 0 is derived from eq 23 as being equal to zero indicating the mass conservation in this ideal wetland flow

discussion 3 1 longitudinally distributed mean concentration it has been determined that the timescale to reach an asymptotic regime for environmental dispersion in tidal wetland flows is 3 0 w 2 π 2 κ λ k ϕ wu et al 2012 here we analyze the concentration distribution after the dimensionless time 1 0 w 2 κ λ k ϕ after which the dispersion process has already fallen into its asymptotic regime after obtaining coefficients k 0 to k 2 the longitudinally distributed mean concentration of eq 22 is derived into an asymptotic gaussian curve as follows 30 c ξ τ 1 4 π g τ exp ξ τ 2 4 g τ where 31 g τ 0 τ k 2 t d t is the time integration of dispersion coefficient and 32 ξ τ η 0 τ k 1 t d t represents the longitudinal coordinate that moves periodically and coincides with the tidal wetland flow to ensure that the centroid of the contaminant cloud constantly remains at the position ξ 0 regarding the mean concentration in steady wetland flows the peak concentration constantly appears at the centroid and gradually decreases with a constant dispersion coefficient which has been thoroughly studied and widely applied to related areas zeng et al 2011 wang and chen 2017 following the analysis routine in steady wetland flows previous works on tidal wetland flows also focused on the evolution of the mean concentration using a period averaged dispersion coefficient to support environmental management this operation reflects the approximate information on the mean concentration and works in applications although without much accuracy wang and chen 2015 wu et al 2012 furthermore some works have attempted to improve the prediction accuracy by numerically using the period changed dispersion coefficient and captured the nonmonotonously decayed mean concentration distribution as shown in fig 3 huang et al 2015 this method has greater accuracy for tidal flows however it lost sight of the rich concentration evolution particularly the two dimensional concentration distribution introduced by tidal flows the two dimensional concentration distribution provides considerably more information for studies of benthic organisms and environmental and health risk assessments hence more precise information about contaminant transport in tidal wetland flows is required in assisting such decision making barros and fiori 2014 3 2 lateral concentration distribution based on the derived longitudinally distributed mean concentration in eq 30 the lateral concentration distribution of the first order series expansion in eq 21 provides 33 c ξ ζ τ c f 1 c ξ 1 4 π g τ exp ξ 2 4 g τ 1 ξ f 1 2 g τ to better understand the effects of tidal flows on the contaminant transport process fig 4 intuitively illustrates the concentration contours of the contaminant cloud at typical times during a tidal period as shown in fig 4a the higher concentration at the center line is carried downstream by the nonuniform flow velocity when the velocity profile resembles that in steady flows with the peak value appearing at the downstream as shown in fig 2 the velocity decreases in general as time passes thus the lateral concentration distribution approaches uniformity under the conditions of lateral diffusion effect and weaker longitudinal stretch as shown in fig 4c the lateral concentration nearly reaches uniformity although the velocity reverses to the upstream at this moment the lateral concentration distribution is controlled by two competing mechanisms one is advection that tends to create considerable lateral nonuniformity whereas the lateral diffusion effect tends to smear it out in wetland flows with large pe the transport process is mainly controlled by advection therefore the lateral concentration appears to be tremendously nonuniform as the velocity to the upstream becomes larger at time τ 1 625 the contours are qualitatively altered to the upstream with considerable nonuniformity due to the strong longitudinal stretch to the end of the period with downstream velocity the concentration contours resemble those at the beginning of the period but with a larger longitudinal range from the family of concentration contours at five time points the contaminant cloud spreads longitudinally except at time τ 1 375 when it contracts with reversed velocity this complex evolution process of lateral concentration has not been revealed in wetland flows before because most studies only considered period averaged dispersion coefficient and neglected the rich concentration changes during one period wu et al 2012 wang and chen 2015 increasing environmental and health concerns regarding contaminant transport in waterways create an increased demand for water quality models with higher accuracy to provide more precise predictions barros and fiori 2014 rubol et al 2016 fig 5 shows the temporal evolution of lateral concentration distribution over typical planes during a tidal period the lateral concentration distribution monotonously changes with time without reversed curves in steady flows as shown in figs 5 a and 5 b the opposite change tendency at the two planes is due to the distance from the plane to the centroid of the contaminant cloud the concentration near the centroid gradually decreases in the dispersion process whereas it increases far away from the centroid as the contaminant expands longitudinally wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2017 greatly different from the cases of steady wetland flows the lateral concentration distribution experiences an extremely complex evolution process in tidal wetland flows at the two planes as determined in fig 5 c and d the lateral concentration distribution generally decreases but experiences an increase with reversed profile during a short time span in each tidal period which exactly reflects the strong effect of tidal flows on the contaminant transport in steady wetland flows the peak concentration is easily predicted because it respectively appears at the wall in the upstream and at the center line in the downstream however the tidal flows introduce challenges for accurately predicting the peak concentration considering that it appears at the wall or at the center line depending on the tidal amplitude diffusion effect and time duration this is exactly the focus of engineers and governments in the urgent treatment of toxic contaminant discharges us environmental protection agency epa 1999 rubol et al 2016 3 3 lateral concentration variation rate to quantitatively evaluate the lateral concentration nonuniformity an indicator of lateral concentration variation rate is defined as wu and chen 2014 34 ra ξ τ c ξ 0 5 τ c ξ 0 τ c 0 0 5 τ which measures the lateral concentration difference between the center line and wall over a transverse plane against that at the centroid of the contaminant cloud as presented in fig 6a the lateral concentration variation rate decreases from the maximum value approximately 25 to nearly zero on up to 15 during a tidal period it has been recognized in taylor s classical dispersion model that the mean concentration reaches normality at dimensionless time τ 1 0 when the lateral concentration is regarded as nearly uniformly distributed taylor 1953 nevertheless as clearly revealed here the lateral concentration remains highly nonuniform at that time and it nonmonotonously decays even with negative values to further characterize the lateral concentration nonuniformity under a long term evolution process fig 6b displays the lateral concentration variation rate at time points across some tidal periods generally the variation rate decreases similar to that in steady flows and the longitudinal range expands with the spreading contaminant cloud note that the tidal flow exerts little influence on the fate of contaminant from the long term perspective however it qualitatively alters the lateral concentration distribution during a tidal period with precise investigation 3 4 factors affecting the dispersion process figs 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of the magnitude of the tidal pressure gradient on the transport process at fixed time when the pressure is reversed to the upstream with the case of steady wetland flows shown in fig 7a for reference with a large value of a 1 the longitudinal stretch of reversed velocity becomes strong enough to cover the smooth effect of lateral diffusion leading to the contaminant cloud being carried by advection upstream at time τ 1 625 as shown in fig 7c fig 8 additionally displays the lateral concentration variation rate to more concisely evaluate the effect of a 1 the increased longitudinal range of the contaminant cloud implies that the average dispersion coefficient is increased with a 1 the magnitude is shown here to be a main factor that affects the lateral concentration distribution the effect of the damping factor α of the wetland flows on the transport process is also illustrated in figs 9 and 10 the damping factor exerts an effect on the contaminant transport by changing the velocity profile as α increases the contours behaves as those shown in fig 7 albeit with a slightly weaker effect it also qualitatively alters the lateral concentration nonuniformity note that the longitudinal range of the contaminant cloud is slightly contracted with increasing α during a period which is mainly due to the decreased velocity in denser wetlands 4 summary and conclusions it is established for the first time that the lateral concentration distribution of contaminant transport in tidal wetland flows experiences complex evolution at the phase average scale by treating the wetlands as porous media and using the phase averaging technique this work reveals the lateral concentration distribution by extending the generalized dispersion model that is generally used to analyze the approximate longitudinally distributed mean concentration the lateral concentration functions are concretely derived for tidal wetland flows to support the more concise first order series expansion regarding the model the base mean concentration is derived with period changed dispersion coefficient rather than the period average to capture the rich transport process during a tidal period that was generally ignored in previous works this work reveals a highly nonuniform lateral concentration distribution under the longitudinal stretch by a large velocity gradient and the nonuniformity decays much faster than that in steady flows when the tidal velocity approaches zero more importantly the lateral concentration distribution will be qualitatively altered with opposite nonuniformity to that in steady flows the peak concentration position periodically appears at the center line or wall depending on the tidal flows and the peak concentration value can even be increased in the transport process which has not been previously explored in wetland flows the reason lies in the fact that the tidal velocity directs to upstream during a short time span and carries the contaminant to move back in the channel in addition both the magnitude of the tidal pressure gradient and damping factor of the wetlands are determined to greatly affect the lateral concentration distribution the present work provides a potential approach with a low computational cost to meet the challenges brought by tidal flows in wetlands for

5422,tidal flows in addition to the vegetation introduce considerable complexity into the transport of contaminants in wetland flows under the hypothesis that wetlands can be treated as porous media we apply the phase averaging technique to obtain the apparently continuous concentration distribution at the macro phase average scale in tidal wetland flows rather than the extremely complex concentration distribution at the micro plant scale to meet the requirements of precise concentration in terms of peak concentration position and value for strict environmental and health risk assessments this work studied the lateral concentration distribution rather than the generally studied approximate longitudinally distributed mean concentration the lateral concentration functions for tidal wetland flows are concretely derived to support the first order series expansion of the generalized dispersion model we show that the lateral concentration nonuniformity can be qualitatively altered as the contaminant cloud is carried back upstream by tidal flows the peak concentration position periodically appears at the center line or at the wall depending on the tidal flows and the peak concentration value can even be increased in the transport process due to its analytical features this work provides a model with low computational cost for effective environmental management keywords contaminant transport tidal wetland flows lateral concentration distribution phase averaging technique 1 introduction a wide range of tidal wetlands including unvegetated tidal flats salt marshes and mangroves are ubiquitously scattered along the world s shallow water coastlines eisma et al 1998 tidal wetlands are sites for the accumulation of sediment nutrients and contaminants and they also play an important role in coastal defense by offering protection from waves tidal bores and tsunamis alongi 2008 an awareness of the mass transport process in tidal wetlands is imperative for coastal management and it is important for environmental and ecological studies costanza et al 1997 neumeier and ciavola 2004 wu et al 2012 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017 zeng and pedley 2018 numerous works have investigated mass transport in tidal or oscillatory flows since taylor s canonical work on solute transport in a tube flow taylor 1953 taylor dispersion refers to the process in which a solute is transported longitudinally in flows under the combined effect of flow advection and molecular or turbulent diffusion with an enhanced virtual diffusion coefficient that is several orders of magnitude larger than the molecular or turbulent diffusivity taylor 1953 taylor 1954 the theory was applied to explore dispersion experimentally for wide channels by elder 1959 and for natural rivers by fischer 1967 fischer et al 1979 theoretically derived the longitudinal dispersion coefficient which is the sum of a steady component and an oscillatory component in an oscillatory flow the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can occasionally be negative if the flow oscillations are rapid relative to the timescale for transverse mixing fischer 1972 which had been verified by smith 1983 for dispersion in an oscillatory tube flow for factors contributing to the dispersion in an estuary flow including the transverse velocity variation and vertical velocity variation the former may cause the longitudinal dispersion coefficient to be orders of magnitude greater than it would be if only the vertical variations were considered which is mainly due to the enhanced mixing effect of transverse gravitational circulation holley et al 1970 yotsukura et al 1970 aquatic vegetation significantly alters the flow and dispersion processes in tidal meadows and it acts as a damping factor and reduces oscillatory velocities by as much as approximately 30 luhar et al 2013 for dense submerged vegetation the drag discontinuity at the top of the vegetation generates canopy scale vortices that dominate the mass and momentum exchange between the vegetation and overflow taking the vegetation flexibility into account the vegetation swings under the effect of canopy scale vortices generated in the shear flow around the vegetation and overflow interface called a monami nepf 2012 this swing motion will be more significant in tidal or oscillatory flows patil and singh 2009 conducted a flume experiment to investigate the flow and dispersion in submerged vegetation under wave conditions water waves increase the turbulence and vertical diffusivity between the vegetation and overflow and these effects help to release the contaminants trapped within the stem wakes thereby facilitating the contaminants over cross sections becoming more uniformly distributed some numerical works explored the dispersion models for tidal or oscillatory wetlands for example arega and sanders 2004 used depth integrated conservation equations for flow and solute transport models because the tidal wetland flows with horizontal dimensions that are substantially larger than the vertical extent can be treated as shallow flows in shallow flows transverse mixing is of particular importance under the effects of tidal flow and vegetation the longitudinal dispersion coefficient oscillates with a similar frequency as the tidal flow additionally the dispersivities are enhanced at low water depths with a small submergence ratio s r water depth vegetation height s r 5 which is attributed to the canopy scale turbulence occurring around the interface and caused by submerged vegetation and the turbulent diffusivity has a peak value at the top of the submerged vegetation huang et al 2015 nepf 2012 given the crucial role of wetlands in degrading contaminants it is quite important to predict the solute transport and determine the concentration distributions after a chemical discharge which will support decision making related to environmental and human health risk assessments barros and fiori 2014 for example for toxic substances accidentally discharged into rivers estuaries or coastal waters during water transportation predicting the concentration distribution in terms of the peak concentration position and value of the contaminant cloud under given environmental or health standards is of extreme and urgent significance wu and chen 2014 wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2017 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 this problem is more at the macro scale as considered by environmental engineers and governments rather than at the micro branch or plant scale wang and chen 2015 rubol et al 2016 in this regard models at the macro scale that remove the complex flow and transport processes in the vicinity of a single branch or plant need to be constructed to support environmental and ecological management the real flow and transport processes in wetland flows are extremely complex and are characterized by multiscale problems ranging from individual branches and blades on a single plant to the community of plants nepf 2012 vegetation significantly alters the flow by introducing additional drag and producing wakes behind the plant for practical applications the transport process at the large environmental scale is often considered rather than the complex details of the real water flow or mass transport at the micro scale on individual branches and blades in this regard some researchers studied the mass transport process in vegetated flows by treating the vegetation as porous media battiato and her co researchers modeled the vegetation as porous media in a two domain approach to capture the velocity profile and solute dispersion in submerged vegetated flows battiato 2012 battiato and rubol 2014 rubol et al 2016 larmaei and mahdi 2012 simulated heat and fluid flows in rigid vegetation through porous media science in which the porosity of a vegetated region is used in the governing equations chen and his co researchers among others obtained the continuum superficial fields of flow and concentration by using the phase averaging technique to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of solid vegetation and water wu et al 2012 luo et al 2016 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017 wang et al 2018 phase averaging technique provides a continuum model that is valid at the phase average scale for both the superficial water flow and superficial mass transport in the entire domain of the wetland whitaker 1999 it is a basic method for dealing with flow and mass transport in wetland flows it introduces a new perspective to explore the flow and transport in wetland flows and provides the frame of governing equations the theoretical model has also been verified through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations luo et al 2016 zeng et al 2014 wang et al 2020 for tidal wetlands the water depth is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the horizontal scale thus the tidal flows can be characterized as shallow flows with negligible vertical water movement and hydrostatic pressure arega 2013 under the reasonable assumption of shallow water the contaminant can be treated as being uniformly distributed along the depth from the perspective of a large spatial scale therefore what is of the greatest concern in environmental and ecological management is the horizontal mixing process at the large scale i e the longitudinal spreading and transverse mixing understanding these transport processes and accurately predicting the contaminant concentration distribution play a crucial role in environmental and human health risk assessments wastewater treatment engineering and ecological restoration barros and fiori 2014 wang and chen 2015 by treating the

where ψ is the dimensionless velocity as a function of ζ and τ at the coordinate moving at the period and lateral averaged flow velocity zeng et al 2011 2 2 tidal velocity profile flows in tidal wetlands are mainly turbulent and the transverse mixing is due to the molecular diffusion advection and mechanical dispersion in contrast to the complex microscopic transport process this work focuses on the macroscopic mixing process by using the phase averaging technique to smear out the microscopic discontinuity and to obtain the superficial flow field which is the space and time averaged velocity at the phase average scale the work wang and chen 2015 analyzed the dispersion process in tidal wetland flows however it focused on the mean concentration distribution with the assumption of uniform transverse concentration distribution limited to the understanding at that time the transverse concentration distribution was not explored this work is parallel with the previous wang and chen 2015 which is on the transverse average mean concentration while the present on the transverse concentration distribution regarding the study of wetland flows using the phase averaging technique chen et al 2010 devised a dimensionless characteristic parameter the damping factor α to account for the effect of vegetation on flow this parameter represents the combined effects of the vegetation on the flow as 15 α μ fh 2 κ l μ the flow gradually evolves as α increases from plain poiseuille flow to sweeping flow chen et al 2010 a simplified tidal pressure gradient p x with a time period of t

and b are presented in appendix a 2 3 the generalized dispersion model among various models gill 1967 chatwin 1970 gill and sankaras 1970 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2016 gill 1967 originally proposed the generalized dispersion model by relating the concentration to its mean and higher order longitudinal derivatives as 21 c k 0 f k ζ τ k c η k where f k ζ τ represents the k th order lateral concentration distribution functions based on the longitudinal derivatives of the mean substituting eq 21 into the lateral averaged equation of eq 11 the generalized dispersion equation is derived as 22 c τ i 0 k i τ i c η i where 23 k i τ δ i 2 pe 0 1 ψ f i 1 d ζ i 0 1 2 and function δ ij is the kronecker delta defined as 24 δ ij 1 i j 0 i j the potential of the intermediate eq 21 to obtain the lateral concentration distribution has been recognized in the very recent work of wang and chen 2016 in the present work the lateral concentration evolution in the tidal wetland flows will be analyzed by using eq 21 in the generalized dispersion model regarding the fourth order series expansion model in wang and chen 2016 it has been demonstrated in recent works that the first order expansion dominates the transverse concentration distribution and orders higher than the first can be truncated without causing many errors wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2017 to more concisely and essentially determine the lateral concentration evolution in tidal wetland flows we only pursue up to the first order transverse function f 1 the detailed derivation is provided in appendix b it is clear from eq 39 that 25 f 0 1 k 0 0 the coefficient f 0 represents the lateral concentration distribution reshaped by the wall condition such as contaminant sink or source wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2016 and no contaminant flux across the walls leads to f 0 1 then coefficient k 0 is derived from eq 23 as being equal to zero indicating the mass conservation in this ideal wetland flow

discussion 3 1 longitudinally distributed mean concentration it has been determined that the timescale to reach an asymptotic regime for environmental dispersion in tidal wetland flows is 3 0 w 2 π 2 κ λ k ϕ wu et al 2012 here we analyze the concentration distribution after the dimensionless time 1 0 w 2 κ λ k ϕ after which the dispersion process has already fallen into its asymptotic regime after obtaining coefficients k 0 to k 2 the longitudinally distributed mean concentration of eq 22 is derived into an asymptotic gaussian curve as follows 30 c ξ τ 1 4 π g τ exp ξ τ 2 4 g τ where 31 g τ 0 τ k 2 t d t is the time integration of dispersion coefficient and 32 ξ τ η 0 τ k 1 t d t represents the longitudinal coordinate that moves periodically and coincides with the tidal wetland flow to ensure that the centroid of the contaminant cloud constantly remains at the position ξ 0 regarding the mean concentration in steady wetland flows the peak concentration constantly appears at the centroid and gradually decreases with a constant dispersion coefficient which has been thoroughly studied and widely applied to related areas zeng et al 2011 wang and chen 2017 following the analysis routine in steady wetland flows previous works on tidal wetland flows also focused on the evolution of the mean concentration using a period averaged dispersion coefficient to support environmental management this operation reflects the approximate information on the mean concentration and works in applications although without much accuracy wang and chen 2015 wu et al 2012 furthermore some works have attempted to improve the prediction accuracy by numerically using the period changed dispersion coefficient and captured the nonmonotonously decayed mean concentration distribution as shown in fig 3 huang et al 2015 this method has greater accuracy for tidal flows however it lost sight of the rich concentration evolution particularly the two dimensional concentration distribution introduced by tidal flows the two dimensional concentration distribution provides considerably more information for studies of benthic organisms and environmental and health risk assessments hence more precise information about contaminant transport in tidal wetland flows is required in assisting such decision making barros and fiori 2014 3 2 lateral concentration distribution based on the derived longitudinally distributed mean concentration in eq 30 the lateral concentration distribution of the first order series expansion in eq 21 provides 33 c ξ ζ τ c f 1 c ξ 1 4 π g τ exp ξ 2 4 g τ 1 ξ f 1 2 g τ to better understand the effects of tidal flows on the contaminant transport process fig 4 intuitively illustrates the concentration contours of the contaminant cloud at typical times during a tidal period as shown in fig 4a the higher concentration at the center line is carried downstream by the nonuniform flow velocity when the velocity profile resembles that in steady flows with the peak value appearing at the downstream as shown in fig 2 the velocity decreases in general as time passes thus the lateral concentration distribution approaches uniformity under the conditions of lateral diffusion effect and weaker longitudinal stretch as shown in fig 4c the lateral concentration nearly reaches uniformity although the velocity reverses to the upstream at this moment the lateral concentration distribution is controlled by two competing mechanisms one is advection that tends to create considerable lateral nonuniformity whereas the lateral diffusion effect tends to smear it out in wetland flows with large pe the transport process is mainly controlled by advection therefore the lateral concentration appears to be tremendously nonuniform as the velocity to the upstream becomes larger at time τ 1 625 the contours are qualitatively altered to the upstream with considerable nonuniformity due to the strong longitudinal stretch to the end of the period with downstream velocity the concentration contours resemble those at the beginning of the period but with a larger longitudinal range from the family of concentration contours at five time points the contaminant cloud spreads longitudinally except at time τ 1 375 when it contracts with reversed velocity this complex evolution process of lateral concentration has not been revealed in wetland flows before because most studies only considered period averaged dispersion coefficient and neglected the rich concentration changes during one period wu et al 2012 wang and chen 2015 increasing environmental and health concerns regarding contaminant transport in waterways create an increased demand for water quality models with higher accuracy to provide more precise predictions barros and fiori 2014 rubol et al 2016 fig 5 shows the temporal evolution of lateral concentration distribution over typical planes during a tidal period the lateral concentration distribution monotonously changes with time without reversed curves in steady flows as shown in figs 5 a and 5 b the opposite change tendency at the two planes is due to the distance from the plane to the centroid of the contaminant cloud the concentration near the centroid gradually decreases in the dispersion process whereas it increases far away from the centroid as the contaminant expands longitudinally wang and chen 2016 wang and chen 2017 greatly different from the cases of steady wetland flows the lateral concentration distribution experiences an extremely complex evolution process in tidal wetland flows at the two planes as determined in fig 5 c and d the lateral concentration distribution generally decreases but experiences an increase with reversed profile during a short time span in each tidal period which exactly reflects the strong effect of tidal flows on the contaminant transport in steady wetland flows the peak concentration is easily predicted because it respectively appears at the wall in the upstream and at the center line in the downstream however the tidal flows introduce challenges for accurately predicting the peak concentration considering that it appears at the wall or at the center line depending on the tidal amplitude diffusion effect and time duration this is exactly the focus of engineers and governments in the urgent treatment of toxic contaminant discharges us environmental protection agency epa 1999 rubol et al 2016 3 3 lateral concentration variation rate to quantitatively evaluate the lateral concentration nonuniformity an indicator of lateral concentration variation rate is defined as wu and chen 2014 34 ra ξ τ c ξ 0 5 τ c ξ 0 τ c 0 0 5 τ which measures the lateral concentration difference between the center line and wall over a transverse plane against that at the centroid of the contaminant cloud as presented in fig 6a the lateral concentration variation rate decreases from the maximum value approximately 25 to nearly zero on up to 15 during a tidal period it has been recognized in taylor s classical dispersion model that the mean concentration reaches normality at dimensionless time τ 1 0 when the lateral concentration is regarded as nearly uniformly distributed taylor 1953 nevertheless as clearly revealed here the lateral concentration remains highly nonuniform at that time and it nonmonotonously decays even with negative values to further characterize the lateral concentration nonuniformity under a long term evolution process fig 6b displays the lateral concentration variation rate at time points across some tidal periods generally the variation rate decreases similar to that in steady flows and the longitudinal range expands with the spreading contaminant cloud note that the tidal flow exerts little influence on the fate of contaminant from the long term perspective however it qualitatively alters the lateral concentration distribution during a tidal period with precise investigation 3 4 factors affecting the dispersion process figs 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of the magnitude of the tidal pressure gradient on the transport process at fixed time when the pressure is reversed to the upstream with the case of steady wetland flows shown in fig 7a for reference with a large value of a 1 the longitudinal stretch of reversed velocity becomes strong enough to cover the smooth effect of lateral diffusion leading to the contaminant cloud being carried by advection upstream at time τ 1 625 as shown in fig 7c fig 8 additionally displays the lateral concentration variation rate to more concisely evaluate the effect of a 1 the increased longitudinal range of the contaminant cloud implies that the average dispersion coefficient is increased with a 1 the magnitude is shown here to be a main factor that affects the lateral concentration distribution the effect of the damping factor α of the wetland flows on the transport process is also illustrated in figs 9 and 10 the damping factor exerts an effect on the contaminant transport by changing the velocity profile as α increases the contours behaves as those shown in fig 7 albeit with a slightly weaker effect it also qualitatively alters the lateral concentration nonuniformity note that the longitudinal range of the contaminant cloud is slightly contracted with increasing α during a period which is mainly due to the decreased velocity in denser wetlands 4 summary and conclusions it is established for the first time that the lateral concentration distribution of contaminant transport in tidal wetland flows experiences complex evolution at the phase average scale by treating the wetlands as porous media and using the phase averaging technique this work reveals the lateral concentration distribution by extending the generalized dispersion model that is generally used to analyze the approximate longitudinally distributed mean concentration the lateral concentration functions are concretely derived for tidal wetland flows to support the more concise first order series expansion regarding the model the base mean concentration is derived with period changed dispersion coefficient rather than the period average to capture the rich transport process during a tidal period that was generally ignored in previous works this work reveals a highly nonuniform lateral concentration distribution under the longitudinal stretch by a large velocity gradient and the nonuniformity decays much faster than that in steady flows when the tidal velocity approaches zero more importantly the lateral concentration distribution will be qualitatively altered with opposite nonuniformity to that in steady flows the peak concentration position periodically appears at the center line or wall depending on the tidal flows and the peak concentration value can even be increased in the transport process which has not been previously explored in wetland flows the reason lies in the fact that the tidal velocity directs to upstream during a short time span and carries the contaminant to move back in the channel in addition both the magnitude of the tidal pressure gradient and damping factor of the wetlands are determined to greatly affect the lateral concentration distribution the present work provides a potential approach with a low computational cost to meet the challenges brought by tidal flows in wetlands for

5423,recent studies have incorporated hydraulic redistribution hr schemes into earth system models to explore its effects on the hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes of terrestrial ecosystems however the influence of hr on ecosystems during increasingly frequent extreme drought events and the performance of different hr schemes at sites with contrasting ecosystem types and climate regimes remains unclear especially among ecologically fragile forest ecosystems in asia in this study we incorporated two different hr schemes into community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 the

ecosystem located at the northeastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau incorporating of a simple empirical hr scheme into clm4 5 yielded better performance than incorporating a physically based scheme into the model for ecosystems with seasonal frozen soil layers combined with previous studies at ameriflux sites it can be concluded that climate zones with overlapped dry season and growing

and numerical studies for different ecosystems and plant species ryel et al 2002 amenu and kumar 2008 neumann and cardon 2012 sulis et al 2019 hr includes the hydraulic lift of water from moist deep soils to dry shallow soils during dry periods richards and caldwell 1987 the hydraulic descent of water usually following a precipitation event burgess et al 1998 and lateral water transport smart et al 2005 hydraulic lift usually occurs at night during the dry season and is generally the most evident form of hr whereas hydraulic descent typically occurs only when overall annual rainfall is limited and the deep soil layer is unsaturated even during rainy seasons scott et al 2008 fu et al 2018b hr affects soil moisture evapotranspiration et soil organic matter decomposition nitrogen mineralization and immobilization plant growth and greenhouse gas e g co2 n2o emissions fu et al 2018a 2018b thus the influence of hr on water carbon and nitrogen cycles is broad and complex empirical studies have shown that hr can vary by nearly two orders across certain ecosystems 0 04 1 3 mm h2o d 1 neumann and cardon 2012 fu et al 2016 however many uncertainties remain with respect to the magnitude of hr and its effects among diverse ecosystems modeling studies have incorporated different formulations of hr into land surface models lsms in an attempt to elucidate uncertainties in the

improving simulations of latent heat flux at the reserva biológica do jaru site in amazonia fu et al 2016 incorporated the same hr scheme into clm4 5 and applied it to eight ameriflux sites clearly improving model performance in terms of simulating et the bowen ratio and soil moisture during the dry season in ecosystems ranging from forest to grassland with vegetation including desert perennials and annuals tang et al 2015 incorporated a frequently used and physically based hr scheme proposed by amenu and kumar 2008 into clm4 5 and reported improvements in simulated seasonal et cycles at a forested site in california but no improvement at a forested site in amazonia lee et al 2018 combined the hr scheme proposed by amenu and kumar 2008 with a one dimensional 1d ecohydrological model and simulated vegetation water use patterns in a semi arid savanna ecosystem in southern arizona they reported hydraulic descent during the wet monsoon season and hydraulic lift between precipitation events similar directional changes in hr between wet and dry seasons were also reported by fu et al 2016 for the same savanna ecosystem based on a clm4 5 simulation using the ryel et al 2002 hr scheme despite the contributions of these studies the incorporation of hr schemes into lsms has not yet been studied sufficiently to verify its performance for different vegetation types in various climate zones to date we have not found studies that investigate the hr s influences in different asian climate zones e g tropical rainforest humid subtropical hot summer continental and the dry tundra climate the magnitude form hydraulic lift or descent and occurring time of hr as well as hr s influences on the water and carbon cycles in different asian climate zones all remain unknown in addition a wide range of modeling studies have reported large uncertainties in the simulated magnitude of hr and its biogeochemical effects on ecosystems neumann and cardon 2012 fu et al 2018b which vary by the numerical schemes and implementations used tang et al 2015 the influences of hr schemes on the simulated occurrence and magnitude of hr also need further investigations previous studies have demonstrated hr in seasonally dry ecosystems fu et al 2018a however it remains unclear whether hr plays a role in dry events occurring outside of dry seasons global warming has increased the frequency and severity of extreme drought and flood events allan and soden 2008 utsumi et al 2011 wang et al 2017 and may consequently affect the occurrence of hr and its ecological impact on plant community structure and function sulis et al 2019 more studies combining measurements and modeling are urgently needed to determine the influence of hr on diverse ecosystems during dry events occurring in wet season fu et al 2016 in this study we selected five forested sites in asia ranging from spruce to deciduous and tropical forests and from semi arid and continental climate to tropical forest climate we incorporated one empirical and one physical hr scheme into clm4 5 and applied the hybrid model to the five sites the objectives of this study were a to investigate the magnitude form and occurring

for each plot 2 3 hr scheme to quantify hr we incorporated two schemes based on those of ryel et al 2002 and amenu and kumar 2008 into clm4 5 the former scheme empirically describes hr flux based on the soil water potential gradient between two soil layers the hr induced net water movement into layer i from layer j was calculated as 1 q h r i j c rt δ ϕ m c j f root i f root j 1 f root j d where c rt is the maximum radial soil root conductance of water among the entire active root system cm mpa 1h 1 δϕ m is the water potential difference between the two soil layers mpa simulated using a non steady state richards equation in clm4 5 f root i and f root j are root fractions in soil layers i and j weighted average of pft level root fractions zeng 2001 d is a switching factor set to 1 0 at night and 0 0 during the day assuming that water movement among soil layers via roots occurs only at night when the plant is not transpiring and cj is a factor reducing soil root conductance for water in a given layer and can be expressed as 2 c j 1 1 ϕ j ϕ 50 b where ϕj is the soil water potential of layer j mpa ϕ 50 is that where soil root conductance is reduced by 50 mpa and b is an empirical constant due to a lack of site specific parameters the values of b and ϕ 50 were obtained from ryel et al 2002 as 3 22 and 1 mpa respectively the physically based method of amenu and kumar 2008 calculates hr flux based on a non steady state richards equation for soil and a steady state richards equation for roots 3 θ t z k s ϕ s z 1 k r r a d ϕ s ϕ r 4 z k r a x ϕ r z 1 k r r a d ϕ s ϕ r where θ is the volumetric soil water content k s kr rad and kr ax are soil hydraulic conductivity and root system hydraulic conductivity in the radial and axial directions respectively and ϕ s and ϕ r are water potentials in the soil and roots respectively we replaced the default richards equation in clm with eq 3 added eq 4 and moved the transpiration term from the richards equation for soil to that for roots eqs 3 and 4 were discretized into tridiagonal systems the solution was obtained using a method based on that of tang et al 2015 hr flux in a given soil layer at a specific time step was calculated using the right hand side of equation 4 for ϕ s ϕ r root system hydraulic conductivity in the radial k r rad and axial k r ax directions are empirical parameters provided by amenu and kumar 2008 based on previous model parameter sensitivity studies fu et al 2016 fu et al 2018a and modeling results for parameter sensitivity analysis could be found in fig s11 in fu et al 2016 and in fig s1 in fu et al 2018a we tuned the sensitive parameters for hr flux c rt k r rad and k r ax in both schemes by comparing modeled and measured magnitudes of diurnal water content dynamics in the upper soil layers 0 30 cm during dry seasons we labeled the clm 4 5 modeling runs incorporating the ryel et al 2002 hr scheme and the amenu and kumar 2008 method as simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak respectively and labeled default clm 4 5 model runs as simulation nohr we used a two stage spin up method to obtain stable vertical soil carbon distribution as initial conditions for these simulations an accelerated decomposition spin up and normal spin up run were operated successively for 1000 and 200 years respectively kluzek 2013 spin up runs were done with the ryel et al s hr scheme included further information on spin up methodologies for clm4 5 were provided by oleson et al 2013 hr and its impact on water and carbon cycles were investigated during dry seasons season wet season and dry events at the five selected sites due to the different climate type table 1 the dry season usually comes from may to october at bks site from october to next march at gdk smf and gch sites and from october to next april at gt site zhan et al 2016 dry events with different intensities happened from 2010 7 30 to 2010 8 30 at gt site from 2001 8 28 to 2001 9 21 at bks site from 2016 8 23 to 2016 9 24 at gch site from 2006 9 22 to 2006 10 27 at gdk site and from 2007 7 15 to 2007 9 2 at smf site identified by the dynamics of the surface soil moisture 0 30 cm fig 2 2 4 statistic analyses standardized taylor diagrams were used to display statistical comparisons between modeled and measured time series data on soil moisture et nee and or gpp at the five sites taylor 2001 root mean square error rmse between the observed data and simulated results during dry season wet season and dry events occurring in wet season was used to evaluate the performance of the default and modified models and was calculated as follows 5 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 where p i and o i are the simulated and observed data respectively and n is the total number of observations 3 results 3 1 effects of hr on soil moisture the observed soil moisture and that simulated by simulation nohr simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak at a weekly timescale for selected years are plotted in fig 2 at bks gch and smf sites soil moisture in all three simulations generally followed the magnitude and dynamics of observational data with correlation coefficients r 0 6 figs 2g n and 3 simulation nohr simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak roughly reproduced seasonal changes in soil moisture at different depths at gt site r 0 41 0 90 however the three simulations performed less well during the non growing seasons at gt site especially at depths of 20 120 cm fig 2c f at gdk site both simulation nohr and simulation hr ryel simulated soil moisture well r 0 52 and 0 55 whereas the simulation with hr ak scheme underestimated soil moisture at depths of 0 30 cm during spring thaw r 0 47 figs 2o and 3 as described in section 2 3 hr equation parameters were calibrated based on the magnitude of diurnal soil moisture fluctuation observed and simulated magnitudes are shown in fig 4 both simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak largely captured the amplitude of hr induced diel soil moisture fluctuations during dry events at the five sites fig 4 briefly hr incorporation increased the correlation coefficient and decreased rmse in soil moisture simulations during dry events for example compared to simulation nohr simulation hr ryel simulation hr ak increased the correlation coefficient from 0 74 to 0 83 to 0 85 0 87 0 83 0 84 at depths of 10 50 cm at smf site from 0 37 to 0 86 to 0 48 0 98 0 50 0 97 at depths of 10 and 50 cm at bks site and from 0 90 to 0 93 0 91 at depths of 0 30 cm at gdk site as shown in fig 5 a both simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak clearly decreased rmse at all five sites during dry events and simulation hr ryel decreased rmse to a greater extent than simulation hr ak at all sites except gdk fig 5a the simulation results showed clear hydraulic descent during spring and summer at gt site indicated by hr induced soil moisture decrease and increase in shallow and deeper soil layers respectively fig 2a f downward hr hydraulic descent transported water from shallow soil layers to layers deeper than 80 cm in the simulation hr ryel simulation fig 2f in contrast hydraulic lift characterized by a clear increase in surface soil moisture occurred at the other four sites during dry events fig 2 for example hr increased soil moisture at depths of 10 and 50 cm at bks site 5 and 10 cm at gch site 10 20 and 50 cm at smf site and 0 30 cm at gdk site fig 2 hr induced soil moisture changes lasted longest throughout the growing season and were largest at gt site fig 2 3 2 effects of hr on et model performance in terms of simulating et at all five sites at a weekly timescale for selected years is shown in fig 6 the simulated results by clm4 5 with and without hr schemes generally followed the magnitude and dynamics demonstrated in observational or modis et data at gt gch gdk and smf sites with correlation coefficients between simulated and observed or modis et generally 0 58 fig 3 the correlation coefficient was small 0 10 at bks site fig 3 due to unclear et variation throughout the year fig 6b however simulated mean et values 3 01 and 3 03 mm day 1 from simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak respectively were quite close to that of modis 2 96 mm day 1 at bks site fig 6 simulation hr ak underestimated et to some extent by 0 20 mm day 1 at gt site fig 6a although increases in the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed modis et were limited after hr was included fig 3 hr incorporation decreased the simulated rmse for et during dry events except for simulation hr ak at gt site fig 5b increases decreases in rmse in et simulations were limited at the yearly scale fig 3 hr incorporation increased modeled et to varying degrees at the five sites during dry events ranging from 0 29 mm day 1 at gdk site to 0 68 mm day 1 at gch site fig 6 et simulated by simulation nohr approached zero when extreme drought events occurred in august 2010 at gt site and august 2016 at gch site fig 6a c in contrast simulated et increased due to hr incorporation approaching observed or modis et values obtained using simulation hr ryel at gt and using both hr schemes at gch fig 6a c unlike the other four sites hr decreased et during the growing season at gt due to clear hydraulic descent figs 2a and 6a at the sub daily temporal scale the simulation of diurnal et was improved after incorporating both hr schemes at smf site and the hr ryel scheme at gt site although the improvement was smaller at gdk and bks sites fig 7 no observed sub daily et data were available at gch site hr induced increases in simulated et during dry events were mainly attributed to increased plant transpiration at the five sites fig 7 due to clear hydraulic decent at gt during wet seasons the diel et peak obtained by simulation hr ryel was lower than the value obtained by simulation nohr at gt site during wet periods fig 7 hr induced changes in simulated et were limited during wet periods at the other four sites fig 7 3 3 effects of hr on nee positive negative nee values indicate net co2 release to net co2 uptake from the atmosphere as shown in fig 8 the seasonal dynamics of nee were roughly reproduced at gt bks gdk and smf sites using clm with or without hr except for simulation hr ak at gt site fig 8 gpp was also simulated well at gch site correlation coefficient 0 62 0 66 figs 3 and 8d where no nee data were available at gt site observed nee was close to zero during winter whereas all three clm simulations predicted co2 efflux to the atmosphere positive nee fig 8a winter co2 efflux to the atmosphere in clm modeling was also reported at ameriflux sites in southern california and washington state possibly due to the oversensitivity of clm to cold temperatures and consequent underestimation of winter photosynthesis fu et al 2018a 2018b 2018c the imperfect nee simulation correlation coefficient 0 14 0 15 at smf was caused by observation noise fig 8e according to the simulation results the largest effect of hr on the carbon cycle nee was found at gt site where simulation hr ryel performed better than simulation hr ak fig 8a at gt site hr decreased co2 uptake from the atmosphere during april may and increased co2 uptake or decreased co2 efflux to the atmosphere e g in august 2010 by an average of 1 64 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 during july august fig 8a the second largest effect occurred at gch site during a severe drought in august 2016 fig 8c when simulation nohr predicted a clear drop in gpp that was not seen in modis data fig 8d hr incorporation clearly increased gpp by an average of 1 98 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 and improved gpp simulation accuracy during drought fig 8d simulation results also showed that hr incorporation decreased co2 efflux to the atmosphere fig 8c hr slightly increased co2 uptake at bks gdk and smf sites during dry events fig 8b e f the corresponding rmse values indicated that the nee simulation was improved by the hr ryel scheme at gt gdk and smf sites and by the hr ak scheme only at smf site during dry events fig 5c the duration of hr effects on nee fig 8 was consistent with that of hr effects on soil moisture fig 2 and et fig 6 at the sub daily temporal scale the simulation of diurnal nee during dry events was improved after incorporating both hr schemes at bks and gdk sites and the hr ryel scheme at gt site although the improvement was smaller at smf site fig 9 a e no observed sub daily nee data were available at gch site due to clear hydraulic decent at gt site the lowest value of diel nee obtained by simulation hr ryel was higher than that obtained by simulation nohr at gt site during wet periods fig 9f hr induced changes in simulated nee were limited during wet periods at the other four sites fig 9g j 4 discussion 4 1 hydraulic lift and decent upward hr is generally the most obvious form of hr it takes place when shallow soil layers are drier than deep layers prieto et al 2012 kennedy et al 2019 based on comparisons with observed soil moisture our simulated results indicated that upward hr occurred during dry events from the driest site in northwestern china with a semi arid climate to the wettest site in indonesia with an equatorial fully humid climate fig 2 using specific examples this hr study shed light on asian regions which have been poorly represented to date in contrast to hydraulic lift downward hr can affect overall ecosystem water budgets by increasing deep soil water recharge such recharge can be faster than that occurring via infiltration or preferential flow after a rain event ryel et al 2003 hydraulic descent may improve whole plant water uptake by removing water from shallow soils evaporation and shallow rooted competitors hultine et al 2003 our soil moisture modeling results indicate that downward hr was dominant throughout the growing season at gt site which is the driest forested site and is dominated by picea crassifolia fig 2 due to hydraulic descent precipitation triggered et was suppressed mainly via plant transpiration and partially through ground evaporation ecosystem carbon uptake was also decreased figs 6a 7 and 8a at gt site some rainwater that was transported via downward hr to become deep soil moisture in 2010 was transported back to the shallow soil layer to be eventually consumed by et during drought event in august figs 2 6a and 7 a combination of downward and upward hr processes helped to sustain ecosystem carbon acquisition during drought figs 8a and 9a at a forest site in northwestern china that was drier than gt site with annual precipitation of only 37 4 mm yu et al 2013 observed hydraulic descent in lateral roots and reduced transpiration in stems of populus euphratica with the onset of heavy rains hydraulic descent was also reported at an ameriflux site with a semi arid savanna ecosystem where downward hr was predicted to reduce rainy season et heterotrophic respiration and net primary production fu et al 2016 fu et al 2018b lee et al 2018 significant hydraulic descent during summer monsoon has also been reported to extend the growing season of mesquites and to support transpiration throughout seasonal dry periods scott et al 2008 the present study and those mentioned above support the occurrence of hydraulic decent in forested ecosystems in typical arid and semi arid regions altering ecosystem et and the carbon cycle by storing water in deep soil via downward hr during wet seasons and releasing deep stored water for plant physiological activity during dry periods lee et al 2018 4 2 effects of hr during drought events previous hr studies have mainly focused on dry seasons whereas the present study explored hr effects on water and carbon cycles during dry events occurring in wet seasons during the severe drought event in august 2016 at gch site simulation results obtained by simulation nohr showed serious underestimates of both et and gpp figs 6c and 8d root uptake from deep soil upward hr at night provided a constant water supply for transpiration which ensured physiological activity during the following day fig 7 thereby increasing ecosystem gpp and carbon uptake figs 8c d and 9c our results indicate that bamboo plants at gch site did not experience severe water stress during the extreme drought event in 2016 due to hydraulic lift in our simulations hydraulic conductivity was represented by c rt and k r rad which controlled the magnitude of hr in the hr ryel and hr ak schemes respectively fu et al 2016 2018a notably the values of these parameters were largest at gch site where an extreme dry event occurred during the growing season but not at gt site which was the driest site table 3 gou et al 2018 reported that clm shut off transpiration when topsoil moisture dropped below the wilting point in a savanna ecosystem they incorporated a root water uptake compensation method into clm to allow plants to exploit deep water sources and capture plant water source shifts the root water uptake compensation method used in gou et al 2018 played a similar role to that of hr in the present study we predict that hr will become important in future simulations of water and carbon cycle effects against the background of increasing frequency and severity of extreme drought events except for simulation hr ak at the gt site the simulated ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration t et during the dry events varied from 0 70 to 0 98 figs 7 and s1 which was within the range of 0 9 1 0 that was reported for the summer t et for 1614 sites across the united states by rigden et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 reported that soil evaporation was negligible and transpiration was equal to evapotranspiration sometimes during the growing season rigden et al 2018 also reported larger t et during summer average 0 90 than that under wet condition average 0 82 in the present study the simulated t et was larger during dry events than that during wet season at the gch gdk smf and bks sites consistent with those in zhou et al 2016 and rigden et al 2018 the larger t et during dry event than that during wet season at gt site was consistent with the finding in stoy et al 2019 which illustrated that dry spells could lead to decreased t et if water limitations stunt vegetation growth and subsequently plant transpiration fig 7 also illustrated that the dry spell reduced et at gt site and et during dry event was clearly smaller than that during wet season which was different from the other four sites dry spells can also lead to decrease t et if water limitations stunt vegetation growth and then plant decrease plant transpiration 4 3 influences of climate on hr clear influences of hr on the water figs 4 and 7 and carbon fig 9 cycles during dry events were found in the present study while hr s influences during dry season at the five asiaflux sites except for the driest gt site fig 5d e and f in the present study were not so clear as those at ameriflux sites in previous studies fu et al 2016 2018a 2018b we attribute the different influences of hr on the water and carbon cycles to climate type including the amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation and the consistence between precipitation and temperature grow season specifically the six sites that had a mediterranean climate with dry summer and wet winter fig 10 b and c in fu et al 2016 were all clearly affected by hr no matter the annual mean precipitation small e g 100 mm at us scw site or large e g 2223 mm at us wrc site in contrast hr s influences on water and carbon cycles were not clear at the us ro1 site fu et al 2018a which had a climate of humid continental with wet summer and dry winter the gch climate humid subtropical gdk climate hot summer continental and smf climate humid subtropical sites in the present study also had a climate with wet summer and dry winter and these three sites were not clearly affected by hr during dry season either similar to the us ro1 site the us ro1 gch gdk and smf sites had a mean annual precipitation of 879 1615 mm clear hydraulic descent was only found at the driest gt site climate tundra with a mean annual precipitation of 435 mm in the present study similarly clear hydraulic descent was found at the us srm site climate cold semi arid with a mean annual precipitation of 377 mm among eight ameriflux sites fu et al 2016 the hydraulic descent at us srm site was recorded by monitoring the sapflow of taproot and lateral root by scott et al 2008 both gt and us srm sites had similar seasonal distribution of precipitation as those at us ro1 gch gdk and smf sites 879 1615 mm where most precipitation occurred in grow season it can be inferred that clear hydraulic descent was caused by the limited precipitation amount namely 400 mm at gt and us srm versus 800 mm at us ro1 gch gdk and smf sites figs 10 and s2 the seasonal distribution of precipitation at the two tropical sites namely the bks and br sa1 sites was kind of similar to those at the six sites with a mediterranean climate fig 10 but hr s influences on the two tropical sites were clearly less obvious than those at the six sites fu et al 2016 the less hr s influences at the two tropical sites were caused by the larger precipitation amount during june august than the six sites with mediterranean climate fig 10a and b overall climate zones with overlapped dry season and growing season showed clear hydraulic lift during dry season climate zones with overlapped wet season and growing season showed clear hydraulic descent if precipitation was limited e g 400 mm a 1 and did not showed clear influences of hr if the precipitation was unlimited e g 800 mm a 1 4 4 comparison of the two hr schemes compared to the hr ryel scheme which is based on the water potential gradient the hr function developed by amenu and kumar 2008 is more physically based as it simulates the path of water movement within the soil root system neumann and cardon 2012 recently zhu et al 2017 attempted to modify the original function of hr ak to work only under weak transpiration conditions in our understanding the purpose of zhu et al 2017 was consistent with the assumption of the hr ryel scheme that hr occurs only at night our modeling results obtained using the hr ryel and hr ak schemes showed minor differences among bks smf and gch sites and both improved the underestimation of surface soil moisture by the default clm4 5 during dry events via upward hr fig 2 similar performance between the hr ryel and hr ak schemes was also reported in simulations of water and carbon cycles at different ameriflux sites fu et al 2018b bks smf and gch sites were free of winter soil freezing whereas soil freezing occurred at gdk and gt sites incorporation of the hr ak scheme predicted less surface and deep soil water at gdk and gt sites respectively with the onset of spring thaw and induced synchronous underestimation of et and ecosystem carbon uptake at both sites figs 2 6 and 8 which gradually vanished during the growing season figs 6 and 8 global scale simulations conducted by tang et al 2015 showed that the performance of the hr ak scheme in simulating et was better from april to august than in other months in regions north of 20 n and the higher et predicted for october december in that study was consistent with that at gt site during the soil freezing period fig 6 our results show that the simple ryel hr scheme performed better than the physically based hr ak scheme especially at gt site which located in the unique qinghai tibet plateau assessment of hr processes and their interplay with plant physiological and soil properties requires further investigation in various ecosystems using different hr schemes such studies could elucidate large uncertainties in the quantification of hydrological and ecological processes in lsms sulis et al 2019 5 conclusions in the present study we incorporated two hr schemes into clm4 5 and applied it to five forested sites in asia with different ecosystem and climate types the integration of numerical modeling and field measurements provided insights into the influences of hr on eco hydrological patterns of water and carbon cycles the key findings of this study are as follows a the incorporation of two hr formulations into clm4 5 improved the fit of simulated results and observations for water and carbon fluxes at five forested sites with different ecosystems and contrasting climate regimes in asia b clm4 5 performed better with the simple hr ryel scheme than with the physically based hr ak scheme for ecosystems with seasonal frozen soil layers c hydraulic lift upward hr stimulated surface soil moisture and increased et by 0 29 0 68 mm h2o day 1 and net ecosystem carbon uptake by 1 03 10 6 to 1 64 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 at the five forested sites during dry events hydraulic lift is of great significance during extreme drought events due to its potential to prevent ecosystems from approaching zero et non growth and carbon efflux to the atmosphere d remarkable downward hr was only found at the gt site which is located at the northeast margin of the qinghai tibet plateau with alpine and semi arid climate deep stored soil water due to downward hr was supplied to surface soil during subsequent dry event via upward hr to ensure plant physiological activity implying the profound importance of hr for ecosystem carbon sequestration in alpine and semi arid climates e combined with previous studies at ameriflux sites it can be concluded that climate zones with overlapped dry season and growing season showed clear hydraulic lift during dry season climate zones with overlapped wet season and growing season showed clear hydraulic descent if precipitation was limited e g 400 mm a 1 and did not showed clear influences of hr if the precipitation was unlimited e g 800 mm a 1 to accurately demonstrate the complex influences of hr on water and carbon cycles e g long term effects of hydraulic descent on the ecosystem and the role of hr under global warming further indoor experiments field monitoring and combined observational and modeling studies are required credit

5423,recent studies have incorporated hydraulic redistribution hr schemes into earth system models to explore its effects on the hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes of terrestrial ecosystems however the influence of hr on ecosystems during increasingly frequent extreme drought events and the performance of different hr schemes at sites with contrasting ecosystem types and climate regimes remains unclear especially among ecologically fragile forest ecosystems in asia in this study we incorporated two different hr schemes into community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 the model generally improved predictions of soil moisture evapotranspiration et and carbon c fluxes at five asiaflux sites with contrasting climate regimes upward hr stimulated surface soil moisture and increased et by 0 29 0 68 mm h2o day 1 and net ecosystem c uptake by 1 03 10 6 to 1 64 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 at the five forest sites during dry events remarkable downward hr was found only in a semi arid ecosystem located at the northeastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau incorporating of a simple empirical hr scheme into clm4 5 yielded better performance than incorporating a physically based scheme into the model for ecosystems with seasonal frozen soil layers combined with previous studies at ameriflux sites it can be concluded that climate zones with overlapped dry season and growing season showed clear hydraulic lift during dry season climate zones with overlapped wet season and growing season showed clear hydraulic descent if precipitation was limited e g 400 mm a 1 and did not showed clear influences of hr if the precipitation was unlimited e g 800 mm a 1 keywords asiaflux community land model evapotranspiration hydraulic redistribution net ecosystem carbon exchange soil moisture 1 introduction hydraulic redistribution hr plays a non negligible role in the redistribution of water by roots within the soil profile hr has been documented in a wide range of experimental and numerical studies for different ecosystems and plant species ryel et al 2002 amenu and kumar 2008 neumann and cardon 2012 sulis et al 2019 hr includes the hydraulic lift of water from moist deep soils to dry shallow soils during dry periods richards and caldwell 1987 the hydraulic descent of water usually following a precipitation event burgess et al 1998 and lateral water transport smart et al 2005 hydraulic lift usually occurs at night during the dry season and is generally the most evident form of hr whereas hydraulic descent typically occurs only when overall annual rainfall is limited and the deep soil layer is unsaturated even during rainy seasons scott et al 2008 fu et al 2018b hr affects soil moisture evapotranspiration et soil organic matter decomposition nitrogen mineralization and immobilization plant growth and greenhouse gas e g co2 n2o emissions fu et al 2018a 2018b thus the influence of hr on water carbon and nitrogen cycles is broad and complex empirical studies have shown that hr can vary by nearly two orders across certain ecosystems 0 04 1 3 mm h2o d 1 neumann and cardon 2012 fu et al 2016 however many uncertainties remain with respect to the magnitude of hr and its effects among diverse ecosystems modeling studies have incorporated different formulations of hr into land surface models lsms in an attempt to elucidate uncertainties in the quantification of hydrological and ecological processes for example zheng and wang 2007 incorporated an empirical hr scheme developed by ryel et al 2002 into community land model version 3 clm3 improving simulations of latent heat flux at the reserva biológica do jaru site in amazonia fu et al 2016 incorporated the same hr scheme into clm4 5 and applied it to eight ameriflux sites clearly improving model performance in terms of simulating et the bowen ratio and soil moisture during the dry season in ecosystems ranging from forest to grassland with vegetation including desert perennials and annuals tang et al 2015 incorporated a frequently used and physically based hr scheme proposed by amenu and kumar 2008 into clm4 5 and reported improvements in simulated seasonal et cycles at a forested site in california but no improvement at a forested site in amazonia lee et al 2018 combined the hr scheme proposed by amenu and kumar 2008 with a one dimensional 1d ecohydrological model and simulated vegetation water use patterns in a semi arid savanna ecosystem in southern arizona they reported hydraulic descent during the wet monsoon season and hydraulic lift between precipitation events similar directional changes in hr between wet and dry seasons were also reported by fu et al 2016 for the same savanna ecosystem based on a clm4 5 simulation using the ryel et al 2002 hr scheme despite the contributions of these studies the incorporation of hr schemes into lsms has not yet been studied sufficiently to verify its performance for different vegetation types in various climate zones to date we have not found studies that investigate the hr s influences in different asian climate zones e g tropical rainforest humid subtropical hot summer continental and the dry tundra climate the magnitude form hydraulic lift or descent and occurring time of hr as well as hr s influences on the water and carbon cycles in different asian climate zones all remain unknown in addition a wide range of modeling studies have reported large uncertainties in the simulated magnitude of hr and its biogeochemical effects on ecosystems neumann and cardon 2012 fu et al 2018b which vary by the numerical schemes and implementations used tang et al 2015 the influences of hr schemes on the simulated occurrence and magnitude of hr also need further investigations previous studies have demonstrated hr in seasonally dry ecosystems fu et al 2018a however it remains unclear whether hr plays a role in dry events occurring outside of dry seasons global warming has increased the frequency and severity of extreme drought and flood events allan and soden 2008 utsumi et al 2011 wang et al 2017 and may consequently affect the occurrence of hr and its ecological impact on plant community structure and function sulis et al 2019 more studies combining measurements and modeling are urgently needed to determine the influence of hr on diverse ecosystems during dry events occurring in wet season fu et al 2016 in this study we selected five forested sites in asia ranging from spruce to deciduous and tropical forests and from semi arid and continental climate to tropical forest climate we incorporated one empirical and one physical hr scheme into clm4 5 and applied the hybrid model to the five sites the objectives of this study were a to investigate the magnitude form and occurring time of hr and the potential impact of hr on water and carbon cycles at the study sites b to explore the role of hr during dry season wet season and dry events occurring in wet season and c to analyze the performance of various hr schemes in simulating water and carbon cycles in different climate regions and ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data this study focused on five forested sites with vegetation ranging from evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests to needleleaf forest and bamboo in different climatic regions of asia including the bukit soeharto education forest site bks in indonesia gwangreung deciduous forest site gdk in republic of korea seto mixed forest site smf in japan guantan spruce forest site gt in northwestern china and gaochun bamboo forest site gch in eastern china fig 1 an important criterion when selecting these five sites was a clear increase in surface 0 30 cm soil moisture at night during dry seasons which is an indicator of hr

and surface properties including coverage of different plant functional types pfts leaf area index lai canopy height soil texture and soil organic matter content it is worth mentioning that moso bamboo is not included in the default pfts in clm4 5 and we treated it as temperate broadleaf evergreen forest in the present study based on previous simulations fu et al 2018c also the moso bamboo was not fertilized during our simulation period soil layers and pft level root fractions in the model were previously described in detail fu et al 2016 we used the single point mode of the clm model for each plot 2 3 hr scheme to quantify hr we incorporated two schemes based on those of ryel et al 2002 and amenu and kumar 2008 into clm4 5 the former scheme empirically describes hr flux based on the soil water potential gradient between two soil layers the hr induced net water movement into layer i from layer j was calculated as 1 q h r i j c rt δ ϕ m c j f root i f root j 1 f root j d where c rt is the maximum radial soil root conductance of water among the entire active root system cm mpa 1h 1 δϕ m is the water potential difference between the two soil layers mpa simulated using a non steady state richards equation in clm4 5 f root i and f root j are root fractions in soil layers i and j weighted average of pft level root fractions zeng 2001 d is a switching factor set to 1 0 at night and 0 0 during the day assuming that water movement among soil layers via roots occurs only at night when the plant is not transpiring and cj is a factor reducing soil root conductance for water in a given layer and can be expressed as 2 c j 1 1 ϕ j ϕ 50 b where ϕj is the soil water potential of layer j mpa ϕ 50 is that where soil root conductance is reduced by 50 mpa and b is an empirical constant due to a lack of site specific parameters the values of b and ϕ 50 were obtained from ryel et al 2002 as 3 22 and 1 mpa respectively the physically based method of amenu and kumar 2008 calculates hr flux based on a non steady state richards equation for soil and a steady state richards equation for roots 3 θ t z k s ϕ s z 1 k r r a d ϕ s ϕ r 4 z k r a x ϕ r z 1 k r r a d ϕ s ϕ r where θ is the volumetric soil water content k s kr rad and kr ax are soil hydraulic conductivity and root system hydraulic conductivity in the radial and axial directions respectively and ϕ s and ϕ r are water potentials in the soil and roots respectively we replaced the default richards equation in clm with eq 3 added eq 4 and moved the transpiration term from the richards equation for soil to that for roots eqs 3 and 4 were discretized into tridiagonal systems the solution was obtained using a method based on that of tang et al 2015 hr flux in a given soil layer at a specific time step was calculated using the right hand side of equation 4 for ϕ s ϕ r root system hydraulic conductivity in the radial k r rad and axial k r ax directions are empirical parameters provided by amenu and kumar 2008 based on previous model parameter sensitivity studies fu et al 2016 fu et al 2018a and modeling results for parameter sensitivity analysis could be found in fig s11 in fu et al 2016 and in fig s1 in fu et al 2018a we tuned the sensitive parameters for hr flux c rt k r rad and k r ax in both schemes by comparing modeled and measured magnitudes of diurnal water content dynamics in the upper soil layers 0 30 cm during dry seasons we labeled the clm 4 5 modeling runs incorporating the ryel et al 2002 hr scheme and the amenu and kumar 2008 method as simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak respectively and labeled default clm 4 5 model runs as simulation nohr we used a two stage spin up method to obtain stable vertical soil carbon distribution as initial conditions for these simulations an accelerated decomposition spin up and normal spin up run were operated successively for 1000 and 200 years respectively kluzek 2013 spin up runs were done with the ryel et al s hr scheme included further information on spin up methodologies for clm4 5 were provided by oleson et al 2013 hr and its impact on water and carbon cycles were investigated during dry seasons season wet season and dry events at the five selected sites due to the different climate type table 1 the dry season usually comes from may to october at bks site from october to next march at gdk smf and gch sites and from october to next april at gt site zhan et al 2016 dry events with different intensities happened from 2010 7 30 to 2010 8 30 at gt site from 2001 8 28 to 2001 9 21 at bks site from 2016 8 23 to 2016 9 24 at gch site from 2006 9 22 to 2006 10 27 at gdk site and from 2007 7 15 to 2007 9 2 at smf site identified by the dynamics of the surface soil moisture 0 30 cm fig 2 2 4 statistic analyses standardized taylor diagrams were used to display statistical comparisons between modeled and measured time series data on soil moisture et nee and or gpp at the five sites taylor 2001 root mean square error rmse between the observed data and simulated results during dry season wet season and dry events occurring in wet season was used to evaluate the performance of the default and modified models and was calculated as follows 5 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 where p i and o i are the simulated and observed data respectively and n is the total number of observations 3 results 3 1 effects of hr on soil moisture the observed soil moisture and that simulated by simulation nohr simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak at a weekly timescale for selected years are plotted in fig 2 at bks gch and smf sites soil moisture in all three simulations generally followed the magnitude and dynamics of observational data with correlation coefficients r 0 6 figs 2g n and 3 simulation nohr simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak roughly reproduced seasonal changes in soil moisture at different depths at gt site r 0 41 0 90 however the three simulations performed less well during the non growing seasons at gt site especially at depths of 20 120 cm fig 2c f at gdk site both simulation nohr and simulation hr ryel simulated soil moisture well r 0 52 and 0 55 whereas the simulation with hr ak scheme underestimated soil moisture at depths of 0 30 cm during spring thaw r 0 47 figs 2o and 3 as described in section 2 3 hr equation parameters were calibrated based on the magnitude of diurnal soil moisture fluctuation observed and simulated magnitudes are shown in fig 4 both simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak largely captured the amplitude of hr induced diel soil moisture fluctuations during dry events at the five sites fig 4 briefly hr incorporation increased the correlation coefficient and decreased rmse in soil moisture simulations during dry events for example compared to simulation nohr simulation hr ryel simulation hr ak increased the correlation coefficient from 0 74 to 0 83 to 0 85 0 87 0 83 0 84 at depths of 10 50 cm at smf site from 0 37 to 0 86 to 0 48 0 98 0 50 0 97 at depths of 10 and 50 cm at bks site and from 0 90 to 0 93 0 91 at depths of 0 30 cm at gdk site as shown in fig 5 a both simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak clearly decreased rmse at all five sites during dry events and simulation hr ryel decreased rmse to a greater extent than simulation hr ak at all sites except gdk fig 5a the simulation results showed clear hydraulic descent during spring and summer at gt site indicated by hr induced soil moisture decrease and increase in shallow and deeper soil layers respectively fig 2a f downward hr hydraulic descent transported water from shallow soil layers to layers deeper than 80 cm in the simulation hr ryel simulation fig 2f in contrast hydraulic lift characterized by a clear increase in surface soil moisture occurred at the other four sites during dry events fig 2 for example hr increased soil moisture at depths of 10 and 50 cm at bks site 5 and 10 cm at gch site 10 20 and 50 cm at smf site and 0 30 cm at gdk site fig 2 hr induced soil moisture changes lasted longest throughout the growing season and were largest at gt site fig 2 3 2 effects of hr on et model performance in terms of simulating et at all five sites at a weekly timescale for selected years is shown in fig 6 the simulated results by clm4 5 with and without hr schemes generally followed the magnitude and dynamics demonstrated in observational or modis et data at gt gch gdk and smf sites with correlation coefficients between simulated and observed or modis et generally 0 58 fig 3 the correlation coefficient was small 0 10 at bks site fig 3 due to unclear et variation throughout the year fig 6b however simulated mean et values 3 01 and 3 03 mm day 1 from simulation hr ryel and simulation hr ak respectively were quite close to that of modis 2 96 mm day 1 at bks site fig 6 simulation hr ak underestimated et to some extent by 0 20 mm day 1 at gt site fig 6a although increases in the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed modis et were limited after hr was included fig 3 hr incorporation decreased the simulated rmse for et during dry events except for simulation hr ak at gt site fig 5b increases decreases in rmse in et simulations were limited at the yearly scale fig 3 hr incorporation increased modeled et to varying degrees at the five sites during dry events ranging from 0 29 mm day 1 at gdk site to 0 68 mm day 1 at gch site fig 6 et simulated by simulation nohr approached zero when extreme drought events occurred in august 2010 at gt site and august 2016 at gch site fig 6a c in contrast simulated et increased due to hr incorporation approaching observed or modis et values obtained using simulation hr ryel at gt and using both hr schemes at gch fig 6a c unlike the other four sites hr decreased et during the growing season at gt due to clear hydraulic descent figs 2a and 6a at the sub daily temporal scale the simulation of diurnal et was improved after incorporating both hr schemes at smf site and the hr ryel scheme at gt site although the improvement was smaller at gdk and bks sites fig 7 no observed sub daily et data were available at gch site hr induced increases in simulated et during dry events were mainly attributed to increased plant transpiration at the five sites fig 7 due to clear hydraulic decent at gt during wet seasons the diel et peak obtained by simulation hr ryel was lower than the value obtained by simulation nohr at gt site during wet periods fig 7 hr induced changes in simulated et were limited during wet periods at the other four sites fig 7 3 3 effects of hr on nee positive negative nee values indicate net co2 release to net co2 uptake from the atmosphere as shown in fig 8 the seasonal dynamics of nee were roughly reproduced at gt bks gdk and smf sites using clm with or without hr except for simulation hr ak at gt site fig 8 gpp was also simulated well at gch site correlation coefficient 0 62 0 66 figs 3 and 8d where no nee data were available at gt site observed nee was close to zero during winter whereas all three clm simulations predicted co2 efflux to the atmosphere positive nee fig 8a winter co2 efflux to the atmosphere in clm modeling was also reported at ameriflux sites in southern california and washington state possibly due to the oversensitivity of clm to cold temperatures and consequent underestimation of winter photosynthesis fu et al 2018a 2018b 2018c the imperfect nee simulation correlation coefficient 0 14 0 15 at smf was caused by observation noise fig 8e according to the simulation results the largest effect of hr on the carbon cycle nee was found at gt site where simulation hr ryel performed better than simulation hr ak fig 8a at gt site hr decreased co2 uptake from the atmosphere during april may and increased co2 uptake or decreased co2 efflux to the atmosphere e g in august 2010 by an average of 1 64 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 during july august fig 8a the second largest effect occurred at gch site during a severe drought in august 2016 fig 8c when simulation nohr predicted a clear drop in gpp that was not seen in modis data fig 8d hr incorporation clearly increased gpp by an average of 1 98 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 and improved gpp simulation accuracy during drought fig 8d simulation results also showed that hr incorporation decreased co2 efflux to the atmosphere fig 8c hr slightly increased co2 uptake at bks gdk and smf sites during dry events fig 8b e f the corresponding rmse values indicated that the nee simulation was improved by the hr ryel scheme at gt gdk and smf sites and by the hr ak scheme only at smf site during dry events fig 5c the duration of hr effects on nee fig 8 was consistent with that of hr effects on soil moisture fig 2 and et fig 6 at the sub daily temporal scale the simulation of diurnal nee during dry events was improved after incorporating both hr schemes at bks and gdk sites and the hr ryel scheme at gt site although the improvement was smaller at smf site fig 9 a e no observed sub daily nee data were available at gch site due to clear hydraulic decent at gt site the lowest value of diel nee obtained by simulation hr ryel was higher than that obtained by simulation nohr at gt site during wet periods fig 9f hr induced changes in simulated nee were limited during wet periods at the other four sites fig 9g j 4 discussion 4 1 hydraulic lift and decent upward hr is generally the most obvious form of hr it takes place when shallow soil layers are drier than deep layers prieto et al 2012 kennedy et al 2019 based on comparisons with observed soil moisture our simulated results indicated that upward hr occurred during dry events from the driest site in northwestern china with a semi arid climate to the wettest site in indonesia with an equatorial fully humid climate fig 2 using specific examples this hr study shed light on asian regions which have been poorly represented to date in contrast to hydraulic lift downward hr can affect overall ecosystem water budgets by increasing deep soil water recharge such recharge can be faster than that occurring via infiltration or preferential flow after a rain event ryel et al 2003 hydraulic descent may improve whole plant water uptake by removing water from shallow soils evaporation and shallow rooted competitors hultine et al 2003 our soil moisture modeling results indicate that downward hr was dominant throughout the growing season at gt site which is the driest forested site and is dominated by picea crassifolia fig 2 due to hydraulic descent precipitation triggered et was suppressed mainly via plant transpiration and partially through ground evaporation ecosystem carbon uptake was also decreased figs 6a 7 and 8a at gt site some rainwater that was transported via downward hr to become deep soil moisture in 2010 was transported back to the shallow soil layer to be eventually consumed by et during drought event in august figs 2 6a and 7 a combination of downward and upward hr processes helped to sustain ecosystem carbon acquisition during drought figs 8a and 9a at a forest site in northwestern china that was drier than gt site with annual precipitation of only 37 4 mm yu et al 2013 observed hydraulic descent in lateral roots and reduced transpiration in stems of populus euphratica with the onset of heavy rains hydraulic descent was also reported at an ameriflux site with a semi arid savanna ecosystem where downward hr was predicted to reduce rainy season et heterotrophic respiration and net primary production fu et al 2016 fu et al 2018b lee et al 2018 significant hydraulic descent during summer monsoon has also been reported to extend the growing season of mesquites and to support transpiration throughout seasonal dry periods scott et al 2008 the present study and those mentioned above support the occurrence of hydraulic decent in forested ecosystems in typical arid and semi arid regions altering ecosystem et and the carbon cycle by storing water in deep soil via downward hr during wet seasons and releasing deep stored water for plant physiological activity during dry periods lee et al 2018 4 2 effects of hr during drought events previous hr studies have mainly focused on dry seasons whereas the present study explored hr effects on water and carbon cycles during dry events occurring in wet seasons during the severe drought event in august 2016 at gch site simulation results obtained by simulation nohr showed serious underestimates of both et and gpp figs 6c and 8d root uptake from deep soil upward hr at night provided a constant water supply for transpiration which ensured physiological activity during the following day fig 7 thereby increasing ecosystem gpp and carbon uptake figs 8c d and 9c our results indicate that bamboo plants at gch site did not experience severe water stress during the extreme drought event in 2016 due to hydraulic lift in our simulations hydraulic conductivity was represented by c rt and k r rad which controlled the magnitude of hr in the hr ryel and hr ak schemes respectively fu et al 2016 2018a notably the values of these parameters were largest at gch site where an extreme dry event occurred during the growing season but not at gt site which was the driest site table 3 gou et al 2018 reported that clm shut off transpiration when topsoil moisture dropped below the wilting point in a savanna ecosystem they incorporated a root water uptake compensation method into clm to allow plants to exploit deep water sources and capture plant water source shifts the root water uptake compensation method used in gou et al 2018 played a similar role to that of hr in the present study we predict that hr will become important in future simulations of water and carbon cycle effects against the background of increasing frequency and severity of extreme drought events except for simulation hr ak at the gt site the simulated ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration t et during the dry events varied from 0 70 to 0 98 figs 7 and s1 which was within the range of 0 9 1 0 that was reported for the summer t et for 1614 sites across the united states by rigden et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 reported that soil evaporation was negligible and transpiration was equal to evapotranspiration sometimes during the growing season rigden et al 2018 also reported larger t et during summer average 0 90 than that under wet condition average 0 82 in the present study the simulated t et was larger during dry events than that during wet season at the gch gdk smf and bks sites consistent with those in zhou et al 2016 and rigden et al 2018 the larger t et during dry event than that during wet season at gt site was consistent with the finding in stoy et al 2019 which illustrated that dry spells could lead to decreased t et if water limitations stunt vegetation growth and subsequently plant transpiration fig 7 also illustrated that the dry spell reduced et at gt site and et during dry event was clearly smaller than that during wet season which was different from the other four sites dry spells can also lead to decrease t et if water limitations stunt vegetation growth and then plant decrease plant transpiration 4 3 influences of climate on hr clear influences of hr on the water figs 4 and 7 and carbon fig 9 cycles during dry events were found in the present study while hr s influences during dry season at the five asiaflux sites except for the driest gt site fig 5d e and f in the present study were not so clear as those at ameriflux sites in previous studies fu et al 2016 2018a 2018b we attribute the different influences of hr on the water and carbon cycles to climate type including the amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation and the consistence between precipitation and temperature grow season specifically the six sites that had a mediterranean climate with dry summer and wet winter fig 10 b and c in fu et al 2016 were all clearly affected by hr no matter the annual mean precipitation small e g 100 mm at us scw site or large e g 2223 mm at us wrc site in contrast hr s influences on water and carbon cycles were not clear at the us ro1 site fu et al 2018a which had a climate of humid continental with wet summer and dry winter the gch climate humid subtropical gdk climate hot summer continental and smf climate humid subtropical sites in the present study also had a climate with wet summer and dry winter and these three sites were not clearly affected by hr during dry season either similar to the us ro1 site the us ro1 gch gdk and smf sites had a mean annual precipitation of 879 1615 mm clear hydraulic descent was only found at the driest gt site climate tundra with a mean annual precipitation of 435 mm in the present study similarly clear hydraulic descent was found at the us srm site climate cold semi arid with a mean annual precipitation of 377 mm among eight ameriflux sites fu et al 2016 the hydraulic descent at us srm site was recorded by monitoring the sapflow of taproot and lateral root by scott et al 2008 both gt and us srm sites had similar seasonal distribution of precipitation as those at us ro1 gch gdk and smf sites 879 1615 mm where most precipitation occurred in grow season it can be inferred that clear hydraulic descent was caused by the limited precipitation amount namely 400 mm at gt and us srm versus 800 mm at us ro1 gch gdk and smf sites figs 10 and s2 the seasonal distribution of precipitation at the two tropical sites namely the bks and br sa1 sites was kind of similar to those at the six sites with a mediterranean climate fig 10 but hr s influences on the two tropical sites were clearly less obvious than those at the six sites fu et al 2016 the less hr s influences at the two tropical sites were caused by the larger precipitation amount during june august than the six sites with mediterranean climate fig 10a and b overall climate zones with overlapped dry season and growing season showed clear hydraulic lift during dry season climate zones with overlapped wet season and growing season showed clear hydraulic descent if precipitation was limited e g 400 mm a 1 and did not showed clear influences of hr if the precipitation was unlimited e g 800 mm a 1 4 4 comparison of the two hr schemes compared to the hr ryel scheme which is based on the water potential gradient the hr function developed by amenu and kumar 2008 is more physically based as it simulates the path of water movement within the soil root system neumann and cardon 2012 recently zhu et al 2017 attempted to modify the original function of hr ak to work only under weak transpiration conditions in our understanding the purpose of zhu et al 2017 was consistent with the assumption of the hr ryel scheme that hr occurs only at night our modeling results obtained using the hr ryel and hr ak schemes showed minor differences among bks smf and gch sites and both improved the underestimation of surface soil moisture by the default clm4 5 during dry events via upward hr fig 2 similar performance between the hr ryel and hr ak schemes was also reported in simulations of water and carbon cycles at different ameriflux sites fu et al 2018b bks smf and gch sites were free of winter soil freezing whereas soil freezing occurred at gdk and gt sites incorporation of the hr ak scheme predicted less surface and deep soil water at gdk and gt sites respectively with the onset of spring thaw and induced synchronous underestimation of et and ecosystem carbon uptake at both sites figs 2 6 and 8 which gradually vanished during the growing season figs 6 and 8 global scale simulations conducted by tang et al 2015 showed that the performance of the hr ak scheme in simulating et was better from april to august than in other months in regions north of 20 n and the higher et predicted for october december in that study was consistent with that at gt site during the soil freezing period fig 6 our results show that the simple ryel hr scheme performed better than the physically based hr ak scheme especially at gt site which located in the unique qinghai tibet plateau assessment of hr processes and their interplay with plant physiological and soil properties requires further investigation in various ecosystems using different hr schemes such studies could elucidate large uncertainties in the quantification of hydrological and ecological processes in lsms sulis et al 2019 5 conclusions in the present study we incorporated two hr schemes into clm4 5 and applied it to five forested sites in asia with different ecosystem and climate types the integration of numerical modeling and field measurements provided insights into the influences of hr on eco hydrological patterns of water and carbon cycles the key findings of this study are as follows a the incorporation of two hr formulations into clm4 5 improved the fit of simulated results and observations for water and carbon fluxes at five forested sites with different ecosystems and contrasting climate regimes in asia b clm4 5 performed better with the simple hr ryel scheme than with the physically based hr ak scheme for ecosystems with seasonal frozen soil layers c hydraulic lift upward hr stimulated surface soil moisture and increased et by 0 29 0 68 mm h2o day 1 and net ecosystem carbon uptake by 1 03 10 6 to 1 64 10 5 g c m 2 s 1 at the five forested sites during dry events hydraulic lift is of great significance during extreme drought events due to its potential to prevent ecosystems from approaching zero et non growth and carbon efflux to the atmosphere d remarkable downward hr was only found at the gt site which is located at the northeast margin of the qinghai tibet plateau with alpine and semi arid climate deep stored soil water due to downward hr was supplied to surface soil during subsequent dry event via upward hr to ensure plant physiological activity implying the profound importance of hr for ecosystem carbon sequestration in alpine and semi arid climates e combined with previous studies at ameriflux sites it can be concluded that climate zones with overlapped dry season and growing season showed clear hydraulic lift during dry season climate zones with overlapped wet season and growing season showed clear hydraulic descent if precipitation was limited e g 400 mm a 1 and did not showed clear influences of hr if the precipitation was unlimited e g 800 mm a 1 to accurately demonstrate the complex influences of hr on water and carbon cycles e g long term effects of hydraulic descent on the ecosystem and the role of hr under global warming further indoor experiments field monitoring and combined observational and modeling studies are required credit

5424,distributed hydrologic models represent the spatial heterogeneity within the watersheds but are computationally intensive the problem of computational effort is further exacerbated in the process of the model calibration where iterative simulations are performed to estimate optimal parameter values this study evaluates a parameter transfer approach to address this issue and is demonstrated on two watersheds the results indicate that the parameters from a coarse resolution model that can reasonably capture the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed can be used to simulate a fine resolution model with satisfactory performance nse 0 60 in both watersheds the models with transferred parameters did preserve sufficient watershed heterogeneity to still provide acceptable prediction with performance resulting in an nse 0 6 and nse 0 90 for both stream flow and water quality variables respectively at a location upstream the parameter transfer approach can be used with lesser computational effort along with good simulation accuracy if the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed is preserved at the coarse resolution keywords distributed hydrological models calibration of models parameter transfer computational efficiency swat 1 introduction hydrologic models are widely used for decision making in planning and management of water resources at watershed scale these models simulate the hydrological processes and their complex interactions within the watershed to aid the decision maker evaluate the impact of various forcing variables on the watershed hydrology arnold et al 1998 bergion et al 2017 boughton 2005 daniel et al 2011 miller et al 2007 ranatunga et al 2008 these models can be broadly classified into lumped and distributed hydrologic models based on representation of spatial heterogeneity by the model within the watershed lumped models assume spatially homogenous response of the watershed while distributed hydrologic models capture the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrologic processes within the watershed liu and gupta 2007 mendonça et al 2018 sekar and randhir 2007 consequently the latter is preferred over the former for certain applications nonetheless the application of distributed models is majorly constrained by two factors 1 the availability of spatial input data and 2 the high computational demand spatial heterogeneity can be represented in a model using geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques but the resolution of the data is a concern as it influences the number of computational units in the model the computational units in a distributed model are generally the grid cells delineated by discretizing the watershed into grids without considering watershed characteristics various researchers have attempted to improve the computational efficiency of the distributed hydrological models by either reducing the computational units or effectively utilizing the computational resources for instance wood et al 1988 discretized the catchment into representative elementary areas reas based on the topography soil and rainfall patterns similarly other concepts such as discretizing the catchment into functional units argent et al 2009 hillslope patches tague and band 2001 equivalent cross section approach ajami et al 2016 khan et al 2014 clustering approach chaney et al 2018 2016 etc have been used to reduce the computational burden of distributed hydrologic models among different methods one the commonly used approach in some hydrological models is the concept of the hydrological response units hrus as computational units the hrus are defined using the unique combination of the land use the soil and the slope characteristics of the watershed and may not be spatially connected a fine resolution information of the watershed characteristics would certainly be representing spatial heterogeneity effectively but it induces large number of hrus on the contrary a coarse resolution data reduces the number hrus in the model compromising on the representation of spatial variability of the watershed characteristics researchers have also adopted parallel computing frameworks in the distributed hydrological models to improve the computational efficiency liu et al 2014 vivoni et al 2011 however the improvement in computational efficiency by this approach depends on the available computational resources soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed hydrological model that is being applied worldwide for various watershed management applications arnold and fohrer 2005 cibin et al 2014 gassman et al 2007 narasimhan et al 2010 swat model delineates the watershed into sub basins and within the sub basins hrus are defined the hrus in swat model are defined by the unique combination of land use soil and slope classes irrespective of the resolution of the spatial data the swat considers an in built procedure to reduce the computational requirement several hrus at different spatial locations that have the same characteristics are lumped together during the computations to form a single computational unit her et al 2015b neitsch et al 2009 nonetheless the spatial variability of the watershed characteristics is compromised in this procedure also depending on the spatial resolution of the data used while maximum heterogeneity representation is preferable in any distributed hydrological model the swat model allows a compromise on the same by considering a threshold value for soil land use and slope to form an hru neitsch et al 2009 for reducing the computational requirement generally a threshold of 5 15 is adopted for hru in various studies han et al 2012 her et al 2015b sexton et al 2010 srinivasan et al 2010 while reduction of computational units by giving thresholds is an effective way to reduce the computational effort several studies have reported that the value of threshold used to define an hru has a lot of influence on the accuracy of simulations especially the water quality variables her et al 2015b 2017 shabani et al 2017 singh and saraswat 2016 in addition applications such as identification of best management practice bmp and spatial optimization of cropping pattern requires a zero threshold for hru delineation to preserve the representation of unique landscapes in the model chaubey et al 2010 her et al 2015b resulting in large number of computational units consequently a model with large number of hrus would require huge computational effort rathjens and oppelt 2012 further the number of model parameters that require calibration in a distributed hydrological model is affected by the represented spatial heterogeneity indicating numerous iterative simulations during the calibration which again leads to large computational time therefore it is apparent that the modeler compromises between the representation of the spatial heterogeneity and the computational requirement while applying a distributed model for decision making essentially large number of hrus help improve the representation of the spatial heterogeneity but it increases the computational requirement on the other hand relatively small number of hrus brings in a reduction in computational requirement by compromising on the representation of the spatial variability of the watershed characteristics one of the plausible solutions to address this issue is to transfer the calibrated parameters from a coarse resolution model indicating less computational units to a fine resolution model indicating the preservation of unique landscapes transferring the parameters temporally from one time period to another time period has been adopted by many researchers to validate the model abbaspour et al 2007 chaubey et al 2010 liew and garbrecht 2003 vema et al 2017 similarly many researchers have attempted to transfer the parameters spatially across the basins from gauged to ungauged athira et al 2016 cibin et al 2014 sordo ward et al 2016 van emmerik et al 2015 however only few attempts have been made to reduce the computational effort by transferring parameters across the spatial scales within a watershed klotz et al 2017 mizukami et al 2017 troy et al 2008 wang et al 2018 these studies attempted to transfer the parameters of vic model at both temporal and spatial scales over the entire continental united states similarly samaniego et al 2010 developed relationships between the parameters at different spatial resolution to transfer the parameters from coarser scale model to finer resolution model of a distributed hydrological model the procedures adopted in these studies were similar to regionalization athira et al 2016 by calibrating the model for selected sub basins and transferring them to the whole basin daggupati et al 2015 proposed that parameter transfer is possible from coarse resolution model to a fine resolution with fine tuning in a homogenous watershed generally distributed hydrologic models comprise of large number of unknown parameters and model s efficacy in simulating the hydrological processes depends on accurate estimation of these parameters through calibration the parameters in swat model or any other distributed hydrologic model exist at different spatial scales for example some parameters are at watershed level while some are at sub basin level or at hru level ideally all of them are to be calibrated but it increases the complexity of the optimization during calibration therefore a generic procedure is to uniformly perturb the parameters across the watershed at different spatial scale from their default value which is set based on watershed characteristics so that the spatial heterogeneity is maintained for instance curve number cn in swat model is a parameter that depends on the land use and soil characteristics and therefore may have varying values across the watershed depending on the heterogeneity therefore during the model setup default values are assigned to cn based on the watershed characteristics and these values are given uniform perturbation during calibration on the contrary the parameter surlag which is a surface runoff lag coefficient in swat is a watershed level parameter and it takes a uniform value across the watershed therefore the computational complexity is not majorly due to the large number of parameters in model that is set up based on fine resolution spatial data but due the presence of large number of computational units hrus therefore the optimal perturbations for spatially varying parameters obtained for a coarse model during calibration and the optimal values obtained for watershed level parameters could be transferred to a fine model without compromising on the heterogeneity of the watershed the primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the applicability and computational effectiveness of this parameter transfer approach on a watershed and the swat model is considered for illustration the study also evaluates the impact of the model resolution on the calibrated parameters further the efficacy of the parameter transfer approach from various levels of coarse resolution models to fine resolution model is also assessed the models set up in fine and coarse resolutions are obtained with varying threshold values for hru delineation 2 methodology 2 1 study area and model setup this study is carried out on two agricultural watersheds st joseph watershed and mississinewa watershed in the state of indiana usa the st joseph watershed is located in the southwest portion of the lower peninsula of michigan northwest ohio and the northwestern portion of indiana fig 1 the watershed spans through seven counties viz allen dekalb noble and steuben in indiana state hillsdale in michigan state williams and defiance in ohio state encompassing an area of 2800 km2 the watershed is flat to hilly terrain with 66 of the area under 3 slope the watershed has a mixed land use with 37 cropland under corn soybean rotation 25 pasture 12 forest 10 urban areas 7 forest wetlands and other smaller agricultural fields 6 the dominant soil type is loam and fine loam occupying 81 of the watershed area the long term average annual precipitation 1990 2010 is about 992 mm and average annual temperature is 9 5 c cibin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 from the watershed characteristics presented above it is clear that the st joseph watershed is a spatially heterogeneous watershed the mississinewa watershed is a part of the wabash river basin in the eastern indiana and a small portion of western ohio in the united states fig 1 encompassing an area of 2245 km2 the mississinewa watershed is an agricultural watershed with around 70 of the land use is under corn soybean rotation the next major land use of the watershed is forest covering 10 of the watershed area the major soils in the watershed are blount and glynwood which covers 80 of the total watershed area there are several minor soil types having a share of less than 5 in the watershed the mean slope of the watershed is around 2 7 and poorly drained soils in the agricultural fields are tile drained the mean annual precipitation of the basin is 1085 mm and mean annual temperature is 12 4 c the swat model was been set up for both the watersheds using the required data from various sources the inputs to the model include digital elevation model dem land use cover soil data and weather parameters the dem i e the elevation data with 30 m resolution was obtained from national elevation dataset ned nad 83 the land use data for the watershed was collected from the cropland data layer cdl the usda nrcs maintains the soil survey geographic database ssurgo which is used in the study arcswat was used to parameterize both the watersheds and all the data layers were projected to nad 83 utm 16n coordinate system weather data precipitation minimum and maximum temperature for swat model simulation was obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc the dem the weather data and the land use soil slope were given as input to the swat model the slope within the watershed was divided into 3 classes 0 2 2 5 and 5 for both the watersheds the current analysis was performed by setting up the swat model for both the watersheds using different spatial configurations as mentioned earlier swat model allows users to define two thresholds the channel initiation threshold and hru definition threshold the channel initiation threshold is applied to define the sub basin boundaries and consequently the number of sub basins delineated within the watershed in this study we have fixed the channel initiation threshold to approximately represent the stream network in the watershed and modified the hru threshold to develop models with different spatial configurations the swat model delineates sub basins into smaller hrus by considering the heterogeneity in the land use soil and slope swat allows user to specify the threshold for hru delineation to reduce the number of computational units the hrus which fall below the threshold are redistributed to the remaining hrus a model with higher threshold for hru definition would result in a watershed with relatively less number of land use slope and soil classes as compared to a model with lower threshold for hru definition the detailed explanation on the redistribution of hrus within the swat model is provided in her et al 2015b the configurations of the models for the two watersheds considered in this study i e hru threshold number of delineated sub basins and hrus and number of land use and soil classes represented within the model are presented in table 1 a total of 5 different configurations considering different thresholds are considered during the analysis the hru threshold was varied from 0 to 15 for each of land use soil and slope classes within the sub basins in addition a model configuration with each sub basin as a single hru which has the largest area dominant within the sub basin is also considered the considered models are named accordingly see table 1 for instance the model sj0 refers to a swat model for st joseph watershed with a threshold of 0 for land use soil and slope classes similarly the model ms10 refers to model for mississinewa watershed with a threshold of 10 for the land use soil and slope classes the models with 0 threshold for both the watersheds can be considered as fine resolution models as complete spatial heterogeneity is represented the swat model was setup for a period of 22 years 1990 2011 for st joseph watershed and for 17 years 1992 2008 for the mississinewa watershed with first three years considered as warm up period while there are 29 parameters of the swat model that influence the simulation of stream flow arabi et al 2007 only the sensitive parameters reported in the literature for both the watersheds were considered table 2 in this study multi site calibration was performed for both the watersheds to preserve the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed both the watersheds have two usgs gauging stations one at the watershed outlet and another at an upstream intermediate location fig 1 the models for st joseph watershed were calibrated using the daily stream flow data from the usgs gauging station 04180500 watershed outlet and 04178000 intermediate location the models for mississinewa watershed were calibrated using the daily stream flow data from the usgs gauging station 03326500 watershed outlet and 03325500 intermediate location the calibration period for the st joseph watersheds was for 10 years from 1993 and 9 years from 1995 for mississinewa watershed the remaining simulation period for both the watersheds was considered as validation period the model was calibrated for the objective function of maximizing nash sutcliff efficiency nse 2 2 parameter transfer approach the parameter transfer approach aims at reducing the computational burden of calibrating a fine resolution distributed hydrologic model this is achieved by transferring the parameters calibrated on a coarse resolution distributed hydrologic model to a fine resolution distributed hydrologic model the applicability and computational effectiveness of this approach is testes in this study using swat as hydrologic model the generic form of the hydrologic model can be written as y f x λ where f is the function describing the hydrologic model swat in this study y is the vector containing the outputs of the model x is the vector of inputs to the model and λ represents the set of parameters of the model the set of parameters of the model are estimated using the observed outputs and is described as λ g x o y o λ c g c x o y o where g is the inverse function of the hydrologic model x o is the input data for the model f and y o is the observed outputs of the model the parameters are initially estimated for a coarse resolution distributed hydrologic model g c and are denoted as λ c the parameters λ c are transferred to a fine resolution model to estimate the parameters y f fn x fn λ c where f fn is the functional form of fine resolution hydrologic model and x fn is the fine resolution input data 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the models the swat models for both the watersheds representing different levels of the spatial heterogeneity were calibrated through an automatic calibration procedure using amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 as optimizer maximizing nash sutcliffe efficiency was considered as the objective function and 1500 model evaluations 100 population size arrived at by trial and error approach were performed it is to note that the model sj0 with 43 672 hrus could not be calibrated due to the extensive computational effort required and limited availability of computational resources the variability in the performance of the models at both the sites in the last generation in both calibration and validation period are plotted in fig 2 all the nine models were sufficiently calibrated with a satisfactory performance of nse greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 for all the model evaluations further the narrow spread of the performance amongst the population suggests that the optimizer has converged to near optimal solution the performance of the models during calibration and validation are in agreement with that reported for both the basins by other researchers athira 2015 cibin et al 2016 femeena et al 2018 wang et al 2017 and the values indicate a good performance according to moriasi et al 2007 from the last generation the best performing set parameter set corresponding to maximum nse was selected for each of the model and the models performance in terms of nse at the watershed outlet is reported in table 3 diagonal elements in calibration and validation note that the table 3 contains information about the model performance after the parameter transfer also which are discussed in later sections among the four models calibrated for the st joseph watershed sjd performed the best with an nse of 0 79 and 0 75 for calibration and validation periods respectively similarly the best performing set of the model with dominant hru for the mississinewa watershed msd performed relatively better than other models with an nse of 0 67 during calibration and 0 61 during validation periods it is to note that the performance of the models for the mississinewa watershed was similar across different models while there was a slight difference in the performance of models for the st joseph watershed this can be attributed to the spatially homogenous land use in the mississinewa watershed as compared to the st joseph watershed in both the watersheds the models with dominant hru as configuration performed slightly better than the other models one of the plausible reasons for better performance of these models is the reduced search space for the optimizer due to less number of decision variables since the maximum number of function evaluations were same in calibration of all the models the model with less number of decision variables usually converge faster while the models sjd and msd performed better than others the watershed is represented as homogenous land parcels within a sub basin and thus do not represent the spatial heterogeneity well therefore additional investigation in terms of the model s simulation of the water balance components needs to be ascertained before application of the models sjd and msd for decision making further it is important to look at the parameter variability across the calibrated models to evaluate the impact of the model resolution on the estimated parameters 3 2 optimal parameter ranges for different calibrated models the range of parameters in the last generation is generally a reduced range in which the performance of the model is close to the global optima this range gives an indication of the parameters range in which the calibrated parameter lies for the model in the watershed therefore the parameter ranges obtained from the last generation of the optimization of different models were compared to evaluate the impact of model resolution on the estimated parameters in this analysis only 4 highly sensitive parameters cn f sol awc surlag and slsubbsn as reported in the literature athira 2015 cibin et al 2010 femeena et al 2018 in both the watersheds are considered for brevity and the variability within the last generation is presented as box plots in figs 3 and 4 for st joseph and mississinewa watersheds respectively a significant difference is observed between the ranges of parameters obtained for model sjd compared to the other 3 models fig 3 the models sj5 sj10 and sj15 represent the spatial heterogeneity fairly well within the watershed while spatial representation is mostly homogenous within a sub basin in model sjd a comparison of the optimal ranges indicates that there is a compromise on the model parameter to account for the lower representation of the spatial heterogeneity for instance the parameter cn f is positively changed for model sjd indicating an increase in the simulated flow while there is a negative change for the remaining three models similarly the slsubbsn parameter which accounts for the time of concentration within the sub basin has significant difference a cross examination of the spatial variability of the land use fig 6 a showed that land use pattern of models sj5 and sj10 were similar with approximately 40 area under corn soybean rotation while land use under corn soybean rotation was found to be around 60 for model sjd since it considered dominant hru in sub basin further the comparison of the land cover patterns for different models show that percentage land cover of different classes of sj5 and sj10 was similar to that of sj0 with minor variations the model sjd has soybean followed by pasture as the dominant land uses while the pasture is the dominant land use in sj0 sj5 and sj10 models the reduced ranges of parameters for the models for the mississinewa watershed showed similar ranges across the models the only significant difference in the parameter range was observed for surlag parameter fig 4 which is a parameter for stream flow lag from the sub basin the parameter surlag for the model msd was higher compared to other 4 models indicating more lagged flow at the sub basin level while there was no clear variability in the parameter ranges across different models the combination of parameters might result in different simulations the similarity in the parameter ranges of different models can be attributed to a relatively homogenous land use under corn soybean rotation 70 within the watershed a comparison of the contributing land use classes within different models suggest that as the threshold is increasing the land cover under row crop is increasing while land cover under pasture is reducing fig 6 b in the model msd 95 of the watershed area is represented as the row crops i e corn and soybean similar to the case of the st joseph watershed the land use pattern of the model with 5 threshold ms5 matches closely with fine resolution model ms0 this variability in the optimal parameter ranges in st joseph watershed particularly leads to the following inferences 1 in automatic calibration procedures the model parameters are adjusted such that the impact of lower representation of the watershed spatial heterogeneity is nullified and 2 the parameters from the model with 5 threshold for hru which is moderately coarse can be transferred to the fine resolution model with 0 threshold consequently the calibrated values of parameters were transferred from one model to the others and their simulation performance was evaluated 3 3 models performance after parameter transfer the parameter transfer approach is evaluated by transferring the last generation parameter sets of the coarse resolution models sj5 sj10 sj15 sjd ms5 ms10 ms15 and msd to the fine resolution models sj0 and ms0 of the respective watersheds the swat parameters are at different levels some parameters are at sub basin level while others are at hru level the swat parameters which are at the sub basin level are usually spatially homogenous and are modified as absolute values i e a particular value is assigned to it for the whole basin the hru level parameters depend on the hru for instance curve number of two different hrus would be entirely different in order to preserve this spatial variability of the hru level parameters these parameters are changed relative to the default values as mentioned in table 2 some of the parameters are absolute while other are relative the absolute parameters are transferred directly from the coarse resolution model to fine resolution model the relative parameters are perturbations from the default value of the parameters these parameters are perturbed in the fine resolution model using the calibrated value of perturbation in coarse resolution model the fine resolution models of st joseph watershed with parameter sets from the models sj5 sj10 sj15 and sjd are termed as sj0sj5 sj0sj10 sj0sj15 and sj0sjd respectively the subscript after the model name indicates the model name from which the calibrated parameter sets is used for the model simulation similarly for the mississinewa watershed the fine resolution model ms0 with parameters from coarse resolution models ms5 ms10 ms15 and msd are termed as ms0ms5 ms0ms10 ms0ms15 and ms0msd respectively the performance of these models for the calibration and validation datasets at the watershed and intermediate outlet for the last generation of parameters is presented in fig 5 the results for the st joseph watershed show that performance of the sj0 model with parameters from sj5 sj10 and sj15 performed satisfactorily with an nse 0 6 in all cases while the performance of fine resolution model sj0 with parameters from dominant hru model sjd were found to be unsatisfactory the results of the mississinewa watershed showed similar trend with satisfactory performance of models ms0ms5 and ms0ms10 while the performance of ms0ms15 and ms0msd were found to be unsatisfactory among all the models of the mississinewa watershed with transferred parameters the model ms0ms5 performance was in similar range to that of calibrated ms0 model for further analysis the best parameter set parameter set corresponding to maximum nse of the model of a model was transferred to other models of the watershed and their performance was evaluated the performance statistic nse computed at the watershed outlet for all the models simulated by transferring the calibrated parameters from other models is presented in table 3 the results for the st joseph watershed indicate that the performance of the model sj0sj5 sj0sj10 and sj0sj15 was acceptable with an nse of greater than 0 7 for the models while the performance of the sj0 model simulated using the parameter set obtained from the dominant hru model sjd was not satisfactory nse 0 5 similar results were obtained in the case of mississinewa watershed with model ms0 performing satisfactorily for the parameter sets derived from models ms5 and ms10 while the performance was not satisfactory for parameter sets from other models a cross examination of the ms0 models performance using the parameters obtained from calibrating the models ms0 ms5 and ms10 indicate that the performance was best for the model ms0 with its own calibrated parameters however the model performance of ms0 with calibrated parameters from ms5 ms0ms5 was similar to that of calibrated ms0 model with slight reduction the performance of the models setup using fine resolution configuration sj0 and ms0 was worst with the parameters derived from the dominant hru models sjd and msd a comparison of the land use patterns represented within the model for both watersheds is presented in fig 6 the similarity in the land use pattern represented in the models sj0 and sj5 is reflected in comparable performance of the models sj5 and sj0sj5 while the models sj0sj10 and sj0sj15 also performed satisfactorily nse 0 7 for both models the deviation of the land use pattern was more with additional area under soybean and pasture and area under urban and forest reducing the computational requirements increase with increasing resolution of the models the close matching of the land use pattern of sj0 and sj5 prompted in considering the model sj0sj5 for further application even though the computational requirement of sj10 and sj15 is less compared to sj5 the comparison of the land use pattern of different models for the mississinewa watershed show that land use pattern of ms0 and ms5 are similar in general with the exception of others land use class in ms5 the complete reclassification of the others land use classes in the ms5 model might be the plausible reason for reduced performance of ms0ms5 as compared to calibrated ms0 the deterioration of the performance of the ms0 model using the parameters from the coarse resolution models is evident from the land use patterns represented in the models as the spatial land use representation moves from fine to coarse resolution the land use under soybean significantly increases in the models of mississinewa watershed the average annual water balance components of the fine resolution model with transferred parameters along without transferring the parameters are compared fig 7 the results indicate that the simulation of water balance components in the model ms0msd is significantly different from other models while other models had similar average annual values for the water balance components the model ms0 had more ground water flow component compared to others the model ms0ms5 was considered for further analysis owing to similarity in the land use patterns of the ms0 and ms5 and the satisfactory performance of the ms0ms5 the swat model is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and simulates other watershed processes such as nutrient transport sediment transport crop growth etc in addition to stream flow the swat model has been extensively used in application for evaluation of bmp to impede the nutrient and sediment delivery to the downstream reaches arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 generally the adopted calibration strategy for swat model is to calibrate the stream flow parameters first followed by parameters affecting sediment and finally calibrate the parameters that influence the nutrient transport therefore parameters calibrated for flow would have an impact on the consequent parameters of the sediment and nutrient transport thus it is imperative to evaluate the impact of parameter transfer on the simulation of the nitrate phosphate and sediment transport of the swat model the simulation of the transport of total nitrate total phosphate and sediment at the watershed outlet for the two models model ms0 and model ms0ms5 is compared and presented in fig 8 a c and e the data follows1 1 line and indicate that the simulation of these processes in both the models is very similar suggesting that the impact of the parameter transfer is minimum on simulation of stream flow and water quality variables the resulting nse for this analysis was more than 0 95 in all cases the preservation of heterogeneity in model is important for effective simulation of the hydrological processes in space accordingly the simulations at the intermediate outlet of the models were evaluated to verify the impact of parameter transfer on the spatial simulation by the swat model since the fine resolution model for st joseph watershed sj0 could not be calibrated due to computational limitations only the simulated flow from sj0sj5 model was compared with the observed flow the high nse observed in the stream flow simulations of sj0sj5 at the intermediate location fig 5 indicate good spatial simulation by the model the simulation of the total nitrate phosphate and sediment at the intermediate outlet of ms0ms5 was compared with that ms0 model as no observed records were available the simulation results are presented as scatter plots in fig 8 b d and f the results indicate that simulation by model ms0 and model ms0ms5 are similar as the data mostly lie along the 1 1 line in this case too an nse greater than 0 90 was obtained indicating the good spatial simulation by the fine resolution model forced with parameters of coarse resolution model 3 4 improvement in computational effort after parameter transfer as mentioned earlier the computational requirement for distributed hydrological increases with the level of discretization the computational time required to perform a single simulation of 22 years for st joseph watershed and 17 years for mississinewa watershed is presented in table 4 note that calibration of these models requires multiple simulations iteratively which in this study was 1500 iterations it is evident from the results that as the spatial variability in the models increase the simulation time significantly increases the computational time of sj5 is 37 times less as compared to the sj0 model the calibration of the sj5 model took approximately 7 h while sj0 could not be calibrated similarly the computational time for the ms5 model is 15 times less compared to ms0 model the calibration of ms0 model took more than 4 days while calibrating ms5 model took 3 h considering the computational time one would prefer coarse resolution models compared to the fine resolution models parallel computing has been brought in to hydrological modeling by some researchers her et al 2015a seong et al 2015 which help reduce the computational burden especially when large number of simulations are required nonetheless the gain in computational time depend on the resources available burger et al 2014 in the proposed approach of parameter transfer the computational time for sj0sj5 was 2 5 h one single simulation and 7 h were spent for estimating the parameters model sj5 calibration which resulted in satisfactory performance nse 0 7 therefore the proposed parameter transfer approach would help maintain the heterogeneity as well as reduce the computational time requirement 4 summary and conclusions distributed hydrological models better simulate the spatial variability of the watersheds response by considering the spatially heterogeneous characteristics of the watershed as compared to the lumped hydrological models while some of the applications do not require spatial representation of heterogeneity within a watershed and lumped models can be applied some applications such as spatial land use planning and bmp placing and evaluation require application of distributed hydrological models one of the common limitations in application of the distributed hydrological models is the high computational time associated with them the limitation of the high computational time is further exacerbated in parameter estimation of the distributed models as model calibration requires numerous iterative simulations in this study this issue is addressed by evaluating an approach of parameter transfer from a calibrated coarse resolution distributed model to a fine resolution distributed hydrological model a coarse resolution hydrological model would take relatively less time as compared to fine resolution hydrological model the proposed framework is tested on swat model for two watersheds in usa the proposed approach is tested on five models setup for each of the watershed with varying spatial resolutions the models with 0 threshold for land use soil and slope was considered as fine resolution model for both the watersheds while rest of the models were considered as coarse resolution models with different levels of the spatial resolution the results indicated that the fine resolution models perform satisfactorily nse 0 5 by using the parameters transferred from some of the coarse resolution models from all the coarse resolution models the models sj5 and ms5 for st joseph and mississinewa watersheds respectively are suitable for parameter transfer owing to their similarities in land use patterns with the fine resolution models further the computational time is significantly less for sj5 and ms5 as compared to sj0 and ms0 37 times and 15 times respectively the comparison of the calibrated parameters for different models indicated that the spatial representation of heterogeneity has a significant impact on the estimated parameter value the models sj0sj5 and ms0ms5 did provide a reasonably good simulation at an intermediate location in the watershed both stream flow and water quality indicating the effectiveness of preservation of spatial heterogeneity of the watershed characteristics in addition it is noted that the proposed parameter transfer approach helps reduce the computational requirement for calibrating a distributed hydrological model the proposed approach resulted in 32 times faster calibration for mississinewa watershed and in the st joseph watershed the sj0 model could not be calibrated due to computational limitations the results indicate that the parameters can be transferred from a calibrated coarse resolution model to a fine resolution model without significant loss in accuracy but with a reduced computational effort the results also indicate that the level of coarseness in representing the water heterogeneity cannot be arbitrary and should be like the fine resolution models the applicability of the parameter transfer approach for other fully distributed models needs to be tested author contribution statement all the authors

5424,distributed hydrologic models represent the spatial heterogeneity within the watersheds but are computationally intensive the problem of computational effort is further exacerbated in the process of the model calibration where iterative simulations are performed to estimate optimal parameter values this study evaluates a parameter transfer approach to address this issue and is demonstrated on two watersheds the results indicate that the parameters from a coarse resolution model that can reasonably capture the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed can be used to simulate a fine resolution model with satisfactory performance nse 0 60 in both watersheds the models with transferred parameters did preserve sufficient watershed heterogeneity to still provide acceptable prediction with performance resulting in an nse 0 6 and nse 0 90 for both stream flow and water quality variables respectively at a location upstream the parameter transfer approach can be used with lesser computational effort along with good simulation accuracy if the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed is preserved at the coarse resolution keywords distributed hydrological models calibration of models parameter transfer computational efficiency swat 1 introduction hydrologic models are widely used for decision making in planning and management of water resources at watershed scale these models simulate the hydrological processes and their complex interactions within the watershed to aid the decision maker evaluate the impact of various forcing variables on the watershed hydrology arnold et al 1998 bergion et al 2017 boughton 2005 daniel et al 2011 miller et al 2007 ranatunga et al 2008 these models can be broadly classified into lumped and distributed hydrologic models based on representation of spatial heterogeneity by the model within the watershed lumped models assume spatially homogenous response of the watershed while distributed hydrologic models capture the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrologic processes within the watershed liu and gupta 2007 mendonça et al 2018 sekar and randhir 2007 consequently the latter is preferred over the former for certain applications nonetheless the application of distributed models is majorly constrained by two factors 1 the availability of spatial input data and 2 the high computational demand spatial heterogeneity can be represented in a model using geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques but the resolution of the data is a concern as it influences the number of computational units in the model the computational units in a distributed model are generally the grid cells delineated by discretizing the watershed into grids without considering watershed characteristics various researchers have attempted to improve the computational efficiency of the distributed hydrological models by either reducing the computational units or effectively utilizing the computational resources for instance wood et al 1988 discretized the catchment into representative elementary areas reas based on the topography soil and rainfall patterns similarly other concepts such as discretizing the catchment into functional units argent et al 2009 hillslope patches tague and band 2001 equivalent cross section approach ajami et al 2016 khan et al 2014 clustering approach chaney et al 2018 2016 etc have been used to reduce the computational burden of distributed hydrologic models among different methods one the commonly used approach in some hydrological models is the concept of the hydrological response units hrus as computational units the hrus are defined using the unique combination of the land use the soil and the slope characteristics of the watershed and may not be spatially connected a fine resolution information of the watershed characteristics would certainly be representing spatial heterogeneity effectively but it induces large number of hrus on the contrary a coarse resolution data reduces the number hrus in the model compromising on the representation of spatial variability of the watershed characteristics researchers have also adopted parallel computing frameworks in the distributed hydrological models to improve the computational efficiency liu et al 2014 vivoni et al 2011 however the improvement in computational efficiency by this approach depends on the available computational resources soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed hydrological model that is being applied worldwide for various watershed management applications arnold and fohrer 2005 cibin et al 2014 gassman et al 2007 narasimhan et al 2010 swat model delineates the watershed into sub basins and within the sub basins hrus are defined the hrus in swat model are defined by the unique combination of land use soil and slope classes irrespective of the resolution of the spatial data the swat considers an in built procedure to reduce the computational requirement several hrus at different spatial locations that have the same characteristics are lumped together during the computations to form a single computational unit her et al 2015b neitsch et al 2009 nonetheless the spatial variability of the watershed characteristics is compromised in this procedure also depending on the spatial resolution of the data used while maximum heterogeneity representation is preferable in any distributed hydrological model the swat model allows a compromise on the same by considering a threshold value for soil land use and slope to form an hru neitsch et al 2009 for reducing the computational requirement generally a threshold of 5 15 is adopted for hru in various studies han et al 2012 her et al 2015b sexton et al 2010 srinivasan et al 2010 while reduction of computational units by giving thresholds is an effective way to reduce the computational effort several studies have reported that the value of threshold used to define an hru has a lot of influence on the accuracy of simulations especially the water quality variables her et al 2015b 2017 shabani et al 2017 singh and saraswat 2016 in addition applications such as identification of best management practice bmp and spatial optimization of cropping pattern requires a zero threshold for hru delineation to preserve the representation of unique landscapes in the model chaubey et al 2010 her et al 2015b resulting in large number of computational units consequently a model with large number of hrus would require huge computational effort rathjens and oppelt 2012 further the number of model parameters that require calibration in a distributed hydrological model is affected by the represented spatial heterogeneity indicating numerous iterative simulations during the calibration which again leads to large computational time therefore it is apparent that the modeler compromises between the representation of the spatial heterogeneity and the computational requirement while applying a distributed model for decision making essentially large number of hrus help improve the representation of the spatial heterogeneity but it increases the computational requirement on the other hand relatively small number of hrus brings in a reduction in computational requirement by compromising on the representation of the spatial variability of the watershed characteristics one of the plausible solutions to address this issue is to transfer the calibrated parameters from a coarse resolution model indicating less computational units to a fine resolution model indicating the preservation of unique landscapes transferring the parameters temporally from one time period to another time period has been adopted by many researchers to validate the model abbaspour et al 2007 chaubey et al 2010 liew and garbrecht 2003 vema et al 2017 similarly many researchers have attempted to transfer the parameters spatially across the basins from gauged to ungauged athira et al 2016 cibin et al 2014 sordo ward et al 2016 van emmerik et al 2015 however only few attempts have been made to reduce the computational effort by transferring parameters across the spatial scales within a watershed klotz et al 2017 mizukami et al 2017 troy et al 2008 wang et al 2018 these studies attempted to transfer the parameters of vic model at both temporal and spatial scales over the entire continental united states similarly samaniego et al 2010 developed relationships between the parameters at different spatial resolution to transfer the parameters from coarser scale model to finer resolution model of a distributed hydrological model the procedures adopted in these studies were similar to regionalization athira et al 2016 by calibrating the model for selected sub basins and transferring them to the whole basin daggupati et al 2015 proposed that parameter transfer is possible from coarse resolution model to a fine resolution with fine tuning in a homogenous watershed generally distributed hydrologic models comprise of large number of unknown parameters and model s efficacy in simulating the hydrological processes depends on accurate estimation of these parameters through calibration the parameters in swat model or any other distributed hydrologic model exist at different spatial scales for example some parameters are at watershed level while some are at sub basin level or at hru level ideally all of them are to be calibrated but it increases the complexity of the optimization during calibration therefore a generic procedure is to uniformly perturb the parameters across the watershed at different spatial scale from their default value which is set based on watershed characteristics so that the spatial heterogeneity is maintained for instance curve number cn in swat model is a parameter that depends on the land use and soil characteristics and therefore may have varying values across the watershed depending on the heterogeneity therefore during the model setup default values are assigned to cn based on the watershed characteristics and these values are given uniform perturbation during calibration on the contrary the parameter surlag which is a surface runoff lag coefficient in swat is a watershed level parameter and it takes a uniform value across the watershed therefore the computational complexity is not majorly due to the large number of parameters in model that is set up based on fine resolution spatial data but due the presence of large number of computational units hrus therefore the optimal perturbations for spatially varying parameters obtained for a coarse model during calibration and the optimal values obtained for watershed level parameters could be transferred to a fine model without compromising on the heterogeneity of the watershed the primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the applicability and computational effectiveness of this parameter transfer approach on a watershed and the swat model is considered for illustration the study also evaluates the impact of the model resolution on the calibrated parameters further the efficacy of the parameter transfer approach from various levels of coarse resolution models to fine resolution model is also assessed the models set up in fine and coarse resolutions are obtained with varying threshold values for hru delineation 2 methodology 2 1 study area and model setup this study is carried out on two agricultural watersheds st joseph watershed and mississinewa watershed in the state of indiana usa the st joseph watershed is located in the southwest portion of the lower peninsula of michigan northwest ohio and the northwestern portion of indiana fig 1 the watershed spans through seven counties viz allen dekalb noble and steuben in indiana state hillsdale in michigan state williams and defiance in ohio state encompassing an area of 2800 km2 the watershed is flat to hilly terrain with 66 of the area under 3 slope the watershed has a mixed land use with 37 cropland under corn soybean rotation 25 pasture 12 forest 10 urban areas 7 forest wetlands and other smaller agricultural fields 6 the dominant soil type is loam and fine loam occupying 81 of the watershed area the long term average annual precipitation 1990 2010 is about 992 mm and average annual temperature is 9 5 c cibin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 from the watershed characteristics presented above it is clear that the st joseph watershed is a spatially heterogeneous watershed the mississinewa watershed is a part of the wabash river basin in the eastern indiana and a small portion of western ohio in the united states fig 1 encompassing an area of 2245 km2 the mississinewa watershed is an agricultural watershed with around 70 of the land use is under corn soybean rotation the next major land use of the watershed is forest covering 10 of the watershed area the major soils in the watershed are blount and glynwood which covers 80 of the total watershed area there are several minor soil types having a share of less than 5 in the watershed the mean slope of the watershed is around 2 7 and poorly drained soils in the agricultural fields are tile drained the mean annual precipitation of the basin is 1085 mm and mean annual temperature is 12 4 c the swat model was been set up for both the watersheds using the required data from various sources the inputs to the model include digital elevation model dem land use cover soil data and weather parameters the dem i e the elevation data with 30 m resolution was obtained from national elevation dataset ned nad 83 the land use data for the watershed was collected from the cropland data layer cdl the usda nrcs maintains the soil survey geographic database ssurgo which is used in the study arcswat was used to parameterize both the watersheds and all the data layers were projected to nad 83 utm 16n coordinate system weather data precipitation minimum and maximum temperature for swat model simulation was obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc the dem the weather data and the land use soil slope were given as input to the swat model the slope within the watershed was divided into 3 classes 0 2 2 5 and 5 for both the watersheds the current analysis was performed by setting up the swat model for both the watersheds using different spatial configurations as mentioned earlier swat model allows users to define two thresholds the channel initiation threshold and hru definition threshold the channel initiation threshold is applied to define the sub basin boundaries and consequently the number of sub basins delineated within the watershed in this study we have fixed the channel initiation threshold to approximately represent the stream network in the watershed and modified the hru threshold to develop models with different spatial configurations the swat model delineates sub basins into smaller hrus by considering the heterogeneity in the land use soil and slope swat allows user to specify the threshold for hru delineation to reduce the number of computational units the hrus which fall below the threshold are redistributed to the remaining hrus a model with higher threshold for hru definition would result in a watershed with relatively less number of land use slope and soil classes as compared to a model with lower threshold for hru definition the detailed explanation on the redistribution of hrus within the swat model is provided in her et al 2015b the configurations of the models for the two watersheds considered in this study i e hru threshold number of delineated sub basins and hrus and number of land use and soil classes represented within the model are presented in table 1 a total of 5 different configurations considering different thresholds are considered during the analysis the hru threshold was varied from 0 to 15 for each of land use soil and slope classes within the sub basins in addition a model configuration with each sub basin as a single hru which has the largest area dominant within the sub basin is also considered the considered models are named accordingly see table 1 for instance the model sj0 refers to a swat model for st joseph watershed with a threshold of 0 for land use soil and slope classes similarly the model ms10 refers to model for mississinewa watershed with a threshold of 10 for the land use soil and slope classes the models with 0 threshold for both the watersheds can be considered as fine resolution models as complete spatial heterogeneity is represented the swat model was setup for a period of 22 years 1990 2011 for st joseph watershed and for 17 years 1992 2008 for the mississinewa watershed with first three years considered as warm up period while there are 29 parameters of the swat model that influence the simulation of stream flow arabi et al 2007 only the sensitive parameters reported in the literature for both the watersheds were considered table 2 in this study multi site calibration was performed for both the watersheds to preserve the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed both the watersheds have two usgs gauging stations one at the watershed outlet and another at an upstream intermediate location fig 1 the models for st joseph watershed were calibrated using the daily stream flow data from the usgs gauging station 04180500 watershed outlet and 04178000 intermediate location the models for mississinewa watershed were calibrated using the daily stream flow data from the usgs gauging station 03326500 watershed outlet and 03325500 intermediate location the calibration period for the st joseph watersheds was for 10 years from 1993 and 9 years from 1995 for mississinewa watershed the remaining simulation period for both the watersheds was considered as validation period the model was calibrated for the objective function of maximizing nash sutcliff efficiency nse 2 2 parameter transfer approach the parameter transfer approach aims at reducing the computational burden of calibrating a fine resolution distributed hydrologic model this is achieved by transferring the parameters calibrated on a coarse resolution distributed hydrologic model to a fine resolution distributed hydrologic model the applicability and computational effectiveness of this approach is testes in this study using swat as hydrologic model the generic form of the hydrologic model can be written as y f x λ where f is the function describing the hydrologic model swat in this study y is the vector containing the outputs of the model x is the vector of inputs to the model and λ represents the set of parameters of the model the set of parameters of the model are estimated using the observed outputs and is described as λ g x o y o λ c g c x o y o where g is the inverse function of the hydrologic model x o is the input data for the model f and y o is the observed outputs of the model the parameters are initially estimated for a coarse resolution distributed hydrologic model g c and are denoted as λ c the parameters λ c are transferred to a fine resolution model to estimate the parameters y f fn x fn λ c where f fn is the functional form of fine resolution hydrologic model and x fn is the fine resolution input data 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the models the swat models for both the watersheds representing different levels of the spatial heterogeneity were calibrated through an automatic calibration procedure using amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 as optimizer maximizing nash sutcliffe efficiency was considered as the objective function and 1500 model evaluations 100 population size arrived at by trial and error approach were performed it is to note that the model sj0 with 43 672 hrus could not be calibrated due to the extensive computational effort required and limited availability of computational resources the variability in the performance of the models at both the sites in the last generation in both calibration and validation period are plotted in fig 2 all the nine models were sufficiently calibrated with a satisfactory performance of nse greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 for all the model evaluations further the narrow spread of the performance amongst the population suggests that the optimizer has converged to near optimal solution the performance of the models during calibration and validation are in agreement with that reported for both the basins by other researchers athira 2015 cibin et al 2016 femeena et al 2018 wang et al 2017 and the values indicate a good performance according to moriasi et al 2007 from the last generation the best performing set parameter set corresponding to maximum nse was selected for each of the model and the models performance in terms of nse at the watershed outlet is reported in table 3 diagonal elements in calibration and validation note that the table 3 contains information about the model performance after the parameter transfer also which are discussed in later sections among the four models calibrated for the st joseph watershed sjd performed the best with an nse of 0 79 and 0 75 for calibration and validation periods respectively similarly the best performing set of the model with dominant hru for the mississinewa watershed msd performed relatively better than other models with an nse of 0 67 during calibration and 0 61 during validation periods it is to note that the performance of the models for the mississinewa watershed was similar across different models while there was a slight difference in the performance of models for the st joseph watershed this can be attributed to the spatially homogenous land use in the mississinewa watershed as compared to the st joseph watershed in both the watersheds the models with dominant hru as configuration performed slightly better than the other models one of the plausible reasons for better performance of these models is the reduced search space for the optimizer due to less number of decision variables since the maximum number of function evaluations were same in calibration of all the models the model with less number of decision variables usually converge faster while the models sjd and msd performed better than others the watershed is represented as homogenous land parcels within a sub basin and thus do not represent the spatial heterogeneity well therefore additional investigation in terms of the model s simulation of the water balance components needs to be ascertained before application of the models sjd and msd for decision making further it is important to look at the parameter variability across the calibrated models to evaluate the impact of the model resolution on the estimated parameters 3 2 optimal parameter ranges for different calibrated models the range of parameters in the last generation is generally a reduced range in which the performance of the model is close to the global optima this range gives an indication of the parameters range in which the calibrated parameter lies for the model in the watershed therefore the parameter ranges obtained from the last generation of the optimization of different models were compared to evaluate the impact of model resolution on the estimated parameters in this analysis only 4 highly sensitive parameters cn f sol awc surlag and slsubbsn as reported in the literature athira 2015 cibin et al 2010 femeena et al 2018 in both the watersheds are considered for brevity and the variability within the last generation is presented as box plots in figs 3 and 4 for st joseph and mississinewa watersheds respectively a significant difference is observed between the ranges of parameters obtained for model sjd compared to the other 3 models fig 3 the models sj5 sj10 and sj15 represent the spatial heterogeneity fairly well within the watershed while spatial representation is mostly homogenous within a sub basin in model sjd a comparison of the optimal ranges indicates that there is a compromise on the model parameter to account for the lower representation of the spatial heterogeneity for instance the parameter cn f is positively changed for model sjd indicating an increase in the simulated flow while there is a negative change for the remaining three models similarly the slsubbsn parameter which accounts for the time of concentration within the sub basin has significant difference a cross examination of the spatial variability of the land use fig 6 a showed that land use pattern of models sj5 and sj10 were similar with approximately 40 area under corn soybean rotation while land use under corn soybean rotation was found to be around 60 for model sjd since it considered dominant hru in sub basin further the comparison of the land cover patterns for different models show that percentage land cover of different classes of sj5 and sj10 was similar to that of sj0 with minor variations the model sjd has soybean followed by pasture as the dominant land uses while the pasture is the dominant land use in sj0 sj5 and sj10 models the reduced ranges of parameters for the models for the mississinewa watershed showed similar ranges across the models the only significant difference in the parameter range was observed for surlag parameter fig 4 which is a parameter for stream flow lag from the sub basin the parameter surlag for the model msd was higher compared to other 4 models indicating more lagged flow at the sub basin level while there was no clear variability in the parameter ranges across different models the combination of parameters might result in different simulations the similarity in the parameter ranges of different models can be attributed to a relatively homogenous land use under corn soybean rotation 70 within the watershed a comparison of the contributing land use classes within different models suggest that as the threshold is increasing the land cover under row crop is increasing while land cover under pasture is reducing fig 6 b in the model msd 95 of the watershed area is represented as the row crops i e corn and soybean similar to the case of the st joseph watershed the land use pattern of the model with 5 threshold ms5 matches closely with fine resolution model ms0 this variability in the optimal parameter ranges in st joseph watershed particularly leads to the following inferences 1 in automatic calibration procedures the model parameters are adjusted such that the impact of lower representation of the watershed spatial heterogeneity is nullified and 2 the parameters from the model with 5 threshold for hru which is moderately coarse can be transferred to the fine resolution model with 0 threshold consequently the calibrated values of parameters were transferred from one model to the others and their simulation performance was evaluated 3 3 models performance after parameter transfer the parameter transfer approach is evaluated by transferring the last generation parameter sets of the coarse resolution models sj5 sj10 sj15 sjd ms5 ms10 ms15 and msd to the fine resolution models sj0 and ms0 of the respective watersheds the swat parameters are at different levels some parameters are at sub basin level while others are at hru level the swat parameters which are at the sub basin level are usually spatially homogenous and are modified as absolute values i e a particular value is assigned to it for the whole basin the hru level parameters depend on the hru for instance curve number of two different hrus would be entirely different in order to preserve this spatial variability of the hru level parameters these parameters are changed relative to the default values as mentioned in table 2 some of the parameters are absolute while other are relative the absolute parameters are transferred directly from the coarse resolution model to fine resolution model the relative parameters are perturbations from the default value of the parameters these parameters are perturbed in the fine resolution model using the calibrated value of perturbation in coarse resolution model the fine resolution models of st joseph watershed with parameter sets from the models sj5 sj10 sj15 and sjd are termed as sj0sj5 sj0sj10 sj0sj15 and sj0sjd respectively the subscript after the model name indicates the model name from which the calibrated parameter sets is used for the model simulation similarly for the mississinewa watershed the fine resolution model ms0 with parameters from coarse resolution models ms5 ms10 ms15 and msd are termed as ms0ms5 ms0ms10 ms0ms15 and ms0msd respectively the performance of these models for the calibration and validation datasets at the watershed and intermediate outlet for the last generation of parameters is presented in fig 5 the results for the st joseph watershed show that performance of the sj0 model with parameters from sj5 sj10 and sj15 performed satisfactorily with an nse 0 6 in all cases while the performance of fine resolution model sj0 with parameters from dominant hru model sjd were found to be unsatisfactory the results of the mississinewa watershed showed similar trend with satisfactory performance of models ms0ms5 and ms0ms10 while the performance of ms0ms15 and ms0msd were found to be unsatisfactory among all the models of the mississinewa watershed with transferred parameters the model ms0ms5 performance was in similar range to that of calibrated ms0 model for further analysis the best parameter set parameter set corresponding to maximum nse of the model of a model was transferred to other models of the watershed and their performance was evaluated the performance statistic nse computed at the watershed outlet for all the models simulated by transferring the calibrated parameters from other models is presented in table 3 the results for the st joseph watershed indicate that the performance of the model sj0sj5 sj0sj10 and sj0sj15 was acceptable with an nse of greater than 0 7 for the models while the performance of the sj0 model simulated using the parameter set obtained from the dominant hru model sjd was not satisfactory nse 0 5 similar results were obtained in the case of mississinewa watershed with model ms0 performing satisfactorily for the parameter sets derived from models ms5 and ms10 while the performance was not satisfactory for parameter sets from other models a cross examination of the ms0 models performance using the parameters obtained from calibrating the models ms0 ms5 and ms10 indicate that the performance was best for the model ms0 with its own calibrated parameters however the model performance of ms0 with calibrated parameters from ms5 ms0ms5 was similar to that of calibrated ms0 model with slight reduction the performance of the models setup using fine resolution configuration sj0 and ms0 was worst with the parameters derived from the dominant hru models sjd and msd a comparison of the land use patterns represented within the model for both watersheds is presented in fig 6 the similarity in the land use pattern represented in the models sj0 and sj5 is reflected in comparable performance of the models sj5 and sj0sj5 while the models sj0sj10 and sj0sj15 also performed satisfactorily nse 0 7 for both models the deviation of the land use pattern was more with additional area under soybean and pasture and area under urban and forest reducing the computational requirements increase with increasing resolution of the models the close matching of the land use pattern of sj0 and sj5 prompted in considering the model sj0sj5 for further application even though the computational requirement of sj10 and sj15 is less compared to sj5 the comparison of the land use pattern of different models for the mississinewa watershed show that land use pattern of ms0 and ms5 are similar in general with the exception of others land use class in ms5 the complete reclassification of the others land use classes in the ms5 model might be the plausible reason for reduced performance of ms0ms5 as compared to calibrated ms0 the deterioration of the performance of the ms0 model using the parameters from the coarse resolution models is evident from the land use patterns represented in the models as the spatial land use representation moves from fine to coarse resolution the land use under soybean significantly increases in the models of mississinewa watershed the average annual water balance components of the fine resolution model with transferred parameters along without transferring the parameters are compared fig 7 the results indicate that the simulation of water balance components in the model ms0msd is significantly different from other models while other models had similar average annual values for the water balance components the model ms0 had more ground water flow component compared to others the model ms0ms5 was considered for further analysis owing to similarity in the land use patterns of the ms0 and ms5 and the satisfactory performance of the ms0ms5 the swat model is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and simulates other watershed processes such as nutrient transport sediment transport crop growth etc in addition to stream flow the swat model has been extensively used in application for evaluation of bmp to impede the nutrient and sediment delivery to the downstream reaches arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 generally the adopted calibration strategy for swat model is to calibrate the stream flow parameters first followed by parameters affecting sediment and finally calibrate the parameters that influence the nutrient transport therefore parameters calibrated for flow would have an impact on the consequent parameters of the sediment and nutrient transport thus it is imperative to evaluate the impact of parameter transfer on the simulation of the nitrate phosphate and sediment transport of the swat model the simulation of the transport of total nitrate total phosphate and sediment at the watershed outlet for the two models model ms0 and model ms0ms5 is compared and presented in fig 8 a c and e the data follows1 1 line and indicate that the simulation of these processes in both the models is very similar suggesting that the impact of the parameter transfer is minimum on simulation of stream flow and water quality variables the resulting nse for this analysis was more than 0 95 in all cases the preservation of heterogeneity in model is important for effective simulation of the hydrological processes in space accordingly the simulations at the intermediate outlet of the models were evaluated to verify the impact of parameter transfer on the spatial simulation by the swat model since the fine resolution model for st joseph watershed sj0 could not be calibrated due to computational limitations only the simulated flow from sj0sj5 model was compared with the observed flow the high nse observed in the stream flow simulations of sj0sj5 at the intermediate location fig 5 indicate good spatial simulation by the model the simulation of the total nitrate phosphate and sediment at the intermediate outlet of ms0ms5 was compared with that ms0 model as no observed records were available the simulation results are presented as scatter plots in fig 8 b d and f the results indicate that simulation by model ms0 and model ms0ms5 are similar as the data mostly lie along the 1 1 line in this case too an nse greater than 0 90 was obtained indicating the good spatial simulation by the fine resolution model forced with parameters of coarse resolution model 3 4 improvement in computational effort after parameter transfer as mentioned earlier the computational requirement for distributed hydrological increases with the level of discretization the computational time required to perform a single simulation of 22 years for st joseph watershed and 17 years for mississinewa watershed is presented in table 4 note that calibration of these models requires multiple simulations iteratively which in this study was 1500 iterations it is evident from the results that as the spatial variability in the models increase the simulation time significantly increases the computational time of sj5 is 37 times less as compared to the sj0 model the calibration of the sj5 model took approximately 7 h while sj0 could not be calibrated similarly the computational time for the ms5 model is 15 times less compared to ms0 model the calibration of ms0 model took more than 4 days while calibrating ms5 model took 3 h considering the computational time one would prefer coarse resolution models compared to the fine resolution models parallel computing has been brought in to hydrological modeling by some researchers her et al 2015a seong et al 2015 which help reduce the computational burden especially when large number of simulations are required nonetheless the gain in computational time depend on the resources available burger et al 2014 in the proposed approach of parameter transfer the computational time for sj0sj5 was 2 5 h one single simulation and 7 h were spent for estimating the parameters model sj5 calibration which resulted in satisfactory performance nse 0 7 therefore the proposed parameter transfer approach would help maintain the heterogeneity as well as reduce the computational time requirement 4 summary and conclusions distributed hydrological models better simulate the spatial variability of the watersheds response by considering the spatially heterogeneous characteristics of the watershed as compared to the lumped hydrological models while some of the applications do not require spatial representation of heterogeneity within a watershed and lumped models can be applied some applications such as spatial land use planning and bmp placing and evaluation require application of distributed hydrological models one of the common limitations in application of the distributed hydrological models is the high computational time associated with them the limitation of the high computational time is further exacerbated in parameter estimation of the distributed models as model calibration requires numerous iterative simulations in this study this issue is addressed by evaluating an approach of parameter transfer from a calibrated coarse resolution distributed model to a fine resolution distributed hydrological model a coarse resolution hydrological model would take relatively less time as compared to fine resolution hydrological model the proposed framework is tested on swat model for two watersheds in usa the proposed approach is tested on five models setup for each of the watershed with varying spatial resolutions the models with 0 threshold for land use soil and slope was considered as fine resolution model for both the watersheds while rest of the models were considered as coarse resolution models with different levels of the spatial resolution the results indicated that the fine resolution models perform satisfactorily nse 0 5 by using the parameters transferred from some of the coarse resolution models from all the coarse resolution models the models sj5 and ms5 for st joseph and mississinewa watersheds respectively are suitable for parameter transfer owing to their similarities in land use patterns with the fine resolution models further the computational time is significantly less for sj5 and ms5 as compared to sj0 and ms0 37 times and 15 times respectively the comparison of the calibrated parameters for different models indicated that the spatial representation of heterogeneity has a significant impact on the estimated parameter value the models sj0sj5 and ms0ms5 did provide a reasonably good simulation at an intermediate location in the watershed both stream flow and water quality indicating the effectiveness of preservation of spatial heterogeneity of the watershed characteristics in addition it is noted that the proposed parameter transfer approach helps reduce the computational requirement for calibrating a distributed hydrological model the proposed approach resulted in 32 times faster calibration for mississinewa watershed and in the st joseph watershed the sj0 model could not be calibrated due to computational limitations the results indicate that the parameters can be transferred from a calibrated coarse resolution model to a fine resolution model without significant loss in accuracy but with a reduced computational effort the results also indicate that the level of coarseness in representing the water heterogeneity cannot be arbitrary and should be like the fine resolution models the applicability of the parameter transfer approach for other fully distributed models needs to be tested author contribution statement all the authors
