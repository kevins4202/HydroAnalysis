pleistocene tract 1 introduction bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs 2015 a government organization carry decennial census on socio economy has expressed that the population density of the country is high bbs 2015 has also expressed that the nineteenth century was started with 28 93 million people according to the census of 1901 but in 2001 it became four times higher i e 124 33 million people were working for the way of life in the country the last census was held during 2011 bbs report of 2015 illustrated that the population of bangladesh is 158 9 million with a growth rate of 1 37 during the past 30 years bangladesh has faced 100 plus cyclones and 60 flash floods with other natural disasters according to shahid et al 2015 at the proposed area groundwater resource is exploited by 96 5 for irrigation research paper of bangladesh rural advancement committee brac 2013 is expressing that the wetland area has changed about 25 25 from 1989 to 2000 and 4 02 from 2000 to 2010 the paper also expressing that intensity of deep tube well and shallow tube well installation has increased double and five times respectively and 8 5 times in a total increase number of the total change is 6 9 36 per km2 during 1984 85 fy to 2010 11 fy compared to the shallow and deep tube well installation irrigated land has increased 1 6 times only the study area is a drought prone area bari and anwar 2000 have shown that the river water level has fall 20 m 19 m from the original level and discharge has decreased from 90 8 to 56 9 m3 sec from 1981 to 2010 barind multipurpose development authority bmda 2006 calculated that during 1985 crop production rate was 117 but now the rate has reached to 216 in the study area according to the bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc 2002 the use of surface water and groundwater for irrigation has changed during the last two decades groundwater withdraw has risen from 41 to 75 in the year 1982 1983 to 2001 2002 but in comparison the surface water use has reduced shahid et al 2015 has shown that little river flow is existing for the heavy withdrawal of water at upstream of the ganges river and high drought occurrence is prominent in the study area therefore groundwater dependency is increasing for irrigation but overall analysis has concluded that groundwater use is not sustainable for the proposed area because of over exploitation of water from the subsurface in compared with the groundwater recharge the national water policy of the government of bangladesh inspires groundwater development for irrigation in the sectors of a public and private organization master planning organization 1991 water resources planning organization 2004 scientists have defined groundwater in different ways otutu and oviri 2010

imagery 2 study area the study area is slightly dome shaped highly dissected and north south elongated pleistocene uplifted part in compared to the surrounding area the special character of this area is terrace landform which shows sea level rise and fall for quaternary climatic change the maximum elevation is 45 m from the average mean sea level amsl that was found in this area the geomorphic evolution of the proposed area is a matter of debate for a long period a few portions of the landmass for the study area express morphological origin the tectonic upliftment produced the rest area the proposed area partially covering three districts namely naogaon rajshahi and chapai nawabganj and 10 upazilas namely tanore godagari shapahar porsha patnitala niamatpur dhamurhat nawabganj nachol gomostapur that comprises about 1931 km2 the geographical extent from 25 3 0 n to 24 6 0 n and 88 5 0 e to 88 11 0 e study area is bounded by padma river at the south mohananda river at the west atrai river at the east side fig 1 a shows the bangladesh map and fig 1 b describes the map of the proposed area 2 1 hydrogeology in bangladesh groundwater occurs at shallow depth except for the study area pleistocene dupi tila sand act as an aquifer in the proposed area for massive withdraw of groundwater water table progressively declined avg rate 0 10 m year which ultimately leads the area to water scarcity zone rashid et al 2013 the aquifer is characterized by 5 0 m 42 5 m thick single to multi layered two to four layers plio pleistocene aquifer system jahan et al 2007 the aquifer is overlain by thick silty clay a characteristic of this layer is semi pervious to impervious nature with a percolation rate ranges from 1 mm day to 2 mm day undp 1992 according to institute of water modeling iwm 2006 aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity t and specific yield sy that was obtained from pump test data are 10 20 m day 1000 m2 day and 0 06 to 0 30 respectively a lithological cross section was prepared using gamma ray log data that was collected from the bangladesh atomic energy commission baec fig 2 2 2 climatic condition the study area comprises three seasons winter season exists cool and dry without rainfall from november to february pre monsoon hot and dry exists from march to may and monsoon hot and rainy from june to october the average annual rainfall was recorded from 1389 to 1645 mm during the period 2000 to 2011 in the proposed area bangladesh meteorological department bmd also shows that the temperature of the barind area varies from 5 to 45 c with an average of 25 5 c minimum humidity is existing 40 70 in winter season and at the beginning of pre monsoon rest of the months humidity remain higher varying from 70 to 100 according to the bangladesh water development board bwdb data the annual evaporation of the area ranges from 370 mm to 1120 mm the slope of the proposed area ranges from 0 to 29 3 materials and methods secondary data were collected from different sources for groundwater potentiality identification lithological data were collated from the geological survey of bangladesh gsb vertical electrical sounding ves data were collected directly from field survey using resistivity survey method for the clay layer thickness identification digital elevation model dem from u s geological survey usgs groundwater table depth gwt and rainfall data were collected from bwdb land use land cover map was produced from the landsat image using remote sensing software envi 5 3 table 1 shows the data characteristics for the gp study fig 3 shows the groundwater potentiality study workflow 3 1 preparation of thematic layers thematic layers were chosen and processed after observing different literature and factors that have a direct influence on recharge 3 1 1 surface lithology sl according to akinlalu et al 2017 surface lithology influences recharge to the groundwater the presence of fine grain materials clay peat or silt and the percentage of organic matter within the soil decreases intrinsic permeability and prevent infiltration of surface water to the groundwater hence lithology plays an important role in groundwater potentiality study lithological information was obtained from the geological survey of bangladesh gsb 2001 three types of soil layer namely clay marsh clay and peat and alluvial silt are dominant in the proposed area 3 1 2 lineament density ld according to surinaidu et al 2017 high lineament density provides more recharge and good for groundwater potentiality the lineament map was prepared using arc gis from landsat etm panchromatic band of 15 m resolution image by edge enhancement technique lineament density was obtained by the ratio of the total length of lineaments to the catchment area eq 1 and the unit is km per km2 the lineament density map was divided into five equal interval classes 1 l i n e a m e n t d e n s i t y l d t ll a where t ll total length of the lineament a area of the study area 3 1 3 drainage density dd drainage network was extracted from the digital elevation model dem by arc gis software and the drainage density map was obtained using a line density tool drainage density value was calculated by the ratio of the total length of the channel to the basin area as eq 2 and the unit is km per km2 drainage density determines the rate of water percolation of a particular area akinlalu et al 2017 higher values allow very high and quick surface water runoff so infiltration is low in addition the lower value of drainage density allows lower runoff so the infiltration rate is high drainage density class was divided into five equal interval classes 2 d r a i n a g e d e n s i t y d d t s l a where t sl total stream length a area of the study area 3 1 4 infiltration rate ir according to faniran 1968 the infiltration rate is the product of drainage density eq 2 and stream frequency eq 3 of a watershed the infiltration number was determined by eq 4 for the proposed area infiltration number is directly proportional to the surface runoff which may be used to detect the high percolation zone the stream frequency of an area was obtained by the summation of all streams of a particular order divided by the catchment area dry soil percolates rainwater rapidly and finally reaches the aquifer according to ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 soil infiltration measures in a watershed are difficult for the dependency on so many factors viz soil texture topography rainfall intensity and vegetation etc 3 s t r e a m f r e q u e n c y s f n s a 4 i n f i l t r a t i o n r a t e i r d d s f where n s number of the stream of a particular stream order a area of the study area d d drainage density s f stream frequency 3 1 5 groundwater table depth gwtd groundwater table data was obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb at ten stations the value was prepared by averaging the annual average of the monthly average of weekly data from 1990 to 2016 the data was calculated considering the average mean sea level amsl according to patra et al 2018 groundwater table depth represents the interaction of groundwater with natural and anthropogenic activities of recharge and discharge components in response to geology climate physiography land and hydrology groundwater table raster value was classified into five classes 3 1 6 rainfall rf rainfall intensity and its duration play an important role in infiltration ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 rainfall data were obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb rainfall of six stations from 1990 to 2016 was taken for the proposed arena average of the annual average of daily data was used to create the interpolated rainfall raster map rainfall map was classified into five equally interval zones when all conditions fulfill the groundwater recharge situation becomes suitable to reach rainfall water into the aquifer 3 1 7 geomorphology gm geomorphology map helps to understand various geomorphic parts landforms and underlying rock that provide an outline of processes materials structures and geologic controls relating to groundwater prospects patra et al 2018 the hypsometric index value was obtained after analyzing over 2000 watershed using a stream threshold value 100 from the srtm dem the result shows that the elevated tract is staying at the mature or equilibrium stage with a hypsometric index value 0 3 to 0 6 roughness or irregularities have a direct influence on the water movement geomorphological divisions such as very smooth smooth moderate irregular and highly irregular are identified for the proposed area ayele et al 2015 the very smooth landform is suitable for groundwater recharge 3 1 8 soil thickness st soil thickness map was prepared using the vertical electrical sounding ves record that was collected from the field survey the clay layer is impervious to the recharge therefore the surface water cannot reach the aquifer in the clay layer zone using inverse distance weighting idw the clay layer thickness interpolation map was prepared dry clay soil has more cracks to the top layer those facilities to the infiltration of rainfall water and wet clay soil has more water holding capacity therefore wet soil play rule against recharge ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 the clay layer thickness map divided five classes of equal intervals 3 1 9 slope slo slope refers to the elevation changing rate and plays a role in identifying the groundwater potential zone the steeper slope supports the high surface runoff and rapid erosion of surface soil ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 dem was used for slope map preparation the slope is important for groundwater recharge a high slope angle is less suitable for infiltration that allows quick runoff of rainfall water berhanu et al 2013 classified slope as 0 3 flat 3 8 gentle 8 15 moderate and 15 30 steep 3 1 10 land use land cover lulc land use land cover was generated from 2013 landsat image and characteristics have given in table 1 landsat images were processed using atmospheric correction dark object subtraction and composite band creation that were later classified by supervised maximum likelihood classification technique according to patra et al 2018 agriculture land water body and the vegetation area favorable for groundwater recharge but settlement and wasteland areas are not significant for groundwater recharge 3 2 analytic hierarchy process ahp model for the ahp calculation element of each layer class of individual raster was obtained according to saaty 1980 that later used to calculate the pairwise comparison within the judgment matrix table 2 the judgment matrix was then used for calculating the normalized weight for each thematic layer later consistency was calculated to detect coherence of the judgment matrix ultimately detect the class weight and consistency ratio cr the steps are as follows step 1 pairwise comparison matrix pwcm was calculated as eq 5 5 j u d g m e n t m a t r i x x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 x n n where xnn indicator of the judgment matrix element step 2 calculation of normalized weight was determined as eq 6 6 n w g m n n 1 n f g m n where gm n geometric mean of nth row of judgment matrix x gm n was calculated by eq 7 7 gm n x 1 n x 2 n x n n f n step 3 consistency ratio cr to verify the coherence of the judgments eq 8 8 c r c i r i where ci consistency index ri saaty s ratio index ci was quantified using eq 9 9 c i λ m a x n f n f 1 λ max is an eigen value of the judgment matrix and calculated as eq 10 10 λ m a x n 1 n f x n n n f n w 3 3 groundwater potential zone identification during groundwater potential zone identification each layer weight and their classes are ranked individually based on the field experience and literature review for the proposed area finally the gp index map was generated using gis by wlc of thematic layers layer class rank individual class has individual rank and weight from saaty s assumption of each layer each layer has unique weight was multiplied to get the probable individual layer that was added to get groundwater potential zone gwpz map eq 11 shows the required groundwater potential zone calculation 11 g w p z i 1 n w i r i where gwpz groundwater potential zone wi weight for each layer ri rate for each class of each layer 3 4 sensitivity analysis spsa and mrsa calculations were carried out for gp map validation spsa refers that a particular layer how much sense considering the other layers for groundwater potentiality eq 12 shows the spsa calculation mrsa refers that the influence of a particular layer after removing from the gwpz map eq 13 shows the mrsa calculation 12 s p s a w i r i g w p z 100

removed gwpz groundwater potential zone after removing a layer 4 results and discussion 4 1 discussion of thematic layers 4 1 1 surface lithology sl surface lithology is important for soil conditions that are again related to soil characters like structure porosity adhesion and consistency mcgarry 2006 three lithological types are prominent for the proposed area clay is covering 93 area with class priority value 0 11 marsh clay and peat are covering 3 area of class priority value 0 26 and alluvial silt covering 4 area and class priority value is 0 63 cr value for the pwcm is 0 04 fig 4 a is describing lithology for the proposed area table 3 shows the pwcm alluvial silt has a relatively high porosity therefore assign high class rate value clay has low porosity therefore low class rate value was taken for clay 4 1 2 lineament density ld lineaments are structural features that have importance for groundwater recharge pradhan 2009 lineament appears as a linear feature viz structural lithological topography and drainage anomalies etc lineament may straight or curvilinear features the result shows that the lineament density value ranges from 0 to 0 0012 km per km2 as given in fig 4 b table 4 shows that the pwcm with cr value is 0 08 lineament density plays an important role in groundwater recharge through fractured rock that permits groundwater flow to the aquifer 4 1 3 drainage density dd drainage density refers to the dissected landscape by the stream that reflects surface runoff and permeability of the soil regions with high drainage density will have limited infiltration and rapid runoff therefore the low drainage density value is more favorable for high gp patra et al 2018 fig 5 a result shows that the drainage density value ranges from 0 to 1 35 km per km2 table 4 shows the pwcm with a cr value of 0 08 4 1 4 infiltration rate ir infiltration is important to soil hydraulic property that influences agriculture and water resources infiltration allows groundwater to recharge to the aquifer infiltration rate map was classified into five classes namely very low of 0 5 area low of 7 area moderate of 79 area high of 12 5 area and very high of 1 area where cr value is 0 08 a high infiltration rate is suitable for groundwater potential table 4 shows the pwcm fig 5 b describes the infiltration rate map of the proposed area 4 1 5 groundwater table depth gwtd the groundwater table depth value ranges from 4 7 m to 30 m and quantifies considering the average mean sea level amsl the map was divided into five equal intervals to produce the pwcm as shown in table 4 fig 6 a shows the groundwater table depth map 4 7 m 9 8 m groundwater table depth comprises 7 area 9 8 m 14 9 m groundwater table depth comprises 58 area 14 9 m 19 9 m groundwater table depth comprises 26 area 19 9 m 25 1 m groundwater table depth comprises 10 area 25 1 m 30 m depth comprises 1 area the shallow depth of the groundwater table is suitable for groundwater recharge cr value for groundwater table depth was found at 0 01 4 1 6 rainfall rf high intensity and short time rainfall cause less infiltration and more runoff 1389 1645 mm rainfall occurred in the study area during the rainy season the range has been classified into equal five intervals as shown in fig 6 b table 4 describes the pwcm for the proposed area high weight was assigned for high rainfall value and low weight was assigned for low rainfall value cr value for rainfall calculation is 0 07 4 1 7 geomorphology gm the study area has been divided into five classes depending on geomorphology namely very smooth smooth moderate irregular highly irregular land fig 7 a shows the geomorphology of the proposed area geomorphology classes and the rates were shown with pwcm in table 4 with a cr value of 0 01 4 1 8 soil thickness st soil thickness varies from 15 m to 30 m in the proposed area maximum clay thickness was found at the center position that north south elongated and gradually decreased toward the east and west directions soil thickness map was divided into five equal interval classes table 5 describes the class range and pwcm thick overburden of soil with limited clay and high inter granular space is suitable for groundwater potential especially in basement complex terrain okhue and olorunfemi 1991 15 m 18 m depth comprises 48 area 18 m 20 m depth comprises 36 area 20 m 25 m depth comprises 10 area and 25 m 30 m depth comprises 6 area fig 7 b shows the soil thickness map for the proposed area 4 1 9 slope slo the gentle sloping area allows water movement slowly that favors adequate time to infiltration water into the aquifer high weight was assigned to the gentle sloping area and the lowest weight was assigned to the steep sloping area ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 the sloping value ranges from 9 to 29 in the study area result shows that 82 area comprises 0 to 3 16 area comprises 3 to 8 1 5 area comprises 8 to 15 and 0 5 area comprises 15 to 29 table 5 shows the pwcm for slope and fig 8 a shows the slope map of the proposed area 4 1 10 land use land cover lulc four land use classes namely cultivated land water body sand bar and settlement fig 8 b were detected for the proposed area cultivated land comprises 91 area water body comprises 1 area sand bar comprises 0 5 area and settlement comprises 8 area table 6 shows the pwcm for land use layer with the cr value of 0 08 according to ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 land use type provides knowledge about infiltration soil moisture groundwater and surface water etc of an area 4 2 groundwater potential zone gwpz the identification of gwpz involves a combination of ten thematic layers based on the rates and weight of thematic layers the formula for computing the gp map has shown below eq 14 14 g w p z 0 23 s l 0 21 l d 0 16 i r 0 12 g w t d 0 08 d d 0 06 r f 0 05 s t 0 04 g m 0 03 s l o 0 02 l u l c the gp map developed for the sustainable water resource management that was classified into five zones namely very low low moderate high and very high as shown in fig 9 groundwater potential zone comprises a very low area of 26 or 511 km2 low area of 56 or 1075 km2 moderate area of 15 or 282 km2 high area of 2 or 38 km2 and a very high area of 1 or 25 km2 cr value for each thematic layer was kept between 0 01 and 0 07 which is below one pwcm for ten thematic layers has shown in table 7 weight sequence of raster layer has taken as surface lithology lineament density infiltration rate gwt depth drainage density rainfall soil thickness geomorphology slope land use land cover high to very high gp zones are dominating mostly in alluvial silt areas where a very smooth to smooth geomorphology zone flat to moderate slope zone st ranges from 15 m to 18 m and gwtd ranges from 9 8 m to 14 9 m are existing the major portion of the study area has fallen very low to low gwpz surface lithology is clay which is not suitable for infiltration and groundwater recharge but crop cultivation in the study area depends on groundwater therefore groundwater depletion is common in this area 4 3 sensitivity analyses 4 3 1 map removal sensitivity analysis mrsa the mrsa results are shown in table 8 the result shows that the most sensitive layer for gp map is gwtd with the mean variation index is 8 9 though the assigned layer weight was taken 8 as shown in table 7 second third fourth and fifth layers are ir 8 89 lulc 8 84 dd 8 29 and st 8 18 respectively the lowest mrsa value was 5 86 for the slope the result shows that gp not only dependents on class weight and rate of a particular layer but also dependents on thematic layer weight 4 3 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis spsa table 9 shows the spsa value for each thematic layer results reveal that the most effective parameter for spsa is slope i e 29 7 mean effective weight value but the empirical weight for the slope was assigned 3 table 7 it may result from assigning an empirical weight of surface lithology 23 table 7 the next sensitive parameters are gm sl st and ld with the effective weight of 14 72 14 65 9 52 and 9 37 respectively ir gwtd and lulc are less effective to the gp with a mean effective weight 2 62 2 43 and 2 19 but empirical weights were assigned 16 12 and 2 respectively table 9 also shows that mean effective weights are 7 06 2 62 and 7 56 for rf lulc and dd respectively that are close to the empirical weight 6 2 and 8 of that layers table 7 5 conclusions gp study was carried out using ten thematic layers viz sl ld ir gwtd dd rf st gm slo and lulc that were collected from different secondary sources these layers were processed by geo referencing co register and rectify sub settings atmospheric correction and a dark object subtraction to test the gwpz at the rainless high evapotranspiration and drought prone plio pleistocene elevated tract by gis and rs technique the class priority of each thematic layer has been chosen using ahp by pairwise comparison matrix later the thematic layers were added using wlc thematic layers such as dd gm ld gwtd ir and rf have five classes thematic layers such as lulc slo and st have four classes and sl has three classes cr values for all thematic layers have been kept less than 0 1 the current study shows that various factors like physiography hydrology and geology etc are the main controlling factor for the groundwater recharge in the study area the major conclusion was carried as follows gis and rs tools and techniques provide logical information of gwpz otherwise it is difficult to detect for large area coverage rs technique provides fruitful results in minimal time and costs even in a particular area where it is difficult to assess gp wlc is useful for analysis in the gis technique for multi criteria decision and determination lithology plays an important role in groundwater recharge but mrsa reveals that all parameters are sensitive to gp and spsa reveal that slope and lineament are more effective to gp that slightly deviated from the empirical weight the response of gwpz was conceded with lulc sl slo gm flat sloping to smooth roughness area and alluvial silt are positive for gp gp map shows that the low potential zone has fallen into major clay soil regions of the study area where slope and roughness are high in this place the groundwater recharge amount is low but water withdraws continuously from the subsurface for irrigation therefore the study can help to understand the hydrogeological condition and use it as a guideline for further groundwater development practice for the proposed area funding the research

were working for the way of life in the country the last census was held during 2011 bbs report of 2015 illustrated that the population of bangladesh is 158 9 million with a growth rate of 1 37 during the past 30 years bangladesh has faced 100 plus cyclones and 60 flash floods with other natural disasters according to shahid et al 2015 at the proposed area groundwater resource is exploited by 96 5 for irrigation research paper of bangladesh rural advancement committee brac 2013 is expressing that the wetland area has changed about 25 25 from 1989 to 2000 and 4 02 from 2000 to 2010 the paper also expressing that intensity of deep tube well and shallow tube well installation has increased double and five times respectively and 8 5 times in a total increase number of the total change is 6 9 36 per km2 during 1984 85 fy to 2010 11 fy compared to the shallow and deep tube well installation irrigated land has increased 1 6 times only the study area is a drought prone area bari and anwar 2000 have shown that the river water level has fall 20 m 19 m from the original level and discharge has decreased from 90 8 to 56 9 m3 sec from 1981 to 2010 barind multipurpose development authority bmda 2006 calculated that during 1985 crop production rate was 117 but now the rate has reached to 216 in the study area according to the bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc 2002 the use of surface water and groundwater for irrigation has changed during the last two decades groundwater withdraw has risen from 41 to 75 in the year 1982 1983 to 2001 2002 but in comparison the surface water use has reduced shahid et al 2015 has shown that little river flow is existing for the heavy withdrawal of water at upstream of the ganges river and high drought occurrence is prominent in the study area therefore groundwater dependency is increasing for irrigation but overall analysis has concluded that groundwater use is not sustainable for the proposed area because of over exploitation of water from the subsurface in compared with the groundwater recharge the national water policy of the government of bangladesh inspires groundwater development for irrigation in the sectors of a public and private organization master planning organization 1991 water resources planning organization 2004 scientists have defined groundwater in different ways otutu and oviri 2010

imagery 2 study area the study area is slightly dome shaped highly dissected and north south elongated pleistocene uplifted part in compared to the surrounding area the special character of this area is terrace landform which shows sea level rise and fall for quaternary climatic change the maximum elevation is 45 m from the average mean sea level amsl that was found in this area the geomorphic evolution of the proposed area is a matter of debate for a long period a few portions of the landmass for the study area express morphological origin the tectonic upliftment produced the rest area the proposed area partially covering three districts namely naogaon rajshahi and chapai nawabganj and 10 upazilas namely tanore godagari shapahar porsha patnitala niamatpur dhamurhat nawabganj nachol gomostapur that comprises about 1931 km2 the geographical extent from 25 3 0 n to 24 6 0 n and 88 5 0 e to 88 11 0 e study area is bounded by padma river at the south mohananda river at the west atrai river at the east side fig 1 a shows the bangladesh map and fig 1 b describes the map of the proposed area 2 1 hydrogeology in bangladesh groundwater occurs at shallow depth except for the study area pleistocene dupi tila sand act as an aquifer in the proposed area for massive withdraw of groundwater water table progressively declined avg rate 0 10 m year which ultimately leads the area to water scarcity zone rashid et al 2013 the aquifer is characterized by 5 0 m 42 5 m thick single to multi layered two to four layers plio pleistocene aquifer system jahan et al 2007 the aquifer is overlain by thick silty clay a characteristic of this layer is semi pervious to impervious nature with a percolation rate ranges from 1 mm day to 2 mm day undp 1992 according to institute of water modeling iwm 2006 aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity t and specific yield sy that was obtained from pump test data are 10 20 m day 1000 m2 day and 0 06 to 0 30 respectively a lithological cross section was prepared using gamma ray log data that was collected from the bangladesh atomic energy commission baec fig 2 2 2 climatic condition the study area comprises three seasons winter season exists cool and dry without rainfall from november to february pre monsoon hot and dry exists from march to may and monsoon hot and rainy from june to october the average annual rainfall was recorded from 1389 to 1645 mm during the period 2000 to 2011 in the proposed area bangladesh meteorological department bmd also shows that the temperature of the barind area varies from 5 to 45 c with an average of 25 5 c minimum humidity is existing 40 70 in winter season and at the beginning of pre monsoon rest of the months humidity remain higher varying from 70 to 100 according to the bangladesh water development board bwdb data the annual evaporation of the area ranges from 370 mm to 1120 mm the slope of the proposed area ranges from 0 to 29 3 materials and methods secondary data were collected from different sources for groundwater potentiality identification lithological data were collated from the geological survey of bangladesh gsb vertical electrical sounding ves data were collected directly from field survey using resistivity survey method for the clay layer thickness identification digital elevation model dem from u s geological survey usgs groundwater table depth gwt and rainfall data were collected from bwdb land use land cover map was produced from the landsat image using remote sensing software envi 5 3 table 1 shows the data characteristics for the gp study fig 3 shows the groundwater potentiality study workflow 3 1 preparation of thematic layers thematic layers were chosen and processed after observing different literature and factors that have a direct influence on recharge 3 1 1 surface lithology sl according to akinlalu et al 2017 surface lithology influences recharge to the groundwater the presence of fine grain materials clay peat or silt and the percentage of organic matter within the soil decreases intrinsic permeability and prevent infiltration of surface water to the groundwater hence lithology plays an important role in groundwater potentiality study lithological information was obtained from the geological survey of bangladesh gsb 2001 three types of soil layer namely clay marsh clay and peat and alluvial silt are dominant in the proposed area 3 1 2 lineament density ld according to surinaidu et al 2017 high lineament density provides more recharge and good for groundwater potentiality the lineament map was prepared using arc gis from landsat etm panchromatic band of 15 m resolution image by edge enhancement technique lineament density was obtained by the ratio of the total length of lineaments to the catchment area eq 1 and the unit is km per km2 the lineament density map was divided into five equal interval classes 1 l i n e a m e n t d e n s i t y l d t ll a where t ll total length of the lineament a area of the study area 3 1 3 drainage density dd drainage network was extracted from the digital elevation model dem by arc gis software and the drainage density map was obtained using a line density tool drainage density value was calculated by the ratio of the total length of the channel to the basin area as eq 2 and the unit is km per km2 drainage density determines the rate of water percolation of a particular area akinlalu et al 2017 higher values allow very high and quick surface water runoff so infiltration is low in addition the lower value of drainage density allows lower runoff so the infiltration rate is high drainage density class was divided into five equal interval classes 2 d r a i n a g e d e n s i t y d d t s l a where t sl total stream length a area of the study area 3 1 4 infiltration rate ir according to faniran 1968 the infiltration rate is the product of drainage density eq 2 and stream frequency eq 3 of a watershed the infiltration number was determined by eq 4 for the proposed area infiltration number is directly proportional to the surface runoff which may be used to detect the high percolation zone the stream frequency of an area was obtained by the summation of all streams of a particular order divided by the catchment area dry soil percolates rainwater rapidly and finally reaches the aquifer according to ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 soil infiltration measures in a watershed are difficult for the dependency on so many factors viz soil texture topography rainfall intensity and vegetation etc 3 s t r e a m f r e q u e n c y s f n s a 4 i n f i l t r a t i o n r a t e i r d d s f where n s number of the stream of a particular stream order a area of the study area d d drainage density s f stream frequency 3 1 5 groundwater table depth gwtd groundwater table data was obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb at ten stations the value was prepared by averaging the annual average of the monthly average of weekly data from 1990 to 2016 the data was calculated considering the average mean sea level amsl according to patra et al 2018 groundwater table depth represents the interaction of groundwater with natural and anthropogenic activities of recharge and discharge components in response to geology climate physiography land and hydrology groundwater table raster value was classified into five classes 3 1 6 rainfall rf rainfall intensity and its duration play an important role in infiltration ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 rainfall data were obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb rainfall of six stations from 1990 to 2016 was taken for the proposed arena average of the annual average of daily data was used to create the interpolated rainfall raster map rainfall map was classified into five equally interval zones when all conditions fulfill the groundwater recharge situation becomes suitable to reach rainfall water into the aquifer 3 1 7 geomorphology gm geomorphology map helps to understand various geomorphic parts landforms and underlying rock that provide an outline of processes materials structures and geologic controls relating to groundwater prospects patra et al 2018 the hypsometric index value was obtained after analyzing over 2000 watershed using a stream threshold value 100 from the srtm dem the result shows that the elevated tract is staying at the mature or equilibrium stage with a hypsometric index value 0 3 to 0 6 roughness or irregularities have a direct influence on the water movement geomorphological divisions such as very smooth smooth moderate irregular and highly irregular are identified for the proposed area ayele et al 2015 the very smooth landform is suitable for groundwater recharge 3 1 8 soil thickness st soil thickness map was prepared using the vertical electrical sounding ves record that was collected from the field survey the clay layer is impervious to the recharge therefore the surface water cannot reach the aquifer in the clay layer zone using inverse distance weighting idw the clay layer thickness interpolation map was prepared dry clay soil has more cracks to the top layer those facilities to the infiltration of rainfall water and wet clay soil has more water holding capacity therefore wet soil play rule against recharge ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 the clay layer thickness map divided five classes of equal intervals 3 1 9 slope slo slope refers to the elevation changing rate and plays a role in identifying the groundwater potential zone the steeper slope supports the high surface runoff and rapid erosion of surface soil ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 dem was used for slope map preparation the slope is important for groundwater recharge a high slope angle is less suitable for infiltration that allows quick runoff of rainfall water berhanu et al 2013 classified slope as 0 3 flat 3 8 gentle 8 15 moderate and 15 30 steep 3 1 10 land use land cover lulc land use land cover was generated from 2013 landsat image and characteristics have given in table 1 landsat images were processed using atmospheric correction dark object subtraction and composite band creation that were later classified by supervised maximum likelihood classification technique according to patra et al 2018 agriculture land water body and the vegetation area favorable for groundwater recharge but settlement and wasteland areas are not significant for groundwater recharge 3 2 analytic hierarchy process ahp model for the ahp calculation element of each layer class of individual raster was obtained according to saaty 1980 that later used to calculate the pairwise comparison within the judgment matrix table 2 the judgment matrix was then used for calculating the normalized weight for each thematic layer later consistency was calculated to detect coherence of the judgment matrix ultimately detect the class weight and consistency ratio cr the steps are as follows step 1 pairwise comparison matrix pwcm was calculated as eq 5 5 j u d g m e n t m a t r i x x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 x n n where xnn indicator of the judgment matrix element step 2 calculation of normalized weight was determined as eq 6 6 n w g m n n 1 n f g m n where gm n geometric mean of nth row of judgment matrix x gm n was calculated by eq 7 7 gm n x 1 n x 2 n x n n f n step 3 consistency ratio cr to verify the coherence of the judgments eq 8 8 c r c i r i where ci consistency index ri saaty s ratio index ci was quantified using eq 9 9 c i λ m a x n f n f 1 λ max is an eigen value of the judgment matrix and calculated as eq 10 10 λ m a x n 1 n f x n n n f n w 3 3 groundwater potential zone identification during groundwater potential zone identification each layer weight and their classes are ranked individually based on the field experience and literature review for the proposed area finally the gp index map was generated using gis by wlc of thematic layers layer class rank individual class has individual rank and weight from saaty s assumption of each layer each layer has unique weight was multiplied to get the probable individual layer that was added to get groundwater potential zone gwpz map eq 11 shows the required groundwater potential zone calculation 11 g w p z i 1 n w i r i where gwpz groundwater potential zone wi weight for each layer ri rate for each class of each layer 3 4 sensitivity analysis spsa and mrsa calculations were carried out for gp map validation spsa refers that a particular layer how much sense considering the other layers for groundwater potentiality eq 12 shows the spsa calculation mrsa refers that the influence of a particular layer after removing from the gwpz map eq 13 shows the mrsa calculation 12 s p s a w i r i g w p z 100

removed gwpz groundwater potential zone after removing a layer 4 results and discussion 4 1 discussion of thematic layers 4 1 1 surface lithology sl surface lithology is important for soil conditions that are again related to soil characters like structure porosity adhesion and consistency mcgarry 2006 three lithological types are prominent for the proposed area clay is covering 93 area with class priority value 0 11 marsh clay and peat are covering 3 area of class priority value 0 26 and alluvial silt covering 4 area and class priority value is 0 63 cr value for the pwcm is 0 04 fig 4 a is describing lithology for the proposed area table 3 shows the pwcm alluvial silt has a relatively high porosity therefore assign high class rate value clay has low porosity therefore low class rate value was taken for clay 4 1 2 lineament density ld lineaments are structural features that have importance for groundwater recharge pradhan 2009 lineament appears as a linear feature viz structural lithological topography and drainage anomalies etc lineament may straight or curvilinear features the result shows that the lineament density value ranges from 0 to 0 0012 km per km2 as given in fig 4 b table 4 shows that the pwcm with cr value is 0 08 lineament density plays an important role in groundwater recharge through fractured rock that permits groundwater flow to the aquifer 4 1 3 drainage density dd drainage density refers to the dissected landscape by the stream that reflects surface runoff and permeability of the soil regions with high drainage density will have limited infiltration and rapid runoff therefore the low drainage density value is more favorable for high gp patra et al 2018 fig 5 a result shows that the drainage density value ranges from 0 to 1 35 km per km2 table 4 shows the pwcm with a cr value of 0 08 4 1 4 infiltration rate ir infiltration is important to soil hydraulic property that influences agriculture and water resources infiltration allows groundwater to recharge to the aquifer infiltration rate map was classified into five classes namely very low of 0 5 area low of 7 area moderate of 79 area high of 12 5 area and very high of 1 area where cr value is 0 08 a high infiltration rate is suitable for groundwater potential table 4 shows the pwcm fig 5 b describes the infiltration rate map of the proposed area 4 1 5 groundwater table depth gwtd the groundwater table depth value ranges from 4 7 m to 30 m and quantifies considering the average mean sea level amsl the map was divided into five equal intervals to produce the pwcm as shown in table 4 fig 6 a shows the groundwater table depth map 4 7 m 9 8 m groundwater table depth comprises 7 area 9 8 m 14 9 m groundwater table depth comprises 58 area 14 9 m 19 9 m groundwater table depth comprises 26 area 19 9 m 25 1 m groundwater table depth comprises 10 area 25 1 m 30 m depth comprises 1 area the shallow depth of the groundwater table is suitable for groundwater recharge cr value for groundwater table depth was found at 0 01 4 1 6 rainfall rf high intensity and short time rainfall cause less infiltration and more runoff 1389 1645 mm rainfall occurred in the study area during the rainy season the range has been classified into equal five intervals as shown in fig 6 b table 4 describes the pwcm for the proposed area high weight was assigned for high rainfall value and low weight was assigned for low rainfall value cr value for rainfall calculation is 0 07 4 1 7 geomorphology gm the study area has been divided into five classes depending on geomorphology namely very smooth smooth moderate irregular highly irregular land fig 7 a shows the geomorphology of the proposed area geomorphology classes and the rates were shown with pwcm in table 4 with a cr value of 0 01 4 1 8 soil thickness st soil thickness varies from 15 m to 30 m in the proposed area maximum clay thickness was found at the center position that north south elongated and gradually decreased toward the east and west directions soil thickness map was divided into five equal interval classes table 5 describes the class range and pwcm thick overburden of soil with limited clay and high inter granular space is suitable for groundwater potential especially in basement complex terrain okhue and olorunfemi 1991 15 m 18 m depth comprises 48 area 18 m 20 m depth comprises 36 area 20 m 25 m depth comprises 10 area and 25 m 30 m depth comprises 6 area fig 7 b shows the soil thickness map for the proposed area 4 1 9 slope slo the gentle sloping area allows water movement slowly that favors adequate time to infiltration water into the aquifer high weight was assigned to the gentle sloping area and the lowest weight was assigned to the steep sloping area ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 the sloping value ranges from 9 to 29 in the study area result shows that 82 area comprises 0 to 3 16 area comprises 3 to 8 1 5 area comprises 8 to 15 and 0 5 area comprises 15 to 29 table 5 shows the pwcm for slope and fig 8 a shows the slope map of the proposed area 4 1 10 land use land cover lulc four land use classes namely cultivated land water body sand bar and settlement fig 8 b were detected for the proposed area cultivated land comprises 91 area water body comprises 1 area sand bar comprises 0 5 area and settlement comprises 8 area table 6 shows the pwcm for land use layer with the cr value of 0 08 according to ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 land use type provides knowledge about infiltration soil moisture groundwater and surface water etc of an area 4 2 groundwater potential zone gwpz the identification of gwpz involves a combination of ten thematic layers based on the rates and weight of thematic layers the formula for computing the gp map has shown below eq 14 14 g w p z 0 23 s l 0 21 l d 0 16 i r 0 12 g w t d 0 08 d d 0 06 r f 0 05 s t 0 04 g m 0 03 s l o 0 02 l u l c the gp map developed for the sustainable water resource management that was classified into five zones namely very low low moderate high and very high as shown in fig 9 groundwater potential zone comprises a very low area of 26 or 511 km2 low area of 56 or 1075 km2 moderate area of 15 or 282 km2 high area of 2 or 38 km2 and a very high area of 1 or 25 km2 cr value for each thematic layer was kept between 0 01 and 0 07 which is below one pwcm for ten thematic layers has shown in table 7 weight sequence of raster layer has taken as surface lithology lineament density infiltration rate gwt depth drainage density rainfall soil thickness geomorphology slope land use land cover high to very high gp zones are dominating mostly in alluvial silt areas where a very smooth to smooth geomorphology zone flat to moderate slope zone st ranges from 15 m to 18 m and gwtd ranges from 9 8 m to 14 9 m are existing the major portion of the study area has fallen very low to low gwpz surface lithology is clay which is not suitable for infiltration and groundwater recharge but crop cultivation in the study area depends on groundwater therefore groundwater depletion is common in this area 4 3 sensitivity analyses 4 3 1 map removal sensitivity analysis mrsa the mrsa results are shown in table 8 the result shows that the most sensitive layer for gp map is gwtd with the mean variation index is 8 9 though the assigned layer weight was taken 8 as shown in table 7 second third fourth and fifth layers are ir 8 89 lulc 8 84 dd 8 29 and st 8 18 respectively the lowest mrsa value was 5 86 for the slope the result shows that gp not only dependents on class weight and rate of a particular layer but also dependents on thematic layer weight 4 3 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis spsa table 9 shows the spsa value for each thematic layer results reveal that the most effective parameter for spsa is slope i e 29 7 mean effective weight value but the empirical weight for the slope was assigned 3 table 7 it may result from assigning an empirical weight of surface lithology 23 table 7 the next sensitive parameters are gm sl st and ld with the effective weight of 14 72 14 65 9 52 and 9 37 respectively ir gwtd and lulc are less effective to the gp with a mean effective weight 2 62 2 43 and 2 19 but empirical weights were assigned 16 12 and 2 respectively table 9 also shows that mean effective weights are 7 06 2 62 and 7 56 for rf lulc and dd respectively that are close to the empirical weight 6 2 and 8 of that layers table 7 5 conclusions gp study was carried out using ten thematic layers viz sl ld ir gwtd dd rf st gm slo and lulc that were collected from different secondary sources these layers were processed by geo referencing co register and rectify sub settings atmospheric correction and a dark object subtraction to test the gwpz at the rainless high evapotranspiration and drought prone plio pleistocene elevated tract by gis and rs technique the class priority of each thematic layer has been chosen using ahp by pairwise comparison matrix later the thematic layers were added using wlc thematic layers such as dd gm ld gwtd ir and rf have five classes thematic layers such as lulc slo and st have four classes and sl has three classes cr values for all thematic layers have been kept less than 0 1 the current study shows that various factors like physiography hydrology and geology etc are the main controlling factor for the groundwater recharge in the study area the major conclusion was carried as follows gis and rs tools and techniques provide logical information of gwpz otherwise it is difficult to detect for large area coverage rs technique provides fruitful results in minimal time and costs even in a particular area where it is difficult to assess gp wlc is useful for analysis in the gis technique for multi criteria decision and determination lithology plays an important role in groundwater recharge but mrsa reveals that all parameters are sensitive to gp and spsa reveal that slope and lineament are more effective to gp that slightly deviated from the empirical weight the response of gwpz was conceded with lulc sl slo gm flat sloping to smooth roughness area and alluvial silt are positive for gp gp map shows that the low potential zone has fallen into major clay soil regions of the study area where slope and roughness are high in this place the groundwater recharge amount is low but water withdraws continuously from the subsurface for irrigation therefore the study can help to understand the hydrogeological condition and use it as a guideline for further groundwater development practice for the proposed area funding the research

which is usually blackened by a highly absorptive black material the base of the still radiates energy in the infra red region which is partially absorbed and re radiated back into the still by the cover heat from the still base is transferred into the water thereby increasing its temperature and evaporation of the heated upper layers of the water is enhanced convection currents inside the still carry this warm vapour air mixture to the cooler transparent cover the water vapour generated condenses on the underside of this cover the heat of condensation being conducted through it to the environment the water film of condensate on the inner side of the cover flows down the surface into the collecting trough and is collected as distilled water the technology is age old and has been in use from the days when sailors used this technology to desalinate seawater to make potable water in the 15th century arab alchemists used the lens and concentrated sun rays onto a pot to distill water from the 15th century to the 21st century the systems of water distillation using solar energy had passed several transitions in its design and had become a prevalent option for water purification kalita et al 2017 however it was only after world war ii the funding towards the development of solar desalination started soaring up when it was felt to be a useful technology for armies it has become a tendency in the scientific community to integrate different desalination processes with solar energy devices to enhance energy savings and augment efficiencies fig 3 shows two different designs of ss namely rain machine and aquamate rain machine is a ss developed by the us department of energy in collaboration with florida solar energy centre it was developed to make solar distillation technology popular among common people aquamate ss is one of the commercial design of ss which is very popular among sailors and adventure lovers it is made of a flexible polymer that can distillate water from impure water anywhere with the utilization of freely available solar energy therefore the use of solar distillation becomes an extremely attractive alternative solution to tackle the problem of water scarcity in remote locations fig 4 shows the basic processes involved in solar distillation sss coupled with technologies like pv t nanoparticle encapsulated phase change material pcm with sun tracking solar pond etc are some of the techno economically feasible systems for clean water generation al musawi et al 2018 dsilva winfred rufuss et al 2018a even photo thermal material absorber made with paper and pencil have been found to generate close to a liter of water per hour c paper a paper based carbon particle system can also be a solution towards increasing the efficiency of solar desalination processes newly invented nanotechnology based solutions such as 2d defective tungsten oxide nanosheets as photo absorber are found to have an evaporation efficiency of 76 at 1 sun condition with such encouraging research findings solar desalination technology can be an effective solution for clean water generation in the coming days though the productivity of ss is a major concern for the researchers the distillate quality is also an aspect to not forget besides recent technological developments that proved the efficiency improvement of solar distillation devices many research also showed that ss can effectively remove chemicals and bacteria from the dirty water ss is even reported to remove complex chemicals such as epoxiconazole and pyraclostrobin from effluents by 99 whereas ozonation can achieve 73 and 91 removal of epoxiconazole and pyraclostrobin respectively hoff et al 2019 dsilva winfred rufuss et al dsilva winfred rufuss et al 2016 presented a summary of economic analysis of different types of ss and found that cost can be reduced if locally available materials are used for construction nasri et al 2019 the ss can successfully convert saline water to a standard necessary for agricultural usage mashaly et al 2015 the solar distillation is an effective technique to eliminate suspended solids dissolved solids and atomic elements abujazar et al 2018a hanson et al hanson et al 2004 studied the nitrate and fluoride removal ability of a single basin ss along with organic contaminants this study put forward many important observations such as distillate quality was unaffected by the salinity and hardness of the feed water their designed still has reported a removal efficiency of more than 99 on salinity total hardness nitrate and fluoride along with 99 9 for bacteria fig 2 shows the removal efficiency of a ss for fluoride the feeding of the still should be carried out during the day to avoid bacterial contamination malaeb et al 2017 the sss has also been reported to remove arsenic from 6 mg l to 0 01 mg l in distillate jasrotia et al 2012 the ss technology has achieved the reputation within the frame of prescribed drinking water quality standards by highly reputed international organisations such as world health organization who united states environmental protection agency epa and bureau of indian standards arunkumar et al 2019 it is important to understand the physics of heat transfer in a ss to achieve higher efficiency by identifying the areas of minimising the heat losses and increasing thermal energy trapping the various types of heat transfers taking place in the ss can be categorized into internal and external heat transfer the internal heat transfer takes place from the basin water to the inward surface of the glass whereas external heat losses are the top bottom and side losses different heat transfers and losses that occur in a conventional single slope single basin ss are given in table 1 and fig 4 shows the heat transfer mechanisms in a typical ss a community which is located at about 100 km from a freshwater source can save about 33 of total cost spent on transporting clean water if solar distillation is adopted instead howe 1986 nijmeh et al 2005 a ss can be the most appropriate water purification technique in terms of its environmental compatibility and effectiveness for rural and remote applications different modifications have been made by researchers on the absorber of ss and adding auxiliaries to the still this includes sponge cubes that can enhance ss production by as much as 273 abu hijleh et al 2001 and the use of wicks that can increase productivity by about 114 omara et al 2013 preheating inlet water is also an effective technique to enhance the yield of the still because it increases the temperature difference between basin water and inner glass surface which improves the evaporation process thanvi and pande 1988 integration of water and solar air collectors have reportedly increased distillate productivity by 175 eltawil and omara 2014 the efficiency enhancement of 57 is reported when pcm were used in the absorber plate pcm stores the thermal energy and supply it to the brackish water when the usual external heat supply is not available naim en abd el kawi 2003a the most influential parameters on still efficiency are found to be solar irradiance intensity insulation effectiveness of the ss basin mass condenser inner reflectivity and evaporation surface area ahsan et al 2014 durkaieswaran and murugavel 2015 kalita et al 2016 research is also carried out on ss having additional vertical rotating wick surface which increases the evaporation area haddad et al 2017 there is an added advantage of solar desalination as water production increases under the summer season which is consistent with the water demand during this time of the year researchers across the world are trying to find ways to enhance the productivity of the ss to promote its broad applicability by focusing their study on one or more of the mentioned parameters few other parameters such as condenser material the mass of condenser outer emissivity wind speed and cover tilt angle were reported to be of less importance fath and hosny 2002 the present study incorporates a review of some of the recent works carried out in the field of productivity enhancement of ss s mostly in the last ten years the article discusses both the active and passive types of solar stills the active type of stills includes use of additional condensers or collectors reflectors humidification dehumidification hd units etc whereas in passive category of stills modifications done on absorber plate addition of heat storage medium nanofluid in basin water etc are discussed the economic analysis of various solar still designs is also reviewed in the study the study can be a useful resource for researchers who attempt to gain a comprehensive idea about solar still technology 2 distillate enhancement techniques during last few years the area of solar powered distillation has attracted the attention of the scientific community worldwide researchers have attempted numerous methods either to curb the external losses or to enhance the internal heat transfer coefficients scientists and researchers have tried various methods to increase the distillate productivity of the ss such as absorber plate modifications use of dye sponges condenser units external reflectors concentrating collectors heat storage medium nano particles multi effect configuration integration of hdunits preheating of feed water spray feeding mechanism rotating absorber etc kabeel et al kabeel et al 2018c have carried out a review on design modifications on inclined sss for productivity enhancement the authors reported distillate yield of 1 8 1 l m2 d for passive still designs whereas 1 049 9 l m2 d for active systems the cost of distillate production is reported to have decreased with technological advancement in the field of solar water distillation the production cost per liter of distillate using either passive or active solar distillation method is very economical in egyptian and saudi markets the cost can be reduced by using locally available materials and avoiding sun tracking devices el bialy et al 2016 in the present section some of the distillate production enhancement techniques that are studied widely will be discussed the review has been divided into two categories i e active and passive designs 2 1 active ss depending on the methods used to enhance the production stills are categorized into active and passive types of solar stills in active types of stills additional condensers or collectors are used 2 1 1 integration of condenser with ss different designs were developed and tested by researchers to improve the distillate productivity of sss one such design is the ss integrated with an external or internal condenser which is deemed to be effective this section will introduce and discuss the status of different sss integrated with various designs of condensers the condenser acts as an additional heat and mass sink the hot vapour in the still will tend to move from the still to the condenser due to diffusion purging or natural circulation and condenses on the cold surface fath and elsherbiny 1993 the productivity is sensitive to mass flow rate of coolant in the condenser tubes the volume of the condenser tubes and the condenser area yahia mahammed et al 2019 table 2 presents an overview of various works on integration condenser to a ss inbuilt passive cooler has the capability of bringing enhanced condensation output bhardwaj et al bhardwaj et al 2015 showed the effect of increase in the condensation area on the production of water from a solar still the experiments were performed both under indoor and outdoor conditions the designed ss is shown in fig 5 indoor test conducted at constant energy input of 625 w m2 reported an increase of 65 distillate output whereas under the outdoor condition the production of water increased by more than 50 with reference to still without an additional area of condensation an experimental study was to explore the impact of utilizing a double pass inner condenser on the performance of a single sloped ss by ahmed et al ahmed 1988 the results showed that the use of condenser improved the distillation yield from 5 5 to 5 9 l m2 d el bahi et al el bahi and inan 1999 designed a ss with a parallel double glass with a separate condenser in this work dunkle s relation dunkle 1961 was used for estimation of heat and mass transfer inside the evaporator the same authors also studied a ss with a tilt angle of 4 coupled to an outside condenser the ss reported a yield up to 7 l m2 d with an improvement of 70 as compared to a conventional still during the summer a theoretical investigation of a single sloped basin still with built in condenser was studied by fath and hosny fath and hosny 2002 the still was designed such that one of its covered side is tilted to be parallel to the sun rays so that the condenser can be placed in shaded areas black dyes in the basin water was also added to increase its absorptivity the combined effect of all the modifications resulted in an increase of distillate production by 55 than the conventional single sloped basin still a numerical study on the effect of integrating an adjacent condensation chamber to a single basin double slope ss was carried out by belhadj et al belhadj et al 2015 a part of vapour generated inside the still is condensed on the inner glass surface of the still and the rest is directed to the condenser the daily yield reported is 7 15 l m2 with an improvement in the production rate of about 60 higher than that of the conventional still in such ss systems where condensation is taking place both in the glass and condenser the collection system is required at the two locations this cause an elevated system cost this situation could be avoided by using a suction device such as a blower or fan in the condenser unit to minimise the vapour movement from basin water to the glass and maximising the mass transfer takes place from basin to condenser this will reduce the system cost as well as improve the ease of distillate collection al hamadani et al al hamadani and shukla 2013 tried to improve the performance of the single slope ss by adding block shaped fins on the absorber plate a phase change material pcm chamber having slender shaped fins for enhancing the thermal conductivity of the pcm and a condenser the authors studied the effects of variation of mass of water in the basin and mass of pcm on the distillate productivity the results showed that the rate of condensation was increased by the secondary condenser it was found that productivity of the still with mentioned modifications i e 5 71 l m2 is higher than that of conventional still 4 29 l m2 al nimr et al al nimr and dahdolan 2015a introduced a novel ss design utilizing concentration porous evaporation internal condensation and thermos phonic circulations in this work the authors observed that the efficiency of still increase with decreasing temperature of condenser and the wind speed the ss proposed has a tubular configuration having porous evaporator hay and sponge were used to make the evaporator the sponge was also printed with dark colour an internal condenser is also part of the system which boosts the condensation rate of the vapour generated and parabolic concentrator to increase the basin water temperature in the tubular still fig 6 shows the setup developed by al nimr et al al nimr and dahdolan 2015a the proposed ss is found to have numerous advantages such as improved distillation rate negligible electricity consumption compact size due to concentration faster transient response of the evaporator and waste heat recovery through absorption of latent heat of condensation the efficiency of the still as obtained from the simulation results is 17 1 21 3 with a distillate production rate of 1 51 1 89 kg day for the ambient temperature of 25 c and solar irradiance of 500 w m2 kerfah et al kerfah et al 2012 studied about modular ss through simulation and model design the model has a streaming plate collector and condenser they studied numerically about the modular system considering natural convection mode of heat transfer the top of the ss was made up of glass the still also had a concentric tube enclosure with the absorber the absorber material was steel sheet governing equations for the heat and mass exchanger were established using the nodal method the obtained distillate mass was found to be maximum during august while the best performance is recorded during may the still was simulated considering the weather condition of algeria el samadonyetal et al el samadony et al 2015 studied experimentally a stepped ss the still was integrated with reflectors and external condenser the tray width is equal to the step width 100 mm in the constructed ss a suction fan was used to route the water vapour into the condenser the distillate productivity as reported from the experimental study was 66 higher in case of the stepped still with condenser than that of the conventional still an improvement of 165 in distillate production is observed when both internal and external reflectors and the external condenser was used hassan and abo elfadl hassan and abo elfadl 2017 performed an experimental study on the effect of condenser type on the production rate of ss the authors also investigated the effect of adding black steel fibers and sand with the saline water in the basin an increase of 52 productivity was observed by using aluminium heat sink with pins as condenser surface along with sand and black steel fiber in the basin than the conventional ss fig 7 shows one proposal of handy ss design by monowe et al monowe et al 2011 an external reflecting booster mirror and an external condenser were incorporated in this ss design the proposed ss has provision for recovery of latent heat of condensation at the condenser which can be utilised for preheating the saline water or other domestic utilities the ss efficiency can go up by 85 if latent heat of condensation is utilised for saline water preheating and reported an extra 1 l production of distilled water ibrahim et al ibrahim et al 2015 tried to reduce the energy requirement for evaporation of water in the basin zone by bringing the inside pressure of the still chamber to sub atmospheric level using a vacuum pump the authors also used an external condenser for improving the rate of condensation though results showed improvement in efficiency and productivity the cost of generation is reported to be higher than the conventional ss 2 1 2 humidification dehumidification system integrated ss hd process can be categorized under active solar desalination system due to use of additional unit bhardwaj et al 2015 when air comes in contact with salt water the water vapour humidifies air as the temperature of air increases vapour carrying capacity of air also increases the required energy for increasing the temperature can be supplied by solar energy the distilled water can be obtained from direct contact of humid air with some cooled surface hd is a versatile technique that can be adapted for water desalination with several advantages such as flexibility in capacity moderate installation and working costs simplicity plausibility of utilizing low temperature and the utilization of sustainable power source according to parekh et al faridb et al 2004 hd is a great invention in the field of ss nafey et al nafey et al 2004a 2004b investigated the thermal model involving transient heat transfer of a naturally circulated hd ss the still productivity is similar to that of a forced circulation model as reported by the authors tabrizi et al farshchi tabrizi et al 2016 experimentally investigated cascade ss coupled with a hdsystem two parameters were considered in their investigation to study the daily productivity under different conditions these were the effect of feed water flow rate and air flow rates a closed air loop assisted by a blower is used in the developed system the outlet water is not circulated back to the cascade system to maintain efficiency from decreasing because with recirculation of outlet water salt from outlet water covers the surface of the absorber assembling of the hd system with cascade ss css resulted in increment of efficiency from 28 to 141 hacene et al mahmoudi et al 2010 proposed a mathematical model for the study of a passive condenser and hd unit integrated greenhouse water desalination system two different designs were considered for the study one is a passive cooling system with condenser which is immersed in basin water the other one is an external passive condenser which is placed on the top of the basin the humid air temperature and relative humidity were found to be the two major factors that have affected the rate of condensation based on the long term study of the system authors have also investigated the relationships between the condensate rate and those variables one of the parts of this work was the mathematical study of the influence of condenser design parameters on daily distillate output their results showed high condensation rates for condenser tubes with a large value of inner diameter and low temperature of the coolant in the condenser tube sharshir et al sharshir et al 2016 investigated a high yielding desalination system having hd and ss integrated with evacuated solar water heater the experimental study was performed in june august 2014 at kafrelshikh university egypt this design reused the drained out warm water from hd for feeding ss and thus achieved a gain of 50 in the output ratio of the system the production of the hybrid system was approximately 200 more than that of the conventional one the cost per unit liter of distillate from the hybrid desalination system was around 0 034 however such systems have a high chance of failing in the long run because impure water circulating in hd system led to its fouling and poor heat transfer characteristics pv t collectors can also be integrated into hd solar desalination systems to enhance the overall system performance das et al 2018a mahmoud et al mahmoud et al 2018 has investigated a ss with a hd system for desalination having integrated concentrating and pv t collectors the authors have studied the system productivity at various operating conditions viz varying the flow rate of air mass varied from 0 1 to 1 5 kg s at different water basin height 0 01 0 3 m and at various concentrating ratio cr 1 up to 5 the optimal operating conditions for the system was observed at cr of 3 and basin water height of 0 15 m with both pv t systems for water and air attaining the required optimal operating conditions the maximum distillate yield at the optimum operating condition is reported to be around 9 l m2 d the productivity of the hd and ss integrated system is significantly affected by the temperature of the input feed water therefore high temperature solar heating devices like concentrators and evacuated tubes collectors are recommended the effect of air temperature on productivity is reported to be insignificant it is also evident from the literature that closed cycle of heated air and water is the most efficient the efficiency of the system can also be enhanced significantly by maximising the absorptivity and heat transfer area of the humidifier shalaby et al 2017 2 1 3 integration of reflecting surface reflecting surfaces are accessories for ss application because it improves the flexibility of the absorber plate configuration external reflectors er s are useful in the locations where the solar irradiance is frail er s are made up of mirror and finished metal plate use of er s is also an economical approach er is used to enhance the energy input to the basin tanaka et al tanaka 2009 tanaka and nakatake 2009a 2007a have conducted several numerical investigations on a ss model which consists of a top mirror and tilted evaporating wick the mirror is placed on the extension from the upper edge of the still the authors concluded that the top mirror was useful for increasing solar radiation availability for absorption by the wick the reflected solar irradiation from the top mirror can be further enhanced by adjusting the orientation for various seasons depending on the position of the sun sebaii et al el sebaii 2000 used external mirrors to observe the effect on performance of a double slope single basin solar dssbs the daily productivity is found to be improved with the mirrors by 19 and 30 as compared to dssbs without mirrors during the summer and winter season respectively tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2005 theoretically studied a ss which comprises of a flat mirror a vertical parallel partitions contacted with wicks and small casters for tracking the still was based on vertical multiple effect diffusion principle the authors recommended the still due to its ease of construction the work theoretically analysed the effect of mirror angle and azimuth angle of the still on solar absorbance of the first partition the authors made a conclusion that tracking provision in the system has a positive effect on the amount of solar absorption of the first partition it is important to have an optimum orientation of reflector and the optimum tilt angle for vertical multiple effect diffusion ss integrated with a flat plate reflector this study has been carried out theoretically by tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2007b over the years the authors observed that the orientation of the reflector should be 10 from horizontal during summer and changed to 0 during the winter at higher latitudes irrespective of any latitude the orientation of the still should be adjusted according to the month to have maximum output tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2007c carried out an experimental study to validate their earlier theoretical study of the effect reflector angle and orientation of the still on ss productivity the authors found that the results of both the theoretical and experimental study are quite similar the numerical study predicted that the daily production of the system having 10 partitions with a diffusion gap of 10 mm between successive partitions to be about 5 6 times as large as that of a single effect vertical still it was also predicted to produce 29 2 and 34 6 l m2 on a sunny day of spring equinox and winter solstice days respectively at the location near the equator tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2009b has also carried out a theoretical investigation of one step azimuth tracking tilted wick ss twss with a vertical flat plate reflection the use reflector found to increase the productivity of twss by around 41 the performance of a ss with an external acrylic mirror as shown in fig 8 was studied by shanmugan et al shanmugan et al 2008 an estimated 26 improvement in the efficiency has been reported with the addition booster mirror kumar et al kumar et al 2008 analysed the thermal performance of a v type ss the still has charcoal absorber and mirror the advantage with this configuration is that it has a slope from edge to the central portion and facilitate the distillate water collection from the centre of the still as seen from fig 9 the overall efficiency for the v type ss reported being 24 5 and 11 9 for the still with and without the boosting mirror respectively the authors also performed experiments with charcoal bed absorber and mirror and found the efficiency of 30 05 khalifa and ibrahim khalifa and ibrahim 2009 did experimental investigation on the productivity of a basin type ss with an internal and external reflector at different tilt for a location at 33 3 n during winter the productivity found to be maximum with reflectors inclined at 20 it was estimated that around 2 45 times increment of productivity had been gained compared to simple still without reflectors srivastava and agarwal srivastava and agrawal 2013a studied theoretically as well as the experimentally about a ss with floating porous absorbers and twin reflectors as the materials of porous absorbers were jute cloth and floating thermocol so it ensures uniform distribution of the feed water over the absorber plate by capillary action and helps in keeping the absorber plate always wet by avoiding dry spots the productivity was improved by 68 and 35 more than the conventional still on a clear sky and cloudy days respectively when a twin reflector booster was placed perpendicularly on the upper edge of the modified still the productivity increased by 79 over the still without a reflector omara et al omara et al 2016 experimentally studied passive ss having a corrugated absorber plate with wick lining and reflectors an improvement of 55 36 in the distillate production was reported as compared to conventional ss whereas with the addition of wick the improvement in productivity was found to be 90 more than that of conventional still and the average efficiency of 49 3 was reported however the best result in terms of productivity 145 5 improvement compared to conventional ss was achieved when reflecting mirrors were used estahbanati et al karimi estahbanati et al 2016 investigated theoretically and experimentally the effect of internal reflectors on the efficiency of single slope ss for both summer and winter seasons the authors proposed an accurate prediction radiation model for productivity of the still which was better than the earlier developed models the model is unique in way that it considers the effect of all the four walls of the still chamber on the total amount of solar radiation received by the still basin the results proved that an enhancement of efficiency was observed by 18 and 22 with installation of reflectors on the front and side walls and installation on the back wall respectively fresnel reflectors are also used by a few researchers to increase the productivity of the sss sriram et al sriram et al 2019 tried to produce pure water from industrial wastewater using a double slope single basin still integrated with fresnel reflector gang et al gang et al 2019 proposed a multi effect tube distiller that uses a linear fresnel mirror field and works on the scientific principle of concentrating direct heating multi effect tubular falling film distillation the designed setup by the authors is shown in fig 10 the proposed system has reported a pure water generation capacity of 63 68 kg day at the cost of 0 0067 kg the review presented in this section clearly indicated that using the reflectors i e both internal and external can enhance the productivity of the sss significantly the inner mirrors spoil at a very rapid manner this is a disadvantage of ss with inside mirrors ss with reflectors needs to be adjusted its orientation with respect to the sun along the year in order to get maximum possible output this is another disadvantage with such system the distillate output of fresnel reflector equipped multi effect tubular still is found to be high as compared to the basic ss designs however the water production cost is more compared to other contemporary water purification techniques using conventional reflectors but such a device can provide pure water for people living in remote areas and the system doesn t need any labor management during the operation the ss with external reflectors for concentration can be a viable option in remote areas with weak solar radiation incidence 2 1 4 thermoelectric devices in a ss in 1821 a baltic german physicist thomas johann seebeck observed that when two dissimilar metals are joined at two different points having a different temperature at the junctions an electromotive force is generated in the circuit in 1834 jean peltier reported the reverse phenomenon to that which was earlier observed by seebeck joffe 2010 nolas et al 2001 he noted that there is a heating or cooling of a junction of a pair of dissimilar substances if direct current is passed through them these revelations were unable to get consideration of the scientific community until 1838 when lenz a german researcher demonstrated the significance of them he solidified and liquefied water by these impacts which prompted the idea of thermoelectric refrigeration he froze and melted a water droplet by these effects this established the concept of thermoelectric cooling nolas et al 2001 thermoelectric coolers tec have various advantages such as they have no moving parts very long life noiseless operation compact in size easily controllable and suitable for low voltage due to the mentioned advantages tec s made its way into solar cooling applications sarbu and dorca 2018 even though incorporation of tec in solar application especially in sss is not extensive but few works reported in this area in the recent past esfahani et al esfahani et al 2011 developed a portable ss integrated with the thermoelectric cooling package fig 11 the developed still has separate evaporation and condensation zone with a sprinkler for feed water supply into the evaporation zone the results showed that the output and efficiency of the still is 1 2 l m2 d and 13 respectively another experimental work carried out by rahbar and esfahani rahbar and esfahani 2012 studied a system having both heat pipe and thermoelectric cooling according to the authors with the increase in temperature difference between the basin water and the condensation surface results in more efficiency and production rate the same group of authors developed an improved portable asymmetrical ss design and tested rahbar et al 2016 the results proved that a greater temperature difference could be achieved by using tec compared to glass water nazari et al nazari et al 2019 investigated the performance of single slope ss with external tec for cover glass cooling and copper oxide nanoparticle in the basin water the authors showed that the efficiency of the system could be improved by using tec and copper oxide nanoparticles in the basin water however one disadvantage of this system was high cost of clean water generation this was because of high cost of copper oxide nanoparticles shafii et al shafii et al 2016 used evacuated tubes to generate vapour and used the heat of condensation to get the desired temperature difference to operate the thermoelectric panel which in turn runs a fan for directing the generated vapour onto the condensation surface and simultaneously keeping the condensation chamber relatively cool the schematic of the developed experimental setup is shown in fig 12 the system has been reported to yield a maximum of 1 1 kg of distillate in an hour and efficiency improvement of 68 however this type of system may be inefficient in the long run due to fouling of the heat transfer surface in the collector as there is direct contact of impure water with the collector tube surfaces al madhhachi and min al madhhachi and min 2017 designed and developed a miniature ss utilizing both the hot and cold surfaces of the thermoelectric module for evaporation and condensation respectively the designed still has a basin of dimension 116 mm 116 mm and reported to generate an hourly distillate output of 28 5 ml 2 1 5 pv integrated ss pv integrated ss is used to generate power and purify water at the same time pv panel is used for the self sustainability of the system in case of passive ss the productivity is found to be lower active ss is a good alternative as it converts the solar energy to heat energy of an external fluid the external fluid is circulated throughout the ss basin for heat transfer with the help of a dc pump the external power source for running the dc pump is provided by the pv panel manokar et al manokar et al 2018 designed an integrated system of pv module with ss both for power and fresh water production a polycrystalline pv panel was attached with an inclined ss to reduce the vapour loss the ss was fully covered with silicon paste cotton thread was put on the solar cell to increase the evaporation rate maximum distillate output of 7 3 kg was obtained with inclined solar panel basin with sidewall and bottom wall insulation with insulation the heat loss to surroundings decreased and the water temperature could reach up to 73 5 c but the panel efficiency decrease because of the increase in panel temperature singh et al singh et al 2011 fabricated one double slope active ss by integrating pvt system the objective of their modification was to increase the temperature of the water at ss so that the productivity could be increased the modification was done by connecting one flat plate collector and another photovoltaic integrated collector the experimental performance was observed both in natural and forced circulation mode series and parallel one dc motor is operated with the pv module for the circulation of water in forced mode parallel forced mode configuration gave higher yield 7 54 kg day and the energy efficiency was found to be 17 4 the energy payback period was estimated to be 3 years which was 30 less than pvt integrated single slope ss an experiment was performed on pvt active ss after applying heating and cover cooling by kumar et al praveen kumar et al 2018 the hybrid ss was designed with the same dimension as the conventional single slope ss for comparison the modification was incorporating arrangement of panels and a heating filament that touch the basin water in the still water was first spread with spreading tube on the pv and then fed to the basin the nicr heating element was connected to the basin with a battery connection from the pv so that the system could work on cloudy days also the maximum temperature of basin water power output and productivity were almost 50 30 and 6 times higher than the conventional passive ss the study carried by paunraj et al pounraj et al 2018 included the overall performance of a ss using peltier base hybrid pv t active system the ss design consisted of saline water storage tank basin valve control peltier modules solar pv panel battery and recycling water tank the peltier module was designed with one p n junction where cooling happened due to movement of electrons so the cooling system was expected to have longer life as no moving parts were involved two main modifications were done to increase the productivity of the ss and the efficiency of the pv panel the input basin water was used to carry the heat from pv panel thus decreasing the temperature of panel which was needed for efficiency enhancement for achieving faster rate of condensation water vapour was cooled their results showed that the efficiency of ss and pv were increased by 30 and 32 respectively and productivity by 6 5 times with the proposed model compared to the conventional one rajaseenvasan et al rajaseenivasan et al 2017 studied both mathematically and experimentally the effect of basin water variation and stirring of water using pv panel on ss two heights 0 45 m and 0 15 m were selected between saline water surface and glass cover to create turbulence in the basin water four stirrers with motors were used the power used for dc motors 8 w and the power was supplied by a pv panel of capacity 40 w additional space was provided to store energy by providing material like charcoal and paraffin wax the stirring of basin water broke the boundary layer and enhanced the evaporation heat transfer the results showed that productivity increased by 30 with stirring compared to conventional ss a theoretical study on performance of a ss with a pcm pv module was done by mazraeh et al mazraeh et al 2018 their design consisted of semitransparent photovoltaic module evacuated tube collectors and phase change materials energy and exergy balance equations were used for investigation pv only acted as a source of power production and had no effect on distillate output the generated electricity depended on temperature pv set and solar radiation pcm had no effect on electricity production but if the melting temperature of pcm could be decreased the ss performance expected to improve yari et al yari et al 2016 designed one cogeneration system for both water and power production by integrating ss with semitransparent pv module when solar radiation fell on the system part of the radiation absorbed by the pv module for electricity generation the remaining part of radiation was passed to the basin water which was beneath the module evacuate tube collectors were also attached to the system and natural circulation of water was allowed for transferring heat to basin water their analysis resulted that using 10 tubes and hit heterojunction comprised of a thin a si pv cell on top of a c si cell as pv module the change in energy and exergy efficiency were found to be 9 5 256 1 and 10 41 8 respectively the design of a model with pv t integrated distillation system equipped with porous evaporator and internal condenser was reported by nimr et al al nimr and dahdolan 2015b the thermal energy rejected by the pv cell was used for distillation of water one parabolic concentrator concentrated the solar radiation to the main pvt system pv panel produced electricity on receiving solar radiation and the rejected heat by solar cell caused the water vaporized the condenser condensed the water vapour with the circulated cold water through thermosyphonic effect results showed that as the wind speed increased ss system efficiency decreased but electrical power production efficiency increased if the ambient temperature increased opposite of wind effect could be observed both productivity of ss and efficiency of power production increased with solar intensity 2 2 passive ss passive types of stills modifications are done in two ways the modification can be done on inside the still or some materials are used in the basin along with the saline water bhardwaj et al 2015 enhancement in distillate production can be achieved either by increasing the water temperature by increasing the temperature gradient between the water surface and glass cover or by both authors have employed modification to the basin construction material glass reinforced plastic grp and frp fiber reinforced plastic are some of the basin construction material used to enhance distillate productions pal and dev 2018 however the best method to achieve higher distillate production is modification of the absorber to increase basin water temperature for faster evaporation rate 2 2 1 absorber plate modifications and auxiliaries many experiments have been performed on the modification of the absorber plate of a ss in case of a ss solar radiation penetrates from the top glass cover the impure water is poured onto the absorber plate the thermal energy heats up the fluid and the fluid thus gets evaporated the generated vapour condenses on the cool inner glass surface and trickles down where it is collected and then supplied for required work like drinking in certain cases the inner surface of the basin itself acts as the absorber plate in order to absorb the maximum amount of incident solar radiation the inner side of the basin is painted in black many researchers worldwide had worked to maximize solar radiation absorbance in ss and to purify more amount of brackish water than normal ss does most of the augmentation includes adding fins to the absorber baffle wick rubber gravel wiry metallic sponges surfactant additives etc kalita et al 2018 the property of surface coating material used over the plate should have high absorptivity and poor emissivity for the reduction of the conduction heat loss from the bottom and sides of the absorber plate adequate insulation is provided tiris et al tiris 1996 investigated to find out an optimum combination of absorber plate modification options necessary for efficient desalination the various materials of absorber plate have been another important study over the years the impact of adding charcoal and blackened rock bed to the black painted absorber on still productivity was also investigated as part of the study charcoal gave the best results almost 18 more productivity than black painted absorber and 23 92 more than blackened rock bed among the three selected absorber material el sebaii et al el sebaii et al 2000 designed a ss with baffle suspended absorber in an attempt to decrease the heating time of the basin water and reported an efficiency improvement of about 20 than that of the conventional still from the theoretical study nafey et al nafey et al 2002 did an experiment with black perforated floating absorber plate the absorber plate was designed with 0 5 mm diameter perforation and made up of aluminium the plate was suspended with five floating use of ordinary black paint matt black polymethyl methacrylate and blackened jute wick have been reported to achieve maximum absorption of solar insolation naim et al naim and abd el kawi 2003b reported an improvement of 15 in ss productivity over the wick type ss using a charcoal bed absorber ss velmurugan et al velmurugan et al 2009 constructed an absorber plate of galvanized iron steel with the addition of fins sponges and pebble to the absorber the system had 25 number of trays the authors conducted experiments at two different water depths i e 10 mm and 5 mm respectively it has been observed that incorporation of fins pebble and sponges increased the exposed surface area thus increasing the thermal energy absorbed by the basin water which finally leads to increase in the water temperature for faster evaporation salah abdallah et al abdallah et al 2009 used coated and uncoated metallic wiry sponges and volcanic rocks on the absorber plate of three similar stills the results showed that coated metallic wiry sponges uncoated metallic wiry sponges and volcanic rocks increased the distillate productivity by 28 43 and 60 respectively as compared to the reference conventional still the superior material properties of metallic wiry sponges such as absorptivity permeability and extinction made it a suitable absorbing material for ss application hansen and murugavel samuel hansen and kalidasa murugavel 2017 studied an inclined ss integrated with single basin ss and hot water storage tank the ss was tested with different configurations of absorber plate viz flat grooved and finned absorbers as shown in fig 13 the daily distillate productivity and efficiency of the ss were reported to be 5 2 l d and 40 9 for 1 3 m2 collecting area which was 74 25 and 34 1 higher than that of the conventional inclined still respectively the fin configuration found to enhance the system efficiency because the fin arrangement increases the residence time of the water inside the basin as well as enhances the heat transfer area of the still the addition of wick bundle to the basin of the still is found to improve the water distribution on the basin as well as quick evaporation modi and modi modi and modi 2019 developed sss with absorber plates having multiple perforations with jute and cotton wick pile placed in each perforations the wicks dipped in the basin water assist it to rise up the absorber surface by capillary action to facilitate evaporation cotton wicks found to be more effective in providing capillary action as compared to jute thus ss with cotton wicks produces more distillate as that of ss with jute wicks some of the selected recent works related to absorber plate modification are presented in table 3 it is clear from the literature that researchers have successfully enhanced the performance of the ss by modifying the absorber plate the absorber plate modification has been done in many ways such as the incorporation of fins baffles wicks cloths corrugations porous medium etc it is important to note that all these attempts were made to enhance the evaporation area as the evaporation heat transfer coefficient is reported to be the most important parameter in the ss so increasing this coefficient performance of ss can be easily improved researchers have also indicated that cost effectiveness of the ss can be significantly enhanced by using locally available materials for the construction 2 2 2 ss with thermal energy storage for an enhancement in the productivity of ss several heat storage materials have been tested across the world heat storage helps in uniform heating and improving nocturnal evaporation thus enhancing the overall productivity of the systems there are two types of heat storage materials that are used in ss first is sensible heat storage material such as sand gravel stones concrete pipes charcoal wicks metal scraps etc sakthivel and shanmugasundaram 2008 and second is the latent heat storage which includes mainly the phase change material pcm such as paraffin wax fatty acids inorganic salts salt hydrates polymers polyalcohols etc das et al 2018b fig 15 shows the effect of adding pcm in the ss on the evaporative heat transfer coefficient it is clear from the figure that even during the off sunshine hours the evaporative heat transfer remains prominent however paraffin wax gained more popularity in solar energy applications due to its wide range of available melting point for the different level of temperatures the pcm based thermal storage material undergo phase transition once it reaches the melting temperature during sun shine hours once the sun sets off it starts reversing its phase by releasing the stored thermal energy for utilization table 4 presents the use of the heat storage medium in the ss in the recent past it is also noteworthy that the integration of heat storage within the ss does not involve a high cost therefore it can be a solution for efficiency improvement of the ss productivity in an economical way 2 2 3 ss with nanoparticles and nano fluid heat transfer rate between the basin water and the glass plate is a very important factor for enhancement of the productivity of the ss the more temperature difference between basin water and glass more is the rate of evaporation heat transfer can be increased by increasing the surface area of basin thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient of the base fluid as nanoparticles are well known for its larger surface area per unit weight so they are mixed with basin water to improve the evaporation rate mahian et al mahian et al 2017 studied both experimentally and theoretically the effects of nano fluids on the evaporation rate of ss with heat exchanger they analysed about three parameters namely freshwater yield energy and exergy efficiency with two various sizes of nano particles 7 nm and 40 nm the design consisted of two flat plate collectors in series one heat exchanger in the basin and one nano fulid tank the nano fluid was heated with flat plate collectors and then carried through the heat exchanger inside the basin the brackish water was evaporated with the help of both solar radiation and the heat carried by the nano fluid the experiments were performed on two water depths of ss 4 cm and 8 cm and with three different mass flow rate under various weather conditions the authors reported that solar radiation had greater influence on evaporation rate than the heat transfer by nano particles the evaporation rate was affected by some microscopic phenomena like thermophoresis and diffusophoresis wettability of nano fluid droplets migration of nano particles aggregation and brownian motion of nanoparticles if the inlet temperature was 70 c the yield of ss could be increased by using a heat exchanger for increasing the evaporation rate the uses of sio2 water and cu water were encouraged at low temperatures and high temperature respectively omara et al omara et al 2015 performed experiment on corrugated wick ss by providing vacuum and using nanofluids they compared conventional ss with corrugated still with internal reflectors external condenser and using different type of nanomaterials aluminium and cuprous oxide nanoparticles were used in the study the nanoparticles were mixed with saline water in weight concentration of 1 97 200 g of nano particles on 10 15 kg of saline water due to high thermal conductivity and high convective heat transfer coefficients the evaporation of saline water was enhanced in the modified still the authors concluded that the using of cuprous oxide and aluminium oxide in the modified ss increased the productivity up to 285 and 255 respectively for a saline water depth of 1 cm another experiment was carried out by gupta et al gupta et al 2016 where they developed passive ss system and studied the performance enhancement using cuo nano particles the experiments were performed by varying the water depths 5 cm and 10 cm with same weight concentration 0 12 of nanoparticles they compared conventional ss with modified one the modified ss is made by painting the sidewalls white to reduce heat loss to the environment the nanoparticles could store heat and hence increased productivity at night also the productivity for modified ss is 22 4 higher and 30 higher than the conventional still at a water depth of 5 cm and 10 cm respectively sahota et al sahota and tiwari 2016a carried out a study on the performance of three nanofluids on double basin type ss using characteristics curve the mass concentration of the nanofluids were 0 2 for al2o3 0 25 for tio2 and 0 3 for cuo higher thermal energy efficiency and thermal exergy efficiency were obtained with the use of nanofluids in comparison with the basefluid al2o3 gave the best productivity among the three nano fluids as the thermo physical and optical properties of the al2o3 were better so the absorptivity and the basin water temperature were increased the maximum temperature difference between the base fluid and nanofluid increased in the sunshine hours for the three nanoparticles the reason they explained it as the plasmon resonance absorption band of metallic powders is similar with the solar spectrum thereby direct absorption of solar radiation takes place the working of a vacuum assisted ss by using solid cuprous and aluminium oxide nanoparticles was investigated by kabeel et al kabeel et al 2014 maximum productivity was gained with cuprous oxide at concentration of 0 2 the productivity increased due to higher heat transfer coefficient thermal conductivity and better evaporative properties also the fan carried out the water vapour to the external condenser the productivity increased to 134 64 with the fan operating the whole day and 93 87 without the fan compared to the conventional one elango et al elango et al 2015 prepared four different water nanofluids at different concentration they also compared their performance effect on single basin ss the nanofluids of aluminium oxide zinc oxide tin oxide and iron oxide were characterized for thermal and physical properties the stability of each nanofluid sample was tested with particle size and zeta potential the results obtained showed that concentration of 0 1 had the best stability for all the samples the thermal conductivity of the aluminium oxide nanofluid sample was found to be higher over the others the total production with aluminium oxide nanofluid was 29 95 more than the conventional still performance enhancement of passive double slope ss using al2o3 was done by sahota et al sahota and tiwari 2016b solar radiation coming from the condensation glass was directly absorbed by the nanoparticles as the plasmon resonance band of particles arises in the ir or visible spectrum of solar radiation the radiation was then absorbed by the blackened surfaces as the nanoparticles were mixed with the base fluid the temperature increased and thus evaporation happened at faster rate three concentration 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 of the nanofluids were used for two base fluid mass 35 kg and 80 kg respectively when nanoparticles with 0 12 concentration was used daily yield increased up to 12 2 and 8 4 from 35 kg to 80 kg mass compared to simple base fluid ss sharshir et al sharshir et al 2017 modified the conventional ss using flake graphite nanoparticles phase change materials and film cooling the first modification was done by manual mixing of graphite nanoparticles 0 5 mass concentration to water and poured the modified water in ss the second modification was done with same concentration graphene nanoparticles and 20 stainless still pipe encapsulated inside with pcm used as basin liner to store energy the third modification was done by giving film cooling on the glass in addition with the first modification the fourth modification combined liner film cooling with 0 5 graphene nanoparticles the maximum productivity gain was 73 8 with the fourth modification here the evaporation rate and condensation rate was increased by graphene oxide and pcm and film cooling respectively sain et al sain and kumawat 2015 designed one single slope ss and used al2o3 nanoparticles with black paint for productivity enhancement 38 65 efficiency of ss could be achieved with nanoparticles with black paint at a water depth of 0 01 m as the nanoparticles increased the surface area for absorption of solar radiation so the productivity increased with the use of al2o3 abdelal and taamneh abdelal and taamneh 2017 developed absorber plates made of carbon fibre carbon nanotubes modified epoxy composites for pyramid ss productivity to augment the distilled water productivity for the experimental study four similar pyramid sss had been developed each absorber plate had a surface area of 0 5 m2 three absorber plates were made up of carbon fibre epoxy composites having a different proportion of carbon based nanoparticles in it 2 5 wt 5 wt carbon nanotubes and 2 5 wt graphene in the epoxy matrix the results established that with the addition of 5 wt and 2 5 wt carbon nanotubes to the epoxy matrix in the carbon fibre epoxy composites increased the production of distilled water 109 and 65 respectively the comparison was made with black painted galvanized steel fig 16 shows the distillate production rate for the four pyramid still with the different fraction of cnt on their absorber plate manufacturing the size and volume concentration of the nanoparticles in the base fluid effect the heat transfer rate very predominantly it can be seen that cuo and al2o3 nanoparticles are the mostly used for ss application for their high thermal conductivity cuprous oxide nanoparticle though reported maximum improvement in distillate output in comparison with other nanoparticles surveyed as part of the present study nanoparticles assisted with active system like vacuum creation by fan can increase the productivity to a very higher level the review indicates that the daily productivities of solar distillation systems enhance by using nanofluid and increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles in the basin water however stability during long term operation remained an unsolved issue erosion and corrosion of components of sss due to use of nanoparticles is another challenge for the researchers the advent of carbon nanotubes and growing amount of research in the field can be a breakthrough for solar distillation and productivity the nanotubes can replace conventional absorber materials due to its inherent heat absorbing nature natural glues made with carbon nanotubes can also applied on the absorber of other materials pierantonio et al 2017 3 economic analysis of ss the cost per liter of fresh water produced is one of the prominent parameter of measuring the economic feasibility of a ss the cost of ss is mainly dependent on location site unit size and design the quality of the feed water and the required quality of the purified water kabeel et al 2010 the life cycle cost analysis of ss depends on initial cost rate of interest annul distillate yield maintenance cost life time of ss production cost of distilled water salvage value of the system etc kumar and tiwari 2009 kianifar et al kianifar et al 2012 analysed about exergy and economics of pyramid shaped ss for both active and passive cases the two systems were identical but the active one had an external fan fitted with the basin they have assumed an interest rate of 12 salvage value as 20 of the capital cost maintenance cost as 15 of the annual capital cost and life cycle as 12 years for their analysis the capital cost for active system and passive system is 160 and 150 respectively they have concluded that the cost per liter of fresh water for active system was 8 9 lower than the passive unit rajaseenivasan et al rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016b studied the economic analysis of ss with circular and square fins in the basin the initial investment of the basin with circular and square fin was 156 67 and 154 17 respectively they took the 12 interest rate 5 30 years of life time salvage value as 20 of the capital cost and maintenance cost as 15 of the annual capital cost for their analysis they found that the minimum cost of purified water was 0 024 kg for square finned still with wick material for 350 operational days and 30 years of life time cost analysis of 17 different types of ss for water production cost was done by kabeel et al kabeel et al 2010 they considered 12 interest rate and 10 years of life cycles and concluded that the low cost of distilled water was obtained from pyramid shaped ss and highest cost was obtained with the configuration having sun tracking facility the cost analysis of a single slope hybrid pv t active ss was performed by kumar et al kumar and tiwari 2009 the hybrid ss was consist of pv integrated flat plate collector and dc motor pump the expected lifetime of pv module flat plate collector ss dc pump was considered as 30 years 15 years 30 years and 10 years respectively they assumed three interest rates as 4 8 and 12 respectively they found that distillate water cost from the hybrid active ss was 2 8 times the passive ss the payback period was found to be 1 1 6 2 years and 3 3 23 9 years for passive and active ss respectively esfahani et al esfahani et al 2011 studied experimentally thermoelectric cooling effect in a portable active ss the design was made up of solar collector a wall covered with black wool water sprinkling system and thermoelectric cooling device a 12 v solar module was attached with the system as power source to drive fan pump and thermoelectric cooler they also performed cost analysis of that ss the interest rate was 12 and life of the system was 10 years for their study the salvage value of the system was considered as 20 of the used materials that can be used after the life of the ss they concluded that the cost per liter of distillate water 0 13 l m2 from their design was lower than that of sun tracking 0 23 l m2 and transportable hemispherical ss 0 18 l m2 pounraj et al pounraj et al 2018 designed one active ss model with pv panel battery with charge controller and peltier module and estimated the cost analysis the fabrication cost for their proposed model and conventional still was rs 6150 and rs 10 350 respectively the cost per liter production was rs 29 60 day and rs 131 55 day respectively but the payback period for proposed model was found out to be 88 days which was 40 lesser than the normal still kabeel et al kabeel et al 2014 designed one ss using vacuum and nanoparticles and performed cost analysis of the system they analysed the cost of four different configurations of ss the fixed cost of active still with vacuum fan active still with al2o3 nanoparticles active still with cu2o nanoparticles and conventional still was estimated as 140 260 268 and 103 us respectively the lowest cost was found to be 0 035 us with modified still using fan and cu2o nanoparticles kumar et al praveen kumar et al 2018 reported the cost analysis of hybrid active ss with effective cooling and heating method payback period of the still includes the costs of fabrication maintenance feed water cost operating cost and the cost of distillate water the payback period was found to be 86 days less than the conventional still because of net production rate of distilled water cost was much higher than cost of components table 5 shows a comparison of various solar still designs based on their economic analysis 4 conclusions the review work covered most of the efficient and viable techniques for improving ss efficiency and the production rate of distilled water it has included areas such as modification of absorber plate integration of condenser use of reflectors dehumidification unit integration of thermal energy storage materials and the thermoelectric cooler it has been observed that most of the works related to ss are performed in middle east asian countries india malaysia etc however some of the works in this area have also been reported from european countries like netherland and uk the article put forward various important observations by studying various research articles published in recent years especially in the last decade some of the important findings are as follows i with the use of baffles the water residence time in the basin can be successfully increased and thus the temperature of water to facilitate fast evaporation ii a suitable absorbing material for ss application should have higher values of absorptivity and permeability sponges are found to be suitable material satisfying the mentioned criterions iii with the combination of a reflector and condenser with basin type ss can improve the productivity of still installation of reflectors is recommended in the places where solar irradiance is weak a provision on the external reflector should be made to adjust the tilt angle for various seasons and need tracking for the day to get better output for the system iv thermoelectric glass cover cooling can enhance the efficiency of the ss but the cost of the system is a concern to look into v cuprous oxide nanoparticle can be used effectively for improvement in distillate output in comparison with other nanoparticles vi nanoparticles assisted with an active system like vacuum creation by fan can increase the productivity to a very higher level vii the productivity of ss can also be enhanced by the use of pcm impregnated with nanoparticles and it is reported that systems with pcm and nanoparticle have potential to generate distilled water at a cost comparable to bottled water cost paraffin wax is found to be one of the highly effective heat storage mediums used in ss sand can also be used as heat storage medium to reduce the overall cost of the system 4 1 future scope there are various challenges in the field of ss development which are still awaiting research intervention one of the avenues is to enhance condensation heat transfer the wettability of the condensing surface dictates the type of condensations whether it will be film wise or drop wise the productivity of the still is expected to be increased with the use of drop wise condensation in most of the theoretical work done on ss with a condenser natural convection is considered as the cause of internal heat transfer between basin water to condenser and glass the heat transfer should have been by mixed convection since the flow of air vapour mixture onto condenser is mostly assisted by a fan or blower

potential applications from the desalting of seawater to the purification of groundwater it is a proven technique for the removal of hazardous chemicals such as arsenic fluoride etc from water solar distillation can become a useful process in rural and remote areas suffering from acute water crisis due to the contamination of groundwater and surface reserves either by natural or by anthropogenic

either go for highly priced safe drinking water or risk their health by drinking polluted hazardous chemical laced water technology for water purification is developing day by day in various parts of the world there are different water purification devices or systems available in the market water purifiers range from simple ones to advanced purifiers with membrane technology the latter is very common now and is followed by disinfection with uv lamp filters to make sure that purified water is microbe free some of the most common water purification methods are ro purification ultrafiltration ultraviolet purification and activated carbon filter purification development of zeolite and photocatalytic hollow fiber membranes has proved tremendous potential for water purification chakraborty et al 2017 frontera et al 2013 mastropietro et al 2016 the research in the field of geopolymeric mortars for wastewater treatment has attracted various researchers iorfida et al 2018 luukkonen et al 2019 the biomass ass based eco friendly geopolymeric mortars made it more popular choice candamano et al 2017 these methods are found to be costly and energy intensive thus rural communities have adopted simple and old age methods which primarily focuses on filtering out the impurities visible only to the naked eyes it is apparent from numerous studies that there exist spatial coincidences of water scarcity solar energy abundance and brackish water availability the importance of ss is that it is one of the easiest and effective ways to utilize solar energy for water purification in small communities where the natural supply of freshwater is insufficient or of low quality and where the sunshine is also abundant shekarchi and shahnia 2019 a ss in general constructed from galvanized steel sheet or other materials like wood fiber reinforced plastics with a rectangular plane area contains a shallow layer of brine at the bottom above the basin a sloping transparent cover is placed generally made of glass with high value of transmittance the generated water vapour condenses on the inner surface of the glass cover the cover is sloped to facilitate the distillate to trickle into troughs from where it is collected the incident solar radiation which penetrates the transparent cover is partially absorbed by the saline water the major portion being absorbed in the basin bottom which is usually blackened by a highly absorptive black material the base of the still radiates energy in the infra red region which is partially absorbed and re radiated back into the still by the cover heat from the still base is transferred into the water thereby increasing its temperature and evaporation of the heated upper layers of the water is enhanced convection currents inside the still carry this warm vapour air mixture to the cooler transparent cover the water vapour generated condenses on the underside of this cover the heat of condensation being conducted through it to the environment the water film of condensate on the inner side of the cover flows down the surface into the collecting trough and is collected as distilled water the technology is age old and has been in use from the days when sailors used this technology to desalinate seawater to make potable water in the 15th century arab alchemists used the lens and concentrated sun rays onto a pot to distill water from the 15th century to the 21st century the systems of water distillation using solar energy had passed several transitions in its design and had become a prevalent option for water purification kalita et al 2017 however it was only after world war ii the funding towards the development of solar desalination started soaring up when it was felt to be a useful technology for armies it has become a tendency in the scientific community to integrate different desalination processes with solar energy devices to enhance energy savings and augment efficiencies fig 3 shows two different designs of ss namely rain machine and aquamate rain machine is a ss developed by the us department of energy in collaboration with florida solar energy centre it was developed to make solar distillation technology popular among common people aquamate ss is one of the commercial design of ss which is very popular among sailors and adventure lovers it is made of a flexible polymer that can distillate water from impure water anywhere with the utilization of freely available solar energy therefore the use of solar distillation becomes an extremely attractive alternative solution to tackle the problem of water scarcity in remote locations fig 4 shows the basic processes involved in solar distillation sss coupled with technologies like pv t nanoparticle encapsulated phase change material pcm with sun tracking solar pond etc are some of the techno economically feasible systems for clean water generation al musawi et al 2018 dsilva winfred rufuss et al 2018a even photo thermal material absorber made with paper and pencil have been found to generate close to a liter of water per hour c paper a paper based carbon particle system can also be a solution towards increasing the efficiency of solar desalination processes newly invented nanotechnology based solutions such as 2d defective tungsten oxide nanosheets as photo absorber are found to have an evaporation efficiency of 76 at 1 sun condition with such encouraging research findings solar desalination technology can be an effective solution for clean water generation in the coming days though the productivity of ss is a major concern for the researchers the distillate quality is also an aspect to not forget besides recent technological developments that proved the efficiency improvement of solar distillation devices many research also showed that ss can effectively remove chemicals and bacteria from the dirty water ss is even reported to remove complex chemicals such as epoxiconazole and pyraclostrobin from effluents by 99 whereas ozonation can achieve 73 and 91 removal of epoxiconazole and pyraclostrobin respectively hoff et al 2019 dsilva winfred rufuss et al dsilva winfred rufuss et al 2016 presented a summary of economic analysis of different types of ss and found that cost can be reduced if locally available materials are used for construction nasri et al 2019 the ss can successfully convert saline water to a standard necessary for agricultural usage mashaly et al 2015 the solar distillation is an effective technique to eliminate suspended solids dissolved solids and atomic elements abujazar et al 2018a hanson et al hanson et al 2004 studied the nitrate and fluoride removal ability of a single basin ss along with organic contaminants this study put forward many important observations such as distillate quality was unaffected by the salinity and hardness of the feed water their designed still has reported a removal efficiency of more than 99 on salinity total hardness nitrate and fluoride along with 99 9 for bacteria fig 2 shows the removal efficiency of a ss for fluoride the feeding of the still should be carried out during the day to avoid bacterial contamination malaeb et al 2017 the sss has also been reported to remove arsenic from 6 mg l to 0 01 mg l in distillate jasrotia et al 2012 the ss technology has achieved the reputation within the frame of prescribed drinking water quality standards by highly reputed international organisations such as world health organization who united states environmental protection agency epa and bureau of indian standards arunkumar et al 2019 it is important to understand the physics of heat transfer in a ss to achieve higher efficiency by identifying the areas of minimising the heat losses and increasing thermal energy trapping the various types of heat transfers taking place in the ss can be categorized into internal and external heat transfer the internal heat transfer takes place from the basin water to the inward surface of the glass whereas external heat losses are the top bottom and side losses different heat transfers and losses that occur in a conventional single slope single basin ss are given in table 1 and fig 4 shows the heat transfer mechanisms in a typical ss a community which is located at about 100 km from a freshwater source can save about 33 of total cost spent on transporting clean water if solar distillation is adopted instead howe 1986 nijmeh et al 2005 a ss can be the most appropriate water purification technique in terms of its environmental compatibility and effectiveness for rural and remote applications different modifications have been made by researchers on the absorber of ss and adding auxiliaries to the still this includes sponge cubes that can enhance ss production by as much as 273 abu hijleh et al 2001 and the use of wicks that can increase productivity by about 114 omara et al 2013 preheating inlet water is also an effective technique to enhance the yield of the still because it increases the temperature difference between basin water and inner glass surface which improves the evaporation process thanvi and pande 1988 integration of water and solar air collectors have reportedly increased distillate productivity by 175 eltawil and omara 2014 the efficiency enhancement of 57 is reported when pcm were used in the absorber plate pcm stores the thermal energy and supply it to the brackish water when the usual external heat supply is not available naim en abd el kawi 2003a the most influential parameters on still efficiency are found to be solar irradiance intensity insulation effectiveness of the ss basin mass condenser inner reflectivity and evaporation surface area ahsan et al 2014 durkaieswaran and murugavel 2015 kalita et al 2016 research is also carried out on ss having additional vertical rotating wick surface which increases the evaporation area haddad et al 2017 there is an added advantage of solar desalination as water production increases under the summer season which is consistent with the water demand during this time of the year researchers across the world are trying to find ways to enhance the productivity of the ss to promote its broad applicability by focusing their study on one or more of the mentioned parameters few other parameters such as condenser material the mass of condenser outer emissivity wind speed and cover tilt angle were reported to be of less importance fath and hosny 2002 the present study incorporates a review of some of the recent works carried out in the field of productivity enhancement of ss s mostly in the last ten years the article discusses both the active and passive types of solar stills the active type of stills includes use of additional condensers or collectors reflectors humidification dehumidification hd units etc whereas in passive category of stills modifications done on absorber plate addition of heat storage medium nanofluid in basin water etc are discussed the economic analysis of various solar still designs is also reviewed in the study the study can be a useful resource for researchers who attempt to gain a comprehensive idea about solar still technology 2 distillate enhancement techniques during last few years the area of solar powered distillation has attracted the attention of the scientific community worldwide researchers have attempted numerous methods either to curb the external losses or to enhance the internal heat transfer coefficients scientists and researchers have tried various methods to increase the distillate productivity of the ss such as absorber plate modifications use of dye sponges condenser units external reflectors concentrating collectors heat storage medium nano particles multi effect configuration integration of hdunits preheating of feed water spray feeding mechanism rotating absorber etc kabeel et al kabeel et al 2018c have carried out a review on design modifications on inclined sss for productivity enhancement the authors reported distillate yield of 1 8 1 l m2 d for passive still designs whereas 1 049 9 l m2 d for active systems the cost of distillate production is reported to have decreased with technological advancement in the field of solar water distillation the production cost per liter of distillate using either passive or active solar distillation method is very economical in egyptian and saudi markets the cost can be reduced by using locally available materials and avoiding sun tracking devices el bialy et al 2016 in the present section some of the distillate production enhancement techniques that are studied widely will be discussed the review has been divided into two categories i e active and passive designs 2 1 active ss depending on the methods used to enhance the production stills are categorized into active and passive types of solar stills in active types of stills additional condensers or collectors are used 2 1 1 integration of condenser with ss different designs were developed and tested by researchers to improve the distillate productivity of sss one such design is the ss integrated with an external or internal condenser which is deemed to be effective this section will introduce and discuss the status of different sss integrated with various designs of condensers the condenser acts as an additional heat and mass sink the hot vapour in the still will tend to move from the still to the condenser due to diffusion purging or natural circulation and condenses on the cold surface fath and elsherbiny 1993 the productivity is sensitive to mass flow rate of coolant in the condenser tubes the volume of the condenser tubes and the condenser area yahia mahammed et al 2019 table 2 presents an overview of various works on integration condenser to a ss inbuilt passive cooler has the capability of bringing enhanced condensation output bhardwaj et al bhardwaj et al 2015 showed the effect of increase in the condensation area on the production of water from a solar still the experiments were performed both under indoor and outdoor conditions the designed ss is shown in fig 5 indoor test conducted at constant energy input of 625 w m2 reported an increase of 65 distillate output whereas under the outdoor condition the production of water increased by more than 50 with reference to still without an additional area of condensation an experimental study was to explore the impact of utilizing a double pass inner condenser on the performance of a single sloped ss by ahmed et al ahmed 1988 the results showed that the use of condenser improved the distillation yield from 5 5 to 5 9 l m2 d el bahi et al el bahi and inan 1999 designed a ss with a parallel double glass with a separate condenser in this work dunkle s relation dunkle 1961 was used for estimation of heat and mass transfer inside the evaporator the same authors also studied a ss with a tilt angle of 4 coupled to an outside condenser the ss reported a yield up to 7 l m2 d with an improvement of 70 as compared to a conventional still during the summer a theoretical investigation of a single sloped basin still with built in condenser was studied by fath and hosny fath and hosny 2002 the still was designed such that one of its covered side is tilted to be parallel to the sun rays so that the condenser can be placed in shaded areas black dyes in the basin water was also added to increase its absorptivity the combined effect of all the modifications resulted in an increase of distillate production by 55 than the conventional single sloped basin still a numerical study on the effect of integrating an adjacent condensation chamber to a single basin double slope ss was carried out by belhadj et al belhadj et al 2015 a part of vapour generated inside the still is condensed on the inner glass surface of the still and the rest is directed to the condenser the daily yield reported is 7 15 l m2 with an improvement in the production rate of about 60 higher than that of the conventional still in such ss systems where condensation is taking place both in the glass and condenser the collection system is required at the two locations this cause an elevated system cost this situation could be avoided by using a suction device such as a blower or fan in the condenser unit to minimise the vapour movement from basin water to the glass and maximising the mass transfer takes place from basin to condenser this will reduce the system cost as well as improve the ease of distillate collection al hamadani et al al hamadani and shukla 2013 tried to improve the performance of the single slope ss by adding block shaped fins on the absorber plate a phase change material pcm chamber having slender shaped fins for enhancing the thermal conductivity of the pcm and a condenser the authors studied the effects of variation of mass of water in the basin and mass of pcm on the distillate productivity the results showed that the rate of condensation was increased by the secondary condenser it was found that productivity of the still with mentioned modifications i e 5 71 l m2 is higher than that of conventional still 4 29 l m2 al nimr et al al nimr and dahdolan 2015a introduced a novel ss design utilizing concentration porous evaporation internal condensation and thermos phonic circulations in this work the authors observed that the efficiency of still increase with decreasing temperature of condenser and the wind speed the ss proposed has a tubular configuration having porous evaporator hay and sponge were used to make the evaporator the sponge was also printed with dark colour an internal condenser is also part of the system which boosts the condensation rate of the vapour generated and parabolic concentrator to increase the basin water temperature in the tubular still fig 6 shows the setup developed by al nimr et al al nimr and dahdolan 2015a the proposed ss is found to have numerous advantages such as improved distillation rate negligible electricity consumption compact size due to concentration faster transient response of the evaporator and waste heat recovery through absorption of latent heat of condensation the efficiency of the still as obtained from the simulation results is 17 1 21 3 with a distillate production rate of 1 51 1 89 kg day for the ambient temperature of 25 c and solar irradiance of 500 w m2 kerfah et al kerfah et al 2012 studied about modular ss through simulation and model design the model has a streaming plate collector and condenser they studied numerically about the modular system considering natural convection mode of heat transfer the top of the ss was made up of glass the still also had a concentric tube enclosure with the absorber the absorber material was steel sheet governing equations for the heat and mass exchanger were established using the nodal method the obtained distillate mass was found to be maximum during august while the best performance is recorded during may the still was simulated considering the weather condition of algeria el samadonyetal et al el samadony et al 2015 studied experimentally a stepped ss the still was integrated with reflectors and external condenser the tray width is equal to the step width 100 mm in the constructed ss a suction fan was used to route the water vapour into the condenser the distillate productivity as reported from the experimental study was 66 higher in case of the stepped still with condenser than that of the conventional still an improvement of 165 in distillate production is observed when both internal and external reflectors and the external condenser was used hassan and abo elfadl hassan and abo elfadl 2017 performed an experimental study on the effect of condenser type on the production rate of ss the authors also investigated the effect of adding black steel fibers and sand with the saline water in the basin an increase of 52 productivity was observed by using aluminium heat sink with pins as condenser surface along with sand and black steel fiber in the basin than the conventional ss fig 7 shows one proposal of handy ss design by monowe et al monowe et al 2011 an external reflecting booster mirror and an external condenser were incorporated in this ss design the proposed ss has provision for recovery of latent heat of condensation at the condenser which can be utilised for preheating the saline water or other domestic utilities the ss efficiency can go up by 85 if latent heat of condensation is utilised for saline water preheating and reported an extra 1 l production of distilled water ibrahim et al ibrahim et al 2015 tried to reduce the energy requirement for evaporation of water in the basin zone by bringing the inside pressure of the still chamber to sub atmospheric level using a vacuum pump the authors also used an external condenser for improving the rate of condensation though results showed improvement in efficiency and productivity the cost of generation is reported to be higher than the conventional ss 2 1 2 humidification dehumidification system integrated ss hd process can be categorized under active solar desalination system due to use of additional unit bhardwaj et al 2015 when air comes in contact with salt water the water vapour humidifies air as the temperature of air increases vapour carrying capacity of air also increases the required energy for increasing the temperature can be supplied by solar energy the distilled water can be obtained from direct contact of humid air with some cooled surface hd is a versatile technique that can be adapted for water desalination with several advantages such as flexibility in capacity moderate installation and working costs simplicity plausibility of utilizing low temperature and the utilization of sustainable power source according to parekh et al faridb et al 2004 hd is a great invention in the field of ss nafey et al nafey et al 2004a 2004b investigated the thermal model involving transient heat transfer of a naturally circulated hd ss the still productivity is similar to that of a forced circulation model as reported by the authors tabrizi et al farshchi tabrizi et al 2016 experimentally investigated cascade ss coupled with a hdsystem two parameters were considered in their investigation to study the daily productivity under different conditions these were the effect of feed water flow rate and air flow rates a closed air loop assisted by a blower is used in the developed system the outlet water is not circulated back to the cascade system to maintain efficiency from decreasing because with recirculation of outlet water salt from outlet water covers the surface of the absorber assembling of the hd system with cascade ss css resulted in increment of efficiency from 28 to 141 hacene et al mahmoudi et al 2010 proposed a mathematical model for the study of a passive condenser and hd unit integrated greenhouse water desalination system two different designs were considered for the study one is a passive cooling system with condenser which is immersed in basin water the other one is an external passive condenser which is placed on the top of the basin the humid air temperature and relative humidity were found to be the two major factors that have affected the rate of condensation based on the long term study of the system authors have also investigated the relationships between the condensate rate and those variables one of the parts of this work was the mathematical study of the influence of condenser design parameters on daily distillate output their results showed high condensation rates for condenser tubes with a large value of inner diameter and low temperature of the coolant in the condenser tube sharshir et al sharshir et al 2016 investigated a high yielding desalination system having hd and ss integrated with evacuated solar water heater the experimental study was performed in june august 2014 at kafrelshikh university egypt this design reused the drained out warm water from hd for feeding ss and thus achieved a gain of 50 in the output ratio of the system the production of the hybrid system was approximately 200 more than that of the conventional one the cost per unit liter of distillate from the hybrid desalination system was around 0 034 however such systems have a high chance of failing in the long run because impure water circulating in hd system led to its fouling and poor heat transfer characteristics pv t collectors can also be integrated into hd solar desalination systems to enhance the overall system performance das et al 2018a mahmoud et al mahmoud et al 2018 has investigated a ss with a hd system for desalination having integrated concentrating and pv t collectors the authors have studied the system productivity at various operating conditions viz varying the flow rate of air mass varied from 0 1 to 1 5 kg s at different water basin height 0 01 0 3 m and at various concentrating ratio cr 1 up to 5 the optimal operating conditions for the system was observed at cr of 3 and basin water height of 0 15 m with both pv t systems for water and air attaining the required optimal operating conditions the maximum distillate yield at the optimum operating condition is reported to be around 9 l m2 d the productivity of the hd and ss integrated system is significantly affected by the temperature of the input feed water therefore high temperature solar heating devices like concentrators and evacuated tubes collectors are recommended the effect of air temperature on productivity is reported to be insignificant it is also evident from the literature that closed cycle of heated air and water is the most efficient the efficiency of the system can also be enhanced significantly by maximising the absorptivity and heat transfer area of the humidifier shalaby et al 2017 2 1 3 integration of reflecting surface reflecting surfaces are accessories for ss application because it improves the flexibility of the absorber plate configuration external reflectors er s are useful in the locations where the solar irradiance is frail er s are made up of mirror and finished metal plate use of er s is also an economical approach er is used to enhance the energy input to the basin tanaka et al tanaka 2009 tanaka and nakatake 2009a 2007a have conducted several numerical investigations on a ss model which consists of a top mirror and tilted evaporating wick the mirror is placed on the extension from the upper edge of the still the authors concluded that the top mirror was useful for increasing solar radiation availability for absorption by the wick the reflected solar irradiation from the top mirror can be further enhanced by adjusting the orientation for various seasons depending on the position of the sun sebaii et al el sebaii 2000 used external mirrors to observe the effect on performance of a double slope single basin solar dssbs the daily productivity is found to be improved with the mirrors by 19 and 30 as compared to dssbs without mirrors during the summer and winter season respectively tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2005 theoretically studied a ss which comprises of a flat mirror a vertical parallel partitions contacted with wicks and small casters for tracking the still was based on vertical multiple effect diffusion principle the authors recommended the still due to its ease of construction the work theoretically analysed the effect of mirror angle and azimuth angle of the still on solar absorbance of the first partition the authors made a conclusion that tracking provision in the system has a positive effect on the amount of solar absorption of the first partition it is important to have an optimum orientation of reflector and the optimum tilt angle for vertical multiple effect diffusion ss integrated with a flat plate reflector this study has been carried out theoretically by tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2007b over the years the authors observed that the orientation of the reflector should be 10 from horizontal during summer and changed to 0 during the winter at higher latitudes irrespective of any latitude the orientation of the still should be adjusted according to the month to have maximum output tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2007c carried out an experimental study to validate their earlier theoretical study of the effect reflector angle and orientation of the still on ss productivity the authors found that the results of both the theoretical and experimental study are quite similar the numerical study predicted that the daily production of the system having 10 partitions with a diffusion gap of 10 mm between successive partitions to be about 5 6 times as large as that of a single effect vertical still it was also predicted to produce 29 2 and 34 6 l m2 on a sunny day of spring equinox and winter solstice days respectively at the location near the equator tanaka and nakatake tanaka and nakatake 2009b has also carried out a theoretical investigation of one step azimuth tracking tilted wick ss twss with a vertical flat plate reflection the use reflector found to increase the productivity of twss by around 41 the performance of a ss with an external acrylic mirror as shown in fig 8 was studied by shanmugan et al shanmugan et al 2008 an estimated 26 improvement in the efficiency has been reported with the addition booster mirror kumar et al kumar et al 2008 analysed the thermal performance of a v type ss the still has charcoal absorber and mirror the advantage with this configuration is that it has a slope from edge to the central portion and facilitate the distillate water collection from the centre of the still as seen from fig 9 the overall efficiency for the v type ss reported being 24 5 and 11 9 for the still with and without the boosting mirror respectively the authors also performed experiments with charcoal bed absorber and mirror and found the efficiency of 30 05 khalifa and ibrahim khalifa and ibrahim 2009 did experimental investigation on the productivity of a basin type ss with an internal and external reflector at different tilt for a location at 33 3 n during winter the productivity found to be maximum with reflectors inclined at 20 it was estimated that around 2 45 times increment of productivity had been gained compared to simple still without reflectors srivastava and agarwal srivastava and agrawal 2013a studied theoretically as well as the experimentally about a ss with floating porous absorbers and twin reflectors as the materials of porous absorbers were jute cloth and floating thermocol so it ensures uniform distribution of the feed water over the absorber plate by capillary action and helps in keeping the absorber plate always wet by avoiding dry spots the productivity was improved by 68 and 35 more than the conventional still on a clear sky and cloudy days respectively when a twin reflector booster was placed perpendicularly on the upper edge of the modified still the productivity increased by 79 over the still without a reflector omara et al omara et al 2016 experimentally studied passive ss having a corrugated absorber plate with wick lining and reflectors an improvement of 55 36 in the distillate production was reported as compared to conventional ss whereas with the addition of wick the improvement in productivity was found to be 90 more than that of conventional still and the average efficiency of 49 3 was reported however the best result in terms of productivity 145 5 improvement compared to conventional ss was achieved when reflecting mirrors were used estahbanati et al karimi estahbanati et al 2016 investigated theoretically and experimentally the effect of internal reflectors on the efficiency of single slope ss for both summer and winter seasons the authors proposed an accurate prediction radiation model for productivity of the still which was better than the earlier developed models the model is unique in way that it considers the effect of all the four walls of the still chamber on the total amount of solar radiation received by the still basin the results proved that an enhancement of efficiency was observed by 18 and 22 with installation of reflectors on the front and side walls and installation on the back wall respectively fresnel reflectors are also used by a few researchers to increase the productivity of the sss sriram et al sriram et al 2019 tried to produce pure water from industrial wastewater using a double slope single basin still integrated with fresnel reflector gang et al gang et al 2019 proposed a multi effect tube distiller that uses a linear fresnel mirror field and works on the scientific principle of concentrating direct heating multi effect tubular falling film distillation the designed setup by the authors is shown in fig 10 the proposed system has reported a pure water generation capacity of 63 68 kg day at the cost of 0 0067 kg the review presented in this section clearly indicated that using the reflectors i e both internal and external can enhance the productivity of the sss significantly the inner mirrors spoil at a very rapid manner this is a disadvantage of ss with inside mirrors ss with reflectors needs to be adjusted its orientation with respect to the sun along the year in order to get maximum possible output this is another disadvantage with such system the distillate output of fresnel reflector equipped multi effect tubular still is found to be high as compared to the basic ss designs however the water production cost is more compared to other contemporary water purification techniques using conventional reflectors but such a device can provide pure water for people living in remote areas and the system doesn t need any labor management during the operation the ss with external reflectors for concentration can be a viable option in remote areas with weak solar radiation incidence 2 1 4 thermoelectric devices in a ss in 1821 a baltic german physicist thomas johann seebeck observed that when two dissimilar metals are joined at two different points having a different temperature at the junctions an electromotive force is generated in the circuit in 1834 jean peltier reported the reverse phenomenon to that which was earlier observed by seebeck joffe 2010 nolas et al 2001 he noted that there is a heating or cooling of a junction of a pair of dissimilar substances if direct current is passed through them these revelations were unable to get consideration of the scientific community until 1838 when lenz a german researcher demonstrated the significance of them he solidified and liquefied water by these impacts which prompted the idea of thermoelectric refrigeration he froze and melted a water droplet by these effects this established the concept of thermoelectric cooling nolas et al 2001 thermoelectric coolers tec have various advantages such as they have no moving parts very long life noiseless operation compact in size easily controllable and suitable for low voltage due to the mentioned advantages tec s made its way into solar cooling applications sarbu and dorca 2018 even though incorporation of tec in solar application especially in sss is not extensive but few works reported in this area in the recent past esfahani et al esfahani et al 2011 developed a portable ss integrated with the thermoelectric cooling package fig 11 the developed still has separate evaporation and condensation zone with a sprinkler for feed water supply into the evaporation zone the results showed that the output and efficiency of the still is 1 2 l m2 d and 13 respectively another experimental work carried out by rahbar and esfahani rahbar and esfahani 2012 studied a system having both heat pipe and thermoelectric cooling according to the authors with the increase in temperature difference between the basin water and the condensation surface results in more efficiency and production rate the same group of authors developed an improved portable asymmetrical ss design and tested rahbar et al 2016 the results proved that a greater temperature difference could be achieved by using tec compared to glass water nazari et al nazari et al 2019 investigated the performance of single slope ss with external tec for cover glass cooling and copper oxide nanoparticle in the basin water the authors showed that the efficiency of the system could be improved by using tec and copper oxide nanoparticles in the basin water however one disadvantage of this system was high cost of clean water generation this was because of high cost of copper oxide nanoparticles shafii et al shafii et al 2016 used evacuated tubes to generate vapour and used the heat of condensation to get the desired temperature difference to operate the thermoelectric panel which in turn runs a fan for directing the generated vapour onto the condensation surface and simultaneously keeping the condensation chamber relatively cool the schematic of the developed experimental setup is shown in fig 12 the system has been reported to yield a maximum of 1 1 kg of distillate in an hour and efficiency improvement of 68 however this type of system may be inefficient in the long run due to fouling of the heat transfer surface in the collector as there is direct contact of impure water with the collector tube surfaces al madhhachi and min al madhhachi and min 2017 designed and developed a miniature ss utilizing both the hot and cold surfaces of the thermoelectric module for evaporation and condensation respectively the designed still has a basin of dimension 116 mm 116 mm and reported to generate an hourly distillate output of 28 5 ml 2 1 5 pv integrated ss pv integrated ss is used to generate power and purify water at the same time pv panel is used for the self sustainability of the system in case of passive ss the productivity is found to be lower active ss is a good alternative as it converts the solar energy to heat energy of an external fluid the external fluid is circulated throughout the ss basin for heat transfer with the help of a dc pump the external power source for running the dc pump is provided by the pv panel manokar et al manokar et al 2018 designed an integrated system of pv module with ss both for power and fresh water production a polycrystalline pv panel was attached with an inclined ss to reduce the vapour loss the ss was fully covered with silicon paste cotton thread was put on the solar cell to increase the evaporation rate maximum distillate output of 7 3 kg was obtained with inclined solar panel basin with sidewall and bottom wall insulation with insulation the heat loss to surroundings decreased and the water temperature could reach up to 73 5 c but the panel efficiency decrease because of the increase in panel temperature singh et al singh et al 2011 fabricated one double slope active ss by integrating pvt system the objective of their modification was to increase the temperature of the water at ss so that the productivity could be increased the modification was done by connecting one flat plate collector and another photovoltaic integrated collector the experimental performance was observed both in natural and forced circulation mode series and parallel one dc motor is operated with the pv module for the circulation of water in forced mode parallel forced mode configuration gave higher yield 7 54 kg day and the energy efficiency was found to be 17 4 the energy payback period was estimated to be 3 years which was 30 less than pvt integrated single slope ss an experiment was performed on pvt active ss after applying heating and cover cooling by kumar et al praveen kumar et al 2018 the hybrid ss was designed with the same dimension as the conventional single slope ss for comparison the modification was incorporating arrangement of panels and a heating filament that touch the basin water in the still water was first spread with spreading tube on the pv and then fed to the basin the nicr heating element was connected to the basin with a battery connection from the pv so that the system could work on cloudy days also the maximum temperature of basin water power output and productivity were almost 50 30 and 6 times higher than the conventional passive ss the study carried by paunraj et al pounraj et al 2018 included the overall performance of a ss using peltier base hybrid pv t active system the ss design consisted of saline water storage tank basin valve control peltier modules solar pv panel battery and recycling water tank the peltier module was designed with one p n junction where cooling happened due to movement of electrons so the cooling system was expected to have longer life as no moving parts were involved two main modifications were done to increase the productivity of the ss and the efficiency of the pv panel the input basin water was used to carry the heat from pv panel thus decreasing the temperature of panel which was needed for efficiency enhancement for achieving faster rate of condensation water vapour was cooled their results showed that the efficiency of ss and pv were increased by 30 and 32 respectively and productivity by 6 5 times with the proposed model compared to the conventional one rajaseenvasan et al rajaseenivasan et al 2017 studied both mathematically and experimentally the effect of basin water variation and stirring of water using pv panel on ss two heights 0 45 m and 0 15 m were selected between saline water surface and glass cover to create turbulence in the basin water four stirrers with motors were used the power used for dc motors 8 w and the power was supplied by a pv panel of capacity 40 w additional space was provided to store energy by providing material like charcoal and paraffin wax the stirring of basin water broke the boundary layer and enhanced the evaporation heat transfer the results showed that productivity increased by 30 with stirring compared to conventional ss a theoretical study on performance of a ss with a pcm pv module was done by mazraeh et al mazraeh et al 2018 their design consisted of semitransparent photovoltaic module evacuated tube collectors and phase change materials energy and exergy balance equations were used for investigation pv only acted as a source of power production and had no effect on distillate output the generated electricity depended on temperature pv set and solar radiation pcm had no effect on electricity production but if the melting temperature of pcm could be decreased the ss performance expected to improve yari et al yari et al 2016 designed one cogeneration system for both water and power production by integrating ss with semitransparent pv module when solar radiation fell on the system part of the radiation absorbed by the pv module for electricity generation the remaining part of radiation was passed to the basin water which was beneath the module evacuate tube collectors were also attached to the system and natural circulation of water was allowed for transferring heat to basin water their analysis resulted that using 10 tubes and hit heterojunction comprised of a thin a si pv cell on top of a c si cell as pv module the change in energy and exergy efficiency were found to be 9 5 256 1 and 10 41 8 respectively the design of a model with pv t integrated distillation system equipped with porous evaporator and internal condenser was reported by nimr et al al nimr and dahdolan 2015b the thermal energy rejected by the pv cell was used for distillation of water one parabolic concentrator concentrated the solar radiation to the main pvt system pv panel produced electricity on receiving solar radiation and the rejected heat by solar cell caused the water vaporized the condenser condensed the water vapour with the circulated cold water through thermosyphonic effect results showed that as the wind speed increased ss system efficiency decreased but electrical power production efficiency increased if the ambient temperature increased opposite of wind effect could be observed both productivity of ss and efficiency of power production increased with solar intensity 2 2 passive ss passive types of stills modifications are done in two ways the modification can be done on inside the still or some materials are used in the basin along with the saline water bhardwaj et al 2015 enhancement in distillate production can be achieved either by increasing the water temperature by increasing the temperature gradient between the water surface and glass cover or by both authors have employed modification to the basin construction material glass reinforced plastic grp and frp fiber reinforced plastic are some of the basin construction material used to enhance distillate productions pal and dev 2018 however the best method to achieve higher distillate production is modification of the absorber to increase basin water temperature for faster evaporation rate 2 2 1 absorber plate modifications and auxiliaries many experiments have been performed on the modification of the absorber plate of a ss in case of a ss solar radiation penetrates from the top glass cover the impure water is poured onto the absorber plate the thermal energy heats up the fluid and the fluid thus gets evaporated the generated vapour condenses on the cool inner glass surface and trickles down where it is collected and then supplied for required work like drinking in certain cases the inner surface of the basin itself acts as the absorber plate in order to absorb the maximum amount of incident solar radiation the inner side of the basin is painted in black many researchers worldwide had worked to maximize solar radiation absorbance in ss and to purify more amount of brackish water than normal ss does most of the augmentation includes adding fins to the absorber baffle wick rubber gravel wiry metallic sponges surfactant additives etc kalita et al 2018 the property of surface coating material used over the plate should have high absorptivity and poor emissivity for the reduction of the conduction heat loss from the bottom and sides of the absorber plate adequate insulation is provided tiris et al tiris 1996 investigated to find out an optimum combination of absorber plate modification options necessary for efficient desalination the various materials of absorber plate have been another important study over the years the impact of adding charcoal and blackened rock bed to the black painted absorber on still productivity was also investigated as part of the study charcoal gave the best results almost 18 more productivity than black painted absorber and 23 92 more than blackened rock bed among the three selected absorber material el sebaii et al el sebaii et al 2000 designed a ss with baffle suspended absorber in an attempt to decrease the heating time of the basin water and reported an efficiency improvement of about 20 than that of the conventional still from the theoretical study nafey et al nafey et al 2002 did an experiment with black perforated floating absorber plate the absorber plate was designed with 0 5 mm diameter perforation and made up of aluminium the plate was suspended with five floating use of ordinary black paint matt black polymethyl methacrylate and blackened jute wick have been reported to achieve maximum absorption of solar insolation naim et al naim and abd el kawi 2003b reported an improvement of 15 in ss productivity over the wick type ss using a charcoal bed absorber ss velmurugan et al velmurugan et al 2009 constructed an absorber plate of galvanized iron steel with the addition of fins sponges and pebble to the absorber the system had 25 number of trays the authors conducted experiments at two different water depths i e 10 mm and 5 mm respectively it has been observed that incorporation of fins pebble and sponges increased the exposed surface area thus increasing the thermal energy absorbed by the basin water which finally leads to increase in the water temperature for faster evaporation salah abdallah et al abdallah et al 2009 used coated and uncoated metallic wiry sponges and volcanic rocks on the absorber plate of three similar stills the results showed that coated metallic wiry sponges uncoated metallic wiry sponges and volcanic rocks increased the distillate productivity by 28 43 and 60 respectively as compared to the reference conventional still the superior material properties of metallic wiry sponges such as absorptivity permeability and extinction made it a suitable absorbing material for ss application hansen and murugavel samuel hansen and kalidasa murugavel 2017 studied an inclined ss integrated with single basin ss and hot water storage tank the ss was tested with different configurations of absorber plate viz flat grooved and finned absorbers as shown in fig 13 the daily distillate productivity and efficiency of the ss were reported to be 5 2 l d and 40 9 for 1 3 m2 collecting area which was 74 25 and 34 1 higher than that of the conventional inclined still respectively the fin configuration found to enhance the system efficiency because the fin arrangement increases the residence time of the water inside the basin as well as enhances the heat transfer area of the still the addition of wick bundle to the basin of the still is found to improve the water distribution on the basin as well as quick evaporation modi and modi modi and modi 2019 developed sss with absorber plates having multiple perforations with jute and cotton wick pile placed in each perforations the wicks dipped in the basin water assist it to rise up the absorber surface by capillary action to facilitate evaporation cotton wicks found to be more effective in providing capillary action as compared to jute thus ss with cotton wicks produces more distillate as that of ss with jute wicks some of the selected recent works related to absorber plate modification are presented in table 3 it is clear from the literature that researchers have successfully enhanced the performance of the ss by modifying the absorber plate the absorber plate modification has been done in many ways such as the incorporation of fins baffles wicks cloths corrugations porous medium etc it is important to note that all these attempts were made to enhance the evaporation area as the evaporation heat transfer coefficient is reported to be the most important parameter in the ss so increasing this coefficient performance of ss can be easily improved researchers have also indicated that cost effectiveness of the ss can be significantly enhanced by using locally available materials for the construction 2 2 2 ss with thermal energy storage for an enhancement in the productivity of ss several heat storage materials have been tested across the world heat storage helps in uniform heating and improving nocturnal evaporation thus enhancing the overall productivity of the systems there are two types of heat storage materials that are used in ss first is sensible heat storage material such as sand gravel stones concrete pipes charcoal wicks metal scraps etc sakthivel and shanmugasundaram 2008 and second is the latent heat storage which includes mainly the phase change material pcm such as paraffin wax fatty acids inorganic salts salt hydrates polymers polyalcohols etc das et al 2018b fig 15 shows the effect of adding pcm in the ss on the evaporative heat transfer coefficient it is clear from the figure that even during the off sunshine hours the evaporative heat transfer remains prominent however paraffin wax gained more popularity in solar energy applications due to its wide range of available melting point for the different level of temperatures the pcm based thermal storage material undergo phase transition once it reaches the melting temperature during sun shine hours once the sun sets off it starts reversing its phase by releasing the stored thermal energy for utilization table 4 presents the use of the heat storage medium in the ss in the recent past it is also noteworthy that the integration of heat storage within the ss does not involve a high cost therefore it can be a solution for efficiency improvement of the ss productivity in an economical way 2 2 3 ss with nanoparticles and nano fluid heat transfer rate between the basin water and the glass plate is a very important factor for enhancement of the productivity of the ss the more temperature difference between basin water and glass more is the rate of evaporation heat transfer can be increased by increasing the surface area of basin thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient of the base fluid as nanoparticles are well known for its larger surface area per unit weight so they are mixed with basin water to improve the evaporation rate mahian et al mahian et al 2017 studied both experimentally and theoretically the effects of nano fluids on the evaporation rate of ss with heat exchanger they analysed about three parameters namely freshwater yield energy and exergy efficiency with two various sizes of nano particles 7 nm and 40 nm the design consisted of two flat plate collectors in series one heat exchanger in the basin and one nano fulid tank the nano fluid was heated with flat plate collectors and then carried through the heat exchanger inside the basin the brackish water was evaporated with the help of both solar radiation and the heat carried by the nano fluid the experiments were performed on two water depths of ss 4 cm and 8 cm and with three different mass flow rate under various weather conditions the authors reported that solar radiation had greater influence on evaporation rate than the heat transfer by nano particles the evaporation rate was affected by some microscopic phenomena like thermophoresis and diffusophoresis wettability of nano fluid droplets migration of nano particles aggregation and brownian motion of nanoparticles if the inlet temperature was 70 c the yield of ss could be increased by using a heat exchanger for increasing the evaporation rate the uses of sio2 water and cu water were encouraged at low temperatures and high temperature respectively omara et al omara et al 2015 performed experiment on corrugated wick ss by providing vacuum and using nanofluids they compared conventional ss with corrugated still with internal reflectors external condenser and using different type of nanomaterials aluminium and cuprous oxide nanoparticles were used in the study the nanoparticles were mixed with saline water in weight concentration of 1 97 200 g of nano particles on 10 15 kg of saline water due to high thermal conductivity and high convective heat transfer coefficients the evaporation of saline water was enhanced in the modified still the authors concluded that the using of cuprous oxide and aluminium oxide in the modified ss increased the productivity up to 285 and 255 respectively for a saline water depth of 1 cm another experiment was carried out by gupta et al gupta et al 2016 where they developed passive ss system and studied the performance enhancement using cuo nano particles the experiments were performed by varying the water depths 5 cm and 10 cm with same weight concentration 0 12 of nanoparticles they compared conventional ss with modified one the modified ss is made by painting the sidewalls white to reduce heat loss to the environment the nanoparticles could store heat and hence increased productivity at night also the productivity for modified ss is 22 4 higher and 30 higher than the conventional still at a water depth of 5 cm and 10 cm respectively sahota et al sahota and tiwari 2016a carried out a study on the performance of three nanofluids on double basin type ss using characteristics curve the mass concentration of the nanofluids were 0 2 for al2o3 0 25 for tio2 and 0 3 for cuo higher thermal energy efficiency and thermal exergy efficiency were obtained with the use of nanofluids in comparison with the basefluid al2o3 gave the best productivity among the three nano fluids as the thermo physical and optical properties of the al2o3 were better so the absorptivity and the basin water temperature were increased the maximum temperature difference between the base fluid and nanofluid increased in the sunshine hours for the three nanoparticles the reason they explained it as the plasmon resonance absorption band of metallic powders is similar with the solar spectrum thereby direct absorption of solar radiation takes place the working of a vacuum assisted ss by using solid cuprous and aluminium oxide nanoparticles was investigated by kabeel et al kabeel et al 2014 maximum productivity was gained with cuprous oxide at concentration of 0 2 the productivity increased due to higher heat transfer coefficient thermal conductivity and better evaporative properties also the fan carried out the water vapour to the external condenser the productivity increased to 134 64 with the fan operating the whole day and 93 87 without the fan compared to the conventional one elango et al elango et al 2015 prepared four different water nanofluids at different concentration they also compared their performance effect on single basin ss the nanofluids of aluminium oxide zinc oxide tin oxide and iron oxide were characterized for thermal and physical properties the stability of each nanofluid sample was tested with particle size and zeta potential the results obtained showed that concentration of 0 1 had the best stability for all the samples the thermal conductivity of the aluminium oxide nanofluid sample was found to be higher over the others the total production with aluminium oxide nanofluid was 29 95 more than the conventional still performance enhancement of passive double slope ss using al2o3 was done by sahota et al sahota and tiwari 2016b solar radiation coming from the condensation glass was directly absorbed by the nanoparticles as the plasmon resonance band of particles arises in the ir or visible spectrum of solar radiation the radiation was then absorbed by the blackened surfaces as the nanoparticles were mixed with the base fluid the temperature increased and thus evaporation happened at faster rate three concentration 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 of the nanofluids were used for two base fluid mass 35 kg and 80 kg respectively when nanoparticles with 0 12 concentration was used daily yield increased up to 12 2 and 8 4 from 35 kg to 80 kg mass compared to simple base fluid ss sharshir et al sharshir et al 2017 modified the conventional ss using flake graphite nanoparticles phase change materials and film cooling the first modification was done by manual mixing of graphite nanoparticles 0 5 mass concentration to water and poured the modified water in ss the second modification was done with same concentration graphene nanoparticles and 20 stainless still pipe encapsulated inside with pcm used as basin liner to store energy the third modification was done by giving film cooling on the glass in addition with the first modification the fourth modification combined liner film cooling with 0 5 graphene nanoparticles the maximum productivity gain was 73 8 with the fourth modification here the evaporation rate and condensation rate was increased by graphene oxide and pcm and film cooling respectively sain et al sain and kumawat 2015 designed one single slope ss and used al2o3 nanoparticles with black paint for productivity enhancement 38 65 efficiency of ss could be achieved with nanoparticles with black paint at a water depth of 0 01 m as the nanoparticles increased the surface area for absorption of solar radiation so the productivity increased with the use of al2o3 abdelal and taamneh abdelal and taamneh 2017 developed absorber plates made of carbon fibre carbon nanotubes modified epoxy composites for pyramid ss productivity to augment the distilled water productivity for the experimental study four similar pyramid sss had been developed each absorber plate had a surface area of 0 5 m2 three absorber plates were made up of carbon fibre epoxy composites having a different proportion of carbon based nanoparticles in it 2 5 wt 5 wt carbon nanotubes and 2 5 wt graphene in the epoxy matrix the results established that with the addition of 5 wt and 2 5 wt carbon nanotubes to the epoxy matrix in the carbon fibre epoxy composites increased the production of distilled water 109 and 65 respectively the comparison was made with black painted galvanized steel fig 16 shows the distillate production rate for the four pyramid still with the different fraction of cnt on their absorber plate manufacturing the size and volume concentration of the nanoparticles in the base fluid effect the heat transfer rate very predominantly it can be seen that cuo and al2o3 nanoparticles are the mostly used for ss application for their high thermal conductivity cuprous oxide nanoparticle though reported maximum improvement in distillate output in comparison with other nanoparticles surveyed as part of the present study nanoparticles assisted with active system like vacuum creation by fan can increase the productivity to a very higher level the review indicates that the daily productivities of solar distillation systems enhance by using nanofluid and increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles in the basin water however stability during long term operation remained an unsolved issue erosion and corrosion of components of sss due to use of nanoparticles is another challenge for the researchers the advent of carbon nanotubes and growing amount of research in the field can be a breakthrough for solar distillation and productivity the nanotubes can replace conventional absorber materials due to its inherent heat absorbing nature natural glues made with carbon nanotubes can also applied on the absorber of other materials pierantonio et al 2017 3 economic analysis of ss the cost per liter of fresh water produced is one of the prominent parameter of measuring the economic feasibility of a ss the cost of ss is mainly dependent on location site unit size and design the quality of the feed water and the required quality of the purified water kabeel et al 2010 the life cycle cost analysis of ss depends on initial cost rate of interest annul distillate yield maintenance cost life time of ss production cost of distilled water salvage value of the system etc kumar and tiwari 2009 kianifar et al kianifar et al 2012 analysed about exergy and economics of pyramid shaped ss for both active and passive cases the two systems were identical but the active one had an external fan fitted with the basin they have assumed an interest rate of 12 salvage value as 20 of the capital cost maintenance cost as 15 of the annual capital cost and life cycle as 12 years for their analysis the capital cost for active system and passive system is 160 and 150 respectively they have concluded that the cost per liter of fresh water for active system was 8 9 lower than the passive unit rajaseenivasan et al rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016b studied the economic analysis of ss with circular and square fins in the basin the initial investment of the basin with circular and square fin was 156 67 and 154 17 respectively they took the 12 interest rate 5 30 years of life time salvage value as 20 of the capital cost and maintenance cost as 15 of the annual capital cost for their analysis they found that the minimum cost of purified water was 0 024 kg for square finned still with wick material for 350 operational days and 30 years of life time cost analysis of 17 different types of ss for water production cost was done by kabeel et al kabeel et al 2010 they considered 12 interest rate and 10 years of life cycles and concluded that the low cost of distilled water was obtained from pyramid shaped ss and highest cost was obtained with the configuration having sun tracking facility the cost analysis of a single slope hybrid pv t active ss was performed by kumar et al kumar and tiwari 2009 the hybrid ss was consist of pv integrated flat plate collector and dc motor pump the expected lifetime of pv module flat plate collector ss dc pump was considered as 30 years 15 years 30 years and 10 years respectively they assumed three interest rates as 4 8 and 12 respectively they found that distillate water cost from the hybrid active ss was 2 8 times the passive ss the payback period was found to be 1 1 6 2 years and 3 3 23 9 years for passive and active ss respectively esfahani et al esfahani et al 2011 studied experimentally thermoelectric cooling effect in a portable active ss the design was made up of solar collector a wall covered with black wool water sprinkling system and thermoelectric cooling device a 12 v solar module was attached with the system as power source to drive fan pump and thermoelectric cooler they also performed cost analysis of that ss the interest rate was 12 and life of the system was 10 years for their study the salvage value of the system was considered as 20 of the used materials that can be used after the life of the ss they concluded that the cost per liter of distillate water 0 13 l m2 from their design was lower than that of sun tracking 0 23 l m2 and transportable hemispherical ss 0 18 l m2 pounraj et al pounraj et al 2018 designed one active ss model with pv panel battery with charge controller and peltier module and estimated the cost analysis the fabrication cost for their proposed model and conventional still was rs 6150 and rs 10 350 respectively the cost per liter production was rs 29 60 day and rs 131 55 day respectively but the payback period for proposed model was found out to be 88 days which was 40 lesser than the normal still kabeel et al kabeel et al 2014 designed one ss using vacuum and nanoparticles and performed cost analysis of the system they analysed the cost of four different configurations of ss the fixed cost of active still with vacuum fan active still with al2o3 nanoparticles active still with cu2o nanoparticles and conventional still was estimated as 140 260 268 and 103 us respectively the lowest cost was found to be 0 035 us with modified still using fan and cu2o nanoparticles kumar et al praveen kumar et al 2018 reported the cost analysis of hybrid active ss with effective cooling and heating method payback period of the still includes the costs of fabrication maintenance feed water cost operating cost and the cost of distillate water the payback period was found to be 86 days less than the conventional still because of net production rate of distilled water cost was much higher than cost of components table 5 shows a comparison of various solar still designs based on their economic analysis 4 conclusions the review work covered most of the efficient and viable techniques for improving ss efficiency and the production rate of distilled water it has included areas such as modification of absorber plate integration of condenser use of reflectors dehumidification unit integration of thermal energy storage materials and the thermoelectric cooler it has been observed that most of the works related to ss are performed in middle east asian countries india malaysia etc however some of the works in this area have also been reported from european countries like netherland and uk the article put forward various important observations by studying various research articles published in recent years especially in the last decade some of the important findings are as follows i with the use of baffles the water residence time in the basin can be successfully increased and thus the temperature of water to facilitate fast evaporation ii a suitable absorbing material for ss application should have higher values of absorptivity and permeability sponges are found to be suitable material satisfying the mentioned criterions iii with the combination of a reflector and condenser with basin type ss can improve the productivity of still installation of reflectors is recommended in the places where solar irradiance is weak a provision on the external reflector should be made to adjust the tilt angle for various seasons and need tracking for the day to get better output for the system iv thermoelectric glass cover cooling can enhance the efficiency of the ss but the cost of the system is a concern to look into v cuprous oxide nanoparticle can be used effectively for improvement in distillate output in comparison with other nanoparticles vi nanoparticles assisted with an active system like vacuum creation by fan can increase the productivity to a very higher level vii the productivity of ss can also be enhanced by the use of pcm impregnated with nanoparticles and it is reported that systems with pcm and nanoparticle have potential to generate distilled water at a cost comparable to bottled water cost paraffin wax is found to be one of the highly effective heat storage mediums used in ss sand can also be used as heat storage medium to reduce the overall cost of the system 4 1 future scope there are various challenges in the field of ss development which are still awaiting research intervention one of the avenues is to enhance condensation heat transfer the wettability of the condensing surface dictates the type of condensations whether it will be film wise or drop wise the productivity of the still is expected to be increased with the use of drop wise condensation in most of the theoretical work done on ss with a condenser natural convection is considered as the cause of internal heat transfer between basin water to condenser and glass the heat transfer should have been by mixed convection since the flow of air vapour mixture onto condenser is mostly assisted by a fan or blower

12182,aquifer storage and recovery asr with treated wastewater is considered as an effective solution for a critical aquifer decline due to groundwater overexploitation in asr operational step and after the aquifer storage phase the problem is the new groundwater right for stakeholders and specifically farmers in a 2 year study the potential of a participatory approach for solving this problem was investigated and applied in fashafoeyeh aquifer in southern tehran province this aquifer faces a critical situation of groundwater from point of view of quantitative and qualitative aspects firstly five indicators were considered including agricultural efficiency water resource efficiency water governance local participation and economic factors then 23 farmers and agricultural landowners were selected based on age education and gender a questionnaire was designed surveyed and filled out after interviewing them in several field trips to the site the results of data analysis showed that 96 of farmers and landowners were highly motivated in the implementation of the participatory approach in asr management moreover 91 showed a high desire to decrease the groundwater withdrawal from wells a high percentage of stakeholders had a tendency to participate in some aspects of asr system in the meantime many farmers had a negative viewpoint about government supports the results illustrate a correlation between agriculture efficiency with participation in the government s projects and implementation moreover a correlation exists between water management in the field and participation in government s projects as well as local participatory this research emphasises on proper planning through face to face dialogue with farmers and landowners in this regard they collaborate in a participatory approach as well as a technical and social team to implement the aquifer storage and recovery management graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer treated wastewater storage people participation groundwater iran 1 introduction groundwater plays a main role in agricultural water demands in arid and semi arid zones in the last three decades due to population growth drought periods agricultural domestic industrial development groundwater overexploitation have caused a dramatic decline of the water table in most aquifers in iran on the other hand population growth in large cities has been faster and caused a large amount of wastewater to be produced every year the continued generation of a large amount of wastewater in urban regions has caused environmental problems and endangered ecosystems however wastewater has a great potential that has not yet been considered as a way to be used to keep aquifers to be in balance smith et al 2017 aquifer storage and recovery asr is a managed artificial recharge using a direct injection that is used to increase groundwater storage through injection wells and unsaturated saturated porous media the use of treated wastewater is one of the ways for aquifer storage while it can solve environmental problems and endanger ecosystems brown 2005 el arabi and dawoud 2012 balance critical aquifers store water for later use and improve groundwater quality castro 1997 page et al 2017 sheng 2005 public participation is one of the five indicators of groundwater sustainable management valentin and spangenberg 2000 it improves groundwater quality parameters ghose et al 2018 smith et al 2017 van steenbergen 2006 people trust and less conflict chebaane et al 2004 sandoval 2004 voinov and bousquet 2010 increase area

two initiatives for iran for the first time it will prove the importance and role of local society in groundwater management as the first attempt for iran so far moreover it will look at specific views of the bottom up approach of participatory management in an overexploited aquifer in fashafuyeh aquifer to highlight sustainable groundwater management and reduce local conflict the paper starts with a brief general background on global research on relevant issues and provides an understanding of the implementation and use of asr across iran we will use this study area as a typical cultivation region and employ field survey data and questionnaires to investigate the findings and present results 1 1 literature review table 1 shows global studies and projects focusing on participatory groundwater management and aquifer storage and recovery as is clear a diverse range of regional settings and stakeholders have been assessed globally despite several groundwater artificial recharge sites in iran to the best of our knowledge asr has not been implemented in iran yet the feasibility study and its potential in the south of tehran were investigated through an applied research lens for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the fashafouyeh plain is located in the center of tehran province between latitudes 51 00 ʹ00ʹʹ n and 51 20ʹ00ʹʹ n and longitudes 35 20ʹ00ʹʹ e and 35 30ʹ00ʹʹ e fig 1 with an area of about 200 km2 and annual precipitation of 166 mm the area is used mostly for agriculture above 95 of water demand for agriculture in this area is supplied by groundwater and the rest by a surface river seasonal karaj river the area encompasses a total of 335 groundwater users as well as 14 villages with a total population of 30 000 also the area is surrounded by rural industries including the largest industrial site in iran thus it has attracted a large flux of national and foreign immigrants the domestic water resources of the villages located in this plain are supplied by pumping wells with good groundwater quality located in the upper part of the plain and are owned by the government there are 23 qanats with a total length of 160 km most of which have been dried in addition there are a total of 232 wells with a total annual withdrawal of 31 02 mcm table 2 the agricultural industrial and domestic water resources depend on groundwater in the last four decades due to frequent drought periods surface water availability of region has decreased and most of the rivers dried in such cases groundwater resource was the only available water resource leading to over exploitation of groundwater and extreme water level decline fig 2 hydrological problems fig 3 soil salinity reduction of cultivated size areas and migration of local people to other cities of tehran province a large volume of wastewater is generated by the tehran metropolis each year an increase of excessive groundwater withdrawals from fashafuyeh plain fig 4 and a shortage of surface water resources have endangered this plain with water quality and quantity crisis 2 2 data collection in order to investigate public awareness local issues and other relevant factors a series of questionnaires were distributed in this research groundwater and surface water characteristics were also studied within a period of two years table 3 2 3 field survey a field survey was carried out in the year 2017 2018 to collect first hand information from local communities this region is homogenous and consisted of individuals who are familiar with the culture language and stakeholders of the region because the industrial water right was given a preference in this area we collected information only from farmers and those landowners who possessed at least one well in their lands following the establishment of the field study methods and indicators a questionnaire was developed according to the existing studies and plain conditions data were collected using the open and close ended questionnaires and face to face interviews with farmers the questionnaire consisted of two sections the first section was related to information about social and economic conditions in which independent variables were expressed and six indicators defined table 4 the second section was based on our field investigations one of the major problems in groundwater management is the low awareness and knowledge of farmers about the status of groundwater resources at the time of completing the questionnaires and interviewing the farmers they were clarified with the challenges the plain has faced over the years it was made possible through the presentation of aquifer salinity map groundwater levels figs 2 and 3 of the original manuscript the trend of cultivation areas and yields of fashafoeyeh plain over the past 40 years subsequently the results of the mathematical modeling of aquifer management scenarios were presented solutions of the current problems were also scrutinized for the farmers including a detailed description of the asr approach cooperative groundwater management reducing pumping rate and impacts on increasing groundwater level preservation of groundwater quality selection of suitable cropping pattern using of pressurized irrigation system and increased contribution with government and local communities in this plain some wells were dried and the others managed by several owners overall 23 questionnaires were collated from 12 villages in general beneficiaries of the groundwater from the fashafoeyeh aquifer were divided into two main groups of main landowners and farmers these 23 questionnaires included main landowners those with more than five pumping wells and an average cultivation area of 31 ha these groups role was important in the implementation and management of the asr plan and groundwater withdrawal a few pumping wells in the plain were also used by a group of 20 farmers which their cultivation area and withdrawal volume were not significant in comparison to the main landowners for this reason the assign weights for the farmers were less than the main landowners for further statistical analysis spss 2 3 was used to analyze the data 3 results 3 1 respondent features to analyze the results of the first part of the questionnaire descriptive and inferential statistics were used the results showed that 22 participants were male and the majority of them 78 3 had above primary education the respondent s average age was 59 74 years with the average agricultural experience of 42 32 years among them 15 persons used flood irrigation methods cultivated areas and an average of wheat yields were 30 65 ha and 4 56 tons per hectare respectively table 5 3 2 participation in asr system in this research participation refers to the contributions of government main landowners and farmers for this reason it included local communities in resolving problems and challenges in the area participation and collaboration of users in the implementation maintenance and management of the asr system their participation in the implementation of government projects to increase crop yields and the implementation of pressurized irrigation systems farmers are involved in groundwater and surface water withdrawal after implementing the asr plan and participating in training classes one of the main purposes of this study was to investigate the stakeholders in some aspects of asr system including willing to pay for the project maintaining installations and physical participation the results showed that about 65 of respondents had a high tendency to pay for the project an 83 tendency to maintain the equipment for asr system and a 65 2 tendency for physical participation fig 5 3 3 satisfaction of government s organization fig 6 shows that 13 members were not satisfied with water authorities and 74 were not satisfied with the local bureau of agriculture in addition 83 were not satisfied with government function as a whole and they believed that the government had performed no appropriate action for groundwater resource management 3 4 participating in a training class and tendency to decrease groundwater pumping in this research the results showed that 96 of stakeholders had a high tendency to attend training classes for improving their awareness and knowledge about aquifer quality and quantity various approaches for increasing product yields and practical solutions for groundwater management moreover about 91 of users believed if the asr system was performed in this plain and its good impacts were revealed they would reduce groundwater withdrawal from wells 3 5 correlation among indicators the results showed that there was a significant relationship between agricultural efficiency with participation in governmental projects and the implementation and maintenance of the asr system on the other hand there was a high correlation between agricultural efficiency and education in addition water management in the farm had a significant relationship with the participation in the governmental projects and local participation to groundwater sustainability furthermore local participation had a significant relationship with agricultural experience age and education of farmers table 6 4 discussion according to the results it was found that agriculture has a lot of positive effects on the local economies it was also shown that due to the inappropriate management of groundwater resources the wells were dried and many people migrated from the villages to tehran city the aquifer storage and recovery system can turn this challenge into an opportunity in the area even if an aquifer has encountered an extreme decline of several meters over the last years it would have been balanced by asr as a result the equitable distribution of water stored in the reservoir would have resulted for stakeholders for the fashafouyeh plain asr effect was simulated by groundwater flow and solute transport modeling kholghi et al 2018 required data were gathered in a field survey for two years the modeling showed the results of treated wastewater injection to a specific site of an aquifer it revealed that groundwater level was increased and groundwater quality improved just after one year of aquifer storage at the present time many villages are vacant on the other hand since the majority of users are regarded as the main owners with mean cultivated areas of 31 ha and each has more than one well these issues have attracted new immigrants from other regions to move to this plain for working in agricultural and industrial sectors despite the low education level of the majority of users 60 with primary education they used salt resistant plants such as barley and alfalfa bağci et al 2003 such strategies may help to improve productivity in cultivated areas increase yields up to about 4 5 tons per hectare revitalize traditional irrigation systems and reduce salinity levels in some areas zehtabian et al 2010 we must mention that the lack of government support to improve crop efficiency as well as declining surface water resources have enticed local people 96 to participate in training classes the main aim was to raise awareness promote new technologies and improve the relationship with the local bureau of agriculture and regional water authorities in the past because of the existence of qanats as traditional underground water canals and common shared wells stakeholders participated in the construction and operation of these water systems jafary 2016 this indicates that there are a willingness and potential of participation in this region about 91 of respondents believed that there had been participation desires among farmers for controlling groundwater withdrawals in the past however due to the development of electrical water pump technology expansion of personal wells declining local family bonds the need for manpower has been decreased over the last four decades on the other hand increasing competition and individualism have caused local participation to become lower than before however given the current problems in the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater in this plain the existence of participation spirit and dependency of people s income to groundwater and agricultural products about 91 of users show a high tendency to reduce aquifer withdrawal based on asr system in addition about 96 of the users believed that participation and consultation must be considered for aquifer withdrawal the iranian government is responsible for surface and groundwater management this reason has caused about 65 of farmers believed that the government is ownership of groundwater this issue has also caused to increase the competition for groundwater withdrawal while in the past qanats improved local participation in underground water withdrawal previous studies showed that the water authority was responsible for drying the rivers and reducing the water right as a result of the construction of karaj dam located in the upstream of fashafuyeh river and their lack of support to promote pressurized irrigation systems foltz 2002 garduño et al 2010 jafary 2016 in addition the government has frustrated farmers by implementing measures such as inappropriate management ineffective laws top down managerial view and ignoring the fact that farmers are the main controllers of groundwater resources on the other hand we showed that 74 of respondents were not satisfied with the agricultural organization s function because of their poor support in educating and training farmers in particular training proper cultivation methods and increasing product yields and promoting new technologies are really needed in such areas there was a correlation between agricultural efficiency and education increasing the literacy of users was correlated to their higher awareness about the ways to increase crop yields considering that about 60 of users had primary education their information about the methods of increasing the crop yield was relatively high there was also a correlation among education age and history of agriculture with the local participatory attitude the average age of users about 60 years and agricultural experience about 42 years ensured the participation of high experience of farmers in approaches on the other hand due to the reduction in water resources and declining earnings in recent years users were reluctant to cooperate however they now believe that by controlling over exploitation of groundwater resources sustainable water management can be achieved and they will enjoy economic and social benefits there was also a correlation between agricultural efficiency and participation in governments projects ae c2 this shows that farmers are seeking to increase the product yields and they value participation with local agricultural staff and government s projects and the opinions of agricultural experts and believe that in this friendly atmosphere their product yields will increase on the basis of the correlation existed between agricultural efficiency and participation in the implementation and maintenance of the asr system ae d1 we concluded that the asr system will improve aquifer balance and increase the quantity and quality of groundwater furthermore in the fashafuyeh plain with low product yields of 4 56 tons per ha the implementation of asr systems provides water for irrigation increases productivity and enhance agricultural efficiency as a result farmers are increasingly eager to participate in various stages of the project regarding the correlation between water management in the farm with participation in government projects and local participation in the sustainable management of groundwater b1 pg d3 we showed that participation in government projects could improve aquifer status also we showed that water management on the farm scale would lead to the optimal usage of available water to increase product yield in relation to assess the correlation between point of view of farmers to the government s projects with their participation in government s projects c1 c2 despite the negative attitude of local communities towards the government s projects and low satisfaction of the farmer with water regional authority and agricultural staff they had strong desire to participate with water regional authorities at different phases of the asr project to increase the product yields over the past 40 years surface water resources have declined the number of groundwater resources declined aquifer salinity increased due to an increase in the number of wells and qanats dried up results of interviewing with farmers showed many factors poor governmental management of unauthorized withdrawal of surface and groundwater resources and drying up of karaj river as the main permanent surface flow of the plain drilling of a large number of pumping wells in the plain lack of governmental support to improve crop yield lack of training classes to enhance the knowledge of farmers weakness in governmental support for implementing pressurized irrigation system and to the negligence of this fact that farmers were major beneficiaries of groundwater resources these factors have led farmers to believe that the government has not done actions necessary to manage groundwater resources the results also showed that farmers knew that the quality and quantity of aquifer could be improved through the implementation of a participatory management approach as a result farmers are keen to partner with various governmental agencies and implement the asr project to increase their economic income and improve aquifer status for this reason in order to increase the involvement of local communities the government must first increase public confidence by having a bottom up attitude informing the farmers from the groundwater status supporting farmers production implementing pressurized irrigation systems conducting training classes and monitoring water resources researches showed that one of the reasons for the failure of projects in the field of sustainable management of groundwater resources is the negligence of the role and participation of local communities as key beneficiaries of groundwater resources the results of this study also showed that farmers were willing to participate in water management through the asr system in fashafoeyeh plain this cooperation could be summarized in the following cases financial support of the asr project maintenance of equipment participation in optimal aquifer withdrawal cooperation with the government to implement the asr plan attending training sessions to increase their awareness of asr project attempting to increase crop yield participation in the restoration of the qanats participation in the optimal operation of surface water participation with regional water authority to increase agricultural water productivity by implementing pressurized irrigation 5 conclusion this paper focused on the negative impacts of the overexploitation of the groundwater resource to farmers and stakeholders in fashafuyeh plain in southern tehran and investigated the possibility feasibility of the participatory management approach in the aquifer storage and recovery system the methodology focused on i data collection from farmers about socio economic status of the plain investigation of the viewpoint of users on participation in asr system and groundwater withdrawal ii study of the status of water resources evaluation of the viewpoints of local communities on the government s function and relevant organizations by completing questionnaires iii conducting field surveys and interviewing with users during a 2 year period in this research five indicators were recommended for a comprehensive investigation of the plain including the agricultural efficiency ae water resource efficiency we participation in government s projects pg local participation lp and economical e the results showed that farmers had a high tendency to participate in some aspects of the asr system participatory groundwater withdrawal after implementing the asr system to attend in the training classes to cooperate with water and agricultural authorities in order to achieve groundwater sustainability in addition it was found that there was a correlation between agriculture efficiency ae with participatory in government projects c2 and participation in the implementation and maintenance asr system d1 moreover there was a correlation between water management in the farm b1 with participation in government projects pg and local participatory in the sustainable management of groundwater d3 many plains in iran face with a problem of groundwater over exploitation on the other hand those high annual volumes of wastewater have created challenges in large cities the results of this study reaffirm that farmers have a strong interest in implementing asr management in a participatory manner this study considers the potential of this approach for the fashafoeyeh plain but this approach can be extended for the areas that have similar hydrogeological and social conditions to fashafoeyeh participatory groundwater management in the asr system requires cooperation between local farmer communities and responsive governmental organizations author declaration we

12182,aquifer storage and recovery asr with treated wastewater is considered as an effective solution for a critical aquifer decline due to groundwater overexploitation in asr operational step and after the aquifer storage phase the problem is the new groundwater right for stakeholders and specifically farmers in a 2 year study the potential of a participatory approach for solving this problem was investigated and applied in fashafoeyeh aquifer in southern tehran province this aquifer faces a critical situation of groundwater from point of view of quantitative and qualitative aspects firstly five indicators were considered including agricultural efficiency water resource efficiency water governance local participation and economic factors then 23 farmers and agricultural landowners were selected based on age education and gender a questionnaire was designed surveyed and filled out after interviewing them in several field trips to the site the results of data analysis showed that 96 of farmers and landowners were highly motivated in the implementation of the participatory approach in asr management moreover 91 showed a high desire to decrease the groundwater withdrawal from wells a high percentage of stakeholders had a tendency to participate in some aspects of asr system in the meantime many farmers had a negative viewpoint about government supports the results illustrate a correlation between agriculture efficiency with participation in the government s projects and implementation moreover a correlation exists between water management in the field and participation in government s projects as well as local participatory this research emphasises on proper planning through face to face dialogue with farmers and landowners in this regard they collaborate in a participatory approach as well as a technical and social team to implement the aquifer storage and recovery management graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer treated wastewater storage people participation groundwater iran 1 introduction groundwater plays a main role in agricultural water demands in arid and semi arid zones in the last three decades due to population growth drought periods agricultural domestic industrial development groundwater overexploitation have caused a dramatic decline of the water table in most aquifers in iran on the other hand population growth in large cities has been faster and caused a large amount of wastewater to be produced every year the continued generation of a large amount of wastewater in urban regions has caused environmental problems and endangered ecosystems however wastewater has a great potential that has not yet been considered as a way to be used to keep aquifers to be in balance smith et al 2017 aquifer storage and recovery asr is a managed artificial recharge using a direct injection that is used to increase groundwater storage through injection wells and unsaturated saturated porous media the use of treated wastewater is one of the ways for aquifer storage while it can solve environmental problems and endanger ecosystems brown 2005 el arabi and dawoud 2012 balance critical aquifers store water for later use and improve groundwater quality castro 1997 page et al 2017 sheng 2005 public participation is one of the five indicators of groundwater sustainable management valentin and spangenberg 2000 it

two initiatives for iran for the first time it will prove the importance and role of local society in groundwater management as the first attempt for iran so far moreover it will look at specific views of the bottom up approach of participatory management in an overexploited aquifer in fashafuyeh aquifer to highlight sustainable groundwater management and reduce local conflict the paper starts with a brief general background on global research on relevant issues and provides an understanding of the implementation and use of asr across iran we will use this study area as a typical cultivation region and employ field survey data and questionnaires to investigate the findings and present results 1 1 literature review table 1 shows global studies and projects focusing on participatory groundwater management and aquifer storage and recovery as is clear a diverse range of regional settings and stakeholders have been assessed globally despite several groundwater artificial recharge sites in iran to the best of our knowledge asr has not been implemented in iran yet the feasibility study and its potential in the south of tehran were investigated through an applied research lens for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the fashafouyeh plain is located in the center of tehran province between latitudes 51 00 ʹ00ʹʹ n and 51 20ʹ00ʹʹ n and longitudes 35 20ʹ00ʹʹ e and 35 30ʹ00ʹʹ e fig 1 with an area of about 200 km2 and annual precipitation of 166 mm the area is used mostly for agriculture above 95 of water demand for agriculture in this area is supplied by groundwater and the rest by a surface river seasonal karaj river the area encompasses a total of 335 groundwater users as well as 14 villages with a total population of 30 000 also the area is surrounded by rural industries including the largest industrial site in iran thus it has attracted a large flux of national and foreign immigrants the domestic water resources of the villages located in this plain are supplied by pumping wells with good groundwater quality located in the upper part of the plain and are owned by the government there are 23 qanats with a total length of 160 km most of which have been dried in addition there are a total of 232 wells with a total annual withdrawal of 31 02 mcm table 2 the agricultural industrial and domestic water resources depend on groundwater in the last four decades due to frequent drought periods surface water availability of region has decreased and most of the rivers dried in such cases groundwater resource was the only available water resource leading to over exploitation of groundwater and extreme water level decline fig 2 hydrological problems fig 3 soil salinity reduction of cultivated size areas and migration of local people to other cities of tehran province a large volume of wastewater is generated by the tehran metropolis each year an increase of excessive groundwater withdrawals from fashafuyeh plain fig 4 and a shortage of surface water resources have endangered this plain with water quality and quantity crisis 2 2 data collection in order to investigate public awareness local issues and other relevant factors a series of questionnaires were distributed in this research groundwater and surface water characteristics were also studied within a period of two years table 3 2 3 field survey a field survey was carried out in the year 2017 2018 to collect first hand information from local communities this region is homogenous and consisted of individuals who are familiar with the culture language and stakeholders of the region because the industrial water right was given a preference in this area we collected information only from farmers and those landowners who possessed at least one well in their lands following the establishment of the field study methods and indicators a questionnaire was developed according to the existing studies and plain conditions data were collected using the open and close ended questionnaires and face to face interviews with farmers the questionnaire consisted of two sections the first section was related to information about social and economic conditions in which independent variables were expressed and six indicators defined table 4 the second section was based on our field investigations one of the major problems in groundwater management is the low awareness and knowledge of farmers about the status of groundwater resources at the time of completing the questionnaires and interviewing the farmers they were clarified with the challenges the plain has faced over the years it was made possible through the presentation of aquifer salinity map groundwater levels figs 2 and 3 of the original manuscript the trend of cultivation areas and yields of fashafoeyeh plain over the past 40 years subsequently the results of the mathematical modeling of aquifer management scenarios were presented solutions of the current problems were also scrutinized for the farmers including a detailed description of the asr approach cooperative groundwater management reducing pumping rate and impacts on increasing groundwater level preservation of groundwater quality selection of suitable cropping pattern using of pressurized irrigation system and increased contribution with government and local communities in this plain some wells were dried and the others managed by several owners overall 23 questionnaires were collated from 12 villages in general beneficiaries of the groundwater from the fashafoeyeh aquifer were divided into two main groups of main landowners and farmers these 23 questionnaires included main landowners those with more than five pumping wells and an average cultivation area of 31 ha these groups role was important in the implementation and management of the asr plan and groundwater withdrawal a few pumping wells in the plain were also used by a group of 20 farmers which their cultivation area and withdrawal volume were not significant in comparison to the main landowners for this reason the assign weights for the farmers were less than the main landowners for further statistical analysis spss 2 3 was used to analyze the data 3 results 3 1 respondent features to analyze the results of the first part of the questionnaire descriptive and inferential statistics were used the results showed that 22 participants were male and the majority of them 78 3 had above primary education the respondent s average age was 59 74 years with the average agricultural experience of 42 32 years among them 15 persons used flood irrigation methods cultivated areas and an average of wheat yields were 30 65 ha and 4 56 tons per hectare respectively table 5 3 2 participation in asr system in this research participation refers to the contributions of government main landowners and farmers for this reason it included local communities in resolving problems and challenges in the area participation and collaboration of users in the implementation maintenance and management of the asr system their participation in the implementation of government projects to increase crop yields and the implementation of pressurized irrigation systems farmers are involved in groundwater and surface water withdrawal after implementing the asr plan and participating in training classes one of the main purposes of this study was to investigate the stakeholders in some aspects of asr system including willing to pay for the project maintaining installations and physical participation the results showed that about 65 of respondents had a high tendency to pay for the project an 83 tendency to maintain the equipment for asr system and a 65 2 tendency for physical participation fig 5 3 3 satisfaction of government s organization fig 6 shows that 13 members were not satisfied with water authorities and 74 were not satisfied with the local bureau of agriculture in addition 83 were not satisfied with government function as a whole and they believed that the government had performed no appropriate action for groundwater resource management 3 4 participating in a training class and tendency to decrease groundwater pumping in this research the results showed that 96 of stakeholders had a high tendency to attend training classes for improving their awareness and knowledge about aquifer quality and quantity various approaches for increasing product yields and practical solutions for groundwater management moreover about 91 of users believed if the asr system was performed in this plain and its good impacts were revealed they would reduce groundwater withdrawal from wells 3 5 correlation among indicators the results showed that there was a significant relationship between agricultural efficiency with participation in governmental projects and the implementation and maintenance of the asr system on the other hand there was a high correlation between agricultural efficiency and education in addition water management in the farm had a significant relationship with the participation in the governmental projects and local participation to groundwater sustainability furthermore local participation had a significant relationship with agricultural experience age and education of farmers table 6 4 discussion according to the results it was found that agriculture has a lot of positive effects on the local economies it was also shown that due to the inappropriate management of groundwater resources the wells were dried and many people migrated from the villages to tehran city the aquifer storage and recovery system can turn this challenge into an opportunity in the area even if an aquifer has encountered an extreme decline of several meters over the last years it would have been balanced by asr as a result the equitable distribution of water stored in the reservoir would have resulted for stakeholders for the fashafouyeh plain asr effect was simulated by groundwater flow and solute transport modeling kholghi et al 2018 required data were gathered in a field survey for two years the modeling showed the results of treated wastewater injection to a specific site of an aquifer it revealed that groundwater level was increased and groundwater quality improved just after one year of aquifer storage at the present time many villages are vacant on the other hand since the majority of users are regarded as the main owners with mean cultivated areas of 31 ha and each has more than one well these issues have attracted new immigrants from other regions to move to this plain for working in agricultural and industrial sectors despite the low education level of the majority of users 60 with primary education they used salt resistant plants such as barley and alfalfa bağci et al 2003 such strategies may help to improve productivity in cultivated areas increase yields up to about 4 5 tons per hectare revitalize traditional irrigation systems and reduce salinity levels in some areas zehtabian et al 2010 we must mention that the lack of government support to improve crop efficiency as well as declining surface water resources have enticed local people 96 to participate in training classes the main aim was to raise awareness promote new technologies and improve the relationship with the local bureau of agriculture and regional water authorities in the past because of the existence of qanats as traditional underground water canals and common shared wells stakeholders participated in the construction and operation of these water systems jafary 2016 this indicates that there are a willingness and potential of participation in this region about 91 of respondents believed that there had been participation desires among farmers for controlling groundwater withdrawals in the past however due to the development of electrical water pump technology expansion of personal wells declining local family bonds the need for manpower has been decreased over the last four decades on the other hand increasing competition and individualism have caused local participation to become lower than before however given the current problems in the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater in this plain the existence of participation spirit and dependency of people s income to groundwater and agricultural products about 91 of users show a high tendency to reduce aquifer withdrawal based on asr system in addition about 96 of the users believed that participation and consultation must be considered for aquifer withdrawal the iranian government is responsible for surface and groundwater management this reason has caused about 65 of farmers believed that the government is ownership of groundwater this issue has also caused to increase the competition for groundwater withdrawal while in the past qanats improved local participation in underground water withdrawal previous studies showed that the water authority was responsible for drying the rivers and reducing the water right as a result of the construction of karaj dam located in the upstream of fashafuyeh river and their lack of support to promote pressurized irrigation systems foltz 2002 garduño et al 2010 jafary 2016 in addition the government has frustrated farmers by implementing measures such as inappropriate management ineffective laws top down managerial view and ignoring the fact that farmers are the main controllers of groundwater resources on the other hand we showed that 74 of respondents were not satisfied with the agricultural organization s function because of their poor support in educating and training farmers in particular training proper cultivation methods and increasing product yields and promoting new technologies are really needed in such areas there was a correlation between agricultural efficiency and education increasing the literacy of users was correlated to their higher awareness about the ways to increase crop yields considering that about 60 of users had primary education their information about the methods of increasing the crop yield was relatively high there was also a correlation among education age and history of agriculture with the local participatory attitude the average age of users about 60 years and agricultural experience about 42 years ensured the participation of high experience of farmers in approaches on the other hand due to the reduction in water resources and declining earnings in recent years users were reluctant to cooperate however they now believe that by controlling over exploitation of groundwater resources sustainable water management can be achieved and they will enjoy economic and social benefits there was also a correlation between agricultural efficiency and participation in governments projects ae c2 this shows that farmers are seeking to increase the product yields and they value participation with local agricultural staff and government s projects and the opinions of agricultural experts and believe that in this friendly atmosphere their product yields will increase on the basis of the correlation existed between agricultural efficiency and participation in the implementation and maintenance of the asr system ae d1 we concluded that the asr system will improve aquifer balance and increase the quantity and quality of groundwater furthermore in the fashafuyeh plain with low product yields of 4 56 tons per ha the implementation of asr systems provides water for irrigation increases productivity and enhance agricultural efficiency as a result farmers are increasingly eager to participate in various stages of the project regarding the correlation between water management in the farm with participation in government projects and local participation in the sustainable management of groundwater b1 pg d3 we showed that participation in government projects could improve aquifer status also we showed that water management on the farm scale would lead to the optimal usage of available water to increase product yield in relation to assess the correlation between point of view of farmers to the government s projects with their participation in government s projects c1 c2 despite the negative attitude of local communities towards the government s projects and low satisfaction of the farmer with water regional authority and agricultural staff they had strong desire to participate with water regional authorities at different phases of the asr project to increase the product yields over the past 40 years surface water resources have declined the number of groundwater resources declined aquifer salinity increased due to an increase in the number of wells and qanats dried up results of interviewing with farmers showed many factors poor governmental management of unauthorized withdrawal of surface and groundwater resources and drying up of karaj river as the main permanent surface flow of the plain drilling of a large number of pumping wells in the plain lack of governmental support to improve crop yield lack of training classes to enhance the knowledge of farmers weakness in governmental support for implementing pressurized irrigation system and to the negligence of this fact that farmers were major beneficiaries of groundwater resources these factors have led farmers to believe that the government has not done actions necessary to manage groundwater resources the results also showed that farmers knew that the quality and quantity of aquifer could be improved through the implementation of a participatory management approach as a result farmers are keen to partner with various governmental agencies and implement the asr project to increase their economic income and improve aquifer status for this reason in order to increase the involvement of local communities the government must first increase public confidence by having a bottom up attitude informing the farmers from the groundwater status supporting farmers production implementing pressurized irrigation systems conducting training classes and monitoring water resources researches showed that one of the reasons for the failure of projects in the field of sustainable management of groundwater resources is the negligence of the role and participation of local communities as key beneficiaries of groundwater resources the results of this study also showed that farmers were willing to participate in water management through the asr system in fashafoeyeh plain this cooperation could be summarized in the following cases financial support of the asr project maintenance of equipment participation in optimal aquifer withdrawal cooperation with the government to implement the asr plan attending training sessions to increase their awareness of asr project attempting to increase crop yield participation in the restoration of the qanats participation in the optimal operation of surface water participation with regional water authority to increase agricultural water productivity by implementing pressurized irrigation 5 conclusion this paper focused on the negative impacts of the overexploitation of the groundwater resource to farmers and stakeholders in fashafuyeh plain in southern tehran and investigated the possibility feasibility of the participatory management approach in the aquifer storage and recovery system the methodology focused on i data collection from farmers about socio economic status of the plain investigation of the viewpoint of users on participation in asr system and groundwater withdrawal ii study of the status of water resources evaluation of the viewpoints of local communities on the government s function

results showed that farmers had a high tendency to participate in some aspects of the asr system participatory groundwater withdrawal after implementing the asr system to attend in the training classes to cooperate with water and agricultural authorities in order to achieve groundwater sustainability in addition it was found that there was a correlation between agriculture efficiency ae with participatory in government projects c2 and participation in the implementation and maintenance asr system d1 moreover there was a correlation between water management in the farm b1 with participation in government projects pg and local participatory in the sustainable management of groundwater d3 many plains in iran face with a problem of groundwater over exploitation on the other hand those high annual volumes of wastewater have created challenges in large cities the results of this study reaffirm that farmers have a strong interest in implementing asr management in a participatory manner this study considers the potential of this approach for the fashafoeyeh plain but this approach can be extended for the areas that have similar hydrogeological and social

12183,fluoride contamination is a global environmental interrogation due to consideration of its long term persistence in air soil and water even at lower levels long term exposure can exert negative impacts on all communities irrespective of the concentrations therefore immediate attention is needed to remediate the negative impacts of fluoride on the environment various conventional and modern techniques have been developed to remove fluoride from groundwater mainly due to its high prevalence due to limitations such as high cost labor intensity regeneration need and low removal capacity many existing techniques are not practical for remediating fluoride in water at the same time less advertence has been raised for phytoremediation as an effective and environmentally friendly method this review presents the utilization of potential plants for removing fluoride from environmental matrices discusses the fluoride translocation mechanisms and its phytotoxicity in plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords phytoremediation bioavailability translocation uptake accumulation outline 1 introduction fluoride contamination in the environment has been recognized as one of the significant groundwater quality issues for a long time being the 13th most abundant elements found in the earth s crust fluoride is found in different environmental matrices that adversely affect their physiological and biochemical parameters singh et al 2018 vithanage et al 2012b vithanage et al 2014 fluorine is the most reactive and electronegative element in the periodic table and primarily occurs as the negative fluoride ion in the environment in the earth s crust many rocks and minerals contain fluorides and have the ability to leach out by natural weathering and precipitation loganathan et al 2013 vithanage et al 2014 it increases the availability of fluoride in the environment which leads to its entry into the food chain fawell et al 2006 in addition to this fluoride can enter into the environment from the wastewaters generated from industrial activities such as steel glass semiconductors aluminum electronics fertilizer and insecticide production processes kimambo et al 2019 these industrial effluents and the sewage discharged from the domestic water supplies enhanced with fluoride lead to increase in the fluoride levels in aquatic environment volcanic activities and coal combustion contribute to the emission of fluoride rich dust and gasses to the atmosphere as well which are further sources of fluoride leaching into the environment through airborne sources fawell et al 2006 although fluoride is considered an essential element for human well being and in regards to the safe limits as stated earlier excessive doses may cause adverse health effects fluorosis has been reported from south asian african middle east north central and south american and european regions fawell et al 2006 which has been reported to have detrimental effects on human wellbeing it was estimated that 56 2 million people were stricken by fluorosis in india and it was prevalent in 19 states out of 32 jagtap et al 2012 ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a up to date research emphasis has been addressed more on the hazardous effects of fluoride on the human and animal population however lack of attention has been given on its ecological impact and the cost effective ways to deliver safe drinking water with optimal fluoride levels is the need of the hour hence there is a critical need to develop sustainable technology or process to remove or detoxify fluoride from the environment general defluoridation techniques involve precipitation ion exchange adsorption electrocoagulation and membrane processes chatterjee et al 2018 ravulapalli and kunta 2017 however application of these processes are limited to the high cost and high maintenance that they demand mohapatra et al 2009 premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 phytoremediation a green technology for water quality improvements has been intensively studied during the last few decades due to its cost effectiveness environmentally friendly natural clean up process as well as the ability to detoxify the contaminants significantly several plant species have been identified to be utilized for accumulating these contaminants in their tissues especially when it comes to the uptake of trace metals the understanding of their uptake translocation through the root and shoot system is limited and the stress factors it can withstand without compromising the growth of the plant requires detailed attention thus the study of plant and soil interactions in the context of fluoride accumulation is crucial in this review an attempt was made to implicate the use of plants for contaminant mitigation of fluoride and elucidate the fluoride uptake and translocation mechanisms of plants phytotoxicity and phytoremediation of fluoride as an ecofriendly alternative 2 fluoride occurrences and sources 2 1 global distribution of fluoride geographical location is the primary factor that decides the fluoride content in the water vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the water and the rock interactions geothermal springs tectonic processes and volcanic activities are the primary routes for fluoride plumes into the groundwater as depicted in fig 1 chowdhury et al 2019 in groundwater high fluoride concentrations varying between 1 and 48 mg l 1 are found in many parts of asia africa china india ghana kenya sri lanka along with rift valley countries in africa and usa when establishing the fluoride intake limits the two essential factors to be considered are the quantity of water intake and intake from diets for instance in arid regions the fluoride consumption is higher than the temperate regions due to the higher concentrations of fluoride at arid conditions indicating that the fluoride limit for fluorosis should be lower especially for the humid tropics escoto et al 2019 kumar yadav et al 2018 lópez guzmán et al 2019 makehelwala et al 2019 yadav et al 2018 in the asian region out of 85 million tons of fluoride deposits on the earth crust 12 million tons are found in india teotia and teotia 1994 fluoride contamination of groundwater in india has been a severe problem which is due to the evaporation of groundwater with residual alkalinity jacks et al 2005 according to kumar et al 2016 et al about 50 of the groundwater in delhi exceeds the maximum permissible level of fluoride in drinking water datta et al 1996 dehghani et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 due to the presence of inherent fluoride rich granite rocks the groundwater fluoride concentration in andhra pradesh india is at a high risk level of exposure the rocks in southern india are rich with fluoride which forms the principal reason for fluoride contamination in groundwater rao et al 1993 singh et al 2018 in deeper aquifers of maharashtra fluoride content is higher than shallow groundwater due to long term residence time along the shallow groundwater levels madhnure et al 2007 furthermore the deposition of soil dust paves the way to reported high level of fluoride level in two sites in uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh in india singh et al 2016 in sri lanka it was reported that the high fluoride areas are located within the lowland plains due to longer contact time with the geological sites was longer in plains and slow groundwater movement compared to highlands premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 fluoride bearing minerals such as hornblende mica and appetite are in abundance in all of the three major lithotectonic units of the country viz the highland the wanni and the vijayan complex under humid tropical climate the weathering of the mineral rocks occurs and fluoride gets easily leached into the groundwater which is the primary source of drinking water in these arid regions the seasonal rainfalls evaporation and mineralogical compositions of these aquifers significantly control the composition of groundwater causing an excess or deficiency of crucial elements in drinking water chandrajith et al 2012 ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a there are several known instances for the link between the geochemistry and climate in these regions and a consistent trend of human diseases in the vicinity in the dry zone of sri lanka chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu is one of the most common health problems among the farming communities the disease is geographically constrained to the dry zones of the county and is manifested directly in paddy farmers in the age groups of 30 60 years the presence of high levels of fluoride and hardness was reported from water in the ckdu prevalent areas premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 lada sokolova et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 this adds up to the potential toxicology link referred to the intake of fluoride from these drinking water sources the fluoride level in groundwater has not changed even after two decades in some areas of north central part of sri lanka which are higher than 4 mg l 1 in groundwater young et al 2011 to add further around two million people are at risk of being exposed to high fluoride levels in east punjab pakistan due to fertilizer containing leachable fluoride and coal containing fluoride farooqi et al 2007 this accounts for generations of human settlements being exposed to fluoride consuming drinking water exaggerated fluoride in drinking water has been reported from many parts of china gao et al 2007 zhu et al 2007 a salty lake water intrusion has been reported in yuncheng basin china as the source of high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater interaction between a recharge area and fluoride containing minerals was the source of high fluoride in taiyuan basin china high fluoride concentration has resulted in the discharge area of the same basin as well due to evaporation and mixing of karst water gao et al 2007 oversaturation of fluoride in groundwater of mizunami japan has been reported due to weathering and alteration of granite rocks abdelgawad et al 2009 ash from the volcanic explosion of sakurajima volcano japan was found to contain average fluoride concentration of 788 mg l 1 for 12 years nogami et al 2006 evaporation leads to an incensement in the fluoride level in the natural waters of kenya where fluoride concentration was more significantly higher in lake water than groundwater and springs gaciri and davies 1993 the area surrounding the east african rift system and tanzania volcanic activity resulted in increasing the fluoride concentration in waters many of the lakes in these areas have fluoride concentration reaching up to 1640 and 2800 mg l 1 ipcs fluorides 2002 phosphate industry waste disposal sites in poland have reported fluoride concentration of about 8 mg l 1 czarnowski et al 1996 due to silurian ordovician aquifer system in western estonia the fluoride concentration was reported naturally at about 7 mg l 1 indermitte et al 2009 2 2 sources of high fluoride in the environment fluoride can enter into the environment through both natural and anthropogenic activities naturally fluoride is an accomplice with many mineral deposits containing fluoride bearing minerals such as sellaite villianmite flourite cryolite bastnaesite and fluoroapatite which occur in most rocks and sediments chae et al 2007 2006 saxena and ahmed 2003 and can release into the environment through weathering dissolution and other pedogenic processes syenites granites quartz monzonites felsic and biotite gneisses are considered as the highest fluoride containing rocks kimambo et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 mukherjee and halder 2018 polonskij and polonskaya 2013 ideally when rocks containing these fluoride minerals get exposed through weather agents as in water alteration of rocks occurs through a series of geochemical reactions whose fluorine gets leached into the water as in depicted in fig 1 hydrothermal vein deposits contain fluorite fluoro apatite fluoride rich micas and amphiboles ali et al 2019 dolejs and baker 2007 wall rock interactions are considered as the leading process on fluoride release into the groundwater abdelgawad et al 2009 abdelgawad et al 2009 and fluorides mainly originate via hydroxy positions in biotite and hornblende which is concentrated through evaporation resulting residual alkalinity therefore a high level of groundwater concentrations of fluorides is mainly reported in dry parts of the world jacks et al 2005 mukherjee and halder 2018 fluoride concentration is positively correlated with hco3 and na content as high fluoride groundwater typically has high ph values gao et al 2007 further alkaline condition moderate specific conductivity and their ratios are considered as the significant factors that govern the fluoride dissolution from rocks saxena and ahmed 2003 2001 due to alkaline nature of groundwater due to the presence of hco3 and na it has relatively high hydroxyl ions accordingly the oh can be replaced by fluoride of the fluoride bearing minerals leading to boost the fluoride content in groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 despite the exceptional situations that have anthropogenic inputs such as phosphate fertilizers sewage sludge and industrial pollution fluoride content in soil ranges from 200 to 300 mg kg 1 generally edmunds and smedley 2005 who 2002 since fluoride naturally has a strong association with soil factors influencing the release of fluorides from the soil are chemical speciation soil chemistry and climate the aluminum and iron in soils form complexes with the fluoride at acidic ph and the adsorption onto soil is significantly high who 2002 the application of fertilizers makes the soil alkaline and leads to an increased fluoride release from soil to the groundwater sources of fluoride in soil and groundwater include volcanic ash hydrothermal sources wet and dry deposition of gaseous particulate fluorides phosphate fertilizers insecticides fumigants rodenticides and herbicides datta et al 2012 marine aerosols volcanic gas emissions and airborne soil dust are considered as natural atmospheric sources of fluoride tavener and clark 2006 high solubility in volcanic ash may cause to increase the groundwater fluoride content indirectly primary anthropogenic sources of fluorides are aerosols from brickwork phosphate fertilizers iron and steel production ceramic industries and aluminum smelters bonvicini et al 2006 walna et al 2007 further hydrothermal vein deposits contain fluorite fluoro apatite fluoride rich micas and amphiboles dolejs and baker 2007 2 3 problems related to fluoride contamination fluoride abundant drinking water is a boundless problem which can be seen all over the world as the presence of fluoride in water does not indicate any color odor or taste and it acts as an invisible poison in groundwater exaggerated exposure to fluoride paves the way to diseases that can cause calcification of ligament and mottling of teeth skeletal and dental fluorosis fawell et al 2006 developmental issues in children decreased cognitive ability cancer and crippling bone deformities may demonstrate the long term ingestion of fluoride rich drinking water dolejš and baker 2007 osteosarcoma bone cancer in human males is mainly associated with fluorinated water which is the third common cancer in children with a death rate of about 50 and most survivors lose limbs to amputation bassin et al 2006 as reported earlier chronic kidney disease has become the most widely spread disease in some parts of the dry zones of sri lanka and fluoride has been proven to be a contributory factor in spreading the etiology of chronic diseases ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a studies have shown the possible relationship between the fluoride levels in drinking water and the damage it has on the kidney the detrimental indices for analyzing kidney functions were carefully studied upon viz the content of creatine in urine and the activities of the lysosomal enzyme and its co relation with water fluoride levels dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 xiong et al 2007 this necessitates further the measures to be taken for safe provision of potable water for the prevention of this particular disease among the dry zones of sri lanka the fluoride and the total dissolved solids that contribute to forming complexes with the hard water needs to be pre treated using reverse osmosis and currently are remediated in these arid areas lee et al 2009 makehelwala et al 2019 to add further fluoride dosage in drinking water is dependent on the climatic conditions of the region thus it is suggested to drop the recommended fluoride level to 0 6 0 8 mg l 1 from the existing limit in tropical countries with an average temperature of 31 24 c ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a the climatic conditions and high intake of water are co dependent and need to be considered for setting up a standard level for drinking water 3 defluoridation the defluoridation techniques can be broadly divided into four categories mainly as coagulation precipitation adsorption and ion exchange electrochemical technique and membrane process these techniques are being practiced on a commercial scale and yet there exists a gap of identifying an effective convenient safe and cheap method to implement widely coagulation and adsorption ion exchange processes are the most widely used fluoride removal techniques other sophisticated techniques such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and nanofiltration limit their applications due to high cost and high technical competence though they assure good quality water vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the efficiency of these sorbents differs depending on the surface area electrostatic nature and other physical parameters that affect the chemistry between the anions and the sorbents maximum fluoride adsorption occurs typically at a low range of ph and high temperature for the most part langmuir and freundlich isotherms fit well and follow first order kinetics co existing ions in the aqueous solutions do not usually affect the fluoride adsorption because of the strong affinity of electronegative fluoride with the other elements on the sorbents yadav et al 2019 2018 phytoremediation has shown keen interest amongst scientists towards an inexpensive and a sounder technique keeping in view the economic aspects of these other defluoridation strategies and the efficiency involved in remediating this pollutant there is a need to develop more sustainable remediation of fluorine from the environmental matrices the suitability to different climatic scenes and the mechanisms involved for the uptake of fluoride by pants are yet to further studied 3 1 phytoremediation the route for defluoridation strategies phytoremediation is an augmenting technology that employs plants to remove contaminants from the environment which has several advantages over other remediation techniques del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 karmakar et al 2018 phytoremediation is defined as the treatment of environmental pollutants using plants that alleviate the environmental problems without the need to excavate the contaminant material and dispose it off elsewhere the interest in phytoremediation has increased significantly with the identification of the plants ability to hyper accumulate the metals ghosh and singh 2005 several plant species have been identified which have tendencies to accumulate higher levels of pollutants in their tissues the technique of phytoremediation can be applied for both organic and inorganic pollutants present in the soil air and water in phytoremediation plants are used to absorb specific contaminants through a plant s root system into the body of the plant from the soil or water where they are stored and ultimately disposed of huang et al 2004 phytoremediation associates with phytoextraction mondal et al 2013 rhizofiltration phytostabilization boukhris et al 2015 and phytotransformation chatterjee et al 2018 mainly two characteristics are essential for the utilization of plants for phytoremediation i e functional phytoremediation capacity and high production of biomass marmiroli and mccutcheon 2003 3 2 plant as phyto monitoring agents of fluoride due to the sensitivity of plants to fluoride ions they can be used as biomonitors for fluoride pollution baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 the leaves of eucalyptus rostrata populus hybridus and different needle ages of pinus radiata were collected by rodriguez et al 2012 at different distances from the al smelter industry and the fluoride concentrations were analyzed due to the foliar characteristic such as mass and area as well as the higher capacity of retention on leaf surfaces e rostrata demonstrated the highest values of fluoride accumulation rodriguez et al 2012 data on the expression of symptoms on fluoride toxicity is correlated with fluoride analysis of e rostrata and p hybridus it emphasized the importance of the use of these plants as biomonitors for the atmospheric fluorides this usage will help to determine the source extent and the rate of the fluoride contamination baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 previous studies demonstrate the ability of plants to remove a variety of pollutants including antibiotics gujarathi et al 2005 metals ghosh and singh 2005 pilon smits and pilon 2002 pesticides henderson et al 2006 and aromatic compounds similarly constructed wetlands using aquatic plants have been successfully used to accumulate metals such as cr fe and pb senkondo et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 the appropriateness of using aquatic plants for phytoremediation has been investigated for several metals including lead nickel axtell et al 2003 antimony arsenic copper cadmium and zinc ha et al 2009 sakakibara et al 2011 the ability of the fluoride removal is a factor of plant sensitivity which is highly variable and depends on species timing level of exposure and duration of exposure davison and weinstein 1998 fluoride hyper accumulation is an essential process for obtaining successful results in phytoremediation plant to shoot contaminant uptake ratio also known as translocation factor plant to root uptake factor also known as bioaccumulation factor tolerance for maximum uptake of the contaminant that does not affect the biomass growth at the site cunningham and ow 1996 and ratio of contaminant concentration in plant shoot to soil enrichment factor lorestani et al 2011 are the main factors that requires consideration while choosing the right plant finding hyper accumulators is not an easy task that fulfills all the criteria mentioned above the plants that have a factor more significant than one for either bioconcentration translocation or enrichment are considered as hyper accumulators lorestani et al 2011 detailed knowledge on hyper accumulator plant species that can accumulate a considerable amount of fluorides is a rapidly growing need few of the major plant species capable of fluoride uptake through their root shoot system are represented in the table below table 1 the underlying pathways for fluoride uptake are depicted in fig 2 the mechanism of some plants that have high fluoride resistance is not well understood tolerant plants may have a better ability to deactivate fluorides preferably than the sensitive plants according to telesinki et al 2011 possible mechanisms for fluoride deactivation in plants may include uptake of fluorides through their insensitive metabolic pathways removal from sites of enzyme inhibition through reaction with organic components sequestration in vacuoles reaction with cations and translocation to the leaf surface telesinski et al 2011 some plants have the capability of exporting internal fluoride in leaves to the exterior leaf surface for instance clones of basket willow plant namely bjor and tora have the ability of toleration to fluorides at higher levels than jorr clone by detoxifying it at cellular level in the plant or by excluding fluoride at the roots baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 according to the study conducted by del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 camellia japonica pittosporum tobira and saccharum officinarum were able to remove fluoride up to considerable level del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 among them c japonika seedlings demonstrated a progressive uptake of fluoride until seventh day with 0 3 mg l 1 of fluoride removal p tobira culture demonstrated two fold efficiency than c japonika while s officinarum showed removal of fluoride up to 1 6 mg l 1 until the 21st day without indicating apparent saturation indicating that higher removal could be possible at longer exposure times s officinarum which is 20 cm tall was able to remove 40 of the 4 mg l 1 fluoride concentration present in the medium s officinarum is a plant that has one of the highest growth rates as a stem that can grow up to 4 5 m of height and a growth rate of 20 to 25 fold higher biomass in comparison with the other plants used in this study the removal of fluorides from the media happens due to activation of the detoxification processes it has been proposed that tolerant plants may deactivate or sequester fluoride by reaction of fluoride with calcium present in the cell wall which leads to forming insoluble caf2 fluoride concentration in many areas in the world including mexico díaz barriga et al 1997 kenya fawell et al 2006 india chatterjee et al 2018 and sri lanka is rarely exceeding the level of 5 mg l 1 therefore the use of s officinarum could be a viable plant in these countries to remove fluoride in water del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 urzúa abarca et al 2018 plants with a fibrous root system and higher biomass are known to be ideal for the remediation component of fluoride from water as well as the use of ornamental plants would be an aesthetically pleasant mode of phytoremediation nerium oleander portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were selected to estimate the efficiency of fluoride removal among these three species n oleander was found to be superior to other plants and showed the highest translocation and bioaccumulation factors which is mandatory for effective phytoremediation khandare et al 2017 sokolova et al 2019 according to gandhi et al 2016 anaerobic and laboratory conditions are a favorable and adept way to remove fluoride from aqueous solution by using germinated seeds of eleusine coracana pennistum glaucum and sorghum bicolor except setaria italica gandhi et al 2016 the percentage removal is inclined to increase the contact time with all the germinated seeds aside from the sample treated with germinated seeds of s italica it was found that the percentage removal of fluoride is accelerated with the increase of the amount of germinated seeds at three experimental conditions laboratory aerobic and anaerobic the maximum removal efficiency was found to be in p glaucum at all three different experimental conditions as 40 42 45 at laboratory anaerobic and aerobic conditions with 5 mg l 1 p glaucum seeds respectively boukhris et al 2015 mezghani et al 2005 found that olive trees could accumulate fluoride up to 300 μg g 1 dry weight by their leaves without exhibiting any fluoride toxicity symptoms while leaves of the apricot tree become necrotic with 65 300 μg g 1 dry weight mezghani et al 2005 synechococcus leopoliensis cyanobacteria have been isolated in both resistant and tolerant forms and found that the resistant cells demonstrate passive permeation to both fluoride ions and hydrogen fluoride across the membrane nichol et al 1987 yadav et al 2018 the ability of jebri variety of grapes to balance fluoride accumulation by aligned ca accumulation was studied by abdallah et al 2006 abdallah et al 2006 the study suggested that when fluoride trapped in the plants in the form of caf2 fluoride cannot disturb plant metabolism this finding affirms the non translocation of fluoride via phloem towards lower plant organs in chara fragilis can combine fluoride can chemically combine into insoluble caf2 at the deprivation of caco3 abdallah et al 2006 this sequestration and solubilization of fluoride play a significant role in detoxification studies conducted using aquatic plants confirmed the ability to use them for fluoride removal both spirodela polyrrhiza shirke and chandra 1991 singh et al 2016 and hydrilla verticulata sinha et al 2000 were found to have potential in remediation of fluorides in wastewater bioaccumulation of fluorides in submerged plants have been studied using myriophyllum spicatum and ceratophyllum demersum and demonstrated that elevated fluoride concentrations in water directly affected the fluoride content in the submerged plants pińskwar et al 2006 submerged polluted water plant parts accumulated 170 times more fluorides than the same plant part in unpolluted reservoir jezierska madziar and pinskwar 2003 liming and alum treatment are utilized as a flocculant to precipitate the fluoride present which thereby increases the alkalinity and the presence of iron complexes thus formed implementing phytoremediation and coagulant together could enhance the fluoride uptake and a much higher growth rate in an alkaline environment nowack et al 2006 wuana and okieimen 2011 kapenja et al 2017 investigated the combined effect of phytoremediation by amaranthus hybridus in combination with fe iii in defluoridation of water they found that fluoride removal efficiency increased from 3 to 40 at initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 with the fe iii combination as well as removal efficiency increased with increasing concentration of fe iii in fluoride contaminated water ally et al 2017 kapenja et al 2017 similar other studies have been obtained by the use iron fe3o4 nanoparticle to enhance the fluoride uptake by prosopis julifora and helianthus annus l they investigated the optimal fluoride concentration it can uphold the uptake up to 200 mg kg 1 of initial fluoride concentration is in co relation with the calcium uptake in soil and the more fluoride in the root and shoot system the more chlorophyll degradation occurs kumari and khan 2018a martínez fernández et al 2016 some of the plants have an inherent molecular mechanism to reduce the toxic effect of fluorides saini et al 2012 investigated the fluoride tolerance potential of prosopis juliflora this plant has the ability to accumulate available fluoride in the soil saini et al 2012 the observed bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor values were higher than one which indicated the high accumulation efficiency and tolerance for fluorides by p juliflora moreno et al 2003 studied on remediation of boron and fluoride contaminated sediments using chinese cabbage in the laboratory pot tests the growth rate of chinese cabbage was not affected by low fluoride concentration 15 mg l 1 and in the hydroponics tests fluoride content in both stems leaves and roots increased 3 10 times higher than the control moreno et al 2003 the ability of deciduous trees to reduce fluoride contamination was studied by wang cahill and fields 2007 and suggested that fluorides are mainly aggregated in leaf tissues in tulip poplar trees and emphasized the propensity of use of leaves in fall for fluoride phytoremediation kang et al 2008a b the potential of plants to minimize the leachate volume and reduce cyanide and fluoride contamination in groundwater had been studied using sycamore platanus sp green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica willow salix nigra yellow poplar liriodendron tulipifera and bald cypress taxodium distichum based on these results hybrid willow sycamore and black willow are the trees which have a higher potential to be used in reducing the leachate volume besides cyanide was degraded in the rhizosphere of the plants particularly bald cypress and hybrid willow whereas fluoride accumulated in the soil and plant tissues kang et al 2008a b as a practical aspect of utilizing plants as a phytoremediation strategy for fluoride uptake constructed wetland found its niche in this regard for the most part the north central province of sri lanka has high fluoride content in the water along with cadmium hardness and significantly high ionicity athapattu et al 2017a b built a constructed wetland to treat the rejected reverse osmosis water that is typically dumped into the environment these engineered constructed wetlands contained biochar tiles and soil as media along with hyper accumulative plants athapattu et al 2017a b vetiver grass and scirpus grossus reduced a considerable amount of fluoride 20 85 and met with the ambient water quality standards this is also accounted for the biochar contained in the wetland that also adsorbs other competing ions as k ca2 mg2 through chemisorption bhatnagar et al 2011 mukherjee and halder 2018 vetiver grass type is highly hyper accumulative and known for remediating trace metals especially for the uptake of cadmium the plant is biomass rich with c4 photosynthetic efficiency owing to a higher tolerance for extracting pollutants from contaminated sites they also have subtle deep and penetrating root systems which are ideal for purposes as in a wetland for remediating fluoride flow in the stream bandara and vithanage 2016 chen et al 2004 this bio geo constructed wetland is considered to be sustainable for effective removal of fluoride especially in the ckdu affected areas whose drinking water utilizes the ro plants athapattu et al 2017a b 3 3 phytotoxicity and concerns for fluoride uptake fluorides from the air in the form of hf and sif4 are considered as the most potent pollutant and are between 1 3 orders magnitude toxic than other common air pollutants hence release of a small amount of fluoride containing air pollution into the atmosphere leads to extensive damage to plant life singh et al 2018 weinstein and davison 2003 the damages in plants becomes easily visible in its leaf and border line necrosis fornasiero 2001 studied the phytotoxic effects in controlled conditions of hypericum perforatum plants where the tissues of the leaf becomes reddish brown and the chloroplast altered and also concluded the reduction in the anthocyanin contents as the major type of cell injury baroni fornasiero 2003 2001 among other studies proven in the literature explained the concentration of hf more than 1 μg l 1 or 0 8 mg m 3 for every 1 3 days with a long term threshold concentration can cause injuries to the most sensitive vegetation generally in plants fluorides occur in the range of 10 μg g 1 of dry weight of fluoride high concentrations of fluorides can cause various alterations in mineral composition in plant which are essential for physiological and biochemical reactions weinstein and davison 2004 when fluoride enters the plants through soil it causes various toxic effects on plants necrotic lesions chlorosis and burning first appearing in the leaf tips and margins are the general symptoms of fluoride injury gupta et al 2009 gupta and banerjeea 2009 fluoride initially damages the spongy mesophyll and lower epidermis following chloroplasts in the palisade cells depending on the content in the cell sap panda 2015 zouari et al 2017 jha et al 2009 studied the fluoride toxicity in allium cepa l and have found that when there is maximum loaded concentration of 800 mg naf kg 1 to the soil an adsorption capacity of 55 mg f kg 1 soil was obtained with burnt plant tip and finally death of the plant the study postulated that due to the partitioning of fluoride in the onion the order of the retention is found in the order roots shoot and then to the bulb thereby roots becoming the most accumulated sites for fluoride accumulation jha et al 2009 yu et al 2009 the ability of fluoride to transport across membranes through inhibition or stimulation of enzymes involved during glycolysis respiration photosynthesis has been shown by ram et al 2014 ram et al 2014 fluoride interferes with the metabolism of the plant and reduces the rate of cell expansion and cell division which inhabit the early seed development and germination karmakar et al 2016 ram et al 2014 at the same time fluoride intake leads to inappropriate seedling development and unbalanced nutrient uptake gadi et al 2016 thereafter root length shoot length dry weight vigor index chlorophyll content catalase activity tolerance index germination rate germination relative index and mean daily germination like physiological parameters are decreased with increasing fluoride concentration datta et al 2012 devika and nagendra 2011 gadi et al 2016 in a plant system ca2 plays a significant role as a crucial secondary messenger that participates in the multiple signaling cascades banerjee and roychoudhury 2019 fluoride intake alters the cell permeability by interacting with ca which present in the cell wall of the plant stevens et al 1998 which leads to reduce intercellular ca2 followed by the disrupt the abiotic stress responsive signaling process banerjee and roychoudhury 2019 further prolonged fluoride stress reduces the underlying physiological processes like reproductive capability and development 3 3 1 accumulation of fluorides by plants direct uptake via roots and airborne deposition are the major routes of entry of inorganic fluorides into terrestrial plants in plants fluoride uptake via stomata is momentous as compared to the adsorption from the soil weinstein and davison 2003 plants absorb fluorides through unidirectional distal movements which eventually accumulated in roots leaves and fruits devika and nagendra 2011 fluoride uptake by roots is a passive diffusion process from which most of the fluorides remain exchangeable from roots by mild washing processes the cell wall acts as the primary barrier to accumulate fluoride the calcium present in the cell wall acts as a buffer against fluoride accumulation and a difference intolerance of different plant species towards fluoride accumulation depends on ca present in the cell wall makehelwala et al 2019 msagati et al 2014 the mechanism of fluoride entering into the cell is not known up to now however it has been observed that chloride deficiency accelerates the uptake of fluorides as being a halide chloride channels may be mediated by the cellular uptake of fluorides miller et al 1986 most of the fluorides in roots are in cell walls and intercellular space little passes through the cell membrane plasmalemma or tonoplast promote extrusion of negatively charged fluoride ions due to low permeability of cell membrane to fluoride ions transportation of fluorides towards shoots is limited due to presence of endodermis which acts as an effective barrier to the vascular tissues therefore fluorides reach the vascular system via non selective routes that bypass the endodermis vithanage et al 2012a b according to stevens et al 1998 uptake of fluoride from the solution by the plant depends on species and ionic strength of the culture media stevens et al 1998 fluoride concentration in plants increases considerably after a threshold fluoride ion activity in the culture medium is achieved initial concentration the solubility of mineral phases such as ca and p content soil type fawell et al 2006 mohapatra et al 2009 soil reaction conover and poole 1972 are considered as main factors that influence uptake and accumulation of fluoride by plants the accumulation of fluoride in different parts of the plants comply with the trend of roots leaves fruits shoots higher transfer rate is found in leafy vegetation seed crops than fruiting and tuber vegetables gupta et al 2009 the study conducted by three semi arid plants namely acacia tottilis prospis juliflora and cassia fistula showed that an accumulation of fluoride is high in roots followed by leaves and stem the results indicated that the significant translocation of fluorides from roots into aerial parts of the plant baunthiyal and sharma 2012 helianthemum intricatum rhanterium suaveolens and atractylis serratuloids showed uptake of fluoride in leaves and much higher uptake in rosa agrestis and the leaves of oleo europaea due to the hair like structures in them with thick epicuticular waxes this uptake of fluoride is directly linked to the morphological trait in the flora as studies in tunisia boukhris et al 2015 mezghani et al 2005 table 1 most of the plants are able to uptake a minimum of 10 mg kg 1 of fluorides from the soil while some plants have exceptional properties to accumulate fluorides up to several hundred fluorides mg g 1 from the soil for instance camellia sinensis accumulate the extensive amount of fluoride in mature leaves from the soil of normal availabilities ruan et al 2003 singh et al 2018 however this mechanism is not well understood the fluorides in leaves increased linearly with the concentration of the solution or soil whereas those in roots and stem were mildly affected the fluorides uptakes by roots are mainly readily transported to the leaves in camellia sinensis fluoride accumulation in leaves occurs in the form of free anions or connection with aluminum calcium and magnesium weinstein and davison 2004 studies have revealed that the presence of fluoride and aluminum together in plant have a strong correlation compared to other elements their uptake and translocation are enhanced if both are present in the medium weinstein and alscher herman 1981 aquatic plants have a high propensity for accumulating soluble fluorides macroscopic species and bacteria when exposed to high concentrations of fluorides rarely showed toxic effects algae and cyanobacteria differ in their response to fluoride and cyanobacteria are more sensitive to fluoride toxicity bhatnagar and bhatnagar 2000 the absence of internal compartmentalization in prokaryotes brings all the constituents under direct attack once fluoride is inside the cell fluoride may interact with most cellular components and thus shows a multipronged effect on cell metabolism being a strong hydrogen bonding agent the threshold concentration of fluoride is firmly ph dependent at which toxicity manifested varies between algae and cyanobacteria bhatnagar and bhatnagar 2000 3 3 2 effect of fluoride uptake on plants 3 3 2 1 a chlorophyll carbohydrate and protein in plants the presence of fluoride in soil water or air exhibited the inhibitory effect on the pigments of leaves the pigment contents were found to be declined with the increasing initial concentration of fluoride fluoride accumulation in plants leads to retard the chlorophyll level of the plant leaves thereby reducing the carbohydrate synthesis khandare et al 2017 chlorophyll breakdown in leaves during the stress that caused due to fluoride accumulation or incorporation of δ aminolevulinic acid into pathways of chlorophyll synthesis pave the way to reduce the chlorophyll content saini et al 2013 the metabolism of amino acids and nitrogen significantly affects the plant when fluoride present as contaminants in the same study there was a correlation between nitrogen metabolism and fluoride stress among these hypersensitive plants lupinus luteus accumulated high amounts of total nitrogen in their shoots and thus they indulge in higher fluoride uptake by increasing protein synthesis banerjee and roychoudhury 2019 szostek and ciećko 2017 fluorides are also known as potent enzyme inhibitors which conclusively affect physiological processes such as carbohydrate metabolism miller 1993 therefore fluoride accumulation was able to reduce the conversion of sugars into carbohydrates asthir and singh 1995 according to khandare et al 2017 the chlorophyll level in n oleander portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were found to be reduced from 30 2 24 6 and 26 8 up to 28 3 10 6 and 16 2 μg ml 1 respectively after15 days exposure khandare et al 2017 similarly the carbohydrate levels nerium oleander portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were declined by 16 50 and 44 respectively the total protein in n oleander p oleracea and p crinitum were reduced by 15 53 and 38 however protein level reduction was not significant after15 days in n oleander leaves however after fluoride accumulation protein level reduction was noted in p oleracea and p crinitum reddy and kaur 2008 in another study significant chlorophyll reduction of leaves of pistum sativum oryza sativa and triticum aestivum was observed bhargava and bhardwaj 2010 gupta and banerjeea 2009 in accordance with the study conducted by shirke and chandra 1991 there was no effect of fluoride up to 25 mg l 1 on total chlorophyll in spirodela polyrhiza however the total chlorophyll degradation was observed by karmakar et al 2016 in eichhornia crassipes pistia stratiotes and spirodela polyrhiza at the 20 mg l 1 fluoride concentration this may be due to temperature difference of the two studies conducted and granulation of chloroplast enzymatic inhibition and loss of subcellular organization may be the referencing factors for pigment loss due to accumulation of fluoride in e crassipes p stratiotes and s polyrhiza karmakar et al 2016 reduction of the chlorophyll content in the leaves of h perforatum and c sinensis could be seen with the fluoride accumulation huang et al 2011 prolonged contact with this fluoride anion fluoride concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 was able to reduce the chlorophyll content up to 40 60 as it can directly involve in photosynthesis camarena rangel et al 2015 the total protein content in the plants was found to be declined with the increasing initial fluoride concentrations karmakar et al 2016 proline and cysteine like amino acids conserve the plant tissues from the damage caused by due to heavy metal or contaminant stress conditions generally they are generated from protein degradation bauddh and singh 2012 the stress caused due to intrusion of high fluoride levels induce the synthesis of free amino acids in higher plants and the amount of free amino acids in tissue depends on the storage protein degradation yang and miller 1963 the highest reduction was observed at 20 mg l 1 initial concentration in the leaves of e crassipes p stratiotes and s polyrhiza karmakar et al 2016 after 10 mm fluoride solution exposure sugar and starch content of amygdalis communis leaves were also found to be reduced by 75 and 85 respectively elloumi et al 2005 correspondingly paddy seedlings that were exposed to 10 ml 1 naf solution were found to demonstrate 30 reduction in sugar content after 15 days gupta et al 2009 gupta and banerjeea 2009 there are two known channels to which fluoride uptake takes place in plants anion channel and the apoplastic transport channel in anion channel the fluoride gets accumulated in leaf from the ambient air through the stomata that further undergoes a pressure within the cell wall baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 since these fluoride ions cannot commute easily through the lipid membranes and due to its polarization of proteins which now makes it viable for easy transport of ions in and out of the cell this creates a temporary depolarization of the membrane thereby blocking the fluoride ion outflow zhang et al 2016 a brief schematic diagram of the mechanism of uptake of fluoride from root to shoot system of plant from contaminated soil is depicted in fig 2 the apoplastic transport system is mostly more prevalent in the root system mainly due to the presence of positive charges on the cell wall the apolplastic transport system in stomata is also exemplified in fig 2 the entry of fluoride ions directly into the xylem phloem through the epidermis of the secondary roots and further bypasses the casparian strip singh et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 3 3 2 2 b plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress in addition to the adverse effect of fluoride on chlorophyll and total protein the mechanism of fluoride uptake needs to be further investigated to understand the factors contributing to plant stress the interaction pathways through which plants respond from biotic and abiotic stressors needs to be well established gassmann et al 2016 hendry et al 1987 chlorophyll as discussed earlier gets continuously synthesized and degraded at once and with the stressors metabolisms tend to shift from anabolism to catabolism and chlorophyll get degraded to a great extent chang et al 2019 gutbrod et al 2019 hendry et al 1987 the oxidative stress is an impending phenomenon after plant exposes to various abiotic stresses as well as antioxidant enzymes play a significant role in scavenging oxidative stress in plants kumar et al 2009 to examine the marker enzymes of the oxidative stress the roots and leaves of the plants are tested generally before and after fluoride removal karmakar et al 2016 the activities of catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gpx in the roots of the portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were observed to be at a high level however on the other hand n oleander roots showed lowered expression in the activities of cat sod and gpx of 77 153 and 71 respectively after inductions karmakar et al 2016 loganathan et al 2013 however n oleander revealed that sod cat and gpx to be induced by 280 242 and 243 consequently this might be due to superior translocation of fluoride exhibited by n oleander c sinensis and mulberry cultivars were also demonstrated significant inflated levels in sod and cat on fluoride exposure kumar et al 2009 according to saini et al 2013 cat and peroxidase activities in p juliflora were found to be increased by 3 2 and 2 7 folds respectively in karmakar et al 2015 gpx and cat activities were studied and the maximum were achieved at 20 mg l 1 initial concentration of fluoride in the leaves of eichhornia crassipes pistia stratiotes and s polyrhiza karmakar et al 2016 saini et al 2013 4 merits and demerits of phytoremediation phytoremediation is a technique that is relatively easy to implement as it does not require expensive equipment or highly specialized personnel gandhi et al 2016 the cost of other conventional remediation method for fluoride remediation from water may vary between the us 10 us 1000 m 3 whereas the cost for the use of phytoremediation may cost as low as us 0 05 m 3 marmiroli and mccutcheon 2003 a variety of organic and inorganic compounds can be successfully removed from phytoremediation technique it can be used either as an in situ or ex situ application safari sinegani and dastjerdi 2008 the use of in situ application is widespread and reliable because it minimizes the disturbance of the soil and the surrounding environment leading to reduction in the spread of contamination through air or waterborne wastes gandhi et al 2016 disposal sites are not required in the case of phytoremediation and public acceptance is high as it is more aesthetically pleasing and avoids excavation and transport of polluted media hence reducing the risk of spreading the contamination it has the potential to treat sites that are polluted not only with fluoride but also with more than one type of pollutant the distribution of contaminants to air and water is decreased by preventing leaching and soil erosion that may result from water activity and wind ghosh and singh 2005 when properly implemented it is considered as a green technology which is applicable for different organic and inorganic pollutants thus attempts on remediation of fluoride contaminated water by phytoremediation method requires stringent policy strengthening and advocating the need for such a holistic approach with the vital notion of safe disposal mechanism for the so contaminated biomasses are soundly addressed this could otherwise accomplish a whole sets of national policy of eco friendly development and create scientific social economic improvements among scientists environmentalists and agriculturists who gets involved in the application of phytoremediation technique and strengthens the applicability for fluoride uptake by such hyperaccumulators gandhi et al 2016 kumari and khan 2018b plant tolerance to fluoride uptake is the essential requisite for phytoremediation and most of the time it is the invasive species that are great in phytoremediation if the invasive plants are utilized viably it can profusely control their abundance most of the water hyacinth attracts special attention to taking up fluoride which is otherwise treated as a non destructible weed eichornia crassipes water hyacinth have the ability to uptake both inorganic and organic pollutants and very resilient to drastic climatic conditions however time is the most severe limitation of phytoremediation it is a lengthy process which may take several years or longer to clean up hazardous waste sites rajakaruna et al 2006 in most situations phytoremediation is confined to the rooting depth of the plants used for the studies gandhi et al 2016 vegetation conservation in intensively contaminated areas is convoluted and human health can be impacted by the entry of pollutants into the food chain through animal feeding on the contaminated plants vidali 2001 it can affect biodiversity if invasive and non native species are used for the process harvested plant biomass produced from the phytoextraction may be classified as a hazardous waste under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra which leads to raising a problem in consumption of contaminated plants by wildlife and subject to proper handling and disposal gandhi et al 2016 unfavorable climate may limit the growth of plants and mass production thus reducing the efficiency of process safari sinegani and dastjerdi 2008 5 conclusive remarks and future perspectives being one of the most abundant elements with about 0 3 g kg 1 of the earth s crust fluoride has the ability to enter into the environment through natural processes which has accelerated due to anthropogenic activities at present while attaining a detrimental impact to living non living environment and their interactions fig 1 many defluoridation techniques have been explored since 1930 s applications of these techniques in the developing nations will have their limitations and thus necessitates a low cost measure among the other existing membrane processes reverse osmosis or adsorptive measures defluoridation requires high cost and skilled operations and consistent maintenance however a detailed understanding of the plants that can perform in phytoremediation for fluoride uptake in significant amounts from the environment and yet perform at the least toxicity safe and much cheaper is an approach to be considered for a long term strategy within the last few decades the need for the phytoremediation has increased and minimal studies have been conducted on bioremediation of fluorides water and soil have become an intense area of study as plant based phytoremediation comes into the research arena to improve quality biotechnological improvements of plants to increase phytoremediation will be an option which may need future attention a detailed study on the hyper accumulators of fluoride would be a safe secure and cost effective method towards removing fluorides from soil and water by virtue of identifying the diverse groups of terrestrial and aquatic plants so far which have the ability to accumulate fluoride thousands of times more uptake than their origin can be employed successfully for fluoride remediation acknowledgements grant icrp nsf nsfc 2019 bs 01 by the

12183,fluoride contamination is a global environmental interrogation due to consideration of its long term persistence in air soil and water even at lower levels long term exposure can exert negative impacts on all communities irrespective of the concentrations therefore immediate attention is needed to remediate the negative impacts of fluoride on the environment various conventional and modern techniques have been developed to remove fluoride from groundwater mainly due to its high prevalence due to limitations such as high cost labor intensity regeneration need and low removal capacity many existing techniques are not practical for remediating fluoride in water at the same time less advertence has been raised for phytoremediation as an effective and environmentally friendly method this review presents the utilization of potential plants for removing fluoride from environmental matrices discusses the fluoride translocation mechanisms and its phytotoxicity in plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords phytoremediation bioavailability translocation uptake accumulation outline 1 introduction fluoride contamination in the environment has been recognized as one of the significant groundwater quality issues for a long time being the 13th most abundant elements found in the earth s crust fluoride is found in different environmental matrices that adversely affect their physiological and biochemical parameters singh et al 2018 vithanage et al 2012b vithanage et al 2014 fluorine is the most reactive and electronegative element in the periodic table and primarily occurs as the negative fluoride ion in the environment in the earth s crust many rocks and minerals contain fluorides and have the ability to leach out by natural weathering and precipitation loganathan et al 2013 vithanage et al 2014 it increases the availability of fluoride in the environment which leads to its entry into the food chain fawell et al 2006 in addition to this fluoride can enter into the environment from the wastewaters generated from industrial activities such as steel glass semiconductors aluminum electronics fertilizer and insecticide production processes kimambo et al 2019 these industrial effluents and the sewage discharged from the domestic water supplies enhanced with fluoride lead to increase in the fluoride levels in aquatic environment volcanic activities and coal combustion contribute to the emission of fluoride rich dust and gasses to the atmosphere as well which are further sources of fluoride leaching into the environment through airborne sources fawell et al 2006 although fluoride is considered an essential element for human well being and in regards to the safe limits as stated earlier excessive doses may cause adverse health effects fluorosis has been reported from south asian african middle east north central and south american and european regions fawell et al 2006 which has been reported to have detrimental effects on human wellbeing it was estimated that 56 2 million people were stricken by fluorosis in india and it was prevalent in 19 states out of 32 jagtap et al 2012 ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a up to date research emphasis has been addressed more on the hazardous effects of fluoride on the human and animal population however lack of attention has been given on its ecological impact and the cost effective ways to deliver safe drinking water with optimal fluoride levels is the need of the hour hence there is a critical need to develop sustainable technology or process to remove or detoxify fluoride from the environment general defluoridation techniques involve precipitation ion exchange adsorption electrocoagulation and membrane processes chatterjee et al 2018 ravulapalli and kunta 2017 however application of these processes are limited to the high cost and high maintenance that they demand mohapatra et al 2009 premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 phytoremediation a green technology for water quality improvements has been intensively studied during the last few decades due to its cost effectiveness environmentally friendly natural clean up process as well as the ability to detoxify the contaminants significantly several plant species have been identified to be utilized for accumulating these contaminants in their tissues especially when it comes to the uptake of trace metals the understanding of their uptake translocation through the root and shoot system is limited and the stress factors it can withstand without compromising the growth of the plant requires detailed attention thus the study of plant and soil interactions in the context of fluoride accumulation is crucial in this review an attempt was made to implicate the use of plants for contaminant mitigation of fluoride and elucidate the fluoride uptake and translocation mechanisms of plants phytotoxicity and phytoremediation of fluoride as an ecofriendly alternative 2 fluoride occurrences and sources 2 1 global distribution of fluoride geographical location is the primary factor that decides the fluoride content in the water vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the water and the rock interactions geothermal springs tectonic processes and volcanic activities are the primary routes for fluoride plumes into the groundwater as depicted in fig 1 chowdhury et al 2019 in groundwater high fluoride concentrations varying between 1 and 48 mg l 1 are found in many parts of asia africa china india ghana kenya sri lanka along with rift valley countries in africa and usa when establishing the fluoride intake limits the two essential factors to be considered are the quantity of water intake and intake from diets for instance in arid regions the fluoride consumption is higher than the temperate regions due to the higher concentrations of fluoride at arid conditions indicating that the fluoride limit for fluorosis should be lower especially for the humid tropics escoto et al 2019 kumar yadav et al 2018 lópez guzmán et al 2019 makehelwala et al 2019 yadav et al 2018 in the asian region out of 85 million tons of fluoride deposits on the earth crust 12 million tons are found in india teotia and teotia 1994 fluoride contamination of groundwater in india has been a severe problem which is due to the evaporation of groundwater with residual alkalinity jacks et al 2005 according to kumar et al 2016 et al about 50 of the groundwater in delhi exceeds the maximum permissible level of fluoride in drinking water datta et al 1996 dehghani et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 due to the presence of inherent fluoride rich granite rocks the groundwater fluoride concentration in andhra pradesh india is at a high risk level of exposure the rocks in southern india are rich with fluoride which forms the principal reason for fluoride contamination in groundwater rao et al 1993 singh et al 2018 in deeper aquifers of maharashtra fluoride content is higher than shallow groundwater due to long term residence time along the shallow groundwater levels madhnure et al 2007 furthermore the deposition of soil dust paves the way to reported high level of fluoride level in two sites in uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh in india singh et al 2016 in sri lanka it was reported that the high fluoride areas are located within the lowland plains due to longer contact time with the geological sites was longer in plains and slow groundwater movement compared to highlands premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 fluoride bearing minerals such as hornblende mica and appetite are in abundance in all of the three major lithotectonic units of the country viz the highland the wanni and the vijayan complex under humid tropical climate the weathering of the mineral rocks occurs and fluoride gets easily leached into the groundwater which is the primary source of drinking water in these arid regions the seasonal rainfalls evaporation and mineralogical compositions of these aquifers significantly control the composition of groundwater causing an excess or deficiency of crucial elements in drinking water chandrajith et al 2012 ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a there are several known instances for the link between the geochemistry and climate in these regions and a consistent trend of human diseases in the vicinity in the dry zone of sri lanka chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu is one of the most common health problems among the farming communities the disease is geographically constrained to the dry zones of the county and is manifested directly in paddy farmers in the age groups of 30 60 years the presence of high levels of fluoride and hardness was reported from water in the ckdu prevalent areas premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 lada sokolova et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 this adds up to the potential toxicology link referred to the intake of fluoride from these drinking water sources the fluoride level in groundwater has not changed even after two decades in some areas of north central part of sri lanka which are higher than 4 mg l 1 in groundwater young et al 2011 to add further around two million people are at risk of being exposed to high fluoride levels in east punjab pakistan due to fertilizer containing leachable fluoride and coal containing fluoride farooqi et al 2007 this accounts for generations of human settlements being exposed to fluoride consuming drinking water exaggerated fluoride in drinking water has been reported from many parts of china gao et al 2007 zhu et al 2007 a salty lake water intrusion has been reported in yuncheng basin china as the source of high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater interaction between a recharge area and fluoride containing minerals was the source of high fluoride in taiyuan basin china high fluoride concentration has resulted in the discharge area of the same basin as well due to evaporation and mixing of karst water gao et al 2007 oversaturation of fluoride in groundwater of mizunami japan has been reported due to weathering and alteration of granite rocks abdelgawad et al 2009 ash from the volcanic explosion of sakurajima volcano japan was found to contain average fluoride concentration of 788 mg l 1 for 12 years nogami et al 2006 evaporation leads to an incensement in the fluoride level in the natural waters of kenya where fluoride concentration was more significantly higher in lake water than groundwater and springs gaciri and davies 1993 the area surrounding the east african rift system and tanzania volcanic activity resulted in increasing the fluoride concentration in waters many of the lakes in these areas have fluoride concentration reaching up to 1640 and 2800 mg l 1 ipcs fluorides 2002 phosphate industry waste disposal sites in poland have reported fluoride concentration of about 8 mg l 1 czarnowski et al 1996 due to silurian ordovician aquifer system in western estonia the fluoride concentration was reported naturally at about 7 mg l 1 indermitte et al 2009 2 2 sources of high fluoride in the environment fluoride can enter into the environment through both natural and anthropogenic activities naturally fluoride is an accomplice with many mineral deposits containing fluoride bearing minerals such as sellaite villianmite flourite cryolite bastnaesite and fluoroapatite which occur in most rocks and sediments chae et al 2007 2006 saxena and ahmed 2003 and can release into the environment through weathering dissolution and other pedogenic processes syenites granites quartz monzonites felsic and biotite gneisses are considered as the highest fluoride containing rocks kimambo et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 mukherjee and halder 2018 polonskij and polonskaya 2013 ideally when rocks containing these fluoride minerals get exposed through weather agents as in water alteration of rocks occurs through a series of geochemical reactions whose fluorine gets leached into the water as in depicted in fig 1 hydrothermal vein deposits contain fluorite fluoro apatite fluoride rich micas and amphiboles ali et al 2019 dolejs and baker 2007 wall rock interactions are considered as the leading process on fluoride release into the groundwater abdelgawad et al 2009 abdelgawad et al 2009 and fluorides mainly originate via hydroxy positions in biotite and hornblende which is concentrated through evaporation resulting residual alkalinity therefore a high level of groundwater concentrations of fluorides is mainly reported in dry parts of the world jacks et al 2005 mukherjee and halder 2018 fluoride concentration is positively correlated with hco3 and na content as high fluoride groundwater typically has high ph values gao et al 2007 further alkaline condition moderate specific conductivity and their ratios are considered as the significant factors that govern the fluoride dissolution from rocks saxena and ahmed 2003 2001 due to alkaline nature of groundwater due to the presence of hco3 and na it has relatively high hydroxyl ions accordingly the oh can be replaced by fluoride of the fluoride bearing minerals leading to boost the fluoride content in groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 despite the exceptional situations that have anthropogenic inputs such as phosphate fertilizers sewage sludge and industrial pollution fluoride content in soil ranges from 200 to 300 mg kg 1 generally edmunds and smedley 2005 who 2002 since fluoride naturally has a strong association with soil factors influencing the release of fluorides from the soil are chemical speciation soil chemistry and climate the aluminum and iron in soils form complexes with the fluoride at acidic ph and the adsorption onto soil is significantly high who 2002 the application of fertilizers makes the soil alkaline and leads to an increased fluoride release from soil to the groundwater sources of fluoride in soil and groundwater include volcanic ash hydrothermal sources wet and dry deposition of gaseous particulate fluorides phosphate fertilizers insecticides fumigants rodenticides and herbicides datta et al 2012 marine aerosols volcanic gas emissions and airborne soil dust are considered as natural atmospheric sources of fluoride tavener and clark 2006 high solubility in volcanic ash may cause to increase the groundwater fluoride content indirectly primary anthropogenic sources of fluorides are aerosols from brickwork phosphate fertilizers iron and steel production ceramic industries and aluminum smelters bonvicini et al 2006 walna et al 2007 further hydrothermal vein deposits contain fluorite fluoro apatite fluoride rich micas and amphiboles dolejs and baker 2007 2 3 problems related to fluoride contamination fluoride abundant drinking water is a boundless problem which can be seen all over the world as the presence of fluoride in water does not indicate any color odor or taste and it acts as an invisible poison in groundwater exaggerated exposure to fluoride paves the way to diseases that can cause calcification of ligament and mottling of teeth skeletal and dental fluorosis fawell et al 2006 developmental issues in children decreased cognitive ability cancer and crippling bone deformities may demonstrate the long term ingestion of fluoride rich drinking water dolejš and baker 2007 osteosarcoma bone cancer in human males is mainly associated with fluorinated water which is the third common cancer in children with a death rate of about 50 and most survivors lose limbs to amputation bassin et al 2006 as reported earlier chronic kidney disease has become the most widely spread disease in some parts of the dry zones of sri lanka and fluoride has been proven to be a contributory factor in spreading the etiology of chronic diseases ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a studies have shown the possible relationship between the fluoride levels in drinking water and the damage it has on the kidney the detrimental indices for analyzing kidney functions were carefully studied upon viz the content of creatine in urine and the activities of the lysosomal enzyme and its co relation with water fluoride levels dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 xiong et al 2007 this necessitates further the measures to be taken for safe provision of potable water for the prevention of this particular disease among the dry zones of sri lanka the fluoride and the total dissolved solids that contribute to forming complexes with the hard water needs to be pre treated using reverse osmosis and currently are remediated in these arid areas lee et al 2009 makehelwala et al 2019 to add further fluoride dosage in drinking water is dependent on the climatic conditions of the region thus it is suggested to drop the recommended fluoride level to 0 6 0 8 mg l 1 from the existing limit in tropical countries with an average temperature of 31 24 c ranasinghe et al 2019b 2019a the climatic conditions and high intake of water are co dependent and need to be considered for setting up a standard level for drinking water 3 defluoridation the defluoridation techniques can be broadly divided into four categories mainly as coagulation precipitation adsorption and ion exchange electrochemical technique and membrane process these techniques are being practiced on a commercial scale and yet there exists a gap of identifying an effective convenient safe and cheap method to implement widely coagulation and adsorption ion exchange processes are the most widely used fluoride removal techniques other sophisticated techniques such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and nanofiltration limit their applications due to high cost and high technical competence though they assure good quality water vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the efficiency of these sorbents differs depending on the surface area electrostatic nature and other physical parameters that affect the chemistry between the anions and the sorbents maximum fluoride adsorption occurs typically at a low range of ph and high temperature for the most part langmuir and freundlich isotherms fit well and follow first order kinetics co existing ions in the aqueous solutions do not usually affect the fluoride adsorption because of the strong affinity of electronegative fluoride with the other elements on the sorbents yadav et al 2019 2018 phytoremediation has shown keen interest amongst scientists towards an inexpensive and a sounder technique keeping in view the economic aspects of these other defluoridation strategies and the efficiency involved in remediating this pollutant there is a need to develop more sustainable remediation of fluorine from the environmental matrices the suitability to different climatic scenes and the mechanisms involved for the uptake of fluoride by pants are yet to further studied 3 1 phytoremediation the route for defluoridation strategies phytoremediation is an augmenting technology that employs plants to remove contaminants from the environment which has several advantages over other remediation techniques del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 karmakar et al 2018 phytoremediation is defined as the treatment of environmental pollutants using plants that alleviate the environmental problems without the need to excavate the contaminant material and dispose it off elsewhere the interest in phytoremediation has increased significantly with the identification of the plants ability to hyper accumulate the metals ghosh and singh 2005 several plant species have been identified which have tendencies to accumulate higher levels of pollutants in their tissues the technique of phytoremediation can be applied for both organic and inorganic pollutants present in the soil air and water in phytoremediation plants are used to absorb specific contaminants through a plant s root system into the body of the plant from the soil or water where they are stored and ultimately disposed of huang et al 2004 phytoremediation associates with phytoextraction mondal et al 2013 rhizofiltration phytostabilization boukhris et al 2015 and phytotransformation chatterjee et al 2018 mainly two characteristics are essential for the utilization of plants for phytoremediation i e functional phytoremediation capacity and high production of biomass marmiroli and mccutcheon 2003 3 2 plant as phyto monitoring agents of fluoride due to the sensitivity of plants to fluoride ions they can be used as biomonitors for fluoride pollution baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 the leaves of eucalyptus rostrata populus hybridus and different needle ages of pinus radiata were collected by rodriguez et al 2012 at different distances from the al smelter industry and the fluoride concentrations were analyzed due to the foliar characteristic such as mass and area as well as the higher capacity of retention on leaf surfaces e rostrata demonstrated the highest values of fluoride accumulation rodriguez et al 2012 data on the expression of symptoms on fluoride toxicity is correlated with fluoride analysis of e rostrata and p hybridus it emphasized the importance of the use of these plants as biomonitors for the atmospheric fluorides this usage will help to determine the source extent and the rate of the fluoride contamination baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 previous studies demonstrate the ability of plants to remove a variety of pollutants including antibiotics gujarathi et al 2005 metals ghosh and singh 2005 pilon smits and pilon 2002 pesticides henderson et al 2006 and aromatic compounds similarly constructed wetlands using aquatic plants have been successfully used to accumulate metals such as cr fe and pb senkondo et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 the appropriateness of using aquatic plants for phytoremediation has been investigated for several metals including lead nickel axtell et al 2003 antimony arsenic copper cadmium and zinc ha et al 2009 sakakibara et al 2011 the ability of the fluoride removal is a factor of plant sensitivity which is highly variable and depends on species timing level of exposure and duration of exposure davison and weinstein 1998 fluoride hyper accumulation is an essential process for obtaining successful results in phytoremediation plant to shoot contaminant uptake ratio also known as translocation factor plant to root uptake factor also known as bioaccumulation factor tolerance for maximum uptake of the contaminant that does not affect the biomass growth at the site cunningham and ow 1996 and ratio of contaminant concentration in plant shoot to soil enrichment factor lorestani et al 2011 are the main factors that requires consideration while choosing the right plant finding hyper accumulators is not an easy task that fulfills all the criteria mentioned above the plants that have a factor more significant than one for either bioconcentration translocation or enrichment are considered as hyper accumulators lorestani et al 2011 detailed knowledge on hyper accumulator plant species that can accumulate a considerable amount of fluorides is a rapidly growing need few of the major plant species capable of fluoride uptake through their root shoot system are represented in the table below table 1 the underlying pathways for fluoride uptake are depicted in fig 2 the mechanism of some plants that have high fluoride resistance is not well understood tolerant plants may have a better ability to deactivate fluorides preferably than the sensitive plants according to telesinki et al 2011 possible mechanisms for fluoride deactivation in plants may include uptake of fluorides through their insensitive metabolic pathways removal from sites of enzyme inhibition through reaction with organic components sequestration in vacuoles reaction with cations and translocation to the leaf surface telesinski et al 2011 some plants have the capability of exporting internal fluoride in leaves to the exterior leaf surface for instance clones of basket willow plant namely bjor and tora have the ability of toleration to fluorides at higher levels than jorr clone by detoxifying it at cellular level in the plant or by excluding fluoride at the roots baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 according to the study conducted by del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 camellia japonica pittosporum tobira and saccharum officinarum were able to remove fluoride up to considerable level del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 among them c japonika seedlings demonstrated a progressive uptake of fluoride until seventh day with 0 3 mg l 1 of fluoride removal p tobira culture demonstrated two fold efficiency than c japonika while s officinarum showed removal of fluoride up to 1 6 mg l 1 until the 21st day without indicating apparent saturation indicating that higher removal could be possible at longer exposure times s officinarum which is 20 cm tall was able to remove 40 of the 4 mg l 1 fluoride concentration present in the medium s officinarum is a plant that has one of the highest growth rates as a stem that can grow up to 4 5 m of height and a growth rate of 20 to 25 fold higher biomass in comparison with the other plants used in this study the removal of fluorides from the media happens due to activation of the detoxification processes it has been proposed that tolerant plants may deactivate or sequester fluoride by reaction of fluoride with calcium present in the cell wall which leads to forming insoluble caf2 fluoride concentration in many areas in the world including mexico díaz barriga et al 1997 kenya fawell et al 2006 india chatterjee et al 2018 and sri lanka is rarely exceeding the level of 5 mg l 1 therefore the use of s officinarum could be a viable plant in these countries to remove fluoride in water del socorro santos díaz and zamora pedraza 2010 urzúa abarca et al 2018 plants with a fibrous root system and higher biomass are known to be ideal for the remediation component of fluoride from water as well as the use of ornamental plants would be an aesthetically pleasant mode of phytoremediation nerium oleander portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were selected to estimate the efficiency of fluoride removal among these three species n oleander was found to be superior to other plants and showed the highest translocation and bioaccumulation factors which is mandatory for effective phytoremediation khandare et al 2017 sokolova et al 2019 according to gandhi et al 2016 anaerobic and laboratory conditions are a favorable and adept way to remove fluoride from aqueous solution by using germinated seeds of eleusine coracana pennistum glaucum and sorghum bicolor except setaria italica gandhi et al 2016 the percentage removal is inclined to increase the contact time with all the germinated seeds aside from the sample treated with germinated seeds of s italica it was found that the percentage removal of fluoride is accelerated with the increase of the amount of germinated seeds at three experimental conditions laboratory aerobic and anaerobic the maximum removal efficiency was found to be in p glaucum at all three different experimental conditions as 40 42 45 at laboratory anaerobic and aerobic conditions with 5 mg l 1 p glaucum seeds respectively boukhris et al 2015 mezghani et al 2005 found that olive trees could accumulate fluoride up to 300 μg g 1 dry weight by their leaves without exhibiting any fluoride toxicity symptoms while leaves of the apricot tree become necrotic with 65 300 μg g 1 dry weight mezghani et al 2005 synechococcus leopoliensis cyanobacteria have been isolated in both resistant and tolerant forms and found that the resistant cells demonstrate passive permeation to both fluoride ions and hydrogen fluoride across the membrane nichol et al 1987 yadav et al 2018 the ability of jebri variety of grapes to balance fluoride accumulation by aligned ca accumulation was studied by abdallah et al 2006 abdallah et al 2006 the study suggested that when fluoride trapped in the plants in the form of caf2 fluoride cannot disturb plant metabolism this finding affirms the non translocation of fluoride via phloem towards lower plant organs in chara fragilis can combine fluoride can chemically combine into insoluble caf2 at the deprivation of caco3 abdallah et al 2006 this sequestration and solubilization of fluoride play a significant role in detoxification studies conducted using aquatic plants confirmed the ability to use them for fluoride removal both spirodela polyrrhiza shirke and chandra 1991 singh et al 2016 and hydrilla verticulata sinha et al 2000 were found to have potential in remediation of fluorides in wastewater bioaccumulation of fluorides in submerged plants have been studied using myriophyllum spicatum and ceratophyllum demersum and demonstrated that elevated fluoride concentrations in water directly affected the fluoride content in the submerged plants pińskwar et al 2006 submerged polluted water plant parts accumulated 170 times more fluorides than the same plant part in unpolluted reservoir jezierska madziar and pinskwar 2003 liming and alum treatment are utilized as a flocculant to precipitate the fluoride present which thereby increases the alkalinity and the presence of iron complexes thus formed implementing phytoremediation and coagulant together could enhance the fluoride uptake and a much higher growth rate in an alkaline environment nowack et al 2006 wuana and okieimen 2011 kapenja et al 2017 investigated the combined effect of phytoremediation by amaranthus hybridus in combination with fe iii in defluoridation of water they found that fluoride removal efficiency increased from 3 to 40 at initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 with the fe iii combination as well as removal efficiency increased with increasing concentration of fe iii in fluoride contaminated water ally et al 2017 kapenja et al 2017 similar other studies have been obtained by the use iron fe3o4 nanoparticle to enhance the fluoride uptake by prosopis julifora and helianthus annus l they investigated the optimal fluoride concentration it can uphold the uptake up to 200 mg kg 1 of initial fluoride concentration is in co relation with the calcium uptake in soil and the more fluoride in the root and shoot system the more chlorophyll degradation occurs kumari and khan 2018a martínez fernández et al 2016 some of the plants have an inherent molecular mechanism to reduce the toxic effect of fluorides saini et al 2012 investigated the fluoride tolerance potential of prosopis juliflora this plant has the ability to accumulate available fluoride in the soil saini et al 2012 the observed bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor values were higher than one which indicated the high accumulation efficiency and tolerance for fluorides by p juliflora moreno et al 2003 studied on remediation of boron and fluoride contaminated sediments using chinese cabbage in the laboratory pot tests the growth rate of chinese cabbage was not affected by low fluoride concentration 15 mg l 1 and in the hydroponics tests fluoride content in both stems leaves and roots increased 3 10 times higher than the control moreno et al 2003 the ability of deciduous trees to reduce fluoride contamination was studied by wang cahill and fields 2007 and suggested that fluorides are mainly aggregated in leaf tissues in tulip poplar trees and emphasized the propensity of use of leaves in fall for fluoride phytoremediation kang et al 2008a b the potential of plants to minimize the leachate volume and reduce cyanide and fluoride contamination in groundwater had been studied using sycamore platanus sp green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica willow salix nigra yellow poplar liriodendron tulipifera and bald cypress taxodium distichum based on these results hybrid willow sycamore and black willow are the trees which have a higher potential to be used in reducing the leachate volume besides cyanide was degraded in the rhizosphere of the plants particularly bald cypress and hybrid willow whereas fluoride accumulated in the soil and plant tissues kang et al 2008a b as a practical aspect of utilizing plants as a phytoremediation strategy for fluoride uptake constructed wetland found its niche in this regard for the most part the north central province of sri lanka has high fluoride content in the water along with cadmium hardness and significantly high ionicity athapattu et al 2017a b built a constructed wetland to treat the rejected reverse osmosis water that is typically dumped into the environment these engineered constructed wetlands contained biochar tiles and soil as media along with hyper accumulative plants athapattu et al 2017a b vetiver grass and scirpus grossus reduced a considerable amount of fluoride 20 85 and met with the ambient water quality standards this is also accounted for the biochar contained in the wetland that also adsorbs other competing ions as k ca2 mg2 through chemisorption bhatnagar et al 2011 mukherjee and halder 2018 vetiver grass type is highly hyper accumulative and known for remediating trace metals especially for the uptake of cadmium the plant is biomass rich with c4 photosynthetic efficiency owing to a higher tolerance for extracting pollutants from contaminated sites they also have subtle deep and penetrating root systems which are ideal for purposes as in a wetland for remediating fluoride flow in the stream bandara and vithanage 2016 chen et al 2004 this bio geo constructed wetland is considered to be sustainable for effective removal of fluoride especially in the ckdu affected areas whose drinking water utilizes the ro plants athapattu et al 2017a b 3 3 phytotoxicity and concerns for fluoride uptake fluorides from the air in the form of hf and sif4 are considered as the most potent pollutant and are between 1 3 orders magnitude toxic than other common air pollutants hence release of a small amount of fluoride containing air pollution into the atmosphere leads to extensive damage to plant life singh et al 2018 weinstein and davison 2003 the damages in plants becomes easily visible in its leaf and border line necrosis fornasiero 2001 studied the phytotoxic effects in controlled conditions of hypericum perforatum plants where the tissues of the leaf becomes reddish brown and the chloroplast altered and also concluded the reduction in the anthocyanin contents as the major type of cell injury baroni fornasiero 2003 2001 among other studies proven in the literature explained the concentration of hf more than 1 μg l 1 or 0 8 mg m 3 for every 1 3 days with a long term threshold concentration can cause injuries to the most sensitive vegetation generally in plants fluorides occur in the range of 10 μg g 1 of dry weight of fluoride high concentrations of fluorides can cause various alterations in mineral composition in plant which are essential for physiological and biochemical reactions weinstein and davison 2004 when fluoride enters the plants through soil it causes various toxic effects on plants necrotic lesions chlorosis and burning first appearing in the leaf tips and margins are the general symptoms of fluoride injury gupta et al 2009 gupta and banerjeea 2009 fluoride initially damages the spongy mesophyll and lower epidermis following chloroplasts in the palisade cells depending on the content in the cell sap panda 2015 zouari et al 2017 jha et al 2009 studied the fluoride toxicity in allium cepa l and have found that when there is maximum loaded concentration of 800 mg naf kg 1 to the soil an adsorption capacity of 55 mg f kg 1 soil was obtained with burnt plant tip and finally death of the plant the study postulated that due to the partitioning of fluoride in the onion the order of the retention is found in the order roots shoot and then to the bulb thereby roots becoming the most accumulated sites for fluoride accumulation jha et al 2009 yu et al 2009 the ability of fluoride to transport across membranes through inhibition or stimulation of enzymes involved during glycolysis respiration photosynthesis has been shown by ram et al 2014 ram et al 2014 fluoride interferes with the metabolism of the plant and reduces the rate of cell expansion and cell division which inhabit the early seed development and germination karmakar et al 2016 ram et al 2014 at the same time fluoride intake leads to inappropriate seedling development and unbalanced nutrient uptake gadi et al 2016 thereafter root length shoot length dry weight vigor index chlorophyll content catalase activity tolerance index germination rate germination relative index and mean daily germination like physiological parameters are decreased with increasing fluoride concentration datta et al 2012 devika and nagendra 2011 gadi et al 2016 in a plant system ca2 plays a significant role as a crucial secondary messenger that participates in the multiple signaling cascades banerjee and roychoudhury 2019 fluoride intake alters the cell permeability by interacting with ca which present in the cell wall of the plant stevens et al 1998 which leads to reduce intercellular ca2 followed by the disrupt the abiotic stress responsive signaling process banerjee and roychoudhury 2019 further prolonged fluoride stress reduces the underlying physiological processes like reproductive capability and development 3 3 1 accumulation of fluorides by plants direct uptake via roots and airborne deposition are the major routes of entry of inorganic fluorides into terrestrial plants in plants fluoride uptake via stomata is momentous as compared to the adsorption from the soil weinstein and davison 2003 plants absorb fluorides through unidirectional distal movements which eventually accumulated in roots leaves and fruits devika and nagendra 2011 fluoride uptake by roots is a passive diffusion process from which most of the fluorides remain exchangeable from roots by mild washing processes the cell wall acts as the primary barrier to accumulate fluoride the calcium present in the cell wall acts as a buffer against fluoride accumulation and a difference intolerance of different plant species towards fluoride accumulation depends on ca present in the cell wall makehelwala et al 2019 msagati et al 2014 the mechanism of fluoride entering into the cell is not known up to now however it has been observed that chloride deficiency accelerates the uptake of fluorides as being a halide chloride channels may be mediated by the cellular uptake of fluorides miller et al 1986 most of the fluorides in roots are in cell walls and intercellular space little passes through the cell membrane plasmalemma or tonoplast promote extrusion of negatively charged fluoride ions due to low permeability of cell membrane to fluoride ions transportation of fluorides towards shoots is limited due to presence of endodermis which acts as an effective barrier to the vascular tissues therefore fluorides reach the vascular system via non selective routes that bypass the endodermis vithanage et al 2012a b according to stevens et al 1998 uptake of fluoride from the solution by the plant depends on species and ionic strength of the culture media stevens et al 1998 fluoride concentration in plants increases considerably after a threshold fluoride ion activity in the culture medium is achieved initial concentration the solubility of mineral phases such as ca and p content soil type fawell et al 2006 mohapatra et al 2009 soil reaction conover and poole 1972 are considered as main factors that influence uptake and accumulation of fluoride by plants the accumulation of fluoride in different parts of the plants comply with the trend of roots leaves fruits shoots higher transfer rate is found in leafy vegetation seed crops than fruiting and tuber vegetables gupta et al 2009 the study conducted by three semi arid plants namely acacia tottilis prospis juliflora and cassia fistula showed that an accumulation of fluoride is high in roots followed by leaves and stem the results indicated that the significant translocation of fluorides from roots into aerial parts of the plant baunthiyal and sharma 2012 helianthemum intricatum rhanterium suaveolens and atractylis serratuloids showed uptake of fluoride in leaves and much higher uptake in rosa agrestis and the leaves of oleo europaea due to the hair like structures in them with thick epicuticular waxes this uptake of fluoride is directly linked to the morphological trait in the flora as studies in tunisia boukhris et al 2015 mezghani et al 2005 table 1 most of the plants are able to uptake a minimum of 10 mg kg 1 of fluorides from the soil while some plants have exceptional properties to accumulate fluorides up to several hundred fluorides mg g 1 from the soil for instance camellia sinensis accumulate the extensive amount of fluoride in mature leaves from the soil of normal availabilities ruan et al 2003 singh et al 2018 however this mechanism is not well understood the fluorides in leaves increased linearly with the concentration of the solution or soil whereas those in roots and stem were mildly affected the fluorides uptakes by roots are mainly readily transported to the leaves in camellia sinensis fluoride accumulation in leaves occurs in the form of free anions or connection with aluminum calcium and magnesium weinstein and davison 2004 studies have revealed that the presence of fluoride and aluminum together in plant have a strong correlation compared to other elements their uptake and translocation are enhanced if both are present in the medium weinstein and alscher herman 1981 aquatic plants have a high propensity for accumulating soluble fluorides macroscopic species and bacteria when exposed to high concentrations of fluorides rarely showed toxic effects algae and cyanobacteria differ in their response to fluoride and cyanobacteria are more sensitive to fluoride toxicity bhatnagar and bhatnagar 2000 the absence of internal compartmentalization in prokaryotes brings all the constituents under direct attack once fluoride is inside the cell fluoride may interact with most cellular components and thus shows a multipronged effect on cell metabolism being a strong hydrogen bonding agent the threshold concentration of fluoride is firmly ph dependent at which toxicity manifested varies between algae and cyanobacteria bhatnagar and bhatnagar 2000 3 3 2 effect of fluoride uptake on plants 3 3 2 1 a chlorophyll carbohydrate and protein in plants the presence of fluoride in soil water or air exhibited the inhibitory effect on the pigments of leaves the pigment contents were found to be declined with the increasing initial concentration of fluoride fluoride accumulation in plants leads to retard the chlorophyll level of the plant leaves thereby reducing the carbohydrate synthesis khandare et al 2017 chlorophyll breakdown in leaves during the stress that caused due to fluoride accumulation or incorporation of δ aminolevulinic acid into pathways of chlorophyll synthesis pave the way to reduce the chlorophyll content saini et al 2013 the metabolism of amino acids and nitrogen significantly affects the plant when fluoride present as contaminants in the same study there was a correlation between nitrogen metabolism and fluoride stress among these hypersensitive plants lupinus luteus accumulated high amounts of total nitrogen in their shoots and thus they indulge in higher fluoride uptake by increasing protein synthesis banerjee and roychoudhury 2019 szostek and ciećko 2017 fluorides are also known as potent enzyme inhibitors which conclusively affect physiological processes such as carbohydrate metabolism miller 1993 therefore fluoride accumulation was able to reduce the conversion of sugars into carbohydrates asthir and singh 1995 according to khandare et al 2017 the chlorophyll level in n oleander portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were found to be reduced from 30 2 24 6 and 26 8 up to 28 3 10 6 and 16 2 μg ml 1 respectively after15 days exposure khandare et al 2017 similarly the carbohydrate levels nerium oleander portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were declined by 16 50 and 44 respectively the total protein in n oleander p oleracea and p crinitum were reduced by 15 53 and 38 however protein level reduction was not significant after15 days in n oleander leaves however after fluoride accumulation protein level reduction was noted in p oleracea and p crinitum reddy and kaur 2008 in another study significant chlorophyll reduction of leaves of pistum sativum oryza sativa and triticum aestivum was observed bhargava and bhardwaj 2010 gupta and banerjeea 2009 in accordance with the study conducted by shirke and chandra 1991 there was no effect of fluoride up to 25 mg l 1 on total chlorophyll in spirodela polyrhiza however the total chlorophyll degradation was observed by karmakar et al 2016 in eichhornia crassipes pistia stratiotes and spirodela polyrhiza at the 20 mg l 1 fluoride concentration this may be due to temperature difference of the two studies conducted and granulation of chloroplast enzymatic inhibition and loss of subcellular organization may be the referencing factors for pigment loss due to accumulation of fluoride in e crassipes p stratiotes and s polyrhiza karmakar et al 2016 reduction of the chlorophyll content in the leaves of h perforatum and c sinensis could be seen with the fluoride accumulation huang et al 2011 prolonged contact with this fluoride anion fluoride concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 was able to reduce the chlorophyll content up to 40 60 as it can directly involve in photosynthesis camarena rangel et al 2015 the total protein content in the plants was found to be declined with the increasing initial fluoride concentrations karmakar et al 2016 proline and cysteine like amino acids conserve the plant tissues from the damage caused by due to heavy metal or contaminant stress conditions generally they are generated from protein degradation bauddh and singh 2012 the stress caused due to intrusion of high fluoride levels induce the synthesis of free amino acids in higher plants and the amount of free amino acids in tissue depends on the storage protein degradation yang and miller 1963 the highest reduction was observed at 20 mg l 1 initial concentration in the leaves of e crassipes p stratiotes and s polyrhiza karmakar et al 2016 after 10 mm fluoride solution exposure sugar and starch content of amygdalis communis leaves were also found to be reduced by 75 and 85 respectively elloumi et al 2005 correspondingly paddy seedlings that were exposed to 10 ml 1 naf solution were found to demonstrate 30 reduction in sugar content after 15 days gupta et al 2009 gupta and banerjeea 2009 there are two known channels to which fluoride uptake takes place in plants anion channel and the apoplastic transport channel in anion channel the fluoride gets accumulated in leaf from the ambient air through the stomata that further undergoes a pressure within the cell wall baunthiyal and ranghar 2015 since these fluoride ions cannot commute easily through the lipid membranes and due to its polarization of proteins which now makes it viable for easy transport of ions in and out of the cell this creates a temporary depolarization of the membrane thereby blocking the fluoride ion outflow zhang et al 2016 a brief schematic diagram of the mechanism of uptake of fluoride from root to shoot system of plant from contaminated soil is depicted in fig 2 the apoplastic transport system is mostly more prevalent in the root system mainly due to the presence of positive charges on the cell wall the apolplastic transport system in stomata is also exemplified in fig 2 the entry of fluoride ions directly into the xylem phloem through the epidermis of the secondary roots and further bypasses the casparian strip singh et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 3 3 2 2 b plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress in addition to the adverse effect of fluoride on chlorophyll and total protein the mechanism of fluoride uptake needs to be further investigated to understand the factors contributing to plant stress the interaction pathways through which plants respond from biotic and abiotic stressors needs to be well established gassmann et al 2016 hendry et al 1987 chlorophyll as discussed earlier gets continuously synthesized and degraded at once and with the stressors metabolisms tend to shift from anabolism to catabolism and chlorophyll get degraded to a great extent chang et al 2019 gutbrod et al 2019 hendry et al 1987 the oxidative stress is an impending phenomenon after plant exposes to various abiotic stresses as well as antioxidant enzymes play a significant role in scavenging oxidative stress in plants kumar et al 2009 to examine the marker enzymes of the oxidative stress the roots and leaves of the plants are tested generally before and after fluoride removal karmakar et al 2016 the activities of catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gpx in the roots of the portulaca oleracea and pogonatherum crinitum were observed to be at a high level however on the other hand n oleander roots showed lowered expression in the activities of cat sod and gpx of 77 153 and 71 respectively after inductions karmakar et al 2016 loganathan et al 2013 however n oleander revealed that sod cat and gpx to be induced by 280 242 and 243 consequently this might be due to superior translocation of fluoride exhibited by n oleander c sinensis and mulberry cultivars were also demonstrated significant inflated levels in sod and cat on fluoride exposure kumar et al 2009 according to saini et al 2013 cat and peroxidase activities in p juliflora were found to be increased by 3 2 and 2 7 folds respectively in karmakar et al 2015 gpx and cat activities were studied and the maximum were achieved at 20 mg l 1 initial concentration of fluoride in the leaves of eichhornia crassipes pistia stratiotes and s polyrhiza karmakar et al 2016 saini et al 2013 4 merits and demerits of phytoremediation phytoremediation is a technique that is relatively easy to implement as it does not require expensive equipment or highly specialized personnel gandhi et al 2016 the cost of other conventional remediation method for fluoride remediation from water may vary between the us 10 us 1000 m 3 whereas the cost for the use of phytoremediation may cost as low as us 0 05 m 3 marmiroli and mccutcheon 2003 a variety of organic and inorganic compounds can be successfully removed from phytoremediation technique it can be used either as an in situ or ex situ application safari sinegani and dastjerdi 2008 the use of in situ application is widespread and reliable because it minimizes the disturbance of the soil and the surrounding environment leading to reduction in the spread of contamination through air or waterborne wastes gandhi et al 2016 disposal sites are not required in the case of phytoremediation and public acceptance is high as it is more aesthetically pleasing and avoids excavation and transport of polluted media hence reducing the risk of spreading the contamination it has the potential to treat sites that are polluted not only with fluoride but also with more than one type of pollutant the distribution of contaminants to air and water is decreased by preventing leaching and soil erosion that may result from water activity and wind ghosh and singh 2005 when properly implemented it is considered as a green technology which is applicable for different organic and inorganic pollutants thus attempts on remediation of fluoride contaminated water by phytoremediation method requires stringent policy strengthening and advocating the need for such a holistic approach with the vital notion of safe disposal mechanism for the so contaminated biomasses are soundly addressed this could otherwise accomplish a whole sets of national policy of eco friendly development and create scientific social economic improvements among scientists environmentalists and agriculturists who gets involved in the application of phytoremediation technique and strengthens the applicability for fluoride uptake by such hyperaccumulators gandhi et al 2016 kumari and khan 2018b plant tolerance to fluoride uptake is the essential requisite for phytoremediation and most of the time it is the invasive species that are great in phytoremediation if the invasive plants are utilized viably it can profusely control their abundance most of the water hyacinth attracts special attention to taking up fluoride which is otherwise treated as a non destructible weed eichornia crassipes water hyacinth have the ability to uptake both inorganic and organic pollutants and very resilient to drastic climatic conditions however time is the most severe limitation of phytoremediation it is a lengthy process which may take several years or longer to clean up hazardous waste sites rajakaruna et al 2006 in most situations phytoremediation is confined to the rooting depth of the plants used for the studies gandhi et al 2016 vegetation conservation in intensively contaminated areas is convoluted and human health can be impacted by the entry of pollutants into the food chain through animal feeding on the contaminated plants vidali 2001 it can affect biodiversity if invasive and non native species are used for the process harvested plant biomass produced from the phytoextraction may be classified as a hazardous waste under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra which leads to raising a problem in consumption of contaminated plants by wildlife and subject to proper handling and disposal gandhi et al 2016 unfavorable climate may limit the growth of plants and mass production thus reducing the efficiency of process safari sinegani and dastjerdi 2008 5 conclusive remarks and future perspectives being one of the most abundant elements with about 0 3 g kg 1 of the earth s crust fluoride has the ability to enter into the environment through natural processes which has accelerated due to anthropogenic activities at present while attaining a detrimental impact to living non living environment and their interactions fig 1 many defluoridation techniques have been explored since 1930 s applications of these techniques in the developing nations will have their limitations and thus necessitates a low cost measure among the other existing membrane processes reverse osmosis or adsorptive measures defluoridation requires high cost and skilled operations and consistent maintenance however a detailed understanding of the plants that can perform in phytoremediation for fluoride uptake in significant amounts from the environment and yet perform at the least toxicity safe and much cheaper is an approach to be considered for a long term strategy within the last few decades the need for the phytoremediation has increased and minimal studies have been conducted on bioremediation of fluorides water and soil have become an intense area of study as plant based phytoremediation comes into the research arena to improve quality biotechnological improvements of plants to increase phytoremediation will be an option which may need future attention a detailed study on the hyper accumulators of fluoride would be a safe secure and cost effective method towards removing fluorides from soil and water by virtue of identifying the diverse groups of terrestrial and aquatic plants so far which have the ability to accumulate fluoride thousands of times more uptake than their origin can be employed successfully for fluoride remediation acknowledgements grant icrp nsf nsfc 2019 bs 01 by the

12184,fluoride and arsenic in groundwater are two of the most discussed elements in the emerging science medical geology this paper reviews the studies conducted during the last 30 years in sri lanka on fluoride and arsenic in groundwater these studies have clearly indicated that several regions of the dry zone of sri lanka are affected by excessive quantities of fluoride in the groundwater apart from the well known dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis was also reported up to a certain extent in the high fluoride regions the recent increase in the incidence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu has also highlighted the importance of the geochemistry of fluoride in groundwater of the dry zone although geologically the dry zone of sri lanka does not differ markedly from the wet zone the climate and the hydrological conditions play a significant role in the geochemistry of fluoride and its impact on human health over 50 of wells in the dry zone regions of sri lanka have fluoride levels higher than 1 0 mg l while the fluoride content is also higher in deep wells compared to the shallow wells arsenic in groundwater is not yet considered as a serious issue in sri lanka particularly in aquifers in the metamorphic terrain but higher arsenic levels were recorded in sedimentary terrains the toxicity effects of high arsenic in such terrains still remain a neglected health concern that needs greater attention since high fluoride is a major problem in the dry zone regions with severe health concerns suitable defluoridation methods need to be introduced at the household level graphical abstract image 1 keywords ckdu dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis dry zone sedimentary aquifers health hazards 1 introduction the relationships between the natural environmental factors and the health of the inhabitants in a terrain have been known for centuries exposure either to lower or higher levels of certain chemical constituents through drinking water food or air leads to numerous non communicable diseases the science dealing with the relationship between natural geological factors and health of man and animals now defined as medical geology describes the influence of ordinary environmental factors on the geographical distribution of health problems dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 finkelman et al 2001 2018 selinus 2002 such health issues are more apparent in the tropical equatorial belt where the vast majority of countries are less developed compounded by economic health agricultural and many other issues geogenic and climatic factors are also unique in these terrains and are further compounded by the fact that their human populations are exceedingly high tropical countries are very often subject to a variety of geogenic disasters including problems relevant to water quality and health issues bundschuh et al 2017 in such terrains water stress and water quality issues are more severe and expected to increase in the near future with the predicted climate change impacts kundzewicz et al 2008 providing safe water to the community is one of the important considerations in the sustainable development goals sdgs and assessing water quality is therefore an important consideration in providing potable water for the community alcamo 2019 bundschuh et al 2017 li and wu 2019 yunus et al 2019 most importantly in these terrains groundwater is very often used as drinking water directly with no purification and the link between groundwater chemistry and health becomes obvious therefore from a medical geology perspective groundwater geochemistry is of special importance the groundwater derives its solutes from contact with various solids liquids and gases as it finds its way from the recharge to the discharge area the chemical composition of the rocks minerals and soils through which the groundwater flows causes very large variations in the geochemistry of the groundwater dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 finkelman et al 2018 in most developing countries in the tropical equatorial belt contamination of water due to industrial emissions are minimal and the chemistry of the rocks minerals and soils of a terrain is of paramount importance for the geochemistry of groundwater and hence the health of the indigenous populations the anomalous levels of certain dissolved constituents would undoubtedly impact the health of the people living in an area since the quality of drinking water has a clear impact on public health the world health organization who imposed guidelines and standards for many of these constituents including elements and other harmful substances one of the important aspects of the essentiality of elemental constituents is the margin between individual and population requirements and the tolerable intake developing countries with their different lifestyle patterns and inadequate nutritional supplements coupled with a host of natural and anthropogenic environmental problems may have markedly different tolerable intakes as compared to those living in developed and temperate countries therefore the relationship between water quality and human health is more apparent in developing countries where centralized water supply systems are not available dissanayake and chandrajith 2007 li and wu 2019 in developed countries where centralized water supply systems are freely available water quality can be regulated and monitored and proper standards are maintained from among many other relationships between geochemistry and human health the link between fluoride and arsenic geochemistry of drinking water in an area and incidences of health effects are very well established in medical geology during the last few decades several studies had been carried out throughout the world to investigate the geochemical relationship of fluoride and arsenic and the health of populations the aim of this paper is to review some recent studies on the geochemistry of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater and their health impacts giving particular emphasis to the tropical terrain of sri lanka 2 fluoride and human health fluoride in drinking water becomes a serious problem globally since nearly 200 million people mostly from tropical countries are vulnerable to dental and or skeletal fluorosis fig 1 kimambo et al 2019 fluoride related health issues were noted in many counties like china guo et al 2014 wen et al 2013 india ali et al 2019 jacks et al 2005 reddy et al 2010 saxena and ahmed 2003 yadav et al 2019 pakistan rafique et al 2009 rasool et al 2018 eastern african countries davies 2003 gaciri and davies 1993 kut et al 2016 sri lanka balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2012 dissanayake 1991 dissanayake 2005a 2005b ranasinghe et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 mexico armienta and segovia 2008 daesslé et al 2009 valenzuela vasquez et al 2006 argentina gomez et al 2009 2019 kruse and ainchil 2003 among others with very high incidences of dental and in many cases skeletal fluorosis mainly caused by the excess fluoride in drinking water ali et al 2019 dissanayake 1991 1996 edmunds and smedley 2013 fluorine is one of the most abundant elements in the geogenic environment and occurs ubiquitously in natural water as its ionic form fluoride ali et al 2016 although fluoride could be considered an essential element for human health in low doses excessive fluoride has detrimental effects on health while the essentiality of fluoride for human health is still being debated its toxicity has now caused considerable concern in many regions where fluoride is found in excessive quantities in their drinking water however the optimum range of fluoride varies within a very narrow margin causing fluoride imbalances often in populations in tropical countries where people consume large quantities of water with higher fluoride levels with most trace elements required by man food is the principal source but fluoride enters the human body from water dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 most importantly the essentiality and toxicity of fluoride are divided by a narrow line the who recommended drinking water standard for fluoride is 0 5 1 5 mg l who 2011 fluoride is an important element for the homeostasis of bone mineral metabolism dissanayake and chandrajith 2007 due to the chemical similarity of fluoride and hydroxyl ions ingested fluoride is strongly adsorbed on mineralized tissues of the body which are composed mainly of the mineral hydroxyl apatite ca5 po4 3oh over 90 of fluoride in the body is retained in the skeleton and teeth ali et al 2016 ghosh et al 2013 soft tissues do not generally take up fluoride except by the pineal gland where fluoride accumulates in excessive levels luke 2001 malin et al 2019 bones are constantly resorbed and re deposited during a lifetime and high fluoride can affect the ca turnover rates of bone dental fluorosis occurs as a result of exposure to excess fluorides during the childhood particularly during the age of teeth formation developing at levels above 1 5 mg l ali et al 2019 who 2011 as a result enamel becomes harder and discoloured although dental fluorosis does not affect the tooth as such noticeable cosmetic effects can appear in teeth fig 2 long term and continuous exposure to a high level 4 mg l of fluoride leads to hardening of bones joint pain and limb motor dysfunction known as skeletal fluorosis dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 zuo et al 2018 extreme chronic exposure of environmental fluoride could cause crippling fluorosis choubisa 2001 noted that crippling fluorosis can appear at exposures even at about 2 8 mg l of environmental fluoride with an extreme form of skeletal fluorosis known as kyphosis and genu varum in some cases particularly among adults over 45 years of age choubisa and choubisa 2019 patients with skeletal fluorosis with spinal cord compression were also reported in the dry zone of sri lanka due to the regular consumption of high fluoride water for about 20 years dissanayake 1996 in addition to health issues of hard tissues chronic exposure to high levels of environmental fluoride could affect the functions of liver kidney heart lungs brain thyroid gland chromosomes nervous systems development and reproductive abilities kumari and kumar 2011 nakamoto and rawls 2018 zuo et al 2018 chronic exposure of fluoride for prolonged periods possibly causes osteosclerosis and end stage renal failure leading to chronic kidney diseases in certain tropical equatorial regions balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2011a dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 lantz et al 1987 harinarayan et al 2006 have also shown evidence of chronic fluoride intoxication associated with renal tubular dysfunction that leads to both bone and kidney disease the importance of fluoride as a geochemical marker for chronic kidney disease with unknown etiology ckdu in sri lanka was discussed by dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 and dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 damaged kidneys accumulate more fluoride resulting in further damage to kidney bone and other organs connett 2012 health effects of fluoride have been observed even at lower levels than the who recommended levels particularly in tropical terrains ghosh et al 2013 warnakulasuriya et al 1992 it has been documented that the who recommended levels for fluoride in drinking water are not acceptable to all countries and the incidence of dental fluorosis is common even in areas with lower levels of fluoride in water therefore the who recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water are not appropriate for many tropical countries and the optimum levels need to be determined considering the climatic conditions amount of water intake and intake from other sources who 2011 for instance drinking of tea which is one of the common beverages in many regions provide additional fluoride intake chandrajith et al 2007 fung et al 1999 in india dental and skeletal fluorosis have been reported even when the average drinking water fluoride concentration is close to 0 5 mg l and 0 7 mg l respectively lower than the who recommended limits of 1 5 and 4 0 mg l ayoob and gupta 2006 both dental and skeletal fluorosis were more prevalent and more severe in some regions of senegal where 66 5 of children had mild dental fluorosis at the level of 1 0 mg l fluoride dental fluorosis had reached 100 over 4 0 mg l of fluoride in drinking water brouwer et al 1988 in sri lanka the optimal level of fluoride in groundwater for caries protection has been recommended to be 0 6 0 9 mg l warnakulasuriya et al 1992 3 geochemistry of fluoride most importantly the geochemistry of the f ion ionic radius 1 36 å is similar to that of the hydroxyl ion ionic radius 1 40 å and therefore there can be easy exchange between them when groundwater moves in aquifers the exchange between fluoride and hydroxyl ions take place leading to the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater minerals such as fluorite apatite mica amphiboles are common rock forming minerals that contain a high amount of fluoride in addition to fluorspar cryolite fluoroapatite which have fluoride as a major constituent ali et al 2016 these minerals are abundant in granitic rocks and high grade metamorphic rocks such as gneisses silicate minerals in the earth s crust usually contain fluoride levels as high as 650 mg kg of fluoride adriano 2001 prolonged water rock interactions with a higher rate of mineral weathering which is typical to tropical regions lead to leaching of fluoride into the solution and in wet climatic regions intense rainfall washes away fluoride resulting in lower concentrations on the other hand the climatic effects notably evaporation due to the prevailing high ambient temperature can enrich the fluoride concentrations in the water dissanayake 1996 mukherjee and singh 2020 the mobility of fluoride into groundwater is also determined by the groundwater chemistry such as ph hco3 and availability of alkali and alkaline earths guo et al 2014 saxena and ahmed 2003 a lowering of ca activity with increasing na ca ratios occur due to excessive evaporation of groundwater under tropical conditions and this leads to the increase of fluoride levels jacks et al 2005 however carbonate rocks act as good sinks for fluoride dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 and the leachability of fluoride from the carbonates is controlled by a ph of the draining solutions b alkalinity c dissolved co2 and the pco2 in the soil clay minerals fe oh 3 al oh 3 and fine grained soils adsorb fluoride relatively easily by displacing hydroxides on the clay surface fluoride is effectively adsorbed at a ph range of 3 4 and decreases above 6 5 savenko 2001 4 fluoride in groundwater of sri lanka sri lanka a tropical island country with a population of nearly 20 million has well defined wet and dry zones fig 3 in many parts of the island groundwater is the main source of potable water particularly in rural communities of the dry zone of sri lanka of which over 70 of communities depend for their domestic needs the dry zone region comprises almost two thirds of the land area and is characterized by lower rainfall 1000 mm per annum with higher evapotranspiration compared to the wet zone which gets over 2500 mm a rainfall restricted rainfall and long dry spells lead to water scarcity in the dry zone regions in this region groundwater is mainly extracted from shallow dug wells 10 m and deep tube wells in the dry zone regions dental fluorosis is highly prevalent and the exact population affected by dental fluorosis in sri lanka is not well known in some areas in sri lanka dental fluorosis among the population has been recorded as high as 80 98 nunn et al 1994 warnakulasuriya et al 1992 therefore the hydrogeochemistry of fluoride in drinking water is of major interest geologically sri lanka comprises over 90 meta sedimentary and meta volcanic rocks of presumed precambrian age these rocks are abundant in fluoride bearing minerals such as micas hornblende sphene and apatite further minerals such as fluorite tourmaline and topaz are also found as accessory minerals in many rock types and these also contribute to the general geochemical cycle of fluoride in the geological environment the fluoride contents of the different types of metamorphic rocks of sri lanka varied from 95 mg kg to 1440 mg kg dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 groundwater extracted from deep wells in charnockitic gneiss calc gneiss biotite gneiss and on granulite rocks showed higher fluoride contents compared to wells drilled in quartzite and crystalline limestones dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 the difference in fluoride levels in aquifer rocks is due to different mineral constituents in these rocks and their relative capability of releasing fluoride ions into groundwater deep groundwater is often extracted from fractured crystalline rocks and long residence times enable greater water rock interaction which could lead to a higher dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals high fluoride regions in sri lanka lie within the low plains whereas the low fluoride zones are mostly confined to the central highlands in the wet zone high rainfall in the wet zone causes the fluoride to leach out from primary and secondary minerals in rocks and soil whereas in the dry zone evaporation tends to bring soluble ions upwards by capillary action the slow rate of groundwater movement in the low plains also tends to increase the fluoride concentration since the contact time of groundwater with a particular geological formation is comparatively long dissanayake 1996 even in groundwater extracted from the same aquifer rocks in the dry and wet zones a drastic difference in their fluoride contents has been observed for instance some deep wells in the wet zone region showed fluoride contents often below 0 5 mg l indicating a clear influence of climate and hydrology on the fluoride content in groundwater dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 a map showing the distribution of fluoride in groundwater in sri lanka had been first compiled in the hydrogeochemical atlas of sri lanka dissanayake and weerasooriya 1986 and the fluoride zones of sri lanka delineated based on the fluoride content in dug well water samples it was recently updated with data obtained from many shallow and deep wells fig 4 and which showed that a large part of the landmass of sri lanka is fluoride rich chandrajith et al 2012 over 50 of wells in the dry zone regions have fluoride levels higher than 1 0 mg l while the fluoride content is also higher in deep wells compared to the shallow wells chandrajith et al 2012 raghava rao et al 1987 noted that high fluoride wells 3 5 mg l are mostly associated with charnockites meta granites hornblende biotite gneisses and granitic gneisses whereas moderately fluoride rich wells 2 3 mg l were recognized in garnet biotite sillimanite gneisses in many regions in the north central province the fluoride concentration in groundwater reaches up to 5 mg l with a high incidence of dental fluorosis in the very early study of seneviratne et al 1974 it had been shown that the prevalence of dental fluorosis in two dry zone districts of anuradhapura and polonnaruwa was significant they showed that 77 5 and 56 2 of the population in these two districts respectively suffer from dental fluorosis in which fluoride levels varied from 0 10 to 4 70 mg l and 0 50 13 1 mg l in drinking water van der hoek et al 2003 showed that the prevalence of dental fluorosis among 14 year old children were 43 2 in the udawalawe region where the mean fluoride in groundwater was 0 80 mg l warnakulasuriya et al 1992 investigated 380 children of about 14 years living in 4 geographic areas of sri lanka with fluoride at 0 09 mg l to 8 0 mg l and showed that even in low fluoride level areas dental fluorosis is prevalent a survey carried out in the aluthwewa village near galewela showed that 63 of school children are affected by dental fluorosis the mean fluoride content of the groundwater being 1 13 mg l ekanayake 2017 in recent years a large number of water quality studies have been carried out particularly in the dry zone regions of sri lanka due to the wide attention on ckdu fluoride is known to interact with cellular systems including oxidative stress and modulation of intracellular redox homeostasis and some others emphasizing the toxicity of fluoride to human beings even at significantly lower doses cittanova et al 1996 the spatial distribution of ckdu in sri lanka mostly overlaps with the regions of high fluoride groundwater and high water hardness dissanayake 2005a 2005b chandrajith et al 2011a 2011b as indicated in recent studies the fluoride content in dry zone metamorphic terrains varied from 0 02 mg l to 8 00 mg l table 1 the highest mean fluoride content 2 40 mg l was recorded in the madirigiriya area near polonnaruwa jayawardana et al 2012 however levels were lower in dry zone sedimentary aquifers systems in the north and north western part of the island for instance the highest mean fluoride content of 0 55 mg l was recorded in limestone aquifer systems in the murunkan region thilakerathne et al 2015 groundwater extracted from sandy aquifers in the dry zone also showed much lower fluoride levels 0 45 mg l in contrast fluoride levels in wet zone hard rock aquifers are lower than that of the dry zone aquifers the other interesting feature of fluoride in groundwater in the hard rock terrain is a drastic variation of the concentrations within short distances a recent comprehensive investigation carried out using data obtained from 6107 wells indicated that the groundwater fluoride levels in sri lanka varied from 0 02 to 12 0 mg l of which 28 of the wells showed a fluoride level below 0 5 mg l and 9 7 of wells had over 2 0 mg l ranasinghe et al 2019 it was also noted that high fluoride wells 2 mg l were in some cases located within a distance of 500 m from low fluoride wells 0 5 mg l the minimum distance observed between a high 2 0 mg l and a low fluoride wells 0 5 mg l was 42 m and the maximum distance was 9 km ranasinghe et al 2019 since low fluoride wells are often located in the vicinity of high fluoride wells it is very important that the water quality of individual wells be studied for their fluoride contents 5 arsenic in groundwater chronic arsenic poisoning caused by drinking water is considered as one of the world s biggest environmental disasters recorded in the last century kapaj et al 2006 millions of people in bangladesh and west bengal were severely affected with arsenic related diseases the groundwater extracted from clay or peat layers in the quaternary sediments of the ganges brahmaputra delta consisted of alarmingly high levels of arsenic annaduzzaman et al 2018 bhattacharya et al 1997 2002 vietnam taiwan china mexico nepal chile myanmar cambodia and many parts of the usa and argentina are among the other countries where high arsenic groundwater had been reported ahmed et al 2004 rahman et al 2009 it was reported that over 43 million people in bangladesh and west bengal in india consume water which has over 10 μg l as chowdhury et al 2000 goswami et al 2020 rahman et al 2009 after the outbreak of the chronic arsenic position in bangladesh the who has lowered the maximum allowable limit of arsenic from 45 μg l to 10 μg l however up to 3200 μg l of arsenic had been reported in groundwater in bangladesh bhattacharyya et al 2003 arsenic is a toxic and carcinogenic element present in many rock forming minerals mostly associated with iron oxides clays and in particular sulphide minerals bhattacharya et al 1997 groundwater obtained from sedimentary aquifers is particularly characterized by higher contents of inorganic as exceeding the who recommended values ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 1997 currell et al 2011 once arsenic gets into groundwater it subsequently enters the human body causing serious health hazards skin lesions including skin pigmentation and hyperkeratosis and skin cancer are the most typical symptoms of chronic exposure to arsenic lung cancer blackfoot disease heart vascular and kidney diseases are also among other health issues related to the chronic as poisoning cohen et al 2006 kapaj et al 2006 however skin diseases are the most common health effects of chronic as poisoning that was reported in people who consume drinking water even with 5 μg l of as yoshida et al 2004 since arsenic is a metalloid naturally occurring arsenic occurs in groundwater as oxy anions of as iii or as v compared to organic forms of arsenic such as as betaine mono methyl or dimethyl arsenate inorganic arsenic is considered to be more toxic sharma and sohn 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 however organic forms of arsenic are mostly found in food and from among the inorganic forms the more toxic form as iii enters the body mainly through drinking water even as v reduces to as iii after entering the cell membranes jomova et al 2011 6 arsenic in groundwater in sri lanka recent hydrogeochemical investigations indicated that alarmingly high arsenic containing groundwater is not present in the high grade metamorphic terrains of sri lanka nanayakkara et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 in particular groundwater in this terrain is extracted from the weathered overburden or tensional fractures in the metamorphic rocks in recent years arsenic in groundwater received wider attention as it was proposed as an etiological factor for the occurrence of ckdu in sri lanka jayasumana et al 2015 jayatilake et al 2013 despite public debates on high arsenic in drinking water and its relationship with the ckdu alarmingly higher concentrations of arsenic in water and soil have not been reported in the geological materials in sri lanka high grade metamorphic rocks of sri lanka contain exclusively low arsenic contents chandrajith et al 2001 investigated several types of high grade metamorphic rocks such as gneisses charnockites granulites which contained less than 5 mg kg of arsenic indicating the non availability of arsenic bearing minerals soils are other natural materials that can easily be contaminated with arsenic due to the application of fertilizer and pesticides jayawardana et al 2014 reported that agricultural soils contain relatively higher contents of arsenic 1 0 24 mg kg compared to non agricultural soils 1 0 4 0 mg kg however organic rich uncontaminated forest soils collected from the udawalawe region in the dry zone had 9 29 mg kg as chandrajith et al 2009 a study of 70 paddy soils collected from different terrains of sri lanka contained only 0 85 mg kg of arsenic as the mean while soils from both dry and wet zones showed almost similar as levels chandrajith et al 2005 soils collected from two ckdu affected regions medawachchiya and medirigiriya in the dry zone of sri lanka showed 3 39 11 9 mg kg of arsenic with a mean value of 7 32 mg kg levine et al 2016 sediments from a dry zone reservoir showed an arsenic content of 0 5 24 mg kg mean 8 3 mg kg chandrajith et al 2008 although phosphate fertilizer is claimed to be a source of inorganic arsenic in cultivated soils jayasumana et al 2015 the reported soil as levels were relatively low and negligible inorganic arsenic in groundwater is mostly leached from the aquifer rocks but anthropogenic activities such as an application of phosphate fertilizer can also add arsenic into groundwater the leaching of arsenic from aquifer materials depends on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater the most common mechanism for the release of arsenic is dissolution under reducing conditions anawar et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 1997 tufano and fendorf 2008 higher organic contents in aquifers could enhance the release of as into groundwater redman et al 2002 wang and mulligan 2006 alkaline conditions in groundwater also favour the release of arsenic from aquifer materials fendorf and kocar 2009 oxidation of sulfide minerals such as arsenopyrite feass and arsenian pyrite fe sas 2 also can release arsenic into groundwater smedley 2008 although arsenic contaminated groundwater is not reported particularly in metamorphic aquifers elevated levels were reported in certain parts of the island table 2 it has been reported that groundwater from mannar fig 5 mulativu puttalam and jaffna fig 6 has high arsenic levels compared to other parts of the island amarathunga et al 2019 bandara et al 2018 herath et al 2018 in all these regions groundwater is extracted from unconfined aquifers in the holocene sand dunes that are underlain by miocene limestones for instance over 30 of the shallow wells in the mannar island exceeded the who recommended limits of arsenic bandara et al 2018 fig 5 groundwater in the wet zone region of sri lanka has extremely low levels of arsenic sometimes less than 0 01 μg l in the dry zone regions where ckdu is widespread arsenic levels are lower than the recommended values of the who 7 removal of fluoride and arsenic from drinking water since there are no beneficial roles of high fluoride and arsenic reduction of these parameters from drinking water is most important the problem of high fluoride and arsenic in drinking water can be observed mostly in rural regions of sri lanka in such regions centralized water supply networks are unavailable and a majority of the population depends on groundwater due to a low socio economic background rural communities cannot offer expensive household level or community based water purification systems therefore developing a cheap simple and easily to use household level water filtration system is necessary for the mitigation of the fluoride and arsenic problems although the arsenic problem is only restricted to small regions high fluoride groundwater is a widespread problem in many dry zone regions of sri lanka the consumers are unaware of the presence of excess fluoride or arsenic since both parameters do not affect the taste colour or the smell of water many techniques had been introduced for fluoride removal and most methods are based on the affinity of fluoride towards hydroxyl group or tendency of adsorbing ferrous and aluminium ions among these techniques adsorption processes are used widely and in most cases natural geological materials were used as adsorbing agents bhatnagar et al 2011 in sri lanka several studies had been carried out to introduce village level or household level defluoridation methods that can remove fluoride into the safe limits from among these techniques use of locally available brick and tile chips kaolinite clay laterite apatite and serpentinite showed promising results jinadasa et al 1991 nikagolla et al 2013 padmasiri and dissanayake 1995 weerasooriya et al 1998 these materials are widely available in sri lanka and can be used for developing household level defluoridators removal of arsenic from contaminated drinking water is also widely studied and coagulation ion exchange and adsorption on to aluminium or iron oxides were the technique used for arsenic removal naturally occurring red sand in north and northwestern coastal area were used effectively to remove both arsenate and arsenite vithanage et al 2006 their studies showed that almost all arsenic species can be removed from contaminated in ph range of 4 8 8 conclusions this review has attempted to investigate the fluoride and arsenic geochemistry in the groundwater of sri lanka as shown in previous studies excessive fluoride containing groundwater is a major problem in the dry areas of sri lanka in this region a large population suffers from chronic fluoride poisoning in view of the fact that over 80 of the population uses groundwater for drinking purposes this leads to the condition of dental fluorosis and in some cases to skeletal fluorosis until the later stages of symptoms appear although geologically both dry and wet zones of sri lanka do not show major differences groundwater fluoride levels are drastically different this clearly indicates that under semi arid conditions fluoride tends to increase in groundwater due to low precipitation and high evaporation since high fluoride lead to severe health hazards introducing household level defluoridation techniques are urgently required in high fluoride regions identification of low fluoride wells in village level also helps to provide drinking water for the rural communities since low fluoride wells are sometimes located in the close vicinity of high fluoride wells since communities in the dry zone of sri lanka ingest excessive levels of fluoride through drinking water and also through regular consumption of black tea with high fluoride estimation of the daily intake and associated health hazards need to be assessed arsenic is not observed as a critical issue in the island particularly in the metamorphic terrain excessive levels however were recorded in sedimentary aquifers it is obvious that local geological conditions are responsible for the higher contents of arsenic in the groundwater of sri lanka acknowledgements rc acknowledges the fellowship

12184,fluoride and arsenic in groundwater are two of the most discussed elements in the emerging science medical geology this paper reviews the studies conducted during the last 30 years in sri lanka on fluoride and arsenic in groundwater these studies have clearly indicated that several regions of the dry zone of sri lanka are affected by excessive quantities of fluoride in the groundwater apart from the well known dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis was also reported up to a certain extent in the high fluoride regions the recent increase in the incidence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu has also highlighted the importance of the geochemistry of fluoride in groundwater of the dry zone although geologically the dry zone of sri lanka does not differ markedly from the wet zone the climate and the hydrological conditions play a significant role in the geochemistry of fluoride and its impact on human health over 50 of wells in the dry zone regions of sri lanka have fluoride levels higher than 1 0 mg l while the fluoride content is also higher in deep wells compared to the shallow wells arsenic in groundwater is not yet considered as a serious issue in sri lanka particularly in aquifers in the metamorphic terrain but higher arsenic levels were recorded in sedimentary terrains the toxicity effects of high arsenic in such terrains still remain a neglected health concern that needs greater attention since high fluoride is a major problem in the dry zone regions with severe health concerns suitable defluoridation methods need to be introduced at the household level graphical abstract image 1 keywords ckdu dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis dry zone sedimentary aquifers health hazards 1 introduction the relationships between the natural environmental factors and the health of the inhabitants in a terrain have been known for centuries exposure either to lower or higher levels of certain chemical constituents through drinking water food or air leads to numerous non communicable diseases the science dealing with the relationship between natural geological factors and health of man and animals now defined as medical geology describes the influence of ordinary environmental factors on the geographical distribution of health problems dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 finkelman et al 2001 2018 selinus 2002 such health issues are more apparent in the tropical equatorial belt where the vast majority of countries are less developed compounded by economic health agricultural and many other issues geogenic and climatic factors are also unique in these terrains and are further compounded by the fact that their human populations are exceedingly high tropical countries are very often subject to a variety of geogenic disasters including problems relevant to water quality and health issues bundschuh et al 2017 in such terrains water stress and water quality issues are more severe and expected to increase in the near future with the predicted climate change impacts kundzewicz et al 2008 providing safe water to the community is one of the important considerations in the sustainable development goals sdgs and assessing water quality is therefore an important consideration in providing potable water for the community alcamo 2019 bundschuh et al 2017 li and wu 2019 yunus et al 2019 most importantly in these terrains groundwater is very often used as drinking water directly with no purification and the link between groundwater chemistry and health becomes obvious therefore from a medical geology perspective groundwater geochemistry is of special importance the groundwater derives its solutes from contact with various solids liquids and gases as it finds its way from the recharge to the discharge area the chemical composition of the rocks minerals and soils through which the groundwater flows causes very large variations in the geochemistry of the groundwater dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 finkelman et al 2018 in most developing countries in the tropical equatorial belt contamination of water due to industrial emissions are minimal and the chemistry of the rocks minerals and soils of a terrain is of paramount importance for the geochemistry of groundwater and hence the health of the indigenous populations the anomalous levels of certain dissolved constituents would undoubtedly impact the health of the people living in an area since the quality of drinking water has a clear impact on public health the world health organization who imposed guidelines and standards for many of these constituents including elements and other harmful substances one of the important aspects of the essentiality of elemental constituents is the margin between individual and population requirements and the tolerable intake developing countries with their different lifestyle patterns and inadequate nutritional supplements coupled with a host of natural and anthropogenic environmental problems may have markedly different tolerable intakes as compared to those living in developed and temperate countries therefore the relationship between water quality and human health is more apparent in developing countries where centralized water supply systems are not available dissanayake and chandrajith 2007 li and wu 2019 in developed countries where centralized water supply systems are freely available water quality can be regulated and monitored and proper standards are maintained from among many other relationships between geochemistry and human health the link between fluoride and arsenic geochemistry of drinking water in an area and incidences of health effects are very well established in medical geology during the last few decades several studies had been carried out throughout the world to investigate the geochemical relationship of fluoride and arsenic and the health of populations the aim of this paper is to review some recent studies on the geochemistry of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater and their health impacts giving particular emphasis to the tropical terrain of sri lanka 2 fluoride and human health fluoride in drinking water becomes a serious problem globally since nearly 200 million people mostly from tropical countries are vulnerable to dental and or skeletal fluorosis fig 1 kimambo et al 2019 fluoride related health issues were noted in many counties like china guo et al 2014 wen et al 2013 india ali et al 2019 jacks et al 2005 reddy et al 2010 saxena and ahmed 2003 yadav et al 2019 pakistan rafique et al 2009 rasool et al 2018 eastern african countries davies 2003 gaciri and davies 1993 kut et al 2016 sri lanka balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2012 dissanayake 1991 dissanayake 2005a 2005b ranasinghe et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 mexico armienta and segovia 2008 daesslé et al 2009 valenzuela vasquez et al 2006 argentina gomez et al 2009 2019 kruse and ainchil 2003 among others with very high incidences of dental and in many cases skeletal fluorosis mainly caused by the excess fluoride in drinking water ali et al 2019 dissanayake 1991 1996 edmunds and smedley 2013 fluorine is one of the most abundant elements in the geogenic environment and occurs ubiquitously in natural water as its ionic form fluoride ali et al 2016 although fluoride could be considered an essential element for human health in low doses excessive fluoride has detrimental effects on health while the essentiality of fluoride for human health is still being debated its toxicity has now caused considerable concern in many regions where fluoride is found in excessive quantities in their drinking water however the optimum range of fluoride varies within a very narrow margin causing fluoride imbalances often in populations in tropical countries where people consume large quantities of water with higher fluoride levels with most trace elements required by man food is the principal source but fluoride enters the human body from water dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 most importantly the essentiality and toxicity of fluoride are divided by a narrow line the who recommended drinking water standard for fluoride is 0 5 1 5 mg l who 2011 fluoride is an important element for the homeostasis of bone mineral metabolism dissanayake and chandrajith 2007 due to the chemical similarity of fluoride and hydroxyl ions ingested fluoride is strongly adsorbed on mineralized tissues of the body which are composed mainly of the mineral hydroxyl apatite ca5 po4 3oh over 90 of fluoride in the body is retained in the skeleton and teeth ali et al 2016 ghosh et al 2013 soft tissues do not generally take up fluoride except by the pineal gland where fluoride accumulates in excessive levels luke 2001 malin et al 2019 bones are constantly resorbed and re deposited during a lifetime and high fluoride can affect the ca turnover rates of bone dental fluorosis occurs as a result of exposure to excess fluorides during the childhood particularly during the age of teeth formation developing at levels above 1 5 mg l ali et al 2019 who 2011 as a result enamel becomes harder and discoloured although dental fluorosis does not affect the tooth as such noticeable cosmetic effects can appear in teeth fig 2 long term and continuous exposure to a high level 4 mg l of fluoride leads to hardening of bones joint pain and limb motor dysfunction known as skeletal fluorosis dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 zuo et al 2018 extreme chronic exposure of environmental fluoride could cause crippling fluorosis choubisa 2001 noted that crippling fluorosis can appear at exposures even at about 2 8 mg l of environmental fluoride with an extreme form of skeletal fluorosis known as kyphosis and genu varum in some cases particularly among adults over 45 years of age choubisa and choubisa 2019 patients with skeletal fluorosis with spinal cord compression were also reported in the dry zone of sri lanka due to the regular consumption of high fluoride water for about 20 years dissanayake 1996 in addition to health issues of hard tissues chronic exposure to high levels of environmental fluoride could affect the functions of liver kidney heart lungs brain thyroid gland chromosomes nervous systems development and reproductive abilities kumari and kumar 2011 nakamoto and rawls 2018 zuo et al 2018 chronic exposure of fluoride for prolonged periods possibly causes osteosclerosis and end stage renal failure leading to chronic kidney diseases in certain tropical equatorial regions balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2011a dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 lantz et al 1987 harinarayan et al 2006 have also shown evidence of chronic fluoride intoxication associated with renal tubular dysfunction that leads to both bone and kidney disease the importance of fluoride as a geochemical marker for chronic kidney disease with unknown etiology ckdu in sri lanka was discussed by dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 and dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 damaged kidneys accumulate more fluoride resulting in further damage to kidney bone and other organs connett 2012 health effects of fluoride have been observed even at lower levels than the who recommended levels particularly in tropical terrains ghosh et al 2013 warnakulasuriya et al 1992 it has been documented that the who recommended levels for fluoride in drinking water are not acceptable to all countries and the incidence of dental fluorosis is common even in areas with lower levels of fluoride in water therefore the who recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water are not appropriate for many tropical countries and the optimum levels need to be determined considering the climatic conditions amount of water intake and intake from other sources who 2011 for instance drinking of tea which is one of the common beverages in many regions provide additional fluoride intake chandrajith et al 2007 fung et al 1999 in india dental and skeletal fluorosis have been reported even when the average drinking water fluoride concentration is close to 0 5 mg l and 0 7 mg l respectively lower than the who recommended limits of 1 5 and 4 0 mg l ayoob and gupta 2006 both dental and skeletal fluorosis were more prevalent and more severe in some regions of senegal where 66 5 of children had mild dental fluorosis at the level of 1 0 mg l fluoride dental fluorosis had reached 100 over 4 0 mg l of fluoride in drinking water brouwer et al 1988 in sri lanka the optimal level of fluoride in groundwater for caries protection has been recommended to be 0 6 0 9 mg l warnakulasuriya et al 1992 3 geochemistry of fluoride most importantly the geochemistry of the f ion ionic radius 1 36 å is similar to that of the hydroxyl ion ionic radius 1 40 å and therefore there can be easy exchange between them when groundwater moves in aquifers the exchange between fluoride and hydroxyl ions take place leading to the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater minerals such as fluorite apatite mica amphiboles are common rock forming minerals that contain a high amount of fluoride in addition to fluorspar cryolite fluoroapatite which have fluoride as a major constituent ali et al 2016 these minerals are abundant in granitic rocks and high grade metamorphic rocks such as gneisses silicate minerals in the earth s crust usually contain fluoride levels as high as 650 mg kg of fluoride adriano 2001 prolonged water rock interactions with a higher rate of mineral weathering which is typical to tropical regions lead to leaching of fluoride into the solution and in wet climatic regions intense rainfall washes away fluoride resulting in lower concentrations on the other hand the climatic effects notably evaporation due to the prevailing high ambient temperature can enrich the fluoride concentrations in the water dissanayake 1996 mukherjee and singh 2020 the mobility of fluoride into groundwater is also determined by the groundwater chemistry such as ph hco3 and availability of alkali and alkaline earths guo et al 2014 saxena and ahmed 2003 a lowering of ca activity with increasing na ca ratios occur due to excessive evaporation of groundwater under tropical conditions and this leads to the increase of fluoride levels jacks et al 2005 however carbonate rocks act as good sinks for fluoride dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 and the leachability of fluoride from the carbonates is controlled by a ph of the draining solutions b alkalinity c dissolved co2 and the pco2 in the soil clay minerals fe oh 3 al oh 3 and fine grained soils adsorb fluoride relatively easily by displacing hydroxides on the clay surface fluoride is effectively adsorbed at a ph range of 3 4 and decreases above 6 5 savenko 2001 4 fluoride in groundwater of sri lanka sri lanka a tropical island country with a population of nearly 20 million has well defined wet and dry zones fig 3 in many parts of the island groundwater is the main source of potable water particularly in rural communities of the dry zone of sri lanka of which over 70 of communities depend for their domestic needs the dry zone region comprises almost two thirds of the land area and is characterized by lower rainfall 1000 mm per annum with higher evapotranspiration compared to the wet zone which gets over 2500 mm a rainfall restricted rainfall and long dry spells lead to water scarcity in the dry zone regions in this region groundwater is mainly extracted from shallow dug wells 10 m and deep tube wells in the dry zone regions dental fluorosis is highly prevalent and the exact population affected by dental fluorosis in sri lanka is not well known in some areas in sri lanka dental fluorosis among the population has been recorded as high as 80 98 nunn et al 1994 warnakulasuriya et al 1992 therefore the hydrogeochemistry of fluoride in drinking water is of major interest geologically sri lanka comprises over 90 meta sedimentary and meta volcanic rocks of presumed precambrian age these rocks are abundant in fluoride bearing minerals such as micas hornblende sphene and apatite further minerals such as fluorite tourmaline and topaz are also found as accessory minerals in many rock types and these also contribute to the general geochemical cycle of fluoride in the geological environment the fluoride contents of the different types of metamorphic rocks of sri lanka varied from 95 mg kg to 1440 mg kg dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 groundwater extracted from deep wells in charnockitic gneiss calc gneiss biotite gneiss and on granulite rocks showed higher fluoride contents compared to wells drilled in quartzite and crystalline limestones dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 the difference in fluoride levels in aquifer rocks is due to different mineral constituents in these rocks and their relative capability of releasing fluoride ions into groundwater deep groundwater is often extracted from fractured crystalline rocks and long residence times enable greater water rock interaction which could lead to a higher dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals high fluoride regions in sri lanka lie within the low plains whereas the low fluoride zones are mostly confined to the central highlands in the wet zone high rainfall in the wet zone causes the fluoride to leach out from primary and secondary minerals in rocks and soil whereas in the dry zone evaporation tends to bring soluble ions upwards by capillary action the slow rate of groundwater movement in the low plains also tends to increase the fluoride concentration since the contact time of groundwater with a particular geological formation is comparatively long dissanayake 1996 even in groundwater extracted from the same aquifer rocks in the dry and wet zones a drastic difference in their fluoride contents has been observed for instance some deep wells in the wet zone region showed fluoride contents often below 0 5 mg l indicating a clear influence of climate and hydrology on the fluoride content in groundwater dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 1993 a map showing the distribution of fluoride in groundwater in sri lanka had been first compiled in the hydrogeochemical atlas of sri lanka dissanayake and weerasooriya 1986 and the fluoride zones of sri lanka delineated based on the fluoride content in dug well water samples it was recently updated with data obtained from many shallow and deep wells fig 4 and which showed that a large part of the landmass of sri lanka is fluoride rich chandrajith et al 2012 over 50 of wells in the dry zone regions have fluoride levels higher than 1 0 mg l while the fluoride content is also higher in deep wells compared to the shallow wells chandrajith et al 2012 raghava rao et al 1987 noted that high fluoride wells 3 5 mg l are mostly associated with charnockites meta granites hornblende biotite gneisses and granitic gneisses whereas moderately fluoride rich wells 2 3 mg l were recognized in garnet biotite sillimanite gneisses in many regions in the north central province the fluoride concentration in groundwater reaches up to 5 mg l with a high incidence of dental fluorosis in the very early study of seneviratne et al 1974 it had been shown that the prevalence of dental fluorosis in two dry zone districts of anuradhapura and polonnaruwa was significant they showed that 77 5 and 56 2 of the population in these two districts respectively suffer from dental fluorosis in which fluoride levels varied from 0 10 to 4 70 mg l and 0 50 13 1 mg l in drinking water van der hoek et al 2003 showed that the prevalence of dental fluorosis among 14 year old children were 43 2 in the udawalawe region where the mean fluoride in groundwater was 0 80 mg l warnakulasuriya et al 1992 investigated 380 children of about 14 years living in 4 geographic areas of sri lanka with fluoride at 0 09 mg l to 8 0 mg l and showed that even in low fluoride level areas dental fluorosis is prevalent a survey carried out in the aluthwewa village near galewela showed that 63 of school children are affected by dental fluorosis the mean fluoride content of the groundwater being 1 13 mg l ekanayake 2017 in recent years a large number of water quality studies have been carried out particularly in the dry zone regions of sri lanka due to the wide attention on ckdu fluoride is known to interact with cellular systems including oxidative stress and modulation of intracellular redox homeostasis and some others emphasizing the toxicity of fluoride to human beings even at significantly lower doses cittanova et al 1996 the spatial distribution of ckdu in sri lanka mostly overlaps with the regions of high fluoride groundwater and high water hardness dissanayake 2005a 2005b chandrajith et al 2011a 2011b as indicated in recent studies the fluoride content in dry zone metamorphic terrains varied from 0 02 mg l to 8 00 mg l table 1 the highest mean fluoride content 2 40 mg l was recorded in the madirigiriya area near polonnaruwa jayawardana et al 2012 however levels were lower in dry zone sedimentary aquifers systems in the north and north western part of the island for instance the highest mean fluoride content of 0 55 mg l was recorded in limestone aquifer systems in the murunkan region thilakerathne et al 2015 groundwater extracted from sandy aquifers in the dry zone also showed much lower fluoride levels 0 45 mg l in contrast fluoride levels in wet zone hard rock aquifers are lower than that of the dry zone aquifers the other interesting feature of fluoride in groundwater in the hard rock terrain is a drastic variation of the concentrations within short distances a recent comprehensive investigation carried out using data obtained from 6107 wells indicated that the groundwater fluoride levels in sri lanka varied from 0 02 to 12 0 mg l of which 28 of the wells showed a fluoride level below 0 5 mg l and 9 7 of wells had over 2 0 mg l ranasinghe et al 2019 it was also noted that high fluoride wells 2 mg l were in some cases located within a distance of 500 m from low fluoride wells 0 5 mg l the minimum distance observed between a high 2 0 mg l and a low fluoride wells 0 5 mg l was 42 m and the maximum distance was 9 km ranasinghe et al 2019 since low fluoride wells are often located in the vicinity of high fluoride wells it is very important that the water quality of individual wells be studied for their fluoride contents 5 arsenic in groundwater chronic arsenic poisoning caused by drinking water is considered as one of the world s biggest environmental disasters recorded in the last century kapaj et al 2006 millions of people in bangladesh and west bengal were severely affected with arsenic related diseases the groundwater extracted from clay or peat layers in the quaternary sediments of the ganges brahmaputra delta consisted of alarmingly high levels of arsenic annaduzzaman et al 2018 bhattacharya et al 1997 2002 vietnam taiwan china mexico nepal chile myanmar cambodia and many parts of the usa and argentina are among the other countries where high arsenic groundwater had been reported ahmed et al 2004 rahman et al 2009 it was reported that over 43 million people in bangladesh and west bengal in india consume water which has over 10 μg l as chowdhury et al 2000 goswami et al 2020 rahman et al 2009 after the outbreak of the chronic arsenic position in bangladesh the who has lowered the maximum allowable limit of arsenic from 45 μg l to 10 μg l however up to 3200 μg l of arsenic had been reported in groundwater in bangladesh bhattacharyya et al 2003 arsenic is a toxic and carcinogenic element present in many rock forming minerals mostly associated with iron oxides clays and in particular sulphide minerals bhattacharya et al 1997 groundwater obtained from sedimentary aquifers is particularly characterized by higher contents of inorganic as exceeding the who recommended values ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 1997 currell et al 2011 once arsenic gets into groundwater it subsequently enters the human body causing serious health hazards skin lesions including skin pigmentation and hyperkeratosis and skin cancer are the most typical symptoms of chronic exposure to arsenic lung cancer blackfoot disease heart vascular and kidney diseases are also among other health issues related to the chronic as poisoning cohen et al 2006 kapaj et al 2006 however skin diseases are the most common health effects of chronic as poisoning that was reported in people who consume drinking water even with 5 μg l of as yoshida et al 2004 since arsenic is a metalloid naturally occurring arsenic occurs in groundwater as oxy anions of as iii or as v compared to organic forms of arsenic such as as betaine mono methyl or dimethyl arsenate inorganic arsenic is considered to be more toxic sharma and sohn 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 however organic forms of arsenic are mostly found in food and from among the inorganic forms the more toxic form as iii enters the body mainly through drinking water even as v reduces to as iii after entering the cell membranes jomova et al 2011 6 arsenic in groundwater in sri lanka recent hydrogeochemical investigations indicated that alarmingly high arsenic containing groundwater is not present in the high grade metamorphic terrains of sri lanka nanayakkara et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 in particular groundwater in this terrain is extracted from the weathered overburden or tensional fractures in the metamorphic rocks in recent years arsenic in groundwater received wider attention as it was proposed as an etiological factor for the occurrence of ckdu in sri lanka jayasumana et al 2015 jayatilake et al 2013 despite public debates on high arsenic in drinking water and its relationship with the ckdu alarmingly higher concentrations of arsenic in water and soil have not been reported in the geological materials in sri lanka high grade metamorphic rocks of sri lanka contain exclusively low arsenic contents chandrajith et al 2001 investigated several types of high grade metamorphic rocks such as gneisses charnockites granulites which contained less than 5 mg kg of arsenic indicating the non availability of arsenic bearing minerals soils are other natural materials that can easily be contaminated with arsenic due to the application of fertilizer and pesticides jayawardana et al 2014 reported that agricultural soils contain relatively higher contents of arsenic 1 0 24 mg kg compared to non agricultural soils 1 0 4 0 mg kg however organic rich uncontaminated forest soils collected from the udawalawe region in the dry zone had 9 29 mg kg as chandrajith et al 2009 a study of 70 paddy soils collected from different terrains of sri lanka contained only 0 85 mg kg of arsenic as the mean while soils from both dry and wet zones showed almost similar as levels chandrajith et al 2005 soils collected from two ckdu affected regions medawachchiya and medirigiriya in the dry zone of sri lanka showed 3 39 11 9 mg kg of arsenic with a mean value of 7 32 mg kg levine et al 2016 sediments from a dry zone reservoir showed an arsenic content of 0 5 24 mg kg mean 8 3 mg kg chandrajith et al 2008 although phosphate fertilizer is claimed to be a source of inorganic arsenic in cultivated soils jayasumana et al 2015 the reported soil as levels were relatively low and negligible inorganic arsenic in groundwater is mostly leached from the aquifer rocks but anthropogenic activities such as an application of phosphate fertilizer can also add arsenic into groundwater the leaching of arsenic from aquifer materials depends on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater the most common mechanism for the release of arsenic is dissolution under reducing conditions anawar et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 1997 tufano and fendorf 2008 higher organic contents in aquifers could enhance the release of as into groundwater redman et al 2002 wang and mulligan 2006 alkaline conditions in groundwater also favour the release of arsenic from aquifer materials fendorf and kocar 2009 oxidation of sulfide minerals such as arsenopyrite feass and arsenian pyrite fe sas 2 also can release arsenic into groundwater smedley 2008 although arsenic contaminated groundwater is not reported particularly in metamorphic aquifers elevated levels were reported in certain parts of the island table 2 it has been reported that groundwater from mannar fig 5 mulativu puttalam and jaffna fig 6 has high arsenic levels compared to other parts of the island amarathunga et al 2019 bandara et al 2018 herath et al 2018 in all these regions groundwater is extracted from unconfined aquifers in the holocene sand dunes that are underlain by miocene limestones for instance over 30 of the shallow wells in the mannar island exceeded the who recommended limits of arsenic bandara et al 2018 fig 5 groundwater in the wet zone region of sri lanka has extremely low levels of arsenic sometimes less than 0 01 μg l in the dry zone regions where ckdu is widespread arsenic levels are lower than the recommended values of the who 7 removal of fluoride and arsenic from drinking water since there are no beneficial roles of high fluoride and arsenic reduction of these parameters from drinking water is most important the problem of high fluoride and arsenic in drinking water can be observed mostly in rural regions of sri lanka in such regions centralized water supply networks are unavailable and a majority of the population depends on groundwater due to a low socio economic background rural communities cannot offer expensive household level or community based water purification systems therefore developing a cheap simple and easily to use household level water filtration system is necessary for the mitigation of the fluoride and arsenic problems although the arsenic problem is only restricted to small regions high fluoride groundwater is a widespread problem in many dry zone regions of sri lanka the consumers are unaware of the presence of excess fluoride or arsenic since both parameters do not affect the taste colour or the smell of water many techniques had been introduced for fluoride removal and most methods are based on the affinity of fluoride towards hydroxyl group or tendency of adsorbing ferrous and aluminium ions among these techniques adsorption processes are used widely and in most cases natural geological materials were used as adsorbing agents bhatnagar et al 2011 in sri lanka several studies had been carried out to introduce village level or household level defluoridation methods that can remove fluoride into the safe limits from among these techniques use of locally available brick and tile chips kaolinite clay laterite apatite and serpentinite showed promising results jinadasa et al 1991 nikagolla et al 2013 padmasiri and dissanayake 1995 weerasooriya et al 1998 these materials are widely available in sri lanka and can be used for developing household level defluoridators removal of arsenic from contaminated drinking water is also widely studied and coagulation ion exchange and adsorption on to aluminium or iron oxides were the technique used for arsenic removal naturally occurring red sand in north and northwestern coastal area were used effectively to remove both arsenate and arsenite vithanage et al 2006 their studies showed that almost all arsenic species can be removed from contaminated in ph range of 4 8 8 conclusions this review has attempted to investigate the fluoride and arsenic geochemistry in the groundwater of sri lanka as shown in previous studies excessive fluoride containing groundwater is a major problem in the dry areas of sri lanka in this region a large population suffers from chronic fluoride poisoning in view of the fact that over 80 of the population uses groundwater for drinking purposes this leads to the condition of dental fluorosis and in some cases to skeletal fluorosis until the later stages of symptoms appear although geologically both dry and wet zones of sri lanka do not show major differences groundwater fluoride levels are drastically different this clearly indicates that under semi arid conditions fluoride tends to increase in groundwater due to low precipitation and high evaporation since high fluoride lead to severe health hazards introducing household level defluoridation techniques are urgently required in high fluoride regions identification of low fluoride wells in village level also helps to provide drinking water for the rural communities since low fluoride wells are sometimes located in the close vicinity of high fluoride wells since communities in the dry zone of sri lanka ingest excessive levels of fluoride through drinking water and also through regular consumption of black tea with high fluoride estimation of the daily intake and associated health hazards need to be assessed arsenic is not observed as a critical issue in the island particularly in the metamorphic terrain excessive levels however were recorded in sedimentary aquifers it is obvious that local geological conditions are responsible for the higher contents of arsenic in the groundwater of sri lanka acknowledgements rc acknowledges the fellowship
