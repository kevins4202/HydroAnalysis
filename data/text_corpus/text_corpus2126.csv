10630,computation of reference evapotranspiration eto poses a challenge under limited meteorological data availability however even in this case hourly data may be available since low cost sensors can report hourly measurements this study evaluates for the first time in regional and local scenarios the use of limited hourly meteorological data temperature and relative humidity or only temperature to estimate daily eto directly and by summing hourly eto values employing rf xgboost ann and cnn the following options were evaluated i use of daily input data conventional approach ii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period hourly extraterrestrial radiation ra to estimate daily eto directly iii the same configuration of the last option but with daily ra instead of hourly ra and iv use of hourly data to estimate hourly eto and then to estimate daily eto by summing hourly eto all options used ra to develop and evaluate the models two daily eto targets were considered etod computed using the daily version of the asce pm equation and etosoh computed by summing hourly eto obtained with the asce pm equation data from 53 weather stations located in the state of minas gerais brazil were used for all models the best results were found using hourly data to estimate daily eto directly cnn models developed with 24 h hourly data hourly ra offered the best performance in all cases in relation to the best models developed with daily data rmse reduced by up to 28 2 0 71 to 0 51 and nse and r2 increased by up to 21 7 0 69 to 0 84 and 11 4 0 79 to 0 88 respectively in regional scenario in local scenario rmse reduced by up to 22 4 0 58 to 0 45 and nse and r2 increased by up to 10 1 0 79 to 0 87 and 11 3 0 80 to 0 89 respectively keywords 1d cnn convolutional neural network irrigation scheduling neural network random forest 1 introduction reliable estimates of reference evapotranspiration eto are crucial in tasks such as irrigation scheduling water resource management and hydrological studies given the complexity involved with the direct measurement of this parameter it is commonly estimated based on meteorological data pereira et al 2015 to do so the fao 56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation allen et al 1998 or the asce american society of civil engineers penman monteith asce pm equation asce ewri 2005 can be used these equations although well accepted in practical applications and academic research require meteorological data temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed that may be partially unavailable in some locations therefore several studies have investigated alternative equations such as the well known hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 to estimate eto with reduced data requirement ahooghalandari et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 paredes and pereira 2019 valiantzas 2018 zanetti et al 2019 in the last years machine learning models have been successfully used to estimate eto with fewer meteorological data these models are capable of capturing complex relationships between input and output data which makes them powerful tools in eto modeling various models have been assessed such as artificial neural network ann ferreira et al 2019 kumar et al 2011 nourani et al 2019 wu and fan 2019 support vector machine svm ferreira et al 2019 mehdizadeh et al 2017 nourani et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis nourani et al 2019 wu and fan 2019 extreme learning machine elm abdullah et al 2015 fan et al 2018 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars mehdizadeh et al 2017 wu and fan 2019 random forest rf fan et al 2019 feng et al 2017 wang et al 2019 extreme gradient boosting xgboost fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 and light gradient boosting machine lightgbm fan et al 2019 in general machine learning models have outperformed conventional equations for estimation of eto reaching higher performances for the same data requirement fan et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 kiafar et al 2017 kumar et al 2011 mehdizadeh et al 2017 reis et al 2019 in the standard approach to develop a model to estimate daily eto daily meteorological data are used as input however in some cases even with limited availability of meteorological data hourly data may be available for instance a simplified automatic weather station with only an air temperature sensor can report hourly measurements in this situation only daily maximum and minimum temperatures would be used when considering the standard approach losing any possible extra information contained in hourly data to obtain possible benefits in using limited hourly data to estimate daily eto there are two options i to sum hourly eto values estimated with limited hourly data and ii to use models than can estimate daily eto directly using all the hourly data measured during a 24 h time period in relation to the first option there are only a few studies that evaluated estimation of hourly eto with limited data alexandris and kerkides 2003 chatzithomas 2019 chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 naderianfar et al 2017 trajkovic 2010 2011 in addition these studies generally do not evaluate the models considering daily scale therefore there is still a gap in the efficiency of this approach against traditional methods to estimate daily eto i e using daily data regarding the second option above mentioned according to our knowledge so far no study investigated the use of limited hourly data to estimate daily eto directly it should be highlighted that models that can capture additional information from hourly data may achieve higher accuracy in estimation of daily eto it is especially important for temperature based models due to the following reasons i temperature based models commonly do not exhibit high performances ii temperature sensors are generally cheaper than sensors to measure relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation iii advances in estimation of eto using only air temperature can enable the development of low cost systems for irrigation scheduling it is also worth mentioning that the inclusion of relative humidity in addition to temperature in eto models can contribute to achieve higher performance at a low additional cost exner kittridge 2012 valiantzas 2012 2018 when using hourly data obtained during a 24 h time period it is possible to employ models that can handle sequential data in this sense convolutional neural network cnn can be used cnn is a deep learning model that has gained a lot of attention in image recognition field including applications in agricultural area dyrmann et al 2016 ji et al 2018 kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018a b lecun et al 2015 in the case of sequential data or time series like hourly meteorological data one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn an especial type of cnn can be used abdeljaber et al 2018 canizo et al 2019 gao et al 2019 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 ng et al 2019 in hydrology climatology field studies using 1d cnn are still very scarce haidar and verma 2018 generally cnn has outperformed traditional machine learning models in many studies reaching state of the art performances despite its high capabilities deep learning models such as cnn have not been very explored in hydrological sciences as reported for shen 2018 in an extensive review study in estimation of eto according to our knowledge so far cnn was not used considering the importance of reliable estimates of eto using reduced datasets the objective of the present study is to assess for the first time in regional and local scenarios the use of limited hourly meteorological data temperature and relative humidity or only temperature to estimate daily eto directly and by summing hourly eto values employing rf xgboost ann and cnn 2 materials and methods 2 1 database study sites and data management hourly data from 53 automatic weather stations of the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet were used all the stations are located in the state of minas gerais brazil the data length varied according to the stations given their different epochs of creation with a mean length of 11 7 1 34 years all the stations have data up to the year 2018 the data length of each station is presented in appendix a maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were collected wind speed measured at 10 m height was converted to 2 m according to allen et al 1998 days with missing or faulty data were removed faulty data were identified in daily scale when minimum temperature was higher than maximum temperature relative humidity out of the range 0 100 minimum relative humidity higher than maximum relative humidity negative wind speed negative solar radiation or solar radiation higher than extraterrestrial radiation to perform the analysis two scenarios were considered i regional models were trained with pooled data from 43 weather stations and evaluated in the 10 remaining stations and ii local models were trained and evaluated using individual data from the 10 weather stations used for evaluation in the previous scenario the 10 stations mentioned were selected in order to represent different climatic conditions in both regional and local scenarios data up to 2013 were used in the training process of the models and data from 2014 to 2018 were used to test them fig 1 the weather stations split as well as their locations and climate classification alvares et al 2013 can be seen in fig 2 aridity index ia unep united nations environmental programme 1997 ratio between annual precipitation to annual reference evapotranspiration annual reference evapotranspiration and annual precipitation are presented in fig 3 it can be noted that the study area covers a wide variety of climatic conditions with ia ranging from 0 31 to 1 61 more details on the climatic characteristics of the study sites are presented in appendix a 2 2 input data for the machine learning models to explore the potential of hourly limited meteorological data to estimate daily eto the following approaches were employed to develop the machine learning models i use of daily data to estimate daily eto conventional approach ii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and hourly extraterrestrial radiation ra to estimate daily eto directly iii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and daily ra to estimate daily eto directly and iv use of hourly data to estimate hourly eto and then to estimate daily eto by summing hourly eto approaches i and iv also used ra in daily and hourly scales respectively the variation in ra scale approaches ii and iii was done in order to verify the effect of ra scale in the estimation of eto two meteorological data availability options were assessed temperature based models and temperature and relative humidity based models in the first option maximum temperature minimum temperature and ra were considered in the second option in addition to the data of the first option maximum and minimum relative humidity were used 2 3 targets for development and evaluation of the machine learning models when developing models for estimation of eto it is a common practice to use eto estimated by the fao56 pm equation or asce pm equation which is used in this study as target for that one can estimate daily eto using the daily version of penman monteith equation here called etod or summing hourly eto obtained with the hourly version of penman monteith equation here called etosoh the last option is generally considered more accurate under certain scenarios allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 althoff et al 2019 in addition when developing models to estimate hourly eto using hourly eto obtained by the penman monteith equation as target it is convenient to use etosoh to evaluate them in daily scale however it is obvious to expect that when using etosoh as target machine learning models developed with hourly input data will perform better than their versions developed with daily data since hourly data were used to calculate the target therefore when considering etod as additional target if hourly data also provide performance increments for this target this gain can be associated with their capability to better capture climate patterns related to eto which may not be as clear when using only etosoh as target thus in this study the two types of daily eto targets i e etod and etosoh were employed to develop and evaluate the machine learning models for direct estimation of daily eto cases i ii and iii models developed for estimation of hourly eto case iv used hourly eto as target and were evaluated in daily scale using both etod and etosoh to compute eto in both hourly and daily scale the asce pm equation allen et al 2006 eq 1 was employed asce pm differs from fao pm in the surface resistance values adopted for hourly time step however allen et al 2006 recommended to use fao pm with the same surface resistance values used in asce pm the calculation of all parameters necessary to use asce pm was done based on fao 56 paper 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 or mm h 1 rn is the net solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 or mj m 2 h 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 or

are constants that depend on calculation time step reference type and time of day for grass eto cn is equal to 900 k mm s3 mg 1 d 1 for daily time step and 37 k mm s3 mg 1 h 1 for hourly time step and cd is equal to 0 34 s m 1 for daily time step and 0 24 and 0 96 s m 1 for hourly time step during daytime rn 0 and nighttime respectively for rn computation the ratio between solar radiation and clear sky solar radiation rs rso which is used to represent cloud cover was limited to 1 0 as it is not possible to compute this ratio during nighttime in this case defined during computations as when ra is equal to 0 rs rso calculated between 2 3 hours before sunset was adopted as nighttime rs rso 2 3 hours before sunset from a given day is used in the subsequent nighttime period of the next day it is not possible to obtain rs rso when the previous day is missing in this study a default value 0 6 was used in this case this value was selected based on recommendations of allen et al 1998 which proposes 0 4 to 0 6 in humid and subhumid climates and 0 7 to 0 8 in arid and semiarid climates 2 4 machine learning models all machine learning models were implemented using the python programming language with the aid of the following libraries scikit learn xgboost tensorflow and keras computations were performed using a virtual machine from google cloud platform to train cnn models a virtual machine with a graphics processing unit gpu was used the models hyperparameters were defined by grid search to accomplish this the data set available to train the models was splitted into two subsets the first one named training subset 70 randomly chosen was used to train the models and the second one 30 was used as a validation subset for hyperparameters tuning therefore the hyperparameters values that minimized the error in the validation subset were chosen finally the models were tested with data from the test set 2 4 1 random forest rf random forest rf is a decision tree based algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 this model combines several decision trees fitted in different subsets of the training data each tree is considered a weak learner however the combination of trees ensemble results in a single model with high predictive power huang et al 2019 rf also has the advantage of estimating the importance of each of the input variables regarding the training process rf generally requires less adjustment in hyperparameters the main hyperparameters to be adjusted which were adjusted in this study are the number of trees n estimators and the number of features considered for splitting at each leaf node max features more information about rf can be seen in tyralis et al 2019 the following values were tested for the hyperparameters mentioned above respectively 100 200 400 and 500 trees and all features the square root of the total number of features and one third of the features 2 4 2 extreme gradient boosting xgboost xgboost was recently proposed chen and guestrin 2016 and has gained wide attention in machine learning competitions adam bourdarios et al 2015 this algorithm like rf is based on decision trees differing in the way the tree ensemble is constructed xgboost uses previous ideas from gradient boosting creating each tree based on information from previously created trees xgboost is also able to estimate the importance of input variables and presents a higher computational efficiency and better ability to deal with overfitting fan et al 2018 more information can be obtained in chen and guestrin 2016 in hyperparameters tuning the number of trees n estimators and maximum tree depth max depth were adjusted the number of trees values tested were 100 200 400 and 500 and the maximum tree depth values tested were 3 5 7 9 and 11 2 4 3 artificial neural network ann ann of the feed forward multilayer perceptron mlp type was used it is based on a network of artificial neurons connected by weights which are organized in layers typically an ann is composed of an input layer hidden layers and output layer each layer can have a different number of neurons the input layer has the same size as the number of input variables used the number of neurons in hidden layers is defined by trial and error and the number of neurons in the output layer depends on the problem however for regression tasks one neuron is normally used an ann with three input variables two hidden layers with four and three neurons and one neuron in the output layer is exemplified in fig 4 more information can be obtained in ferreira et al 2019 in this study the ann architectures were defined by trial and error the following combinations were evaluated one and two hidden layers with 10 15 and 20 neurons in each layer for cases that the number of input variables was less than or equal to five i e models trained with daily data and for estimation of hourly eto and one and two hidden layers with 40 50 and 60 neurons in each layer for cases that the number of input variables was more than 49 i e models trained using 24 h hourly data hyperbolic tangent was used as activation function in hidden layers and linear function was used in the output layer to train the ann models the adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 was used learning rate was set to 0 001 the number of training epochs was defined using early stopping with maximum training epochs equal to 300 and patience equal to 20 epochs and batch size was set to 512 2 4 4 convolutional neural network cnn cnn is machine learning model from the deep learning subfield it is a type of neural network that differs from conventional ann i e mlp mainly because it has convolution layers or convolutional filters goodfellow et al 2016 in these layers an automatic feature extraction process is performed in which the features of the input data that are really important to map the relationship between the input variables and the desired output are extracted this ability makes cnn capable of handling raw data without the need for preprocessing or manual feature extraction besides convolutional layers cnn typically has pooling layers which are used to reduce data dimensionality more detailed information on cnn can be found in lecun et al 2015 and goodfellow et al 2016 cnn is generally applied for image processing thus the convolutional filters used have two dimensions 2d cnn like an image however for the analysis of sequential data or time series one dimensional convolutional filters 1d cnn are used li et al 2017 these filters slide over the input data to capture possible patterns contained in the time dimension in the case of time series therefore 1d cnn is used in this study as convolutional layers require input variables with time dimension this model was used only with the input data combination ii i e 24 h hourly data hourly ra the cnn architecture used in this study consisted of two convolutional layers one pooling layer and two fully connected layers with a dropout layer between them fig 5 the number of filters in each convolutional layer kernel size number of neurons in the first fully connected layer and dropout rate were defined by trial and error in each case the following values for each hyperparameter respectively were tested 48 64 96 3 5 7 20 40 60 and 0 0 2 0 4 in convolutional layers stride was set to 1 padding was set to same and the activation function used was relu in the first fully connected layer relu was used as activation function and in the last fully connected layer linear function was used to train the models the adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 was used learning rate was set to 0 001 the number of training epochs was defined using early stopping with maximum training epochs equal to 150 and patience equal to 10 epochs and batch size was set to 512 2 4 5 data normalization to avoid convergence problems during the training of the machine learning models input and output variables were standardized according to eq 2 to ensure that the evaluation of the models during validation and test steps can reflect their application in a real case the mean μ and standard deviation σ were computed using only the data of the training subset not including data from validation subset and test set 2 x ni x i μ σ where xni is the standardized value xi is the observed value μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation 2 5 performance comparison criteria the models were evaluated for each weather station by means of root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe nash sutcliffe efficiency

results and discussion 3 1 regional scenario 3 1 1 temperature based models the results obtained when using etod and etosoh as targets fig 6 generally had the same behavior all the machine learning models developed with 24 h hourly data using daily or hourly ra exhibited better performances than their versions developed with daily input data conventional approach showing lower rmse and higher nse and r2 values the use of hourly ra in relation to daily ra did not promote significant changes in performance the models that estimated daily eto using hourly eto performed poorer than the ones developed with 24 h hourly data however they were slighly better than the models developed with daily input data when considering etod as target and slighly worse when considering etosoh as target when comparing rf xgboost and ann for all data input combinations evaluated the best performances were generally obtained for ann xgboost and rf in this order however when 24 h hourly data with hourly ra were used as input cnn peformed better than all the models with expressive reductions in rmse values and increments in nse values in relation to ann rmse reduced from 0 59 to 0 52 11 9 and from 0 56 to 0 51 8 9 and nse increased from 0 77 to 0 83 7 8 and from 0 80 to 0 84 5 0 when considering etod and etosoh as targets respectively comparing the best results which were found using cnn for both etod and etosoh targets developed using 24 h hourly data and hourly ra with the results found for the best model that used daily data ann for both etod and etosoh targets rmse reduced from 0 70 to 0 52 25 7 and from 0 71 to 0 51 28 2 nse increased from 0 68 to 0 83 22 1 and from 0 69 to 0 84 21 7 and r2 increased from 0 82 to 0 87 6 1 and from 0 79 to 0 88 11 4 when using etod and etosoh as targets respectively 3 1 2 temperature and relative humidity based models for the regional temperature and relative humidity based models the results obtained for etod and etosoh targets fig 7 had similar behaviors again the best results were found for the models that used 24 h hourly data as input the models that estimated daily eto from hourly eto performed the worst however only slightly worse than the models developed with daily input comparing the machine learning models ann was slightly better than rf and xgboost however cnn exhibited the best performance in relation to the ann models developed with 24 h hourly data and hourly ra rmse reduced from 0 50 to 0 47 6 0 and from 0 49 to 0 45 8 2 nse increased from 0 83 to 0 85 2 4 and from 0 84 to 0 87 3 6 and r2 increased from 0 90 to 0 91 1 1 and from 0 90 to 0 91 1 1 when considering etod and etosoh as targets respectively comparing the best results which were found using cnn for both etod and etosoh targets developed using 24 h hourly data and hourly ra with the results found for the best models that used daily data xgboost and ann for etod and etosoh targets respectively rmse reduced from 0 56 to 0 47 16 1 and from 0 57 to 0 45 21 1 nse increased from 0 79 to 0 85 7 6 and from 0 80 to 0 87 8 8 and r2 increased from 0 87 to 0 91 4 6 and from 0 85 to 0 91 7 1 when using etod and etosoh as targets respectively 3 2 local scenario 3 2 1 temperature based models for the temperature based models developed in local scenario the results obtained for etod and etosoh targets fig 8 also generally had the same behavior the best results were found for the models that used 24 h hourly data as input and the worst performance was found for the models that estimated daily eto from hourly eto comparing the machine learning models ann performed a little better than rf and xgboost when considering daily input data and 24 h hourly data with hourly or daily ra however cnn had the best performance among all models but with slight performance improvements in relation to the ann models developed with 24 h hourly data and hourly ra rmse reduced from 0 44 to 0 41 6 8 and from 0 47 to 0 45 4 3 nse increased from 0 88 to 0 89 1 1 and from 0 86 to 0 87 1 2 and r2 increased from 0 88 to 0 90 2 3 and from 0 87 to 0 89 2 3 when considering etod and etosoh as targets respectively comparing the best results which were found using cnn for both etod and etosoh targets developed using 24 h hourly data and hourly ra with the results found for the best model that used daily data ann for both etod and etosoh targets rmse reduced from 0 53 to 0 41 22 6 and from 0 58 to 0 45 22 4 nse increased from 0 82 to 0 89 8 5 and from 0 79 to 0 87 10 1 and r2 increased from 0 83 to 0 90 8 4 and from 0 80 to 0 89 11 3 when using etod and etosoh as targets respectively 3 2 2 temperature and relative humidity based models for the local temperature and relative humidity based models for both etod and etosoh targets the best results were found for the models that used 24 h hourly data as input with hourly or daily ra fig 9 the models that estimated daily eto using hourly eto performed the worst when etod was adopted as target however they slightly outperformed the models that used daily input data when etosoh was adopted as target comparing the machine learning models all the models showed similar performances with a slight advantage for cnn in relation to the ann models developed with 24 h hourly data and hourly ra using cnn rmse reduced from 0 40 to 0 37 7 5 and from 0 44 to 0 41 6 8 nse increased from 0 90 to 0 91 1 1 and from 0 88 to 0 90 2 3 and r2 increased from 0 90 to 0 92 2 2 and from 0 89 to 0 91 2 2 when considering etod and etosoh as targets respectively comparing the best results which were found using cnn for both etod and etosoh targets developed using 24 h hourly data and hourly ra with the results found for the best models that used daily data ann for both etod and etosoh targets rmse reduced from 0 44 to 0 37 15 9 and from 0 50 to 0 41 18 0 nse increased from 0 87 to 0 91 4 6 and from 0 84 to 0 90 7 1 and r2 increased from 0 88 to 0 92 4 5 and from 0 85 to 0 91 7 1 when using etod and etosoh as targets respectively 3 2 3 overall evaluation the use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period for estimation of daily eto provided good results in all cases evaluated outperforming models developed using daily input data conventional approach in contrast the models that estimated daily eto from hourly eto outperformed the models developed with daily input only in some cases and with slight performance gains the use of hourly ra in relation to daily ra in the models that used 24 h hourly data did not promote large changes in the performance of the models however in almost all cases the use of hourly ra provided results equal or slightly higher than those obtained using daily ra for the penman monteith equation the estimation of daily eto by summing hourly eto values is considered more accurate under certain conditions allen et al 1998 althoff et al 2019 djaman et al 2018 irmak et al 2005 pereira et al 2015 according to pereira et al 2015 this is because hourly calculation keeps radiation and aerodynamic parameters synchronized in time however for machine learning using limited meteorological data the estimation of daily eto by summing hourly eto was not an effective strategy since it promotes performance gains which were slight only in some cases it is possibly related to the higher complexity of hourly calculation as it considers soil heat flux and different surface resistances during nighttime and daytime in addition the rs rso ratio used to represent cloud cover adopted during nighttime depends on data from 2 3 hours after sunset which were not considered by the machine learning nevertheless as there were some performance gains in part of the cases evaluated this approach must be further investigated in future studies an evaluation by hour of the ann models which generally performed the best is presented in appendix a fig a4 the best machine learning models obtained when daily data and hourly data with hourly ra were considered as input as well as their performance metrics are presented in table 1 it should be highlighted that when using temperature based models developed with 24 h hourly data with hourly ra rmse nse and r2 values were better than those obtained with the temperature and relative humidity based models developed with daily data in some cases lower errors have been found when etod was used as target instead of etosoh with rmse differences ranging from 0 01 to 0 06 table 1 however it is important to highlight that when comparing etod against etosoh reference rmse values ranging from 0 24 to 0 32 were obtained table 2 irmak et al 2005 reported rmse ranging from 0 25 to 0 56 united states of america althoff et al 2019 found mean rmse equal to 0 22 brazil including the study area of this study and djaman et al 2018 found rmse ranging from 0 36 to 0 84 africa therefore assuming that etosoh is more accurate than etod allen et al 1998 althoff et al 2019 djaman et al 2018 irmak et al 2005 pereira et al 2015 and that the rmse differences obtained in this study when etod and etosoh were used as targets are much smaller than the etod errors showed above it is recommended to use the machine learning models developed with etosoh as target when etosoh was used as target the models developed with 24 h hourly data provided performance gains over the models that used daily data table 1 this behavior is to a certain extent already expected since to obtain etosoh hourly data are needed however as the use of 24 h hourly data also provided gains when etod was used as target table 1 it can be concluded that this approach has a real potential to improve the estimation of eto under limited data availability for the same input data the models developed in local scenario had better performance than the models developed in regional scenario table 1 this behavior is very common since eto modeling is more complex in regional scenario kiafar et al 2017 reis et al 2019 shiri et al 2014 however it is worth mentioning that local models are specific for the climatic conditions of the place where they were developed therefore regional models have a key role in places without full datasets to use the penman monteith equation or to develop local models although local models typically perform better in this study the regional models developed using hourly data outperformed the local models developed with daily data except in the case of the temperature and relative humidity based models with etod target table 1 in addition to boxplots and mean values of performance metrics it is also convenient to analyze scatter plots of predicted vs observed values and the behavior of the models in space thus scatter plots and the distribution of nse and mbe values in space for the machine learning models listed in table 1 are presented for each test weather station in figs 10 12 respectively it can be noted that when using 24 h hourly data more accurate predictions were found fig 10 in addition in general the use of 24 h hourly data provided performance gains showing higher nse values and lower mbe absolute values in all the study region figs 11 and 12 as the study area includes a wide range of climatic regimes figs 2 and 3 it is indicated that the proposed approach performs well under different climatic conditions it is also important to note that the use of relative humidity generally promoted performance increments in all the study area mainly for the models developed with daily input data although the role of relative humidity can be more important in arid or semi arid regions in the present study this variable also provided performance gains in humid regions southern minas gerais ferreira et al 2019 also reported performance improvements when adding relative humidity to temperature in machine learning models developed for brazil the performance gains obtained with the use of 24 h hourly data is probably because the models have captured patterns in the data measured along the day that can be associated with other variables not used as input for instance it is known that the difference between daily maximum and minimum air temperatures can be used as a cloud cover indicator which is related to solar radiation allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 therefore this and other patterns useful in eto modeling can be empirically explored for machine learning models when using 24 h hourly data improving eto modeling this approach can also be evaluated in future studies for estimation of other meteorological variables when comparing the traditional machine learning models i e rf xgboost and ann in general they performed similar but ann models exhibited slightly higher performances however cnn outperformed all the models in all the cases studied offering the best performance to estimate daily eto the highest performance gains promoted by the cnn models were found for the temperature based models developed in regional scenario in which in relation to ann rmse decreased by 11 9 and 8 9 and nse increased by 7 8 and 5 0 for etod and etosoh targets respectively the good performance obtained for cnn is probably because it was able to extract features from the hourly input data that were not captured by the other models evaluated the automatic feature extraction is a powerful characteristic of cnn which allow it to identify the most useful features which are discriminative information from raw data without the need for preprocessing lecun et al 2015 ng et al 2019 the findings of this study corroborate other studies in which cnn has outperformed traditional machine learning models reaching the best performance haidar and verma 2018 lecun et al 2015 ng et al 2019 shen 2018 the use cnn to estimate daily eto using 24 h hourly data and hourly ra promoted great performance gains in relation to the use of traditional machine models with daily input data conventional approach table 1 therefore the proposed approach can be used to estimate eto at a low cost and with good accuracy in future studies other cnn architectures can be explored in addition other deep learning models such as long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru can be assessed 4 conclusions this study assessed for the first time in regional and local scenarios the use of limited hourly meteorological data temperature and relative humidity or only temperature to estimate daily eto directly and by summing hourly eto values employing rf xgboost ann and cnn the following options were evaluated i use of daily input data conventional approach ii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and hourly ra to estimate daily eto directly iii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and daily ra to estimate daily eto directly and iv use of hourly data to estimate hourly eto and then to estimate daily eto by summing hourly eto all the options used ra as input to develop and evaluate the models two types of targets were considered etod daily eto computed using the daily version of asce pm equation and etosoh daily eto computed by summing hourly eto obtained with the asce pm equation in all cases the best results were found using hourly data to estimate daily eto directly with hourly or daily ra in contrast when estimating daily eto from hourly eto better results in relation to the use of daily input data were found only in some cases the use of limited 24 h hourly data to estimate daily eto can enable better estimates of eto at a low cost this idea can also be assessed in other places and to estimate other meteorological variables when compared to the models developed with daily data in regional scenario for temperature based models the use of 24 h hourly data hourly ra reduced rmse by up to 28 2 and increased nse and r2 by up to 21 7 and 11 4 respectively for temperature and relative humidity based models rmse reduced by up to 21 1 and nse and r2 increased by up to 8 8 and 7 1 respectively in local scenario for temperature based models rmse reduced by up to 22 4 and nse and r2 increased by up to 10 1 and 11 3 respectively for temperature and relative humidity based models rmse reduced by up to 18 0 and nse and r2 increased by up to 7 1 and 7 1 respectively in general ann performed slightly better than the other traditional machine learning models i e rf and xgboost being the best model to estimate eto with daily input data in almost all cases however cnn exhibited the best performance when hourly data were used as input offering the most accurate eto estimates cnn models provided performance gains in terms of rmse and nse up to 11 9 and 7 8 respectively in relation to ann models with the same input data future studies can explore the potential of other cnn

10630,computation of reference evapotranspiration eto poses a challenge under limited meteorological data availability however even in this case hourly data may be available since low cost sensors can report hourly measurements this study evaluates for the first time in regional and local scenarios the use of limited hourly meteorological data temperature and relative humidity or only temperature to estimate daily eto directly and by summing hourly eto values employing rf xgboost ann and cnn the following options were evaluated i use of daily input data conventional approach ii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period hourly extraterrestrial radiation ra to estimate daily eto directly iii the same configuration of the last option but with daily ra instead of hourly ra and iv use of hourly data to estimate hourly eto and then to estimate daily eto by summing hourly eto all options used ra to develop and evaluate the models two daily eto targets were considered etod computed using the daily version of the asce pm equation and etosoh computed by summing hourly eto obtained with the asce pm equation data from 53 weather stations located in the state of minas gerais brazil were used for all models the best results were found using hourly data to estimate daily eto directly cnn models developed with 24 h hourly data hourly ra offered the best performance in all cases in relation to the best models developed with daily data rmse reduced by up to 28 2 0 71 to 0 51 and nse and r2 increased by up to 21 7 0 69 to 0 84 and 11 4 0 79 to 0 88 respectively in regional scenario in local scenario rmse reduced by up to 22 4 0 58 to 0 45 and nse and r2 increased by up to 10 1 0 79 to 0 87 and 11 3 0 80 to 0 89 respectively keywords 1d cnn convolutional neural network irrigation scheduling neural network random forest 1 introduction reliable estimates of reference evapotranspiration eto are crucial in tasks such as irrigation scheduling water resource management and hydrological studies given the complexity involved with the direct measurement of this parameter it is commonly estimated based on meteorological data pereira et al 2015 to do so the fao 56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation allen et al 1998 or the asce american society of civil engineers penman monteith asce pm equation asce ewri 2005 can be used these equations although well accepted in practical applications and academic research require meteorological data temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed that may be partially unavailable in some locations therefore several studies have investigated alternative equations such as the well known hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 to estimate eto with reduced data requirement ahooghalandari et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 paredes and pereira 2019 valiantzas 2018 zanetti et al 2019 in the last years machine learning models have been successfully used to estimate eto with fewer meteorological data these models are capable of capturing complex relationships between input and output data which makes them powerful tools in eto modeling various models have been assessed such as artificial neural network ann ferreira et al 2019 kumar et al 2011 nourani et al 2019 wu and fan 2019 support vector machine svm ferreira et al 2019 mehdizadeh et al 2017 nourani et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy

general machine learning models have outperformed conventional equations for estimation of eto reaching higher performances for the same data requirement fan et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 kiafar et al 2017 kumar et al 2011 mehdizadeh et al 2017 reis et al 2019 in the standard approach to develop a model to estimate daily eto daily meteorological data are used as input however in some cases even with limited availability of meteorological data hourly data may be available for instance a simplified automatic weather station with only an air temperature sensor can report hourly measurements in this situation only daily maximum and minimum temperatures would be used when considering the standard approach losing any possible extra information contained in hourly data to obtain possible benefits in using limited hourly data to estimate daily eto there are two options i to sum hourly eto values estimated with limited hourly data and ii to use models than can estimate daily eto directly using all the hourly data measured during a 24 h time period in relation to the first option there are only a few studies that evaluated estimation of hourly eto with limited data alexandris and kerkides 2003 chatzithomas 2019 chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 naderianfar et al 2017 trajkovic 2010 2011 in addition these studies generally do not evaluate the models considering daily scale therefore there is still a gap in the efficiency of this approach against traditional methods to estimate daily eto i e using daily data regarding the second option above mentioned according to our knowledge so far no study investigated the use of limited hourly data to estimate daily eto directly it should be highlighted that models that can capture additional information from hourly data may achieve higher accuracy in estimation of daily eto it is especially important for temperature based models due to the following reasons i temperature based models commonly do not exhibit high performances ii temperature sensors are generally cheaper than sensors to measure relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation iii advances in estimation of eto using only air temperature can enable the development of low cost systems for irrigation scheduling it is also worth mentioning that the inclusion of relative humidity in addition to temperature in eto models can contribute to achieve higher performance at a low additional cost exner kittridge 2012 valiantzas 2012 2018 when using hourly data obtained during a 24 h time period it is possible to employ models that can handle sequential data in this sense convolutional neural network cnn can be used cnn is a deep learning model that has gained a lot of attention in image recognition field including applications in agricultural area dyrmann et al 2016 ji et al 2018 kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018a b lecun et al 2015 in the case of sequential data or time series like hourly meteorological data one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn an especial type of cnn can be used abdeljaber et al 2018 canizo et al 2019 gao et al 2019 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 ng et al 2019 in hydrology climatology field studies using 1d cnn are still very scarce haidar and verma 2018 generally cnn has outperformed traditional machine learning models in many studies reaching state of the art performances despite its high capabilities deep learning models such as cnn have not been very explored in hydrological sciences as reported for shen 2018 in an extensive review study in estimation of eto according to our knowledge so far cnn was not used considering the importance of reliable estimates of eto using reduced datasets the objective of the present study is to assess for the first time in regional and local scenarios the use of limited hourly meteorological data temperature and relative humidity or only temperature to estimate daily eto directly and by summing hourly eto values employing rf xgboost ann and cnn 2 materials and methods 2 1 database study sites and data management hourly data from 53 automatic weather stations of the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet were used all the stations are located in the state of minas gerais brazil the data length varied according to the stations given their different epochs of creation with a mean length of 11 7 1 34 years all the stations have data up to the year 2018 the data length of each station is presented in appendix a maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were collected wind speed measured at 10 m height was converted to 2 m according to allen et al 1998 days with missing or faulty data were removed faulty data were identified in daily scale when minimum temperature was higher than maximum temperature relative humidity out of the range 0 100 minimum relative humidity higher than maximum relative humidity negative wind speed negative solar radiation or solar radiation higher than extraterrestrial radiation to perform the analysis two scenarios were considered i regional models were trained with pooled data from 43 weather stations and evaluated in the 10 remaining stations and ii local models were trained and evaluated using individual data from the 10 weather stations used for evaluation in the previous scenario the 10 stations mentioned were selected in order to represent different climatic conditions in both regional and local scenarios data up to 2013 were used in the training process of the models and data from 2014 to 2018 were used to test them fig 1 the weather stations split as well as their locations and climate classification alvares et al 2013 can be seen in fig 2 aridity index ia unep united nations environmental programme 1997 ratio between annual precipitation to annual reference evapotranspiration annual reference evapotranspiration and annual precipitation are presented in fig 3 it can be noted that the study area covers a wide variety of climatic conditions with ia ranging from 0 31 to 1 61 more details on the climatic characteristics of the study sites are presented in appendix a 2 2 input data for the machine learning models to explore the potential of hourly limited meteorological data to estimate daily eto the following approaches were employed to develop the machine learning models i use of daily data to estimate daily eto conventional approach ii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and hourly extraterrestrial radiation ra to estimate daily eto directly iii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and daily ra to estimate daily eto directly and iv use of hourly data to estimate hourly eto and then to estimate daily eto by summing hourly eto approaches i and iv also used ra in daily and hourly scales respectively the variation in ra scale approaches ii and iii was done in order to verify the effect of ra scale in the estimation of eto two meteorological data availability options were assessed temperature based models and temperature and relative humidity based models in the first option maximum temperature minimum temperature and ra were considered in the second option in addition to the data of the first option maximum and minimum relative humidity were used 2 3 targets for development and evaluation of the machine learning models when developing models for estimation of eto it is a common practice to use eto estimated by the fao56 pm equation or asce pm equation which is used in this study as target for that one can estimate daily eto using the daily version of penman monteith equation here called etod or summing hourly eto obtained with the hourly version of penman monteith equation here called etosoh the last option is generally considered more accurate under certain scenarios allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 althoff et al 2019 in addition when developing models to estimate hourly eto using hourly eto obtained by the penman monteith equation as target it is convenient to use etosoh to evaluate them in daily scale however it is obvious to expect that when using etosoh as target machine learning models developed with hourly input data will perform better than their versions developed with daily data since hourly data were used to calculate the target therefore when considering etod as additional target if hourly data also provide performance increments for this target this gain can be associated with their capability to better capture climate patterns related to eto which may not be as clear when using only etosoh as target thus in this study the two types of daily eto targets i e etod and etosoh were employed to develop and evaluate the machine learning models for direct estimation of daily eto cases i ii and iii models developed for estimation of hourly eto case iv used hourly eto as target and were evaluated in daily scale using both etod and etosoh to compute eto in both hourly and daily scale the asce pm equation allen et al 2006 eq 1 was employed asce pm differs from fao pm in the surface resistance values adopted for hourly time step however allen et al 2006 recommended to use fao pm with the same surface resistance values used in asce pm the calculation of all parameters necessary to use asce pm was done based on fao 56 paper 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ

cd is equal to 0 34 s m 1 for daily time step and 0 24 and 0 96 s m 1 for hourly time step during daytime rn 0 and nighttime respectively for rn computation the ratio between solar radiation and clear sky solar radiation rs rso which is used to represent cloud cover was limited to 1 0 as it is not possible to compute this ratio during nighttime in this case defined during computations as when ra is equal to 0 rs rso calculated between 2 3 hours before sunset was adopted as nighttime rs rso 2 3 hours before sunset from a given day is used in the subsequent nighttime period of the next day it is not possible to obtain rs rso when the previous day is missing in this study a default value 0 6 was used in this case this value was selected based on recommendations of allen et al 1998 which proposes 0 4 to 0 6 in humid and subhumid climates and 0 7 to 0 8 in arid and semiarid climates 2 4 machine learning models all machine learning models were implemented using the python programming language with the aid of the following libraries scikit learn xgboost tensorflow and keras computations were performed using a virtual machine from google cloud platform to train cnn models a virtual machine with a graphics processing unit gpu was used the models hyperparameters were defined by grid search to accomplish this the data set available to train the models was splitted into two subsets the first one named training subset 70 randomly chosen was used to train the models and the second one 30 was used as a validation subset for hyperparameters tuning therefore the hyperparameters values that minimized the error in the validation subset were chosen finally the models were tested with data from the test set 2 4 1 random forest rf random forest rf is a decision tree based algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 this model combines several decision trees fitted in different subsets of the training data each tree is considered a weak learner however the combination of trees ensemble results in a single model with high predictive power huang et al 2019 rf also has the advantage of estimating the importance of each of the input variables regarding the training process rf generally requires less adjustment in hyperparameters the main hyperparameters to be adjusted which were adjusted in this study are the number of trees n estimators and the number of features considered for splitting at each leaf node max features more information about rf can be seen in tyralis et al 2019 the following values were tested for the hyperparameters mentioned above respectively 100 200 400 and 500 trees and all features the square root of the total number of features and one third of the features 2 4 2 extreme gradient boosting xgboost xgboost was recently proposed chen and guestrin 2016 and has gained wide attention in machine learning competitions adam bourdarios et al 2015 this algorithm like rf is based on decision trees differing in the way the tree ensemble is constructed xgboost uses previous ideas from gradient boosting creating each tree based on information from previously created trees xgboost is also able to estimate the importance of input variables and presents a higher computational efficiency and better ability to deal with overfitting fan et al 2018 more information can be obtained in chen and guestrin 2016 in hyperparameters tuning the number of trees n estimators and maximum tree depth max depth were adjusted the number of trees values tested were 100 200 400 and 500 and the maximum tree depth values tested were 3 5 7 9 and 11 2 4 3 artificial neural network ann ann of the feed forward multilayer perceptron mlp type was used it is based on a network of artificial neurons connected by weights which are organized in layers typically an ann is composed of an input layer hidden layers and output layer each layer can have a different number of neurons the input layer has the same size as the number of input variables used the number of neurons in hidden layers is defined by trial and error and the number of neurons in the output layer depends on the problem however for regression tasks one neuron is normally used an ann with three input variables two hidden layers with four and three neurons and one neuron in the output layer is exemplified in fig 4 more information can be obtained in ferreira et al 2019 in this study the ann architectures were defined by trial and error the following combinations were evaluated one and two hidden layers with 10 15 and 20 neurons in each layer for cases that the number of input variables was less than or equal to five i e models trained with daily data and for estimation of hourly eto and one and two hidden layers with 40 50 and 60 neurons in each layer for cases that the number of input variables was more than 49 i e models trained using 24 h hourly data hyperbolic tangent was used as activation function in hidden layers and linear function was used in the output layer to train the ann models the adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 was used learning rate was set to 0 001 the number of training epochs was defined using early stopping with maximum training epochs equal to 300 and patience equal to 20 epochs and batch size was set to 512 2 4 4 convolutional neural network cnn cnn is machine learning model from the deep learning subfield it is a type of neural network that differs from conventional ann i e mlp mainly because it has convolution layers or convolutional filters goodfellow et al 2016 in these layers an automatic feature extraction process is performed in which the features of the input data that are really important to map the relationship between the input variables and the desired output are extracted this ability makes cnn capable of handling raw data without the need for preprocessing or manual feature extraction besides convolutional layers cnn typically has pooling layers which are used to reduce data dimensionality more detailed information on cnn can be found in lecun et al 2015 and goodfellow et al 2016 cnn is generally applied for image processing thus the convolutional filters used have two dimensions 2d cnn like an image however for the analysis of sequential data or time series one dimensional convolutional filters 1d cnn are used li et al 2017 these filters slide over the input data to capture possible patterns contained in the time dimension in the case of time series therefore 1d cnn is used in this study as convolutional layers require input variables with time dimension this model was used only with the input data combination ii i e 24 h hourly data hourly ra the cnn architecture used in this study consisted of two convolutional layers one pooling layer and two fully connected layers with a dropout layer between them fig 5 the number of filters in each convolutional layer kernel size number of neurons in the first fully connected layer and dropout rate were defined by trial and error in each case the following values for each hyperparameter respectively were tested 48 64 96 3 5 7 20 40 60 and 0 0 2 0 4 in convolutional layers stride was set to 1 padding was set to same and the activation function used was relu in the first fully connected layer relu was used as activation function and in the last fully connected layer linear function was used to train the models the adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 was used learning rate was set to 0 001 the number of training epochs was defined using early stopping with maximum training epochs equal to 150 and patience equal to 10 epochs and batch size was set to 512 2 4 5 data normalization to avoid convergence problems during the training of the machine learning models input and output variables were standardized according to eq 2 to ensure that the evaluation of the models during validation and test steps can reflect their application in a real case the mean μ and standard deviation σ were computed using only the data of the training subset not including data from validation subset and test set 2 x ni x i μ σ where xni is the standardized value xi is the observed value μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation 2 5 performance comparison criteria the models were evaluated for each weather station by means of root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe nash sutcliffe efficiency

results and discussion 3 1 regional scenario 3 1 1 temperature based models the results obtained when using etod and etosoh as targets fig 6 generally had the same behavior all the machine learning models developed with 24 h hourly data using daily or hourly ra exhibited better performances than their versions developed with daily input data conventional approach showing lower rmse and higher nse and r2 values the use of hourly ra in relation to daily ra did not promote significant changes in performance the models that estimated daily eto using hourly eto performed poorer than the ones developed with 24 h hourly data however they were slighly better than the models developed with daily input data when considering etod as target and slighly worse when considering etosoh as target when comparing rf xgboost and ann for all data input combinations evaluated the best performances were generally obtained for ann xgboost and rf in this order however when 24 h hourly data with hourly ra were used as input cnn peformed better than all the models with expressive reductions in rmse values and increments in nse values in relation to ann rmse reduced from 0 59 to 0 52 11 9 and from 0

targets respectively 3 1 2 temperature and relative humidity based models for the regional temperature and relative humidity based models the results obtained for etod and etosoh targets fig 7 had similar behaviors again the best results were found for the models that used 24 h hourly data as input the models that estimated daily eto from hourly eto performed the worst however only slightly worse than the models developed with daily input comparing the machine learning models ann was slightly better than rf and xgboost however cnn exhibited the best performance in relation to the ann models developed with 24 h hourly data and hourly ra rmse reduced from 0 50 to 0 47 6 0 and from 0 49 to 0 45 8 2 nse increased from 0 83 to 0 85 2 4 and from 0 84 to 0 87 3 6 and r2 increased from 0

local scenario 3 2 1 temperature based models for the temperature based models developed in local scenario the results obtained for etod and etosoh targets fig 8 also generally had the same behavior

learning models ann performed a little better than rf and xgboost when considering daily input data and 24 h hourly data with hourly or daily ra however cnn had the best performance among all models

results were found for the models that used 24 h hourly data as input with hourly or daily ra fig 9 the models that estimated daily eto using hourly eto performed the worst when etod was adopted as target however they slightly outperformed the models that used daily input data when etosoh was adopted as target comparing the machine learning models all the models showed similar performances with a slight advantage for cnn in relation to the ann models developed with 24 h hourly data and hourly ra using cnn rmse reduced from 0 40 to 0 37 7 5 and from 0 44 to 0 41 6 8 nse increased from 0 90 to

reduced from 0 44 to 0 37 15 9 and from 0 50 to 0 41 18 0 nse increased from 0 87 to 0 91 4 6 and from 0 84 to 0 90 7 1 and r2 increased from 0 88 to 0 92 4 5 and from 0 85 to 0 91 7 1 when using etod and etosoh as targets respectively 3 2 3 overall evaluation the use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period for estimation of daily eto provided good results in all cases evaluated outperforming models developed using daily input data conventional approach in contrast the models that estimated daily eto from hourly eto outperformed the models developed with daily input only in some cases and with slight performance gains the use of hourly ra in relation to daily ra in the models that used 24 h hourly data did not promote large changes in the performance of the models however in almost all cases the use of hourly ra provided results equal or slightly higher than those obtained using daily ra for the penman monteith equation the estimation of daily eto by summing hourly eto values is considered more accurate under certain conditions allen et al 1998 althoff et al 2019 djaman et al 2018 irmak et al 2005 pereira et al 2015 according to pereira et al 2015 this is because hourly calculation keeps radiation and aerodynamic parameters synchronized in time however for machine learning using limited meteorological data the estimation of daily eto by summing hourly eto was not an effective strategy since it promotes performance gains which were slight only in some cases it is possibly related to the higher complexity of hourly calculation as it considers soil heat flux and different surface resistances during nighttime and daytime in addition the rs rso ratio used to represent cloud cover adopted during nighttime depends on data from 2 3 hours after sunset which were not considered by the machine learning nevertheless as there were some performance gains in part of the cases evaluated this approach must be further investigated in future studies an evaluation by hour of the ann models which generally performed the best is presented in appendix a fig a4 the best machine learning models obtained when daily data and hourly data with hourly ra were considered as input as well as their performance metrics are presented in table 1 it should be highlighted that when using temperature based models developed with 24 h hourly data with hourly ra rmse nse and r2 values were better than those obtained with the temperature and relative humidity based models developed with daily data in some cases lower errors have been found when etod was used as target instead of etosoh with rmse differences ranging from 0 01 to 0 06 table 1 however it is important to highlight that when comparing etod against etosoh reference rmse values ranging from 0 24 to 0 32 were obtained table 2 irmak et al 2005 reported rmse ranging from 0 25 to 0 56 united states of america althoff et al 2019 found mean rmse equal to 0 22 brazil including the study area of this study and djaman et al 2018 found rmse ranging from 0 36 to 0 84 africa therefore assuming that etosoh is more accurate than etod allen et al 1998 althoff et al 2019 djaman et al 2018 irmak et al 2005 pereira et al 2015 and that the rmse differences obtained in this study when etod and etosoh were used as targets are much smaller than the etod errors showed above it is recommended to use the machine learning models developed with etosoh as target when etosoh was used as target the models developed with 24 h hourly data provided performance gains over the models that used daily data table 1 this behavior is to a certain extent already expected since to obtain etosoh hourly data are needed however as the use of 24 h hourly data also provided gains when etod was used as target table 1 it can be concluded that this approach has a real potential to improve the estimation of eto under limited data availability for the same input data the models developed in local scenario had better performance than the models developed in regional scenario table 1 this behavior is very common since eto modeling is more complex in regional scenario kiafar et al 2017 reis et al 2019 shiri et al 2014 however it is worth mentioning that local models are specific for the climatic conditions of the place where they were developed therefore regional models have a key role in places without full datasets to use the penman monteith equation or to develop local models although local models typically perform better in this study the regional models developed using hourly data outperformed the local models developed with daily data except in the case of the temperature and relative humidity based models with etod target table 1 in addition to boxplots and mean values of performance metrics it is also convenient to analyze scatter plots of predicted vs observed values and the behavior of the models in space thus scatter plots and the distribution of nse and mbe values in space for the machine learning models listed in table 1 are presented for each test weather station in figs 10 12 respectively it can be noted that when using 24 h hourly data more accurate predictions were found fig 10 in addition in general the use of 24 h hourly data provided performance gains showing higher nse values and lower mbe absolute values in all the study region figs 11 and 12 as the study area includes a wide range of climatic regimes figs 2 and 3 it is indicated that the proposed approach performs well under different climatic conditions it is also important to note that the use of relative humidity generally promoted performance increments in all the study area mainly for the models developed with daily input data although the role of relative humidity can be more important in arid or semi arid regions in the present study this variable also provided performance gains in humid regions southern minas gerais ferreira et al 2019 also reported performance improvements when adding relative humidity to temperature in machine learning models developed for brazil the performance gains obtained with the use of 24 h hourly data is probably because the models have captured patterns in the data measured along the day that can be associated with other variables not used as input for instance it is known that the difference between daily maximum and minimum air temperatures can be used as a cloud cover indicator which is related to solar radiation allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 therefore this and other patterns useful in eto modeling can be empirically explored for machine learning models when using 24 h hourly data improving eto modeling this approach can also be evaluated in future studies for estimation of other meteorological variables when comparing the traditional machine learning models i e rf xgboost and ann in general they performed similar but ann models exhibited slightly higher performances however cnn outperformed all the models in all the cases studied offering the best performance to estimate daily eto the highest performance gains promoted by the cnn models were found for the temperature based models developed in regional scenario in which in relation to ann rmse decreased by 11 9 and 8 9 and nse increased by 7 8 and 5 0 for etod and etosoh targets respectively the good performance obtained for cnn is probably because it was able to extract features from the hourly input data that were not captured by the other models evaluated the automatic feature extraction is a powerful characteristic of cnn which allow it to identify the most useful features which are discriminative information from raw data without the need for preprocessing lecun et al 2015 ng et al 2019 the findings of this study corroborate other studies in which cnn has outperformed traditional machine learning models reaching the best performance haidar and verma 2018 lecun et al 2015 ng et al 2019 shen 2018 the use cnn to estimate daily eto using 24 h hourly data and hourly ra promoted great performance gains in relation to the use of traditional machine models with daily input data conventional approach table 1 therefore the proposed approach can be used to estimate eto at a low cost and with good accuracy in future studies other cnn architectures can be explored in addition other deep learning models such as long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru can be assessed 4 conclusions this study assessed for the first time in regional and local scenarios the use of limited hourly meteorological data temperature and relative humidity or only temperature to estimate daily eto directly and by summing hourly eto values employing rf xgboost ann and cnn the following options were evaluated i use of daily input data conventional approach ii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and hourly ra to estimate daily eto directly iii use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period and daily ra to estimate daily eto directly and iv use of hourly data to estimate hourly eto and then to estimate daily eto by summing hourly eto all the options used ra as input to develop and evaluate the models two types of targets were considered etod daily eto computed using the daily version of asce pm equation and etosoh daily eto computed by summing hourly eto obtained with the asce pm equation in all cases the best results were found using hourly data to estimate daily eto directly with hourly or daily ra in contrast when estimating daily eto from hourly eto better results in relation to the use of daily input data were found only in some cases the use of limited 24 h hourly data to estimate daily eto can enable better estimates of eto at a low cost this idea can also be assessed in other places and to estimate other meteorological variables when compared to the models developed with daily data in regional scenario for temperature based models the use of 24 h hourly data hourly ra reduced rmse by up to 28 2 and increased nse and r2 by up to 21 7 and 11 4 respectively for temperature and relative humidity based models rmse reduced by up to 21 1 and nse and r2 increased by up to 8 8 and 7 1 respectively in local scenario for temperature based models rmse reduced by up to 22 4 and nse and r2 increased by up to 10 1 and 11 3 respectively for temperature and relative humidity based models rmse reduced by up to 18 0 and nse and r2 increased by up to 7 1 and 7 1 respectively in general ann performed slightly better than the other traditional machine learning models i e rf and xgboost being the best model to estimate eto with daily input data in almost all cases however cnn exhibited the best performance when hourly data were used as input offering the most accurate eto estimates cnn models provided performance gains in terms of rmse and nse up to 11 9 and 7 8 respectively in relation to ann models with the same input data future studies can explore the potential of other cnn

10631,applying saline water resources for irrigating croplands requires serious attentions when sustainable agriculture is considered a two year field investigation was carried out in a drip irrigated sunflower field under six irrigation treatments including i full freshwater irrigation fi full irrigation with diluted seawater ds si alternate ds freshwater irrigation fsi freshwater prd partial root zone drying irrigation with 25 less water than full prd1 ds prd irrigation with 25 less water than full prd2 alternate ds freshwater irrigation under prd with 25 less water than full prd3 in three replicates compared to the fi treatment crop yield was reduced by 3 1 32 with the lowest one under prd1 among the ds treatments prd3 resulted in the highest grain yield 4306 kg ha 1 grain nitrogen content 2 83 oil yield 1907 kg ha 1 and irrigation water productivity 1 10 prd3 also saved freshwater by 20 and kept soil salinity of the rooting zone below the maximum crop tolerance threshold based on the results prd3 might be a cost effective pathway which guarantees the sustainable application of diluted seawater in the irrigated sunflower lands keywords diluted seawater irrigation water productivity partial root zone drying sunflower production salt accumulation 1 introduction while food demand follows a significant increasing trend in response to the rapid population growth freshwater scarcity is becoming a momentous restriction to food production all over the world hence serious attempt is required to improve agricultural water productivity especially within the irrigated lands which has a highlighted role in global crop production among various insights introduced for increasing water use efficiency wue sezen et al 2011a yazar et al 2015 rahil and qanadillo 2015 consoli et al 2017 partial root zone drying prd introduced by dry and loveys 1998 is known as one of the most effective pathways regarding its positive effect on crop and water productivity eg kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006b 2007 shahnazari et al 2007 2008 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 jovanovic et al 2010 mousavi et al 2010 sezen et al 2011a pedrero et al 2014 beis and patakas 2015 lima et al 2015 ghadami firouzabadi et al 2015 karandish and simunek 2016a 2016b karandish and simunek 2017 2018 in this method only half of the rooting zone is irrigated at each irrigation event while the other half is dried out dry and loveys 2000 nevertheless there is a general belief among these scientists that prd s efficiency may vary by crop types and the experimental conditions such as climatic condition the duration of the stress period the level of water deficit over the stress period the time of shifting the wetted and dried parts over the stress period and irrigation water quality are among those parameters shahnazari et al 2007 sezen et al 2011a ghrab et al 2013 and 2014 pedrero et al 2014 irrigation water quality is among the most predominant factor affecting prd s efficiency hence substituting freshwater with saline water when irrigation crops may alter prd results although being a rational solution under freshwater scarcity adopted by numerous researchers eg flagella et al 2004 botia et al 2005 mori et al 2008 chen et al 2009 nagaz et al 2012 huang et al 2012 yazar et al 2015 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 aditya et al 2017 showed that a fixed application of poor quality irrigation water may reduce leaf area index and grain protein content of sorghum while an alternative application of poor quality and freshwater resources for irrigation may maintain these indices at the favorable level for a mediterranean climate the quinoa response to irrigation water quality has been investigated by yazar et al 2015 results indicated that increasing irrigation salinity to 30 ds m 1 may result in a slight reduction in both grain yield and total biomass a highlighted decrease in corn yield under saline water irrigation has also been reported by amer 2010 kang et al 2010 reported that irrigating maize with saline water may result in a considerable reduction in crop height leaf area index and maize grain yield while sea water resources could be a potential saline water resource for agricultural purpose only a few researches investigated the probable consequences of applying such water resources in the irrigated lands izzo et al 2008 pedrero et al 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 as a general belief the more the contribution of sea water in the mixed saline freshwater provided for irrigation is the more negative impacts are expected to the best of our knowledge the probable consequences of seawater application under prd has not been investigated yet in addition researches on the application of the saline water resources under prd are still in its infancy and is considered by quite a few researchers recently through a field modelling approach karandish and simunek 2018 tried to find out the most optimal irrigation fertigation management scenario either for deficit irrigation or for prd under saline water irrigation their finding well indicated that there is an urgent need for adjusting fertilization rate as well as irrigation water depth for prd when saline water is applied ghrab et al 2013 and 2014 investigated the consequences of applying prd with saline water on the 9 years olive trees their finding well indicated that prd with saline water is a promising strategy for sustainably produce olives within the arid regions since in one hand both crop yield and quality properties were maintained at the favorable level and on the other hand less salt was accumulated in the soil at final harvest in this paper we worked toward filling such knowledge gap based on data collected through a two year field investigation in a drip irrigated sunflower field to the best of our knowledge our research is noble in the following ways i a mixed fresh sea water resource was supplied when saline prd irrigation was applied ii and instead of applying prd with various water deficit level which is a regular management adopted by the previous researches prd was applied under various management scenarios rather than adjusting the irrigation water depth the main objective of this research was to find out the most efficient freshwater saving irrigation strategy for sunflower regarding both economic and environmental losses when saline water resources are required to be applied for irrigation to address this issue the following objectives were evaluated i to describe crop growth response during the cropping cycles ii to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative crop properties at final harvest iii to compare freshwater saving and irrigation water productivity at final harvest iv to evaluate the increase in the electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste ece at different soil verticals at final harvest v and finally to find out the most freshwater efficient irrigation strategy within the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and weather a two year field investigation has been carried out during 2014 and 2015 gowing seasons in a 450 m2 experimental farm 15 m 30 m located in sari

the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation of 616 mm and 2500 mm respectively the study area is classified as a humid region most of the annual precipitation about 70 occurs during autumn and winter seasons the long term average minimum and maximum air temperatures are 17 3 6 and 38 9 c respectively karandish and simunek 2016b 2017 daily variation of climatic variables during the study period i e sunflower growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 are displayed in fig 2 a total of 15 2 mm and 35 mm precipitation was recorded over 2014 and 2015 gowing seasons respectively 1 2 mm and 11 mm of which occurred after 55 and 44 days after planting dap in 2014 and 2015 gowing seasons respectively over the study period in 2014 daily average air temperature varied in the range of 25 31 c which was almost higher than those recorded for the 2015 gowing season during 57 of the days the reference evapotranspiration et0 varied in the range of 3 5 to 8 9 mm d 1 in 2014 growing season with a mean value of 6 9 mm d 1 mm and varied in the range of 2 3 to 12 4 mm d 1 in 2015 gowing season with a mean value of 6 1 mm d 1 soil texture over 0 80 cm depth and within the experimental field is classified as sandy clay loam the other soil physical and chemical properties of the study area are summarized in table 1 2 2 field trial and data collection a factorial design in completely

the field each replicate of a treatment was a 25 m2 plot 5 m 5 m since each treatment was replicated three times therefore each treatment spanned an area of 75 m2 3 25 m2 two drip lines with drippers 20 cm apart and emitter discharge of 2 l h 1 were placed on the soil surface 15 cm apart the right and the left sides of each crop row fig 3 a thereafter three time domain reflectometry tdr access tubes of 100 cm in length trime fm imko germany were installed for each treatment to monitor the soil water content swc i e 18 tdr tubes were installed in the study area 3 probes 6 treatments fig 3b tdr probes were used every day to measure soil water contents at depths of every 20 cm during both growing seasons also prior to using tdr sensors were calibrated by gravimetric method the azargol sunflower was then planted on june 14 in 2014 and on may 29 in 2015 at 75 20 cm row and crop spacing fig 3a experimental plots were irrigated every other day for fi treatment net irrigation water

of irrigation water freshwater or saline water and the level of irrigation water full irrigation or prd irrigation varied for different treatments the selected properties of irrigation water sources are explained in table 2 to analyze the quality of irrigation water resources water samples were collected monthly from each irrigation water resource in plastic bottles and were stored in a vacuum at 5 c when transporting to laboratory cations concentration in water samples including na k ca2 and mg2 were determined by using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap

dissolved solids tds in these samples were determined by using a pc 2700 m eutech instruments singapore ph was then determined by using a ph meter crison 507 crisom instruments s a barcelona spain for the prd treatments during the stress period just one of the drip lines was operated over the stress period while the other was not during each irrigation event which resulted in the irrigation of only half of the rooting zone in these treatments irrigation shifted between the two sides of the plants after three irrigation events during both cropping cycles i e at the beginning of the stress period and every 10 days over the whole stress period plants were sampled in all treatments to determine temporal variation of crop height leaf area head diameter capitulum aboveground dry weight and crop chlorophyll content at each sampling date three plants per plot were harvested the measured leaves areas were converted into leaf area index lai by dividing it by the corresponding soil surface covered by the plants following the method proposed by perry and campton 1977 crop s dried weight was measured by oven drying plats at 70 c this temperature is supposed to be safe enough to prevent exposing serious damage to crop s nutrient content at final harvest three plants per plot were harvested to determine seed s protein and oil content seed s protein percentage was determined by the bradford method bradford 1976 seed s oil content was determined based on soxhlet extraction technique pomeranz and clifton 1994 oil yield oy was then determined following the methodology introduced by sezen et al 2011b both economic and biological crop yield were also determined for all treatments at the end of both cropping cycles by harvesting all crops in 1 m2 of each plot harvest index hi was then calculated by dividing economic crop yield by biological yield finally irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated for all treatments by dividing economic crop yield by total irrigation water consumed during the whole growing season similar to the beginning of the growing season soil samples were also collected frequently during the growing season of 2014 at 1 56 72 83 and 94 dap and 2015 at 1 59 72 and 95 dap and at final harvest in order to determine the saturated soil electrical conductivity ece at different soil verticals for different treatments for each treatment and with three replications core samples were collected by using an 2 in auger every 20 cm soil depth at different lateral positions i e for each soil layer three soil samples were collected at three equal horizontal distances between two drip lines and then were mixed together to provide a mixed soil sample for each layer ece was measured for soil each sample based on the saturated soil paste method ussls 1954 and using a conductivity meter model elmetron 401 cc in laboratory average ece was calculated for every 20 cm soil depth and for the whole rooting zone i e at 0 60 cm soil depth crops were harvested on september 15 in 2014 94 dap and on september 2 in 2015 96 dap 2 3 performance of the drip irrigation systems for each treatment three driplines i e each one including 16 emitters along were selected to evaluate the performance of the drip irrigation system during each cropping cycle the rates of the emitter s discharge along each dripline were measured every two weeks measured data were then used to evaluate drip irrigation system s performance the latter is mainly evaluated based on the overall variation of emitter s flow which is determined by two major factors i the hydraulic variations ii and the manufacturing variations barragan et al 2010 hence we computed four different performance criteria to capture these features hydraulic performance of the emitters were determined by using the emitter flow rate variation coefficient cv as follows asae 2002 tang et al 2018 2 c v s d q a v e r a g e 100 where s d is the standard deviation of the emitter flow rates l hr 1 and q a v e r a g e is the average rate of the emitters discharge the emission uniformity eu which is the most important index commonly used to evaluate micro irrigation performance barragan et al 2010 tan et al 2018 was determined as follows keller and karmeli 1974 3 e u 1 1 27 c v n q m i n q a v e r a g e 100 where eu is the emission uniformity coefficient estimated based on the empirical equation defined by keller and karmeli 1974 n is the number of the emitters and q m i n is minimum rate of the emitters discharge l hr 1 we also computed distribution uniformity du which is commonly used by earlier researchers sahin et al 2012 shareef et al 2016 tan et al 2018 and christiansen s uniformity coeﬃcient cu christiansen 1942 as follows 4 d u q q u a r t 25 q a v e r a g e 100 5 c u 1 v i v a

is the average volume of emitted water l 2 4 statistical analysis the measured data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance anova and general linear model glm procedure treatment means were compared using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 in sas package program 9 1 sas institute 2004 3 results 3 1 water consumption temporal variation of irrigation water depth over both cropping cycles are displayed in fig 4 in 2014 irrigation water depth for fi varied in the range of 13 32 mm in 2015 with a general reduction irrigation water depth under fi varied in the range of 8 32 mm over the entire cropping cycles of 2014 and 2015 fi received a total of 844 and 607 mm of fresh water respectively the higher irrigation water consumption in 2014 might be attributed to higher air temperature and eto as well as lower precipitation fig 2 the depths of saline and fresh water applied for irrigating crops under various treatments are summarized in table 3 while all prd treatments saved 25 of freshwater during the stress period compared to the fi treatment i e all prd treatments were scheduled to received 25 less freshwater compared to the fi treatment during the stress period the real freshwater saving highly varies among various prd treatments during the stress period of 2014 growing season the lowest and the highest freshwater saving occurred under the fsi and prd2 treatments accounting for 57 mm and 182 mm respectively and during the stress period of 2015 they occurred under these two treatments accounting for 41 mm and 162 mm respectively when the whole cropping cycle was considered the freshwater saving compared to the fi treatment was 13 7 12 22 and 18 under si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 respectively in 2014 and was 15 7 15 27 and 20 under si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 respectively in 2015 more freshwater saving in 2015 may be ascribed to the longer stress period in this year during 44 96 dap compared to the one in the 2014 growing season during 55 94 dap 3 2 crop responses 3 2 1 crop s growth features temporal variation of leaf area index for all treatments over 2014 and 2015 cropping cycles is presented in fig 5 regardless of the irrigation treatments lai increased from the planting date to the middle of the growth stage and then started a declining trend toward the harvesting time lai declining trend in 2015 started 12 21 days earlier than in 2014 which may be explained by the different cropping calendars in these years in 2015 sunflower was planted 16 days earlier than in 2014 table 4 also shows that the maximum lai laimax was affected by both water and salinity stress the highest laimax was observed under fi laimax 2 93 in 2014 and laimax 1 82 in 2015 prd2 had the lowest laimax either in 2014 1 13 or in 2015 1 37 crop height was significantly affected by the irrigation treatments table 4 in 2014 and 2015 the highest crop height was observed under the fi treatment while the lowest one was observed under the si treatments in 2014 no significant difference was observed in crops dry matter dm between the control and the other treatments except for the prd2 and si treatments for which dry matter was respectively 26 2 and 31 4 less than the one under control treatment in this year the fi and prd2 treatments had the highest dm 262 2 g plant 1 and the lowest dm 179 7 g plant 1 dms compared to the fi treatment water and salinity stress in 2015 resulted in a significant reduction in dms in the si and prd2 treatments p 0 05 similar to 2014 growing season the highest and the lowest dm was observed under fi dm 225 5 g plant 1 and prd2 dm 162 9 g plant 1 respectively according to the summarized results in table 4 head diameter hd had the highest value under fi hd 22 3 cm in 2014 and prd1 hd 20 9 cm in 2015 and the lowest value under prd2 hd 18 7 and 18 5 cm in 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 2 crop s quality features in 2014 seed s nitrogen content varied in the range of 2 43 2 83 with the lowest and the highest values under the prd2 2 43 and the prd3 2 83 treatments in 2015 seed s nitrogen content varied in the range of 2 51 2 90 with the lowest and the highest values under the prd2 2 51 and fsi 2 9 treatments table 5 respectively while no significant difference was observed in seed s nitrogen content between the control and the other treatments the summarized results in table 5 reveals that crops under salinity stress generally had higher nitrogen content our finding also revealed that crops with higher seed s nitrogen content had also higher seed s protein content seed s oil content was less affected by water and or salinity stress which resulted in no significant difference in this parameter among various treatments however plants under prd had higher seed s oil content compared to those under fi 3 2 3 crop s yield and harvest index crops biological yield by was highly correlated with crops dm table 6 in other words irrigation treatments with higher dm during the growing seasons see section 3 2 1 had the highest final by hence in both 2014 and 2015 fi and prd2 had the highest by 14 5 and 12 9 t ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively and the lowest by 12 7 and 9 3 t ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively bys respectively water and salinity stress significantly affected crops economic yield ey in both growing seasons the highest ey was observed under fi ey 4 7 and 4 4 t ha 1 where fresh water was adequately applied the lowest ey was observed under prd2 in 2014 ey 3 6 t ha 1 and under si in 2015 ey 3 t ha 1 in the 2014 and 2015 cropping cycles the highest values for oil yield oy were observed under the prd1 1734 kg ha 1 and the fi 1961 kg ha 1 treatments respectively whereas the lowest oy in these years were observed under the prd2 1392 kg ha 1 and si 1321 kg ha 1 treatments respectively in 2014 harvest index hi under the fi treatment was 32 4 and hi under the other treatments reduced by 2 5 11 4 exception was for prd1 and prd3 under which hi improved by 4 5 and 0 6 respectively in 2015 hi under fi was 34 2 which was 6 4 10 higher than those under the other treatments table 7 hi reduction implies the fact that ey reduction under water and or salinity stress went beyond by reduction the statistical analysis results revealed that compared to the fi treatment hi reduction under the prd2 and si treatments was significant either in 2014 or in 2015 gowing seasons 3 2 4 irrigation water productivity the prd2 and si treatments experienced a remarkable decrease in irrigation water productivity iwp compared to the fi treatment while no significant reduction was observed in iwp under the treatments with alternative freshwater and saline water application prd3 and fsi in addition prd application under the prd1 and prd3 treatments resulted in a considerable improvement in iwp compared to the fi treatment although such improvement was not significant hence the highest iwp in 2014 iwp 1 12 kg m3 and 2015 iwp 1 13 kg m3 was observed under the prd1 treatment which was 7 and 6 higher than those under the fi treatment in 2014 and 2015 respectively in fact the prevention of significant ey loss under favorable soil water condition in the prd1 treatment on the one hand see section 3 2 3 and reducing freshwater use in this treatment on the other hand see section 3 1 resulted in the best iwp values under the prd1 treatment whereas the si treatment resulted in the lowest iwp in 2014 iwp 0 89 kg m3 and 2015 iwp 0 74 kg m3 growing seasons prd2 also ranked next regarding the significant reduction in iwp under water and salinity stress 3 3 soil salinity fig 6 shows the temporal variation of the average ece in the rooting zone eceroot for different treatments during both growing seasons regardless of the treatments eceroot over the growing season followed an increasing pattern particularly after applying irrigation treatments in 2014 eceroot varied in the range of 2 02 2 58 ds m 1 2 50 7 04 ds m 1 2 57 4 79 ds m 1 2 57 2 92 ds m 1 2 58 7 47 ds m 1 2 53 5 14 ds m 1 for the fi si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 treatments respectively in 2015 eceroot varied in the range of 0 91 1 98 ds m 1 0 94 5 74 ds m 1 1 16 4 24 ds m 1 1 08 2 51 ds m 1 1 29 6 67 ds m 1 1 19 4 08 ds m 1 for the fi si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 treatments respectively fig 6 represents no considerable difference in the eceroot values among different treatments before applying the irrigation treatments thereafter eceroot had always the highest values either under si or under prd2 treatments besides the fi treatment always had the lowest eceroot in both cropping cycles the ece increase in different soil layers over the growing period was statistically compared among different treatments and results are summarized in table 8 regardless of the irrigation treatments soil salinity at final harvest was increased by 2 314 and 61 834 compared to the beginning of the 2014 and 2015 cropping cycles respectively at final harvest and for all soil depths fi treatment had the lowest ece values 1 78 2 71 ds m 1 while prd2 treatment had the highest ece values 5 03 8 01 ds m 1 the exception was for the maximum value of ece over the 0 20 cm soil depth in the 2014 cropping cycle which belonged to the si treatment 8 1 ds m 1 nevertheless vertical soil salinity increase pattern over the 0 60 cm soil depth differs among different treatments to have a better comparison among different water saving irrigation treatments the average ece over the 0 60 cm soil depth was calculated for all treatments and results are displayed in fig 7 while a general increase of 13 606 in ece was observed for all treatments applying the prd1 treatment may be of higher interest since it had a 72 378 less increase in soil ece at final harvest compared to the other water saving irrigation treatments and fsi and prd3 treatments ranked next in 2014 with a 14 104 less increase in ece and 2015 with a 26 247 less increase in ece respectively we compared average ece over the 0 60 cm soil depth at final harvest with the maximum ece threshold for which no yield reduction is expected for sunflower sunflower ecethr 4 8 ds m 1 regarding sunflower ecethr prd1 fsi and prd3 treatments may be supposed to be the best water saving irrigation treatments since their ece at final harvest is almost kept lower than ecethr while the average ece over the 0 60 cm soil depths went beyond ecethr by 0 34 ds m 1 under prd3 treatment such increase is expected to result in a negligible yield reduction based on yield reduction factor of 5 for a unit increase in ece beyond sunflower tolerance threshold of 4 8 ds m 1 nevertheless ece under the prd2 and si treatments at final harvest was much higher than sunflower ecethr which is an indication of serious yield reduction at final harvest 3 4 drip irrigation system s performance the performance of the drip irrigation systems for different treatments was evaluated based on different uniformity indices cv eu du and cu and results are summarized in table 9 for all treatments the manufacturing variability of the emitters cv was less than 5 2 93 4 44 indicating an excellent performance of the drip irrigation systems for all treatments eu which represents the influence of the variability of orifice structure and hydraulic performance on the variability of the emitter s discharge varied in the range of 93 0 94 7 the distribution uniformity coefficients du and the christian s uniformity coefficient cu varied in the ranges of 95 0 96 0 and 96 1 97 5 respectively 4 discussion our findings obtained through a 2 year field investigation in a drip irrigated sunflower field indicate a high potential of surviving for sunflower production under freshwater scarcity which is becoming a serious problem all over the world based on the results freshwater could be saved by 7 27 depending on the contribution of the diluted seawater in total irrigation water see section 3 1 table 3 prd2 ranked first regarding freshwater saving through the growing seasons and prd3 ranked next nevertheless proposing an optimal freshwater saving irrigation strategy requires crop s responses to be taken into consideration since they play major roles in determining iwp being a significant influencing factor on crop s water requirement and yield traore et al 2000 howell et al 2004 nagore et al 2014 yazar et al 2015 lai was significantly affected by water salinity stress see section 3 2 1 table 4 which is in agreement with earlier findings eg for water stress liu et al 2006a 2006b shahnazari et al 2007 sezen et al 2011a 2011b yazar et al 2015 karandish and simunek 2016a eg for salinity stress izzo et al 2008 chen et al 2009 kang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 yazar et al 2015 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 our results showed that the more desirable the soil water status was the higher the lai was this result is also reported by sezen et al 2011ab hence fi treatments had always the highest lai by the same logic we could conclude that the significant reduction in lai either under the prd2 or si treatments with the highest contribution of diluted seawater in total irrigation water is an indication of root water uptake restriction under improper soil water status induced by water salinity stress which consequently results in reduced leaves sizes through decreased cell elongation and cell division sezen et al 2011b however crops under prd3 had always the higher lai compared to those under other salinity stress treatments we found the same results when analyzing crop s height and dm table 4 reduced crop height or dm under water salinity stress which is also confirmed by earlier researchers izzo et al 2008 chen et al 2009 sezen et al 2011a zheng et al 2013 yazar et al 2015 carrillo ávila et al 2015 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 may be explained by the fact that water salinity stress results in root water uptake restriction which consequently led to a significant reduction in stem elongation and then reflected on crop height or dm reduction zheng et al 2013 more reduction under prd2 treatments also emphasize the stimulation of the negative consequences when both water and salinity stresses are exposed simultaneously chen et al 2009 amer 2010 mousavi et al 2010 yazar et al 2015 in consistence with the results reported for lai both crop height and dm had also higher values under prd3 compared to other salinity stress treatments table 4 regarding quantitative physiological responses crops under alternate application of fresh saline water through prd and particularly prd3 had higher lai crop height dm and head diameter compared to those under other salinity stress treatments table 4 such results indicate that the positive expected consequences of applying prd which is embodied in prd s theory dry and loveys 1998 went beyond the negative consequences of water salinity stresses however we tried to also explore sunflower s qualitative properties response to the selected treatments see section 3 2 2 our results well indicate that generally the salinity stress stimulated sunflower s n uptake table 5 which is in consistence with results reported by sadak mervat et al 2012 such improvement is enhanced under prd3 mainly due to the nature of such irrigation strategy in fact the frequent wetting and drying cycle under prd may improve n availability in crop s rooting zone on the one hand nourbakhsh and karimian eghbal 1997 vale et al 2007 wang et al 2010 and improve root n uptake through initiating the growth of secondary roots on the other hand poni et al 1992 liang et al 1996 fort et al 1997 sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 1997 which finally resulted in an increase in root n uptake in line with the findings of previous researchers sadak mervat et al 2012 aditya et al 2017 higher n uptake guarantees higher seed s protein content table 5 due to the linear relationship between these two parameters reported by earlier researchers tkachuk 1969 aditya et al 2017 seed s oil content as another qualitative property was less affected by water and or salinity stress table 5 which is also supported by some other researchers ghrab et al 2013 and 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 such findings may imply the importance of the salinity stress level imposed to the crops francois 1996 found that sunflower s seed oil content was not significantly affected by salinity stress when irrigation water ec is increased up to 10 2 ds m nevertheless plants under prd and in particular under prd3 produced more oil content even compared to fi our findings at final harvest showed that by ey and oy were affected by water salinity stress see section 3 2 3 table 6 which is in agreement with earlier findings francois et al 1996 flagella et al 2004 liu et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 mousavi et al 2009 amer 2010 kang et al 2010 ghrab et al 2013 by reduction under the exposed stresses is a result of a highly strong correlation between dm and by table 6 yield reduction under saline water stress may be justified by limited leaf expansion or reduced crop height dm and stem diameter caused by reduced root water uptake which consequently results in lowered photosynthesis rate amer 2010 zheng et al 2013 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 and finally oy reduction is well justified by considerable reduction in ey and or seed s oil content under such stresses flagella et al 2004 ghrab et al 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 while in the farmers point of view ey plays a major role in adopting a new proposed strategy iwp may be a more comprehensive index since it represents the amount of crop production per unit of consumed water our findings demonstrated that all prd treatments had generally high potentials for improving iwp section 3 2 4 table 7 which is also supported by the other researchers shahnazari et al 2007 karandish and simunek 2016a karandish 2016 however prd3 could be proposed as the best freshwater saving irrigation strategy for sunflower production in the study area when both freshwater saving and iwp are considered nevertheless such proposal should be made by caution since soil salinity could be an obstacle to sustainable agriculture and it needs to be analyzed as well our given results showed that soil salinity increased under all treatments at final harvest see section 3 3 table 8 figs 6 and 7 which is generally due to either saline water application amer 2010 nagaz et al 2012 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 or the use of drip irrigation system chen et al 2009 wan et al 2010 kang et al 2010 while soil salinity increase is a serious threat to sustainable agriculture kang et al 2010 aditya et al 2017 such threat may be resolved when the accumulated salt is leached out of the rooting zone either through applying additional irrigation water during the cropping cycle or through rainfall events occurring out of the growing season ghrab et al 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 comparing the rooting zone soil salinity in 2014 and 2015 gowing seasons well indicates that the out season precipitation fallen in the study area had a high potential in reducing soil salinity and keeping it far below the sunflower s ecethr table 8 in addition less additional irrigation precipitation water is required to leach out the accumulated salt in the rooting zone under prd3 fig 7 and table 8 emitter s performance is the other important issue when applying saline water irrigation hence we evaluated the performance of the drip irrigation system see section 3 4 table 9 based on different criteria frequently used by earlier researchers barragan et al 2010 sahin et al 2012 shareef et al 2016 tan et al 2018 the computed cv 5 table 9 denotes the excellent hydraulic performance of the emitters for all treatments based on solomon 1979 cv 20 ensures the acceptable performance of a micro irrigation system asae 2000 also reported that for the point source emitters cv 5 indicates an excellent performance of the emitters while 5 cv 7 and cv 7 are the indications of average and poor performance respectively the computed values for eu were higher than 90 for all treatments based on the classification method defined by merriam and keller 1978 the drip irrigation system could be classified under excellent condition when eu 90 barragan et al 2010 also demonstrated that in a desirable system eu may change in the range of 85 95 when the field s slope is less than 2 the acceptable values obtained either for the distribution uniformity coefficients du 95 0 96 0 or for the christiansen s uniformity coefficients cu 96 1 97 5 also confirm the excellent performance of the current system 5 conclusion feeding the growing population requires alleviating global freshwater scarcity in agriculture by applying poor quality water resources nevertheless such application should be properly managed to prevent serious economic environmental challenges here and for the first time we integrated prd with diluted seawater irrigation to find out the best prd management package regarding crop response soil ec increase and drip irrigation system efficiency apart from freshwater saving both fi and prd1 could be considered as the most efficient treatments since they always had the highest economic yield and the lowest salinity increase in the rooting zone however they couldn t be fully environmentally efficient since they may use up to 36 4 more freshwater compared to the other treatments on the other hand our results indicated that applying either full irrigation or prd with only diluted seawater resource may also expose serious yield losses and salinity increase in the soil despite of a 13 27 freshwater saving irrigating crops with only diluted seawater may result in serious eco environmental impacts since it caused 15 36 loss in economic yield and 2 5 8 3 times increase in soil ece at harvest on the other hand such applications ended up with 15 31 reduction in irrigation water productivity which means less crop per drop however an alternate application of freshwater diluted seawater under prd with 25 less irrigation water compared to crop water demand prd3 may prevent significant yield loss improves crop quality properties and reduces total salt accumulation in the rooting zone at harvest prd3 provided a slight reduction of up to 8 in economic yield and always kept the rooting zone ece below sunflower ecethr the ece under which no yield reduction is expected in addition up to 20 freshwater saving was also obtained under such irrigation strategy which led to higher or close values of iwp to those obtained for the fi treatment the drip irrigation system s performance was also secured under such management such results demonstrate lower economic loss and safer environment based on the results it could be concluded that prd3 is the most efficient irrigation strategy in the study area regarding

10631,applying saline water resources for irrigating croplands requires serious attentions when sustainable agriculture is considered a two year field investigation was carried out in a drip irrigated sunflower field under six irrigation treatments including i full freshwater irrigation fi full irrigation with diluted seawater ds si alternate ds freshwater irrigation fsi freshwater prd partial root zone drying irrigation with 25 less water than full prd1 ds prd irrigation with 25 less water than full prd2 alternate ds freshwater irrigation under prd with 25 less water than full prd3 in three replicates compared to the fi treatment crop yield was reduced by 3 1 32 with the lowest one under prd1 among the ds treatments prd3 resulted in the highest grain yield 4306 kg ha 1 grain nitrogen content 2 83 oil yield 1907 kg ha 1 and irrigation water productivity 1 10 prd3 also saved freshwater by 20 and kept soil salinity of the rooting zone below the maximum crop tolerance threshold based on the results prd3 might be a cost effective pathway which guarantees the sustainable application of diluted seawater in the irrigated sunflower lands keywords diluted seawater irrigation water productivity partial root zone drying sunflower production salt accumulation 1 introduction while food demand follows a significant increasing trend in response to the rapid population growth freshwater scarcity is becoming a momentous restriction to food production all over the world hence serious attempt is required to improve agricultural water productivity especially within the irrigated lands which has a highlighted role in global crop production among various insights introduced for increasing water use efficiency wue sezen et al 2011a yazar et al 2015 rahil and qanadillo 2015 consoli et al 2017 partial root zone drying prd introduced by dry and loveys 1998 is known as one of the most effective pathways regarding its positive effect on crop and water productivity eg kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006b 2007 shahnazari et al 2007 2008 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 jovanovic et al 2010 mousavi et al 2010 sezen et al 2011a pedrero et al 2014 beis and patakas 2015 lima et al 2015 ghadami firouzabadi et al 2015 karandish and simunek 2016a 2016b karandish and simunek 2017 2018 in this method only half of the rooting zone is irrigated at each irrigation event while the other half is dried out dry and loveys 2000 nevertheless there is a general belief among these scientists that prd s efficiency may vary by crop types and the experimental conditions such as climatic condition the duration of the stress period the level of water deficit over the stress period the time of shifting the wetted and dried parts over the stress period and irrigation water quality are among those parameters shahnazari et al 2007 sezen et al 2011a ghrab et al 2013 and 2014 pedrero et al 2014 irrigation water quality is among the most predominant factor affecting prd s efficiency hence substituting freshwater with saline water when irrigation crops may alter prd results although being a rational solution under freshwater scarcity adopted by numerous researchers eg flagella et al 2004 botia et al 2005 mori et al 2008 chen et al 2009 nagaz et al 2012 huang et al 2012 yazar et al 2015 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 aditya et al 2017 showed that a fixed application of poor quality irrigation water may reduce leaf area index and grain protein content of sorghum while an alternative application of poor quality and freshwater resources for irrigation may maintain these indices at the favorable level for a mediterranean climate the quinoa response to irrigation water quality has been investigated by yazar et al 2015 results indicated that increasing irrigation salinity to 30 ds m 1 may result in a slight reduction in both grain yield and total biomass a highlighted decrease in corn yield under saline water irrigation has also been reported by amer 2010 kang et al 2010 reported that irrigating maize with saline water may result in a considerable reduction in crop height leaf area index and maize grain yield while sea water resources could be a potential saline water resource for agricultural purpose only a few researches investigated the probable consequences of applying such water resources in the irrigated lands izzo et al 2008 pedrero et al 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 as a general belief the more the contribution of sea water in the mixed saline freshwater provided for irrigation is the more negative impacts are expected to the best of our knowledge the probable consequences of seawater application under prd has not been investigated yet in addition researches on the application of the saline water resources under prd are still in its infancy and is considered by quite a few researchers recently through a field modelling approach karandish and simunek 2018 tried to find out the most optimal irrigation fertigation management scenario either for deficit irrigation or for prd under saline water irrigation their finding well indicated that there is an urgent need for adjusting fertilization rate as well as irrigation water depth for prd when saline water is applied ghrab et al 2013 and 2014 investigated the consequences of applying prd with saline water on the 9 years olive trees their finding well indicated that prd with saline water is a promising strategy for sustainably produce olives within the arid regions since in one hand both crop yield and quality properties were maintained at the favorable level and on the other hand less salt was accumulated in the soil at final harvest in this paper we worked toward filling such knowledge gap based on data collected through a two year field investigation in a drip irrigated sunflower field to the best of our knowledge our research is noble in the following ways i a mixed fresh sea water resource was supplied when saline prd irrigation was applied ii and instead of applying prd with various water deficit level which is a regular management adopted by the previous researches prd was applied under various management scenarios rather than adjusting the irrigation water depth the main objective of this research was to find out the most efficient freshwater saving irrigation strategy for sunflower regarding both economic and environmental losses when saline water resources are required to be applied for irrigation to address this issue the following objectives were evaluated i to describe crop growth response during the cropping cycles ii to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative crop properties at final harvest iii to compare freshwater saving and irrigation water productivity at final harvest iv to evaluate the increase in the electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste ece at different soil verticals at final harvest v and finally to find out the most freshwater efficient irrigation strategy within the study area 2

winter seasons the long term average minimum and maximum air temperatures are 17 3 6 and 38 9 c respectively karandish and simunek 2016b 2017 daily variation of climatic variables during the study period i e sunflower growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 are displayed in fig 2 a total of 15 2 mm and 35 mm precipitation was recorded over 2014 and 2015 gowing seasons respectively 1 2 mm and 11 mm of

the field each replicate of a treatment was a 25 m2 plot 5 m 5 m since each treatment was replicated three times therefore each treatment spanned an area of 75 m2 3 25 m2 two drip lines with drippers 20 cm apart and emitter discharge of 2 l h 1 were placed on the soil surface 15 cm apart the right and the left sides of each crop row fig 3 a thereafter three time domain reflectometry tdr access tubes of 100 cm in length trime fm imko germany were installed for each treatment to monitor the soil water content swc i e 18 tdr tubes were installed in the study area 3 probes 6 treatments fig 3b tdr probes were used every day to measure soil water contents at depths of every 20 cm during both growing seasons also prior to using tdr sensors were calibrated by gravimetric method the azargol sunflower was then planted on june 14 in 2014 and on may 29 in 2015 at 75 20 cm row and crop spacing fig 3a experimental plots were irrigated every other day for fi treatment net irrigation water

of irrigation water freshwater or saline water and the level of irrigation water full irrigation or prd irrigation varied for different treatments the selected properties of irrigation water sources are explained in table 2 to analyze the quality of irrigation water resources water samples were collected monthly from each irrigation water resource in plastic bottles and were stored in a vacuum at 5 c when transporting to laboratory cations concentration in water samples including na k ca2 and mg2 were determined by using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap

dissolved solids tds in these samples were determined by using a pc 2700 m eutech instruments singapore ph was then determined by using a ph meter crison 507 crisom instruments s a barcelona spain for the prd treatments during the stress period just one of the drip lines was operated over the stress period while the other was not during each irrigation event which resulted in the irrigation of only half of the rooting zone in these treatments irrigation shifted between the two sides of the plants after three irrigation events during both cropping cycles i e at the beginning of the stress period and every 10 days over the whole stress period plants were sampled in all treatments to determine temporal variation of crop height leaf area head diameter capitulum aboveground dry weight and crop chlorophyll content at each sampling date three plants per plot were harvested the measured leaves areas were converted into leaf area index lai by dividing it by the corresponding soil surface covered by the plants following the method proposed by perry and campton 1977 crop s dried weight was measured by oven drying plats at 70 c this temperature is supposed to be safe enough to prevent exposing serious damage to crop s nutrient content at final harvest three plants per plot were harvested to determine seed s protein and oil content seed s protein percentage was determined by the bradford method bradford 1976 seed s oil content was determined based on soxhlet extraction technique pomeranz and clifton 1994 oil yield oy was then determined following the methodology introduced by sezen et al 2011b both economic and biological crop yield were also determined for all treatments at the end of both cropping cycles by harvesting all crops in 1 m2 of each plot harvest index hi was then calculated by dividing economic crop yield by biological yield finally irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated for all treatments by dividing economic crop yield by total irrigation water consumed during the whole growing season similar to the beginning of the growing season soil samples were also collected frequently during the growing season of 2014 at 1 56 72 83 and 94 dap and 2015 at 1 59 72 and 95 dap and at final harvest in order to determine the saturated soil electrical conductivity ece at different soil verticals for different treatments for each treatment and with three replications core samples were collected by using an 2 in auger every 20 cm soil depth at different lateral positions i e for each soil layer three soil samples were collected at three equal horizontal distances between two drip lines and then were mixed together to provide a mixed soil sample for each layer ece was measured for soil each sample based on the saturated soil paste method ussls 1954 and using a conductivity meter model elmetron 401 cc in laboratory average ece was calculated for every 20 cm soil depth and for the whole rooting zone i e at 0 60 cm soil depth crops were harvested on september 15 in 2014 94 dap and on september 2 in 2015 96 dap 2 3 performance of the drip irrigation systems for each treatment three driplines i e each one including 16 emitters along were selected to evaluate the performance of the drip irrigation system during each cropping cycle the rates of the emitter s discharge along each dripline were measured every two weeks measured data were then used to evaluate drip irrigation system s performance the latter is mainly evaluated based on the overall variation of emitter s flow which is determined by two major factors i the hydraulic variations ii and the manufacturing variations barragan et al 2010 hence we computed four different performance criteria to capture these features hydraulic performance of the emitters were determined by using the emitter flow rate variation coefficient cv as follows asae 2002 tang et al 2018 2 c v s d q a v e r a g e 100 where s d is the standard deviation of the emitter flow rates l hr 1 and q a v e r a g e is the average rate of the emitters discharge the emission uniformity eu which is the most important index commonly used to evaluate micro irrigation performance barragan et al 2010 tan et al 2018 was determined as follows keller and karmeli 1974 3 e u 1 1 27 c v n q m i n q a v e r a g e 100 where eu is the emission uniformity coefficient estimated based on the empirical equation defined by keller and karmeli 1974 n is the number of the emitters and q m i n is minimum rate of the emitters discharge l hr 1 we also computed distribution uniformity du which is commonly used by earlier researchers sahin et al 2012 shareef et al 2016 tan et al 2018 and christiansen s uniformity coeﬃcient cu christiansen 1942 as follows 4 d u q q u a r t 25 q a v e r a g e 100 5 c u 1 v i v a v e r a g e v i 100 where q q u a r t 25 is the average rate of emitters discharge for 25 emitters with lowest discharge rates l hr 1 is v i the measured volume of emitted water l and v a v e r a g e is the average volume of emitted water l 2 4 statistical analysis the measured data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance anova and general linear model glm procedure treatment means were compared using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 in sas package program 9 1 sas institute 2004 3 results 3 1 water consumption temporal variation of irrigation water depth over both cropping cycles are displayed in fig 4 in 2014 irrigation water depth for fi varied in the range of 13 32 mm in 2015 with a general reduction irrigation water depth under fi varied in the range of 8 32 mm over the entire cropping cycles of 2014 and 2015 fi received a total of 844 and 607 mm of fresh water respectively the higher irrigation water consumption in 2014 might be attributed to higher air temperature and eto as well as lower precipitation fig 2 the depths of saline and fresh water applied for irrigating crops under various treatments are summarized in table 3 while all prd treatments saved 25 of freshwater during the stress period compared to the fi treatment i e all prd treatments were scheduled to received 25 less freshwater compared to the fi treatment during the stress period the real freshwater saving highly varies among various prd treatments during the stress period of 2014 growing season the lowest and the highest freshwater saving occurred under the fsi and prd2 treatments accounting for 57 mm and 182 mm respectively and during the stress period of 2015 they occurred under these two treatments accounting for 41 mm and 162 mm respectively when the whole cropping cycle was considered the freshwater saving compared to the fi treatment was 13 7 12 22 and 18 under si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 respectively in 2014 and was 15 7 15 27 and 20 under si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 respectively in 2015 more freshwater saving in 2015 may be ascribed to the longer stress period in this year during 44 96 dap compared to the one in the 2014 growing season during 55 94 dap 3 2 crop responses 3 2 1 crop s growth features temporal variation of leaf area index for all treatments over 2014 and 2015 cropping cycles is presented in fig 5 regardless of the irrigation treatments lai increased from the planting date to the middle of the growth stage and then started a declining trend toward the harvesting time lai declining trend in 2015 started 12 21 days earlier than in 2014 which may be explained by the different cropping calendars in these years in 2015 sunflower was planted 16 days earlier than in 2014 table 4 also shows that the maximum lai laimax was affected by both water and salinity stress the highest laimax was observed under fi laimax 2 93 in 2014 and laimax 1 82 in 2015 prd2 had the lowest laimax either in 2014 1 13 or in 2015 1 37 crop height was significantly affected by the irrigation treatments table 4 in 2014 and 2015 the highest crop height was observed under the fi treatment while the lowest one was observed under the si treatments in 2014 no significant difference was observed in crops dry matter dm between the control and the other treatments except for the prd2 and si treatments for which dry matter was respectively 26 2 and 31 4 less than the one under control treatment in this year the fi and prd2 treatments had the highest dm 262 2 g plant 1 and the lowest dm 179 7 g plant 1 dms compared to the fi treatment water and salinity stress in 2015 resulted in a significant reduction in dms in the si and prd2 treatments p 0 05 similar to 2014 growing season the highest and the lowest dm was observed under fi dm 225 5 g plant 1 and prd2 dm 162 9 g plant 1 respectively according to the summarized results in table 4 head diameter hd had the highest value under fi hd 22 3 cm in 2014 and prd1 hd 20 9 cm in 2015 and the lowest value under prd2 hd 18 7 and 18 5 cm in 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 2 crop s quality features in 2014 seed s nitrogen content varied in the range of 2 43 2 83 with the lowest and the highest values under the prd2 2 43 and the prd3 2 83 treatments in 2015 seed s nitrogen content varied in the range of 2 51 2 90 with the lowest and the highest values under the prd2 2 51 and fsi 2 9 treatments table 5 respectively while no significant difference was observed in seed s nitrogen content between the control and the other treatments the summarized results in table 5 reveals that crops under salinity stress generally had higher nitrogen content our finding also revealed that crops with higher seed s nitrogen content had also higher seed s protein content seed s oil content was less affected by water and or salinity stress which resulted in no significant difference in this parameter among various treatments however plants under prd had higher seed s oil content compared to those under fi 3 2 3 crop s yield and harvest index crops biological yield by was highly correlated with crops dm table 6 in other words irrigation treatments with higher dm during the growing seasons see section 3 2 1 had the highest final by hence in both 2014 and 2015 fi and prd2 had the highest by 14 5 and 12 9 t ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively and the lowest by 12 7 and 9 3 t ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively bys respectively water and salinity stress significantly affected crops economic yield ey in both growing seasons the highest ey was observed under fi ey 4 7 and 4 4 t ha 1 where fresh water was adequately applied the lowest ey was observed under prd2 in 2014 ey 3 6 t ha 1 and under si in 2015 ey 3 t ha 1 in the 2014 and 2015 cropping cycles the highest values for oil yield oy were observed under the prd1 1734 kg ha 1 and the fi 1961 kg ha 1 treatments respectively whereas the lowest oy in these years were observed under the prd2 1392 kg ha 1 and si 1321 kg ha 1 treatments respectively in 2014 harvest index hi under the fi treatment was 32 4 and hi under the other treatments reduced by 2 5 11 4 exception was for prd1 and prd3 under which hi improved by 4 5 and 0 6 respectively in 2015 hi under fi was 34 2 which was 6 4 10 higher than those under the other treatments table 7 hi reduction implies the fact that ey reduction under water and or salinity stress went beyond by reduction the statistical analysis results revealed that compared to the fi treatment hi reduction under the prd2 and si treatments was significant either in 2014 or in 2015 gowing seasons 3 2 4 irrigation water productivity the prd2 and si treatments experienced a remarkable decrease in irrigation water productivity iwp compared to the fi treatment while no significant reduction was observed in iwp under the treatments with alternative freshwater and saline water application prd3 and fsi in addition prd application under the prd1 and prd3 treatments resulted in a considerable improvement in iwp compared to the fi treatment although such improvement was not significant hence the highest iwp in 2014 iwp 1 12 kg m3 and 2015 iwp 1 13 kg m3 was observed under the prd1 treatment which was 7 and 6 higher than those under the fi treatment in 2014 and 2015 respectively in fact the prevention of significant ey loss under favorable soil water condition in the prd1 treatment on the one hand see section 3 2 3 and reducing freshwater use in this treatment on the other hand see section 3 1 resulted in the best iwp values under the prd1 treatment whereas the si treatment resulted in the lowest iwp in 2014 iwp 0 89 kg m3 and 2015 iwp 0 74 kg m3 growing seasons prd2 also ranked next regarding the significant reduction in iwp under water and salinity stress 3 3 soil salinity fig 6 shows the temporal variation of the average ece in the rooting zone eceroot for different treatments during both growing seasons regardless of the treatments eceroot over the growing season followed an increasing pattern particularly after applying irrigation treatments in 2014 eceroot varied in the range of 2 02 2 58 ds m 1 2 50 7 04 ds m 1 2 57 4 79 ds m 1 2 57 2 92 ds m 1 2 58 7 47 ds m 1 2 53 5 14 ds m 1 for the fi si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 treatments respectively in 2015 eceroot varied in the range of 0 91 1 98 ds m 1 0 94 5 74 ds m 1 1 16 4 24 ds m 1 1 08 2 51 ds m 1 1 29 6 67 ds m 1 1 19 4 08 ds m 1 for the fi si fsi prd1 prd2 and prd3 treatments respectively fig 6 represents no considerable difference in the eceroot values among different treatments before applying the irrigation treatments thereafter eceroot had always the highest values either under si or under prd2 treatments besides the fi treatment always had the lowest eceroot in both cropping cycles the ece increase in different soil layers over the growing period was statistically compared among different treatments and results are summarized in table 8 regardless of the irrigation treatments soil salinity at final harvest was increased by 2 314 and 61 834 compared to the beginning of the 2014 and 2015 cropping cycles respectively at final harvest and for all soil depths fi treatment had the lowest ece values 1 78 2 71 ds m 1 while prd2 treatment had the highest ece values 5 03 8 01 ds m 1 the exception was for the maximum value of ece over the 0 20 cm soil depth in the 2014 cropping cycle which belonged to the si treatment 8 1 ds m 1 nevertheless vertical soil salinity increase pattern over the 0 60 cm soil depth differs among different treatments to have a better comparison among different water saving irrigation treatments the average ece over the 0 60 cm soil depth was calculated for all treatments and results are displayed in fig 7 while a general increase of 13 606 in ece was observed for all treatments applying the prd1 treatment may be of higher interest since it had a 72 378 less increase in soil ece at final harvest compared to the other water saving irrigation treatments and fsi and prd3 treatments ranked next in 2014 with a 14 104 less increase in ece and 2015 with a 26 247 less increase in ece respectively we compared average ece over the 0 60 cm soil depth at final harvest with the maximum ece threshold for which no yield reduction is expected for sunflower sunflower ecethr 4 8 ds m 1 regarding sunflower ecethr prd1 fsi and prd3 treatments may be supposed to be the best water saving irrigation treatments since their ece at final harvest is almost kept lower than ecethr while the average ece over the 0 60 cm soil depths went beyond ecethr by 0 34 ds m 1 under prd3 treatment such increase is expected to result in a negligible yield reduction based on yield reduction factor of 5 for a unit increase in ece beyond sunflower tolerance threshold of 4 8 ds m 1 nevertheless ece under the prd2 and si treatments at final harvest was much higher than sunflower ecethr which is an indication of serious yield reduction at final harvest 3 4 drip irrigation system s performance the performance of the drip irrigation systems for different treatments was evaluated based on different uniformity indices cv eu du and cu and results are summarized in table 9 for all treatments the manufacturing variability of the emitters cv was less than 5 2 93 4 44 indicating an excellent performance of the drip irrigation systems for all treatments eu which represents the influence of the variability of orifice structure and hydraulic performance on the variability of the emitter s discharge varied in the range of 93 0 94 7 the distribution uniformity coefficients du and the christian s uniformity coefficient cu varied in the ranges of 95 0 96 0 and 96 1 97 5 respectively 4 discussion our findings obtained through a 2 year field investigation in a drip irrigated sunflower field indicate a high potential of surviving for sunflower production under freshwater scarcity which is becoming a serious problem all over the world based on the results freshwater could be saved by 7 27 depending on the contribution of the diluted seawater in total irrigation water see section 3 1 table 3 prd2 ranked first regarding freshwater saving through the growing seasons and prd3 ranked next nevertheless proposing an optimal freshwater saving irrigation strategy requires crop s responses to be taken into consideration since they play major roles in determining iwp being a significant influencing factor on crop s water requirement and yield traore et al 2000 howell et al 2004 nagore et al 2014 yazar et al 2015 lai was significantly affected by water salinity stress see section 3 2 1 table 4 which is in agreement with earlier findings eg for water stress liu et al 2006a 2006b shahnazari et al 2007 sezen et al 2011a 2011b yazar et al 2015 karandish and simunek 2016a eg for salinity stress izzo et al 2008 chen et al 2009 kang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 yazar et al 2015 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 our results showed that the more desirable the soil water status was the higher the lai was this result is also reported by sezen et al 2011ab hence fi treatments had always the highest lai by the same logic we could conclude that the significant reduction in lai either under the prd2 or si treatments with the highest contribution of diluted seawater in total irrigation water is an indication of root water uptake restriction under improper soil water status induced by water salinity stress which consequently results in reduced leaves sizes through decreased cell elongation and cell division sezen et al 2011b however crops under prd3 had always the higher lai compared to those under other salinity stress treatments we found the same results when analyzing crop s height and dm table 4 reduced crop height or dm under water salinity stress which is also confirmed by earlier researchers izzo et al 2008 chen et al 2009 sezen et al 2011a zheng et al 2013 yazar et al 2015 carrillo ávila et al 2015 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 may be explained by the fact that water salinity stress results in root water uptake restriction which consequently led to a significant reduction in stem elongation and then reflected on crop height or dm reduction zheng et al 2013 more reduction under prd2 treatments also emphasize the stimulation of the negative consequences when both water and salinity stresses are exposed simultaneously chen et al 2009 amer 2010 mousavi et al 2010 yazar et al 2015 in consistence with the results reported for lai both crop height and dm had also higher values under prd3 compared to other salinity stress treatments table 4 regarding quantitative physiological responses crops under alternate application of fresh saline water through prd and particularly prd3 had higher lai crop height dm and head diameter compared to those under other salinity stress treatments table 4 such results indicate that the positive expected consequences of applying prd which is embodied in prd s theory dry and loveys 1998 went beyond the negative consequences of water salinity stresses however we tried to also explore sunflower s qualitative properties response to the selected treatments see section 3 2 2 our results well indicate that generally the salinity stress stimulated sunflower s n uptake table 5 which is in consistence with results reported by sadak mervat et al 2012 such improvement is enhanced under prd3 mainly due to the nature of such irrigation strategy in fact the frequent wetting and drying cycle under prd may improve n availability in crop s rooting zone on the one hand nourbakhsh and karimian eghbal 1997 vale et al 2007 wang et al 2010 and improve root n uptake through initiating the growth of secondary roots on the other hand poni et al 1992 liang et al 1996 fort et al 1997 sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 1997 which finally resulted in an increase in root n uptake in line with the findings of previous researchers sadak mervat et al 2012 aditya et al 2017 higher n uptake guarantees higher seed s protein content table 5 due to the linear relationship between these two parameters reported by earlier researchers tkachuk 1969 aditya et al 2017 seed s oil content as another qualitative property was less affected by water and or salinity stress table 5 which is also supported by some other researchers ghrab et al 2013 and 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 such findings may imply the importance of the salinity stress level imposed to the crops francois 1996 found that sunflower s seed oil content was not significantly affected by salinity stress when irrigation water ec is increased up to 10 2 ds m nevertheless plants under prd and in particular under prd3 produced more oil content even compared to fi our findings at final harvest showed that by ey and oy were affected by water salinity stress see section 3 2 3 table 6 which is in agreement with earlier findings francois et al 1996 flagella et al 2004 liu et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 mousavi et al 2009 amer 2010 kang et al 2010 ghrab et al 2013 by reduction under the exposed stresses is a result of a highly strong correlation between dm and by table 6 yield reduction under saline water stress may be justified by limited leaf expansion or reduced crop height dm and stem diameter caused by reduced root water uptake which consequently results in lowered photosynthesis rate amer 2010 zheng et al 2013 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 and finally oy reduction is well justified by considerable reduction in ey and or seed s oil content under such stresses flagella et al 2004 ghrab et al 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 while in the farmers point of view ey plays a major role in adopting a new proposed strategy iwp may be a more comprehensive index since it represents the amount of crop production per unit of consumed water our findings demonstrated that all prd treatments had generally high potentials for improving iwp section 3 2 4 table 7 which is also supported by the other researchers shahnazari et al 2007 karandish and simunek 2016a karandish 2016 however prd3 could be proposed as the best freshwater saving irrigation strategy for sunflower production in the study area when both freshwater saving and iwp are considered nevertheless such proposal should be made by caution since soil salinity could be an obstacle to sustainable agriculture and it needs to be analyzed as well our given results showed that soil salinity increased under all treatments at final harvest see section 3 3 table 8 figs 6 and 7 which is generally due to either saline water application amer 2010 nagaz et al 2012 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 or the use of drip irrigation system chen et al 2009 wan et al 2010 kang et al 2010 while soil salinity increase is a serious threat to sustainable agriculture kang et al 2010 aditya et al 2017 such threat may be resolved when the accumulated salt is leached out of the rooting zone either through applying additional irrigation water during the cropping cycle or through rainfall events occurring out of the growing season ghrab et al 2014 farhadi machekposhti et al 2017 comparing the rooting zone soil salinity in 2014 and 2015 gowing seasons well indicates that the out season precipitation fallen in the study area had a high potential in reducing soil salinity and keeping it far below the sunflower s ecethr table 8 in addition less additional irrigation precipitation water is required to leach out the accumulated salt in the rooting zone under prd3 fig 7 and table 8 emitter s performance is the other important issue when applying saline water irrigation hence we evaluated the performance of the drip irrigation system see section 3 4 table 9 based on different criteria frequently used by earlier researchers barragan et al 2010 sahin et al 2012 shareef et al 2016 tan et al 2018 the computed cv 5 table 9 denotes the excellent hydraulic performance of the emitters for all treatments based on solomon 1979 cv 20 ensures the acceptable performance of a micro irrigation system asae 2000 also reported that for the point source emitters cv 5 indicates an excellent performance of the emitters while 5 cv 7 and cv 7 are the indications of average and poor performance respectively the computed values for eu were higher than 90 for all treatments based on the classification method defined by merriam and keller 1978 the drip irrigation system could be classified under excellent condition when eu 90 barragan et al 2010 also demonstrated that in a desirable system eu may change in the range of 85 95 when the field s slope is less than 2 the acceptable values obtained either for the distribution uniformity coefficients du 95 0 96 0 or for the christiansen s uniformity coefficients cu 96 1 97 5 also confirm the excellent performance of the current system 5 conclusion feeding the growing population requires alleviating global freshwater scarcity in agriculture by applying poor quality water resources nevertheless such application should be properly managed to prevent serious economic environmental challenges here and for the first time we integrated prd with diluted seawater irrigation to find out the best prd management package regarding crop response soil ec increase and drip irrigation system efficiency apart from freshwater saving both fi and prd1 could be considered as the most efficient treatments since they always had the highest economic yield and the lowest salinity increase in the rooting zone however they couldn t be fully environmentally efficient since they may use up to 36 4 more freshwater compared to the other treatments on the other hand our results indicated that applying either full irrigation or prd with only diluted seawater resource may also expose serious yield losses and salinity increase in the soil despite of a 13 27 freshwater saving irrigating crops with only diluted seawater may result in serious eco environmental impacts since it caused 15 36 loss in economic yield and 2 5 8 3 times increase in soil ece at harvest on the other hand such applications ended up with 15 31 reduction in irrigation water productivity which means less crop per drop however an alternate application of freshwater diluted seawater under prd with 25 less irrigation water compared to crop water demand prd3 may prevent significant yield loss improves crop quality properties and reduces total salt accumulation in the rooting zone at harvest prd3 provided a slight reduction of up to 8 in economic yield and always kept the rooting zone ece below sunflower ecethr the ece under which no yield reduction is expected in addition up to 20 freshwater saving was also obtained under such irrigation strategy which led to higher or close values of iwp to those obtained for the fi treatment the drip irrigation system s performance was also secured under such management such results demonstrate lower economic loss and safer environment based on the results it could be concluded that prd3 is the most efficient irrigation strategy in the study area regarding

10632,the jarvis canopy resistance sub model is commonly used in transpiration modelling although its optimal structure is rarely studied it is still not fully clear that to what extent transpiration modeling may differ if using different constraint function forms for key environmental variable in jarvis sub model in this study various jarvis canopy resistance sub model configurations were embedded in the penman monteith model to compare their ability to model daily transpiration of rain fed jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations where soil moisture is a key factor of tree water use parameters were calibrated using the bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation technique and model comparison was quantified using deviance information criterion dic the results showed significant differences in model performance between the constraint function forms of soil water content the difference in dic between the model with the best constraint function form and the other two forms reached 37 66 50 94 much higher than the evaluation criteria for significance larger than 7 when the best constraint function form was used the performance of the transpiration model improved the model performance worsened when the other constraint function forms were used even worse than those without consideration for soil water content however only slight differences in model performance were detected for the constraint function forms of temperature vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation using the best configuration of jarvis canopy resistance sub model daily transpiration of jujube plantation was well estimated with overall good accuracy and acceptable uncertainty the predictions and observations were highly correlated r2 0 87 for calibration and r2 0 80 for validation the results suggested that different constraint function forms of an environmental factor contributed differently to transpiration model performance and the situation was different for different environmental factors including the key environmental factor in the jarvis canopy resistance sub model will not always improve the performance of transpiration models keywords bayesian analysis canopy resistance conductance transpiration rain fed jujube loess plateau 1 introduction currently parameter estimation functions in models are mainly based on empirical and separate approach without syntheses in data processes and theoretical understanding clark and gelfand 2006 it can also be done by fitting models to observed values in combination with parameter validation using independent observations clark and gelfand 2006 zhang et al 2008 ewers 2013 resulting in equifinality in estimation beven and binley 1992 furthermore real systems with many aspects and details are usually too complex to be entirely described in a mathematical model consequently real systems are practically often simplified in models because of limitations in available scientific knowledge and other constraints samanta et al 2007 such incompletely mechanistic models integrate with measurement errors leading to uncertainties in model structure input and output of the model however traditional deterministic modelling methods cannot assess and quantify these uncertainties li et al 2010 in addition model advantages are often debated in terms of complexity even though complex models generally include more mechanistic processes that make them closer to real systems while with a larger number of calibrated parameters they are more susceptible to over fitting than simpler ones gaganis and smith 2001 also estimating many parameters has its own difficulties including limited data availability dekker et al 2001 wang et al 2001 because of these and other factors complex models are not always considered to be better than simple ones relatively recently various methodologies have been developed to overcome the above weakness in traditional model calibrations among these the bayesian approach was introduced to generate post parameter distributions by combining the related probability distributions with field measurements based on prior assumptions about magnitude and uncertainty zhu et al 2013 this allows adequate analysis of uncertainties in model structures parameters inputs and outputs of models along with accounting for prior knowledge on parameters and accommodating effects clark and gelfand 2006 zhu et al 2011 chen et al 2015 abundant evidence shows that the bayesian approach provides powerful tools for drawing inferences on high dimensional models clark and gelfand 2006 the use of bayesian framework in quantitative model comparisons is highly promising as it not only evaluates parameter and predicts uncertainties but also identifies the simplest model among various alternatives samanta et al 2008 mackay et al 2012 as noted by ewers 2013 bayesian framework combined with long term dataset will likely provide the best hope for improving our understanding on forest response to climate change at long term and large spatial scale the focus of this study was on the issues of transpiration models comparison at daily scale using a bayesian framework for jujube trees a drought tolerant plant with limited such studies exactly multiple canopy resistance sub models were embedded in the penman monteith equation to compare their abilities to model transpiration measured by sap flux method in a jujube plantation the canopy resistance sub models were obtained using different configurations of the stomatal conductance model proposed by jarvis 1976 jarvis sub model and the other aspects of the penman monteith equation were fixed this allowed the contributions of different canopy resistance sub models to be evaluated in a stable model structure context the two primary objectives of the study were to 1 quantitatively assess the contributions of commonly used constraint function forms of main environmental factors in jarvis sub model in jujube transpiration modeling based on bayesian analysis and 2 evaluate transpiration modeling with the best configuration of canopy resistance sub model we specifically asked 1 if different constraint function forms of an environmental factor can achieve similar transpiration modeling performance through using the bayesian calibration approach 2 if not to what extent the constraint function forms differ 3 if the situations differ among various environmental factors 4 if the addition of the key environmental factor the factor which has extremely important limit on tree growth to the jarvis sub model always improved transpiration modeling regardless of the constraint function form used since the constraint function forms assessed in this study were those commonly used and widely accepted we assumed that different constraint function forms of an environmental factor cannot equally contribute to transpiration modeling performance but the differences in transpiration modeling performance caused by using different constraint function forms of an environmental factor were relatively small compared with that caused by using different environmental factors therefore we hypothesized that it was more important to recognize the key environmental factor and that including it into jarvis sub model will improve transpiration modeling performance irrespective of the constraint function forms these assumptions were tested in this study actually the first two questions stated above have been partially addressed by samanta et al 2008 where two different constraint function forms of vapor pressure deficit were adopted but only one was considered for other environmental factors our approach here differs from that in that work firstly because we evaluated a large variety of constraint function configurations with multiple function forms adopted for all environmental factors this systematic comparison approach enables us to diagnose if different environmental factors have different influence on transpiration model performance when changing their constraint function forms to answer the third question we raised secondly because a special prominence was given to exploring the importance of choosing constraint function forms for the key environmental factor if it was always necessary to include the key environmental factor in the jarvis sub model thus it was possible to determine the extent to which the constraint function forms of the key factor differs in terms of contributing to transpiration modeling the novelty of this study is reflected in exploring the two issues mentioned above since they are remained poorly understood and not conclusively addressed in other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field observations were conducted from may 2012 to october 2014 at an experimental station 38 11 n 109 28 e altitude of 1049 m of northwest a f university in shaanxi province northwest china this area belongs to the loess plateau region where the climate is dry with severe water scarcity the typical semiarid temperate climate there has a mean daily solar radiation of 13 95 mj m 2 mean annual precipitation of 451 mm mean daily temperature of 8 5 c and frost free period of 160 days the loess soil has a uniform texture and moderate permeability with an average depth to water table of 50 m in the upper 1 0 m soil profile mean soil bulk density is 1 29 g cm 3 field capacity and wilting point moisture content by mass are 17 83 and 5 16 respectively the investigated jujube ziziphus jujuba mill trees were planted at a spacing of 3 m 2 m in 2003 the cultivation was done under rain fed conditions as the site is far away from any water source and irrigation system to reduce competition for water in the jujube plantation weeds were removed regularly and no mulching was done during the study period to ease picking of ripened fruit the jujube trees were pruned every year to keep a height of around 2 m and pruning treatment was arranged before the end of dormancy at the end of march about one month before the start of jujube growth to avoid damage on plant growth the trunk diameter at 20 cm aboveground was 8 10 cm the canopy shape was almost uniform forming a sphere of approximate diameter of 1 5 m and bearing some 500 shoots 25 40 cm in length leaves of size of 4 cm 7 cm were common and had a fresh weight of about 0 5 g and a dry weight of about 0 2 g the growth season of jujube in the study area was from may to october 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 environmental

1998 daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the formula recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 as noted by ma et al 2013 fine roots of the 12 year jujube trees similar to the age of jujube plantation in this study and also under rain fed conditions were most abundant in the upper soil layers the density of the fine root sharply decreased with increasing soil depth beyond 0 8 m specifically over 50 of fine root was concentrated in the 0 1 m soil layer li et al 2017 also noted that soil water storage in the 0 0 6 m soil layer under 10 15 year jujube plantations was remarkably affected by precipitation and root water uptake while soil water storage below 0 6 m soil depth had no clear fluctuation throughout the growing season a similar conclusion was reported by chen et al 2014 that soil water content below 1 m jujube plantation was much more stable and constant compared with that of the 0 1 m soil layer thus the top 1 m soil layer was regarded as the main root distribution zone and water uptake zone of jujube plantation in the study area consequently soil water content θ for the top 1 m soil layer was monitored during the 2012 2014 jujube growth seasons using tdr probe sensors sdi 12 acclima inc usa in total 8 soil profiles with random horizontal distances from the tree trunks were selected as monitoring sites among these 4 profiles located within rows and another 4 located between rows the soil moisture sensors were installed at 20 cm intervals in the 0 1 m soil profile at each selected monitoring site the cr1000 campbell co usa instrument was used to collect the sensor data in every 30 min and the collected volumetric soil water content data were calibrated to mass soil water content using the oven drying method all soil water content data were presented as gravimetric percentage in this study during the entire period of study total precipitation in 2014 386 mm was much lower than that in 2012 477 mm and 2013 530 mm because of the higher total precipitation in 2013 average soil water content θ 9 32 for the upper 20 cm and 8 48 for the upper 1 m soil layer were much higher than that in 2012 8 10 and 7 60 and 2014

2012 2013 and 2014 jujube growth seasons fig 1g i 2 2 2 sap flow and leaf area index sap flux measurement was conducted on 24 randomly selected jujube trees using thermal dissipation method granier 1985 1987 for each tree a single thermal dissipation probe tdp dynamax co usa with two needle probes length 20 diameter 2 mm were installed on the north side of the trunk at a height of 20 cm above the soil surface the sap flow data were recorded using cr1000 data logger campbell co usa at a step of 10 min during the 2012 2014 jujube growth seasons sap flux density was calculated based on the temperature difference between heated and unheated probes following the same equation given by granier 1987 then transpiration t was determined assuming that sap flux density is constant across the sapwood profile granier 1985 granier et al 1996 the calculations have been well documented in our previous studies for brevity we refer readers to chen et al 2015 for more detail according to prior research tdp error is relatively higher under low vpd condition o brien et al 2010 thus only sap flux values for vpd higher than 0 6 kpa were used in this study winscanopy analysis equipment winscanopy 2005a regent instruments inc canada was adopted to take canopy photos around every two weeks on sunny days during jujube growth seasons in 2012 2014 the winscanopy 2005a software was used to derive leaf area index l a i values from collected photos the time series of the lai were then fitted using growth functions and interpolated for daily lai using the fitted equations fig 2 2 3 model description the transpiration models used in this study maintained the same structures in every aspect except the canopy resistance sub model as such the contributions of different canopy resistance sub models could be evaluated within a fixed model structure context the adopted transpiration models were based on the penman monteith equation with its basic structure expressed as monteith 1965 1 t e δ r n c g ρ c p v p d r a δ γ 1 r c r a where te is transpiration mj m 2 d 1 rnc is net radiation intercepted by tree canopy mj m 2 day 1 δ is saturated pressure slope kpa c 1 ρ is

respectively rnc is calculated using beer s law as 2 r n c r n 1 exp c l a i where rn is net radiation above tree canopy mj m 2 day 1 and c is extinction coefficient of light attenuation dimensionless aerodynamic resistance r a is expressed as perrier 1975 3 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d h c d k 2 u where z m is reference height estimated as z h c 2 h c m is mean height of crop m z 0 m is roughness length calculated as z 0 0 13 h c d m is zero plane displacement given as d 0 63 h c k is karman constant dimensionless 0 40 and u m s 1 is wind speed at reference height in this study canopy resistance r c the reciprocal of canopy conductance was calculated utilizing a jarvis type model which gives a general function form presenting the relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors and then using leaf area index lai for conversion to canopy scale assuming that the effect of every environmental factor is independent of the other the individual effect of environmental factor x on stomatal conductance is represented by a constraint function f x a dimensionless value in a range of 0 1 the combined effects of n different environmental factors is expressed as the product of n different constraint functions together f x1 f x2 f x3 f xn in this way jarvis model is flexible to obtain different configurations for modeling environmental response of stomatal conductance depending on the used environmental factors and mathematical formulations of their constraint functions the general expression of canopy resistance r c sub model is given as jarvis 1976 4 r c r s t

effective lai and it is equal to lai when lai 2 lai 2 when lai 4 and 2 for other cases in this study different configurations of the jarvis model differing in terms of structure parameter and factor were embedded in the transpiration model and their contributions to the transpiration model performance were compared in detail the jarvis model configurations compared in this study used constraint functions for air temperature t photosynthetically active radiation par vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil water content θ in various combinations to calculate r c regarding the constraint functions three alternative forms were used for vpd par and θ while two alternative forms were used for t all commonly used in previous research harris et al 2004 kato et al 2004 poyatos et al 2007 samanta et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 ortega farias et al 2010 li et al 2013 ding et al 2015 the constraint functions and associated parameters are shown in table 1 and the explanations to the parameters shown in table 2 we used different combinations of factors and constraint functions in different sub model configurations briefly the transpiration models were designated by letter strings with numerical subscripts to indicate the functions in the related canopy conductance sub models as in table 1 the letters v r t and w denote vpd par t and θ respectively the numerical subscript 1 2 and 3 symbolize that the first second and third form of constraint function is used respectively in case of a particular function is not used the corresponding letter and numerical subscript are removed from the designation e g r3t2w3 implies that par t and θ are included in the canopy resistance sub model and the third second and third form of their constraint functions was used respectively for a certain environmental factor only one constraint function form can be used as a result we obtained 191 configurations in all 11 mono environmental factor configurations 45 di environmental factor configurations 81 tri environmental factor configurations and 54 tetra environmental factor configurations the transpiration models were ran for every configuration to evaluate and compare the relative importance of the environment factors and their constraint functions 2 4 bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison in the bayesian framework unknown parameters are handled as random variables with distributions derived from known data borsuk et al 2001 thus the basic theory of bayesian analysis is to use measurements and parameter prior knowledge to relate the inverse problem with the forward problem li et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 a general function describing the bayesian probabilistic inversion can be found in hill 1974 for this analysis the 191 configurations of canopy resistance r c sub model led to 191 transpiration model forms parameter combinations among which c and rstmin were common parameters used in all transpiration models the other parameters k1 k2 k3 a b b2 tl th top t a2 a3 θcr m1 m2 s f0 were selectively used as components of the parameter vector β according to the associated configuration of r c sub model parameters constituting β were calibrated using a bayesian approach markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation technique bayes and price 1763 it was assumed that model errors defined as the difference between simulated output s and observed data o are independent and normally distributed with a constant and unknown variance σ 2 and a zero mean svensson et al 2008 van oijen et al 2005 the likelihood function for the entire series o containing n observations is given as zhu et al 2013 5 p o β σ 2 σ n i 1 n exp o i s x i β 2 2 σ 2 where oi is measured transpiration for observation i i 1 2 n xi is vector of mode input data s xi β is model simulation output with parameter vector β and σ is standard deviation of model error here it was assumed that the calibration parameter β is distributed uniformly within a specified interval table 2 and the prior distribution of σ uniform over log σ zhu et al 2013 thus the non informative prior distribution used in the study is given as 6 p θ 1 σ 2 using the above prior information the joint posterior distribution is defined as 7 p β σ 2 o σ n 2 i 1 n exp o i s x i β 2 2 σ 2 the posterior distribution was sampled using the mcmc method based on the gibbs sampling using the software windows version of bayesian updating using gibbs sampler winbugs for each of the 191 model forms 3 markov chains of 100 000 iterations were run initialized with given the starting parameter values chain convergence was visually evaluated by plotting traces of sampled parameter values against iterations kass et al 1998 and also diagnosed quantitatively by using the potential scale reduction factor r ˆ an r ˆ value of less than 1 2 was used to indicate that chain convergence to a stationary posterior distribution gelman and rubin 1992 then the posterior distributions for every parameter were obtained after discarding the first half of each chain as the burn in period quantitative model comparisons were performed based on deviance information criterion dic as described by samanta et al 2008 the metric concurrently takes the prediction accuracy uncertainties and model complexity into consideration moreover it is consistent with the bayesian approach and can be calculated along with the usual mcmc steps using the following equations mackay et al 2012 samanta et al 2008 8 p d d θ d θ 9 d i c d θ p d 2 d θ d θ where d θ is mean deviance p d is model complexity defined as the effective number of parameters and d θ is deviance at posterior mean of parameters in model selection a lower dic is associated with a better model we adopted the same judgement standard as done in other studies where dic difference larger than 7 implied highly significant differences in the performances of the models if dic difference was 3 7 the performances of the models had a moderately significant difference then the performances of models were considered to have no significant difference for dic difference smaller than 3 burnham and anderson 2002 mackay et al 2012 samanta et al 2008 it is noteworthy that in this study field observations during the 2012 and 2013 jujube growth seasons were used to calibrate models based on bayesian approach and another independent set of field measured data during the 2014 jujube growth season were used for separate model validation 3 results 3 1 model comparison all three markov chains showed visual indication of convergence for the initial 100 000 iterations considering the first half iterations as the burn in period although the starting values of the parameters were different the chains for all the parameters in all the models were convergent convergence to stationary distributions of parameters and similarity among chains were also supported by the r ˆ value which varied from 0 978 to 1 003 this was less than the maximum value of 1 2 recommended by gelman and rubin 1992 indicating that the chains converged to a stationary posterior distribution besides the value of autocorrelation functions decreased rapidly to zero see examples of v2r3t2w3 shown in figure s1 as supplementary material using the model v2r3t2w3 as an example the posterior parameter distributions are given in figure s2 as supplementary material the shapes of the plot show the dispersions and symmetries of marginal distributions lehuger et al 2009 noticeably the posterior distributions of all the parameters were narrower than the anterior distributions table 2 suggesting that the parameters were well updated by the mcmc procedure and their uncertainties drastically reduced under calibration the distributions of a small number of parameters e g a2 and s remained relatively constant with fairly broad confidence intervals suggesting less identification under low prior information patrick et al 2009 the pd and dic results of the 191 transpiration models based on bayesian analysis ranked in the order of increasing dic and given in table s1 as supplementary material the models were separated into three groups with distinct dic levels depending on the used constraint function of soil water content models in the first group had the best dic range 44 56 to 38 67 significantly smaller than other models based on the criterion used all models with w3 or without soil water content were assorted with this group while models with worser dic values between 6 91 and 2 97 were put in the second group which contained all the models with w2 the remaining models with w1 were put under the third group which had the worst dic range 6 38 16 04 drastically higher than those of the models in the other groups based on the groups there were relatively small variations in dic among the models within a certain group for the first group the w3 model had the best dic 44 56 it was slightly lower than that of r3 43 03 t2 42 71 v2 42 59 v3 42 55 r2 42 55 r1 42 54 v1 42 53 and t1 42 44 but none of the differences was significant dic difference less than 3 the minor difference in dic values suggested that θ vpd par and t had near equivalent impacts on jujube transpiration moreover the three constraint function forms of vpd had small differences in their contributions to dic comparatively lower dic was noted when r3 and t1 were used instead of r1 r2 and t2 for par and t respectively but also none was significant with the exception of w3 the addition of environmental constraint functions particularly for t1 generally increased dic for all the combinations dic increased with the removal of w3 but the degree of increase was not significant too there was no highly significant difference in dic values dic difference larger than 7 among the models within the group to be exact 28 out of 94 configurations were observed to have similar dic values dic difference less than 3 this was the case with the inclusion of w3 the one that had the best dic value and even for the 11 other configurations without w3 implying that the superiority of including soil water content in modeling transpiration was not high compared with the first group the constraint functions related to vpd par and t contributed nearly equally to dic in the other two groups but it was different for soil water constraint function in contrast to w3 w1 and w2 apparently increased dic value when applied to canopy resistance configurations thus changing constraint functions of soil moisture had relatively larger influence on dic values compared with changing constraint functions of other environmental factors indicating that choosing proper constraint function for soil moisture is extremely important in modeling jujube transpiration in the region even though the addition of w3 improved dic at a non significant degree the addition of w1 and w2 pronouncedly worsen dic values the different situation for constraint functions indicating that soil moisture was the most sensitive factor in modeling jujube transpiration in the region for further evaluation the estimated transpirations by w3 and w1 with the best fit parameter sets were compared with observation values in fig 3 in order to provide a baseline for comparison results of the transpiration model without considering any environmental factors in jarvis sub model its dic value was 18 06 worser than all models in table s1 as supplementary material were also presented in this figure here only the validation plot for the period 2014 was used and the comprehensive model performance is given in detail in the next sections compared with w3 the performance of w1 was unstable the results were similar to w3 in the earlier growth stage with relatively more overestimation and underestimation for some measurements while the overall result was worse than w3 for the later growth stage during this period of time soil water content was lowest in the 2012 2014 growth seasons fig 1 and w1 was likely to more severely underestimate the field observations thus w3 was more acceptable than w1 which supports the model comparison results based on dic values among the three models in fig 3 the model without considering any environmental factors in canopy resistance sub model showed the worst accuracy it severely underestimated transpiration in the earlier growth stage which corresponded to a relatively better soil water condition while the model displayed a clear overestimation trend in the latest growth stage during which soil water deficit was significant fig 1 the above result implied that taking soil moisture into consideration is necessary in transpiration modelling in this semi arid region 3 2 environmental response to constraint functions fig 4 compares different constraint function forms used for soil water content θ temperature t photosynthetically active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd even though a linear decrease was used in all the three constraint function forms for soil water content noticeable discrepancies existed at critical points and decreasing slopes the one with the best dic w3 was the flattest and yielded the highest critical point 9 46 for soil water content below the threshold value the constraint function began to drop then w2 exhibited a distinctly lower critical point 8 02 with the steepest decline slope fig 4a for further interpretation the threshold values of soil water content for w1 w2 and w3 were marked in the plots of transpiration normalized by et0 and lai t et0 lai and soil water content fig 5 the reason why we use t et0 lai rather than directly using transpiration was that transpiration is controlled by vegetative growth climate and soil water condition consequently the relationship between transpiration and soil water content could be confounded by variations in climatic factors and leaf and shoot expansions thus t et0 lai was applied to eliminate these effects granier 1987 liu et al 2012 qu et al 2007 this is because et0 generally reflects a comprehensive meteorological condition and lai is an overall index that widely used to roughly represent plant canopy growth status it is clear that the distribution of the points in fig 5 roughly increased with increasing soil moisture at the initial phase then fluctuated with the changes of soil moisture as a transition zone in the second phase and finally relatively stabilized at the latter phase the threshold value for w2 almost corresponded to the dividing line of the initial phase and the transitional phase while the threshold value for w1 located in the transition zone both the two threshold values are not appropriate as a critical point because they located in a stage where decreasing soil moisture inhibited or had obscure influence on t et0 lai which is not meet the definition of critical point differently the threshold value for w3 the constraint functions with the beat dic almost corresponded to the dividing line of the stabilizing phases and unsteady phase which was relatively appropriate as a critical breakpoint because when soil water content is larger than this value t et0 lai became largely steady with dynamics of soil moisture a considerable difference was also noted in the two constraint function forms for t the optimum temperature was nearly 21 close to the mean temperature for the observation period 22 9 and was the same for t1 and t2 fig 4b furthermore the decline in constraint function form t1 with increasing and decreasing temperature was markedly steeper than that of t2 when soil water content function w3 was added the constraint function t2w3 corresponding to a better dic value than t1w3 had a stronger relationship with soil water content linear relationship before threshold value and became constant afterwards but with a dispersed response to temperature fig 6 a and b differently the responses of constraint function t1w3 to temperature were fairly similar in shape to that of t1 without obvious connection with soil water content fig 6c and d similarly among the constraint function forms with par and soil water the one which had better dic value exhibited closer correlation with soil water specifically r3 the one with the best dic among the three constraint function forms for par had a resemble response curve to par compared to r1 and r2 fig 4c but had a lower decreasing point 70 w m 2 and steeper drop slope when combined with w3 a better dic was obtained than r1w3 and r2w3 correspondingly the constraint function of r3w3 had a stronger correlation with soil water content and a more discrete correlation with par fig 6e and f than of r1w3 and r2w3 fig 6g and h the three constraint function forms for vpd almost overlapped when vpd was less than 5 kpa fig 4d which was extensive in this study the result was consistent with the strongly close dic values mentioned above when soil water content was considered the combined constraint function e g v2w3 was more controlled by soil moisture than vpd fig 6i and j the constraint function form v2r3t2w3 which had the best dic among tetra environmental factors exhibited a clear correlation with soil water content and vpd fig 6k and l 3 3 performance of best fit parameters the performances of the transpiration model w3 under different environmental conditions are illustrated in the best fit parameter plots the simulated transpirations were compared with observed values during calibration 2012 2013 and validation 2014 periods in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 plots the observations posterior mean values and the 95 posterior density region of the transpiration model overall the model simulations followed the field measurements closely most measurements distributed well within the 95 posterior density region while exceptions also existed particularly for the early growth stages for which period transpiration was apparently underestimated in contrast the model generated some overestimations when daily transpiration was high as shown in fig 8a plots of the measured versus estimated transpiration fell well along the 1 1 line but with some widespread outlier points around the regression line the model performed better for the calibration period 2012 2013 r2 0 87 than that for the validation period 2014 r2 0 80 moreover the structure of the residual observed transpiration minus estimated value was reasonably consistent with the assumption of normality and conveyed an overall overestimation of high observation values 1 90 mm d 1 underestimation of low observation values 1 25 mm d 1 and a small component of mixes fig 8b it is clear from the plots of residual values against soil water content in fig 9 a that the model performed better under good soil water conditions specifically there was a wide range of the residual distribution 0 5 to 0 75 mm d 1 under soil water content less than 9 5 and a convergence for narrow residual distribution range 0 2 to 0 2 mm d 1 when soil water content was higher than the threshold value no obvious correlation was found between residuals and meteorological factors other than net radiation rn there was a good linear regression between residual and rn except for points for early growth stage with lai 2 m2 m 2 during this time underestimation occurred almost throughout the entire period irrespective of rn as 83 93 of the points were distributed above the zero residual line fig 9b the situation changed for lai 2 m2 m 2 for which underestimation was widespread with rn 125 w m 2 and overestimation dominant with rn 125 w m 2 fig 9b 4 discussion we rejected the hypothesis that addition of the key environmental factor in the jarvis sub model is always associated with improved transpiration modeling no matter which constraint function form was used model performance was worse in terms of dic with the addition of w1 and w2 to the model regardless of the model structure and even worse than without soil water content although soil moisture is a key factor for jujube growth in the region li et al 2018 ma et al 2013 chen et al 2014 however when w3 was used dic improved to varying degrees the models with w1 and w2 had considerably higher dic values compared with those with w3 or without w this implied that determination of proper constraint function form for sensitive environmental factors was essential for improving model performance in this study w1 and w2 were not the appropriate constraint function forms for soil water content however w1 the one with the worst performance and highest dic has mostly been used in massive modeling studies to determine the effect of soil water stress on plant physiological activities harris et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 hu et al 2009 li et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 among the studies w1 has mainly been applied by taking θcr as the only parameter the same as in our study or taking no parameter by directly using field capacity instead of θcr since the threshold for transpiration to be affected by soil moisture is species specific calibrating θcr for different plants is more reasonable than directly using a fixed value field capacity this was supported by the significantly worse dic value under using constant field capacity dic 247 33 data not shown compared with using the θcr parameter dic 6 38 table s1 as supplementary material therefore focus should be put on parameter selection during model calibration even though the constraint function form of w1 has a relatively simpler and more flexible structure over parameterization can easily result in posterior parameter values that are far different from experimental inference compared with w2 and w3 under such circumstance prior bounds of parameters can make a lot of sense and should therefore be considered in bayesian analysis our results suggested that evaluating or developing different forms of soil water constraint functions e g the constraint function used in the studies of bernier et al 2006 poyatos et al 2007 samanta et al 2008 and ding et al 2015 embedded in distinct models was indispensable in dry regions where water restriction commonly occurs except the new findings illustrated above regarding the importance of constraint function form for the key environmental factor our results were similar to samanta et al 2008 in the following three aspects 1 increases in model complexity were not always accompanied by improvements in model quality and the contribution of an individual model component was dependent on the other part of the model structure this was because some higher dic values were shown in most of transpiration models with the tetra environmental factors embedded in canopy resistance sub model 2 different constraint function forms of an environmental factor did not contribute equally to transpiration modeling performance and discrepancies existed among various environmental factors for example unlike the significant difference in w1 w2 and w3 for soil water content the three constraint function forms of v1 v2 and v3 for vapor pressure deficit differed only slightly in our study 3 constraint functions of different environmental factors can significantly differ in their contributions to transpiration modeling which can be interpreted by distinct dic values obtained from w1 and w2 compared with other constraint function forms of other environmental factors the difference in results between our study and that of samanta et al 2008 showed in the relative importance of different environmental factors in their sugar maple study in northern wisconsin usa vapor pressure deficit had the biggest impact on model performance and temperature the least a moderately significant effect of soil moisture function was detected only when a specific vapor pressure deficit constraint function was used otherwise in this study soil moisture constraint function had almost equivalent or even more important and sensitive impact on jujube transpiration compared with photosynthetic active radiation vapor pressure deficit and air temperature this diversity could partly be due to the differences in growing conditions uddling et al 2005 komatsu et al 2012 in the semi arid loess plateau dry climate and soil drought are common occurrences during summer in this case water related factors are critical in controlling plant water use without irrigation since rain fed cultivation was adopted during the three jujube growing seasons average soil water content was only 7 96 in the 0 1 m soil layer much lower than field capacity 17 83 and observed transpiration was mostly in the zone with soil moisture lower than the critical point around 9 5 shown in fig 5 hence it was evident that soil water availability often limited transpiration during the study period based on previous studies irvine et al 1998 sperry and sullivan 1992 poyatos et al 2007 plant can adjust hydraulic resistance in the soil to plant pathway to prevent excessive xylem embolism cavitation during drought stress one of the most common ways plants use in this process is limiting stomata aperture by regulating aba concentration since stomata aperture is directly linked with water use activity it is reasonable that soil water content can exert a significant effect on jujube transpiration modeling under widespread water deficit conditions however soil water content less than 20 volumetric was not observed in the sugar maple forest during their experimental period water stress was not likely a problem in their study thus soil moisture was not more predominant than other environmental factors in their transpiration simulation study moreover to guarantee the safety of water potential water consumption during plant growing period in dry environments tends to be more hydraulically constrained than in wet environments lin et al 2015 therefore difference in water stress degree can lead to the differences in water use sensitivities to other environmental factors another possible reason for the distinct environmental response between the two studies is the difference in anatomical and biochemical features of the different plant species caemmerer and evans 2015 as stated by sage and kubien 2007 environmental response of stomatal conductance is highly variable between species even though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood different key environmental drivers of transpiration of the two plants led to different results further emphasizing the need to recognize the main factors that drive transpiration for different plants to achieve this analyzing multiple datasets for distinct region and plants following a similar methodology can be helpful in evaluating and interpreting the contributions of environmental factors and the corresponding constraint functions in terms of transpiration modelling practice using the jarvis sub model in rain fed jujube plantations in the loess plateau region inclusion of soil moisture in canopy resistance calculation is highly suggested to improve transpiration model quality but just constraint function of w3 could be used in case soil moisture data is not available involving par t or vpd in jarvis sub model could achieve acceptable transpiration model performance and in this process constraint function of r3 and t2 should be firstly adopted for par and t respectively while the three constraint functions of vpd can be considered equally as they displayed small difference in contribution to transpiration modelling in this study even though the mcmc approach provided a powerful tool for calibrating jujube transpiration model parameters the tendency for underestimation in the early growth stage and overestimation in some high transpiration values by model with the best dic was noted underestimation can partly be caused by relatively large lai measurement errors during the period of low leaf area this is because the equipment measurement of lai in this study was based on the gap fraction theory then several factors can apparently influence lai retrieval including assumptions on the spatial distribution of leaves classification principles of images and the presence of non photosynthetic elements weiss et al 2004 these influences are more predominant when lai is low liu et al 2013 resulting in comparatively large model error during the early growth phase also in our study bayesian parameter estimation was performed on the whole time series in a year nevertheless physiologically related model parameters of plants can vary over the time course of plant organs e g leaf expansion aging and senescing wilson et al 2000 medlyn et al 2002 furthermore during development plants generally experience and acclimatize various biotic and abiotic stresses this can also lead to changes in relevant parameter values crucial for long term modeling xu and baldocchi 2003 zhu et al 2011 however seasonal variations in parameters were not considered in this study using fixed parameter values in prediction lasting throughout an entire growth period can lead to overestimation of high transpiration values to balance and compensate for underestimation of low transpiration values in the early growth stage besides the underestimation and overestimation mentioned above discrepancies were noted in model quality among different constraint function forms in this study moreover better model performance was detected under good soil water conditions as also revealed by zhang et al 2008 and rana et al 1997 the three aspects highlight the necessity for further extension or appropriate modification of jarvis model to improve the accuracy and reliability in transpiration simulation possible ways to do this include 1 testing other constraint function forms for different environmental factors 2 using additional variables such as leaf water potential medlyn et al 2011 leaf temperature li et al 2010 ambient co2 concentration samanta et al 2008 or some chemical and hydraulic signals e g xylem aba concentration ahmadi et al 2009 3 adding details in key processes like water storage in internal tissues paudel et al 2015 describing canopy characteristics in more detail mackay et al 2012 interprinting stomatal regulation combining transpiration with photosynthesis lin et al 2015 etc however this could make models more complex require more parameters for calibration and increase the requirements for additional observation data samanta et al 2007 all of these could in turn decrease model quality by making models more susceptible to over fitting during calibration and posing difficulties in obtaining data not commonly available dekker et al 2001 samanta et al 2007 it is therefore necessary to look for a balance by further developing and identifying optimal model structures that are more accurate and reliable not only having small uncertainties but also having relatively simple forms and few parameters the achievement of accurate transpiration estimation is necessary for developing viable water saving management strategies to improve water use efficiency and economic benefits for example combining with evapotranspiration et data our transpiration modelling method can be used to perform et partition dividing plant transpiration and soil evaporation components which is of great importance in irrigation operation kato et al 2004 tourula and heikinheimo 1998 transpiration simulation approaches with high precise are preferable in partition et dynamics than empirical dual coefficient crop factor method in agricultural applications kato et al 2004 qiu et al 1999 in dry farming systems where irrigation is not available compressive understanding of how environment limits plant water use is essential to develop sustainable cultivation strategies for example in chinese semiarid loess plateau region with dry climate and severe water shortage high water consumptions of some afforestation trees induce soil desiccation and ecological degradation cao et al 2010 accurate transpiration modelling is efficient for compressively quantifying plant water use under changing climate conditions based on which proper vegetation types can be evaluated and selected for afforestation adaptationally reasonable transpiration control strategies that maintain acceptable amount of productivity and avoid continuous soil water deficit can be developed to ensure sustainability of water resources management in orchards under such prevailing fragile ecology chen et al 2016 for these strategies the complex relationships between local environment plant water consumption fruit yield and soil water condition should be determined in this process precise transpiration estimation supports more possibilities for extensive explorations therefore this study provides useful information for effective water management in both irrigated and rain fed jujube plantations in the loess plateau region 5 conclusions based on the above discussions the main findings of the study were summarized as follows 1 different constraint function forms of an environmental factor in jarvis sub model differed in contribution to jujube transpiration modeling and there were discrepancies in sensitivity of transpiration to constraint function forms among different environmental factors 2 embedding the key environmental factor in jarvis canopy resistance sub model did not always result in an improvement in jujube transpiration model performance and such improvements depended on selected constraint function forms also increases in model complexity did not always accompanied with improvement in model quality 3 the bayesian approach provided a powerful method for parameter estimation and model comparison with the best configuration of canopy resistance sub model in this study the penman monteith transpiration model generated a good and acceptable performance for jujube

10632,the jarvis canopy resistance sub model is commonly used in transpiration modelling although its optimal structure is rarely studied it is still not fully clear that to what extent transpiration modeling may differ if using different constraint function forms for key environmental variable in jarvis sub model in this study various jarvis canopy resistance sub model configurations were embedded in the penman monteith model to compare their ability to model daily transpiration of rain fed jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations where soil moisture is a key factor of tree water use parameters were calibrated using the bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation technique and model comparison was quantified using deviance information criterion dic the results showed significant differences in model performance between the constraint function forms of soil water content the difference in dic between the model with the best constraint function form and the other two forms reached 37 66 50 94 much higher than the evaluation criteria for significance larger than 7 when the best constraint function form was used the performance of the transpiration model improved the model performance worsened when the other constraint function forms were used even worse than those without consideration for soil water content however only slight differences in model performance were detected for the constraint function forms of temperature vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation using the best configuration of jarvis canopy resistance sub model daily transpiration of jujube plantation was well estimated with overall good accuracy and acceptable uncertainty the predictions and observations were highly correlated r2 0 87 for calibration and r2 0 80 for validation the results suggested that different constraint function forms of an environmental factor contributed differently to transpiration model performance and the situation was different for different environmental factors including the key environmental factor in the jarvis canopy resistance sub model will not always improve the performance of transpiration models keywords bayesian analysis canopy resistance conductance transpiration rain fed jujube loess plateau 1 introduction currently parameter estimation functions in models are mainly based on empirical and separate approach without syntheses in data processes and theoretical understanding clark and gelfand 2006 it can also be done by fitting models to observed values in combination with parameter validation using independent observations clark and gelfand 2006 zhang et al 2008 ewers 2013 resulting in equifinality in estimation beven and binley 1992 furthermore real systems with many aspects and details are usually too complex to be entirely described in a mathematical model consequently real systems are practically often simplified in models because of limitations in available scientific knowledge and other constraints samanta et al 2007 such incompletely mechanistic models integrate with measurement errors leading to uncertainties in model structure input and output of the model however traditional deterministic modelling methods cannot assess and quantify these uncertainties li et al 2010 in addition model advantages are often debated in terms of complexity even though complex models generally include more mechanistic processes that make them closer to real systems while with a larger number of calibrated parameters they are more susceptible to over fitting than simpler ones gaganis and smith 2001 also estimating many parameters has its own difficulties including limited data availability dekker et al 2001 wang et al 2001 because of these and other factors complex models are not always considered to be better than simple ones relatively recently various methodologies have been developed to overcome the above weakness in traditional model calibrations among these the bayesian approach was introduced to generate post parameter distributions by combining the related probability distributions with field measurements based on prior assumptions about magnitude and uncertainty zhu et al 2013 this allows adequate analysis of uncertainties in model structures parameters inputs and outputs of models along with accounting for prior knowledge on parameters and accommodating effects clark and gelfand 2006 zhu et al 2011 chen et al 2015 abundant evidence shows that the bayesian approach provides powerful tools for drawing inferences on high dimensional models clark and gelfand 2006 the use of bayesian framework in quantitative model comparisons is highly promising as it not only evaluates parameter and predicts uncertainties but also identifies the simplest model among various alternatives samanta et al 2008 mackay et al 2012 as noted by ewers 2013 bayesian framework combined with long term dataset will likely provide the best hope for improving our understanding on forest response to climate change at long term and large spatial scale the focus of this study was on the issues of transpiration models comparison at daily scale using a bayesian framework for jujube trees a drought tolerant plant with limited such studies exactly multiple canopy resistance sub models were embedded in the penman monteith equation to compare their abilities to model transpiration measured by sap flux method in a jujube plantation the canopy resistance sub models were obtained using different configurations of the stomatal conductance model proposed by jarvis 1976 jarvis sub model and the other aspects of the penman monteith equation were fixed this allowed the contributions of different canopy resistance sub models to be evaluated in a stable model structure context the two primary objectives of the study were to 1 quantitatively assess the contributions of commonly used constraint function forms of main environmental factors in jarvis sub model in jujube transpiration modeling based on bayesian analysis and 2 evaluate transpiration modeling with the best configuration of canopy resistance sub model we specifically asked 1 if different constraint function forms of an environmental factor can achieve similar transpiration modeling performance through using the bayesian calibration approach 2 if not to what extent the constraint function forms differ 3 if the situations differ among various environmental factors 4 if the addition of the key environmental factor the factor which has extremely important limit on tree growth to the jarvis sub model always improved transpiration modeling regardless of the constraint function form used since the constraint function forms assessed in this study were those commonly used and widely accepted we assumed that different constraint function forms of an environmental factor cannot equally contribute to transpiration modeling performance but the differences in transpiration modeling performance caused by using different constraint function forms of an environmental factor were relatively small compared with that caused by using different environmental factors therefore we hypothesized that it was more important to recognize the key environmental factor and that including it into jarvis sub model will improve transpiration modeling performance irrespective of the constraint function forms these assumptions were tested in this study actually the first two questions stated above have been partially addressed by samanta et al 2008 where two different constraint function forms of vapor pressure deficit were adopted but only one was considered for other environmental factors our approach here differs from that in that work firstly because we evaluated a large variety of constraint function configurations with multiple function forms adopted for all environmental factors this systematic comparison approach enables us to diagnose if different environmental factors have different influence on transpiration model performance when changing their constraint function forms to answer the third question we raised secondly because a special prominence was given to exploring the importance of choosing constraint function forms for the key environmental factor if it was always necessary to include the key environmental factor in the jarvis sub model thus it was possible to determine the extent to which the constraint function forms of the key factor differs in terms of contributing to transpiration modeling the novelty of this study is reflected in exploring the two issues mentioned above since they are remained poorly understood and not conclusively addressed in other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field observations were conducted from may 2012 to october 2014 at an experimental station 38 11 n 109 28 e altitude of 1049 m of northwest a f university in shaanxi province northwest china this area belongs to the loess plateau region where the climate is dry with severe water scarcity the typical semiarid temperate climate there has a mean daily solar radiation of 13 95 mj m 2 mean annual precipitation of 451 mm mean daily temperature of 8 5 c and frost free period of 160 days the loess soil has a uniform texture and moderate permeability with an average depth to water table of 50 m in the upper 1 0 m soil profile mean soil bulk density is 1 29 g cm 3 field capacity and wilting point moisture content by mass are 17 83 and 5 16 respectively the investigated jujube ziziphus jujuba mill trees were planted at a spacing of 3 m 2 m in 2003 the cultivation was done under rain fed conditions as the site is far away from any water source and irrigation system to reduce competition for water in the jujube plantation weeds were removed regularly and no mulching was done during the study period to ease picking of ripened fruit the jujube trees were pruned every year to keep a height of around 2 m and pruning treatment was arranged before the end of dormancy at the end of march about one month before the start of jujube growth to avoid damage on plant growth the trunk diameter at 20 cm aboveground was 8 10 cm the canopy shape was almost uniform forming a sphere of approximate diameter of 1 5 m and bearing some 500 shoots 25 40 cm in length leaves of size of 4 cm 7 cm were common and had a fresh weight of about 0 5 g and a dry weight of about 0 2 g the growth season of jujube in the study area was from may to october 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 environmental

temperature ta wind speed u and relative humidity rh every 10 min during 2012 2014 jujube growth seasons vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated based on air temperature and relative humidity norman 1998 daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the formula recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 as noted by ma et al 2013 fine roots of the 12 year jujube trees similar to the age of jujube plantation in this study and also under rain fed conditions were most abundant in the upper soil layers the density of the fine root sharply decreased with increasing soil depth beyond 0 8 m specifically over 50 of fine root was concentrated in the 0 1 m soil layer li et al 2017 also noted that soil water storage in the 0 0 6 m soil layer under 10 15 year jujube plantations was remarkably affected by precipitation and root water uptake while soil water storage below 0 6 m soil depth had no clear fluctuation throughout the growing season a similar conclusion was reported by chen et al 2014 that soil water content below 1 m jujube plantation was much more stable and constant compared with that of the 0 1 m soil layer thus the top 1 m soil layer was regarded as the main root distribution zone and water uptake zone of jujube plantation in the study area consequently soil water content θ for the top 1 m soil layer was monitored during the 2012 2014 jujube growth seasons using tdr probe sensors sdi 12 acclima inc usa in total 8 soil profiles with random horizontal distances from the tree trunks were selected as monitoring sites among these 4 profiles located within rows and another 4 located between rows the soil moisture sensors were installed at 20 cm intervals in the 0 1 m soil profile at each selected monitoring site the cr1000 campbell co usa instrument was used to collect the sensor data in every 30 min and the collected volumetric soil water content data were calibrated to mass soil water content using the oven drying method all soil water content data were presented as gravimetric percentage in this study during the entire period of study total precipitation in 2014 386 mm was much lower than that in 2012 477 mm and 2013 530 mm because of the higher total precipitation in 2013 average soil water content θ 9 32 for the upper 20 cm and 8 48 for the upper 1 m soil layer were much higher than that in 2012 8 10 and 7 60 and 2014 7 14 and 7 76 fig 1 a c in the three years 82 32 89 42 of the precipitation occurred during jujube growth season may to october the average daily r s was 20 34 mj m 2 for 2012 16 83 mj m 2 for 2013 and 16 97 mj m 2 for 2014 jujube growth seasons v p d exhibited a similar trend with an average of 1 39 kpa for 2012 1 02 kpa for 2013 and 0 98 kpa for 2014 both r s and vpd were highest in late may to mid june fig 1d f the maximum daily average ta was on june 29 2013 30 5 whereas the lowest was on october 1 2014 12 daily mean u was 0 1 04 m s 1 0 1 1 4 m s 1 and 0 2 1 1 m s 1 respectively in the 2012 2013 and 2014 jujube growth seasons fig 1g i 2 2 2 sap flow and leaf area index sap flux measurement was conducted on 24 randomly selected jujube trees using thermal dissipation method granier 1985 1987 for each tree a single thermal dissipation probe tdp dynamax co usa with two needle probes length 20 diameter 2 mm were installed on the north side of the trunk at a height of 20 cm above the soil surface the sap flow data were recorded using cr1000 data logger campbell co usa at a step of 10 min during the 2012 2014 jujube growth seasons sap flux density was calculated based on the temperature difference between heated and unheated probes following the same equation given by granier 1987 then transpiration t was determined assuming that sap flux density is constant across the sapwood profile granier 1985 granier et al 1996 the calculations have been well documented in our previous studies for brevity we refer readers to chen et al 2015 for more detail according to prior research tdp error is relatively higher under low vpd condition o brien et al 2010 thus only sap flux values for vpd higher than 0 6 kpa were used in this study winscanopy analysis equipment winscanopy 2005a regent instruments inc canada was adopted to take canopy photos around every two weeks on sunny days during jujube growth seasons in 2012 2014 the winscanopy 2005a software was used to derive leaf area index l a i values from collected photos the time series of the lai were then fitted using growth functions and interpolated for daily lai using the fitted equations fig 2 2 3 model description the transpiration models used in this study maintained the same structures in every aspect except the canopy resistance sub model as such the contributions of different canopy resistance sub models could be evaluated within a fixed model structure context the adopted transpiration models were based on the penman monteith equation with its basic structure expressed as monteith 1965 1 t e δ r n c g ρ c p v p d r a δ γ 1 r c r a where te is transpiration mj m 2 d 1 rnc is net radiation intercepted by tree canopy mj m 2 day 1 δ is saturated pressure slope kpa c 1 ρ is air density g mm 3 c p is specific heat at constant pressure mj kg 1 c 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r a and r c are aerodynamic resistance s m 1 and surface canopy resistance s m 1 respectively rnc is calculated using beer s law as 2 r n c r n 1 exp c l a i where rn is net radiation above tree canopy mj m 2 day 1 and c is extinction coefficient of light attenuation dimensionless aerodynamic resistance r a is expressed as perrier 1975 3 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d h c d k 2 u where z m is reference height estimated as z h c 2 h c m is mean height of crop m z 0 m is roughness length calculated as z 0 0 13 h c d m is zero plane displacement given as d 0 63 h c k is karman constant dimensionless 0 40 and u m s 1 is wind speed at reference height in this study canopy resistance r c the reciprocal of canopy conductance was calculated utilizing a jarvis type model which gives a general function form presenting the relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors and then using leaf area index lai for conversion to canopy scale assuming that the effect of every environmental factor is independent of the other the individual effect of environmental factor x on stomatal conductance is represented by a constraint function f x a dimensionless value in a range of 0 1 the combined effects of n different environmental factors is expressed as the product of n different constraint functions together f x1 f x2 f x3 f xn in this way jarvis model is flexible to obtain different configurations for modeling environmental response of stomatal conductance depending on the used environmental factors and mathematical formulations of their constraint functions the general expression of canopy resistance r c sub model is given as jarvis 1976 4 r c r s t min l a i e i 1 n f i x i where rstmin is minimum stomatal resistance under optimal conditions xi and fi xi represent a specific environmental factor and its constraint function respectively laie is effective lai and it is equal to lai when lai 2 lai 2 when lai 4 and 2 for other cases in this study different configurations of the jarvis model differing in terms of structure parameter and factor were embedded in the transpiration model and their contributions to the transpiration model performance were compared in detail the jarvis model configurations compared in this study used constraint functions for air temperature t photosynthetically active radiation par vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil water content θ in various combinations to calculate r c regarding the constraint functions three alternative forms were used for vpd par and θ while two alternative forms were used for t all commonly used in previous research harris et al 2004 kato et al 2004 poyatos et al 2007 samanta et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 ortega farias et al 2010 li et al 2013 ding et al 2015 the constraint functions and associated parameters are shown in table 1 and the explanations to the parameters shown in table 2 we used different combinations of factors and constraint functions in different sub model configurations briefly the transpiration models were designated by letter strings with numerical subscripts to indicate the functions in the related canopy conductance sub models as in table 1 the letters v r t and w denote vpd par t and θ respectively the numerical subscript 1 2 and 3 symbolize that the first second and third form of constraint function is used respectively in case of a particular function is not used the corresponding letter and numerical subscript are removed from the designation e g r3t2w3 implies that par t and θ are included in the canopy resistance sub model and the third second and third form of their constraint functions was used respectively for a certain environmental factor only one constraint function form can be used as a result we obtained 191 configurations in all 11 mono environmental factor configurations 45 di environmental factor configurations 81 tri environmental factor configurations and 54 tetra environmental factor configurations the transpiration models were ran for every configuration to evaluate and compare the relative importance of the environment factors and their constraint functions 2 4 bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison in the bayesian framework unknown parameters are handled as random variables with distributions derived from known data borsuk et al 2001 thus the basic theory of bayesian analysis is to use measurements and parameter prior knowledge to relate the inverse problem with the forward problem li et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 a general function describing the bayesian probabilistic inversion can be found in hill 1974 for this analysis the 191 configurations of canopy resistance r c sub model led to 191 transpiration model forms parameter combinations among which c and rstmin were common parameters used in all transpiration models the other parameters k1 k2 k3 a b b2 tl th top t a2 a3 θcr m1 m2 s f0 were selectively used as components of the parameter vector β according to the associated configuration of r c sub model parameters constituting β were calibrated using a bayesian approach markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation technique bayes and price 1763 it was assumed that model errors defined as the difference between simulated output s and observed data o are independent and normally distributed with a constant and unknown variance σ 2 and a zero mean svensson et al 2008 van oijen et al 2005 the likelihood function for the entire series o containing n observations is given as zhu et al 2013 5 p o β σ 2 σ n i 1 n exp o i s x i β 2 2 σ 2 where oi is measured transpiration for observation i i 1 2 n xi is vector of mode input data s xi β is model simulation output with parameter vector β and σ is standard deviation of model error here it was assumed that the calibration parameter β is distributed uniformly within a specified interval table 2 and the prior distribution of σ uniform over log σ zhu et al 2013 thus the non informative prior distribution used in the study is given as 6 p θ 1 σ 2 using the above prior information the joint posterior distribution is defined as 7 p β σ 2 o σ n 2 i 1 n exp o i s x i β 2 2 σ 2 the posterior distribution was sampled using the mcmc method based on the gibbs sampling using the software windows version of bayesian updating using gibbs sampler winbugs for each of the 191 model forms 3 markov chains of 100 000 iterations were run initialized with given the starting parameter values chain convergence was visually evaluated by plotting traces of sampled parameter values against iterations kass et al 1998 and also diagnosed quantitatively by using the potential scale reduction factor r ˆ an r ˆ value of less than 1 2 was used to indicate that chain convergence to a stationary posterior distribution gelman and rubin 1992 then the posterior distributions for every parameter were obtained after discarding the first half of each chain as the burn in period quantitative model comparisons were performed based on deviance information criterion dic as described by samanta et al 2008 the metric concurrently takes the prediction accuracy uncertainties and model complexity into consideration moreover it is consistent with the bayesian approach and can be calculated along with the usual mcmc steps using the following equations mackay et al 2012 samanta et al 2008 8 p d d θ d θ 9 d i c d θ p d 2 d θ d θ where d θ is mean deviance p d is model complexity defined as the effective number of parameters and d θ is deviance at posterior mean of parameters in model selection a lower dic is associated with a better model we adopted the same judgement standard as done in other studies where dic difference larger than 7 implied highly significant differences in the performances of the models if dic difference was 3 7 the performances of the models had a moderately significant difference then the performances of models were considered to have no significant difference for dic difference smaller than 3 burnham and anderson 2002 mackay et al 2012 samanta et al 2008 it is noteworthy that in this study field observations during the 2012 and 2013 jujube growth seasons were used to calibrate models based on bayesian approach and another independent set of field measured data during the 2014 jujube growth season were used for separate model validation 3 results 3 1 model comparison all three markov chains showed visual indication of convergence for the initial 100 000 iterations considering the first half iterations as the burn in period although the starting values of the parameters were different the chains for all the parameters in all the models were convergent convergence to stationary distributions of parameters and similarity among chains were also supported by the r ˆ value which varied from 0 978 to 1 003 this was less than the maximum value of 1 2 recommended by gelman and rubin 1992 indicating that the chains converged to a stationary posterior distribution besides the value of autocorrelation functions decreased rapidly to zero see examples of v2r3t2w3 shown in figure s1 as supplementary material using the model v2r3t2w3 as an example the posterior parameter distributions are given in figure s2 as supplementary material the shapes of the plot show the dispersions and symmetries of marginal distributions lehuger et al 2009 noticeably the posterior distributions of all the parameters were narrower than the anterior distributions table 2 suggesting that the parameters were well updated by the mcmc procedure and their uncertainties drastically reduced under calibration the distributions of a small number of parameters e g a2 and s remained relatively constant with fairly broad confidence intervals suggesting less identification under low prior information patrick et al 2009 the pd and dic results of the 191 transpiration models based on bayesian analysis ranked in the order of increasing dic and given in table s1 as supplementary material the models were separated into three groups with distinct dic levels depending on the used constraint function of soil water content models in the first group had the best dic range 44 56 to 38 67 significantly smaller than other models based on the criterion used all models with w3 or without soil water content were assorted with this group while models with worser dic values between 6 91 and 2 97 were put in the second group which contained all the models with w2 the remaining models with w1 were put under the third group which had the worst dic range 6 38 16 04 drastically higher than those of the models in the other groups based on the groups there were relatively small variations in dic among the models within a certain group for the first group the w3 model had the best dic 44 56 it was slightly lower than that of r3 43 03 t2 42 71 v2 42 59 v3 42 55 r2 42 55 r1 42 54 v1 42 53 and t1 42 44 but none of the differences was significant dic difference less than 3 the minor difference in dic values suggested that θ vpd par and t had near equivalent impacts on jujube transpiration moreover the three constraint function forms of vpd had small differences in their contributions to dic comparatively lower dic was noted when r3 and t1 were used instead of r1 r2 and t2 for par and t respectively but also none was significant with the exception of w3 the addition of environmental constraint functions particularly for t1 generally increased dic for all the combinations dic increased with the removal of w3 but the degree of increase was not significant too there was no highly significant difference in dic values dic difference larger than 7 among the models within the group to be exact 28 out of 94 configurations were observed to have similar dic values dic difference less than 3 this was the case with the inclusion of w3 the one that had the best dic value and even for the 11 other configurations without w3 implying that the superiority of including soil water content in modeling transpiration was not high compared with the first group the constraint functions related to vpd par and t contributed nearly equally to dic in the other two groups but it was different for soil water constraint function in contrast to w3 w1 and w2 apparently increased dic value when applied to canopy resistance configurations thus changing constraint functions of soil moisture had relatively larger influence on dic values compared with changing constraint functions of other environmental factors indicating that choosing proper constraint function for soil moisture is extremely important in modeling jujube transpiration in the region even though the addition of w3 improved dic at a non significant degree the addition of w1 and w2 pronouncedly worsen dic values the different situation for constraint functions indicating that soil moisture was the most sensitive factor in modeling jujube transpiration in the region for further evaluation the estimated transpirations by w3 and w1 with the best fit parameter sets were compared with observation values in fig 3 in order to provide a baseline for comparison results of the transpiration model without considering any environmental factors in jarvis sub model its dic value was 18 06 worser than all models in table s1 as supplementary material were also presented in this figure here only the validation plot for the period 2014 was used and the comprehensive model performance is given in detail in the next sections compared with w3 the performance of w1 was unstable the results were similar to w3 in the earlier growth stage with relatively more overestimation and underestimation for some measurements while the overall result was worse than w3 for the later growth stage during this period of time soil water content was lowest in the 2012 2014 growth seasons fig 1 and w1 was likely to more severely underestimate the field observations thus w3 was more acceptable than w1 which supports the model comparison results based on dic values among the three models in fig 3 the model without considering any environmental factors in canopy resistance sub model showed the worst accuracy it severely underestimated transpiration in the earlier growth stage which corresponded to a relatively better soil water condition while the model displayed a clear overestimation trend in the latest growth stage during which soil water deficit was significant fig 1 the above result implied that taking soil moisture into consideration is necessary in transpiration modelling in this semi arid region 3 2 environmental response to constraint functions fig 4 compares different constraint function forms used for soil water content θ temperature t photosynthetically active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd even though a linear decrease was used in all the three constraint function forms for soil water content noticeable discrepancies existed at critical points and decreasing slopes the one with the best dic w3 was the flattest and yielded the highest critical point 9 46 for soil water content below the threshold value the constraint function began to drop then w2 exhibited a distinctly lower critical point 8 02 with the steepest decline slope fig 4a for further interpretation the threshold values of soil water content for w1 w2 and w3 were marked in the plots of transpiration normalized by et0 and lai t et0 lai and soil water content fig 5 the reason why we use t et0 lai rather than directly using transpiration was that transpiration is controlled by vegetative growth climate and soil water condition consequently the relationship between transpiration and soil water content could be confounded by variations in climatic factors and leaf and shoot expansions thus t et0 lai was applied to eliminate these effects granier 1987 liu et al 2012 qu et al 2007 this is because et0 generally reflects a comprehensive meteorological condition and lai is an overall index that widely used to roughly represent plant canopy growth status it is clear that the distribution of the points in fig 5 roughly increased with increasing soil moisture at the initial phase then fluctuated with the changes of soil moisture as a transition zone in the second phase and finally relatively stabilized at the latter phase the threshold value for w2 almost corresponded to the dividing line of the initial phase and the transitional phase while the threshold value for w1 located in the transition zone both the two threshold values are not appropriate as a critical point because they located in a stage where decreasing soil moisture inhibited or had obscure influence on t et0 lai which is not meet the definition of critical point differently the threshold value for w3 the constraint functions with the beat dic almost corresponded to the dividing line of the stabilizing phases and unsteady phase which was relatively appropriate as a critical breakpoint because when soil water content is larger than this value t et0 lai became largely steady with dynamics of soil moisture a considerable difference was also noted in the two constraint function forms for t the optimum temperature was nearly 21 close to the mean temperature for the observation period 22 9 and was the same for t1 and t2 fig 4b furthermore the decline in constraint function form t1 with increasing and decreasing temperature was markedly steeper than that of t2 when soil water content function w3 was added the constraint function t2w3 corresponding to a better dic value than t1w3 had a stronger relationship with soil water content linear relationship before threshold value and became constant afterwards but with a dispersed response to temperature fig 6 a and b differently the responses of constraint function t1w3 to temperature were fairly similar in shape to that of t1 without obvious connection with soil water content fig 6c and d similarly among the constraint function forms with par and soil water the one which had better dic value exhibited closer correlation with soil water specifically r3 the one with the best dic among the three constraint function forms for par had a resemble response curve to par compared to r1 and r2 fig 4c but had a lower decreasing point 70 w m 2 and steeper drop slope when combined with w3 a better dic was obtained than r1w3 and r2w3 correspondingly the constraint function of r3w3 had a stronger correlation with soil water content and a more discrete correlation with par fig 6e and f than of r1w3 and r2w3 fig 6g and h the three constraint function forms for vpd almost overlapped when vpd was less than 5 kpa fig 4d which was extensive in this study the result was consistent with the strongly close dic values mentioned above when soil water content was considered the combined constraint function e g v2w3 was more controlled by soil moisture than vpd fig 6i and j the constraint function form v2r3t2w3 which had the best dic among tetra environmental factors exhibited a clear correlation with soil water content and vpd fig 6k and l 3 3 performance of best fit parameters the performances of the transpiration model w3 under different environmental conditions are illustrated in the best fit parameter plots the simulated transpirations were compared with observed values during calibration 2012 2013 and validation 2014 periods in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 plots the observations posterior mean values and the 95 posterior density region of the transpiration model overall the model simulations followed the field measurements closely most measurements distributed well within the 95 posterior density region while exceptions also existed particularly for the early growth stages for which period transpiration was apparently underestimated in contrast the model generated some overestimations when daily transpiration was high as shown in fig 8a plots of the measured versus estimated transpiration fell well along the 1 1 line but with some widespread outlier points around the regression line the model performed better for the calibration period 2012 2013 r2 0 87 than that for the validation period 2014 r2 0 80 moreover the structure of the residual observed transpiration minus estimated value was reasonably consistent with the assumption of normality and conveyed an overall overestimation of high observation values 1 90 mm d 1 underestimation of low observation values 1 25 mm d 1 and a small component of mixes fig 8b it is clear from the plots of residual values against soil water content in fig 9 a that the model performed better under good soil water conditions specifically there was a wide range of the residual distribution 0 5 to 0 75 mm d 1 under soil water content less than 9 5 and a convergence for narrow residual distribution range 0 2 to 0 2 mm d 1 when soil water content was higher than the threshold value no obvious correlation was found between residuals and meteorological factors other than net radiation rn there was a good linear regression between residual and rn except for points for early growth stage with lai 2 m2 m 2 during this time underestimation occurred almost throughout the entire period irrespective of rn as 83 93 of the points were distributed above the zero residual line fig 9b the situation changed for lai 2 m2 m 2 for which underestimation was widespread with rn 125 w m 2 and overestimation dominant with rn 125 w m 2 fig 9b 4 discussion we rejected the hypothesis that addition of the key environmental factor in the jarvis sub model is always associated with improved transpiration modeling no matter which constraint function form was used model performance was worse in terms of dic with the addition of w1 and w2 to the model regardless of the model structure and even worse than without soil water content although soil moisture is a key factor for jujube growth in the region li et al 2018 ma et al 2013 chen et al 2014 however when w3 was used dic improved to varying degrees the models with w1 and w2 had considerably higher dic values compared with those with w3 or without w this implied that determination of proper constraint function form for sensitive environmental factors was essential for improving model performance in this study w1 and w2 were not the appropriate constraint function forms for soil water content however w1 the one with the worst performance and highest dic has mostly been used in massive modeling studies to determine the effect of soil water stress on plant physiological activities harris et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 hu et al 2009 li et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 among the studies w1 has mainly been applied by taking θcr as the only parameter the same as in our study or taking no parameter by directly using field capacity instead of θcr since the threshold for transpiration to be affected by soil moisture is species specific calibrating θcr for different plants is more reasonable than directly using a fixed value field capacity this was supported by the significantly worse dic value under using constant field capacity dic 247 33 data not shown compared with using the θcr parameter dic 6 38 table s1 as supplementary material therefore focus should be put on parameter selection during model calibration even though the constraint function form of w1 has a relatively simpler and more flexible structure over parameterization can easily result in posterior parameter values that are far different from experimental inference compared with w2 and w3 under such circumstance prior bounds of parameters can make a lot of sense and should therefore be considered in bayesian analysis our results suggested that evaluating or developing different forms of soil water constraint functions e g the constraint function used in the studies of bernier et al 2006 poyatos et al 2007 samanta et al 2008 and ding et al 2015 embedded in distinct models was indispensable in dry regions where water restriction commonly occurs except the new findings illustrated above regarding the importance of constraint function form for the key environmental factor our results were similar to samanta et al 2008 in the following three aspects 1 increases in model complexity were not always accompanied by improvements in model quality and the contribution of an individual model component was dependent on the other part of the model structure this was because some higher dic values were shown in most of transpiration models with the tetra environmental factors embedded in canopy resistance sub model 2 different constraint function forms of an environmental factor did not contribute equally to transpiration modeling performance and discrepancies existed among various environmental factors for example unlike the significant difference in w1 w2 and w3 for soil water content the three constraint function forms of v1 v2 and v3 for vapor pressure deficit differed only slightly in our study 3 constraint functions of different environmental factors can significantly differ in their contributions to transpiration modeling which can be interpreted by distinct dic values obtained from w1 and w2 compared with other constraint function forms of other environmental factors the difference in results between our study and that of samanta et al 2008 showed in the relative importance of different environmental factors in their sugar maple study in northern wisconsin usa vapor pressure deficit had the biggest impact on model performance and temperature the least a moderately significant effect of soil moisture function was detected only when a specific vapor pressure deficit constraint function was used otherwise in this study soil moisture constraint function had almost equivalent or even more important and sensitive impact on jujube transpiration compared with photosynthetic active radiation vapor pressure deficit and air temperature this diversity could partly be due to the differences in growing conditions uddling et al 2005 komatsu et al 2012 in the semi arid loess plateau dry climate and soil drought are common occurrences during summer in this case water related factors are critical in controlling plant water use without irrigation since rain fed cultivation was adopted during the three jujube growing seasons average soil water content was only 7 96 in the 0 1 m soil layer much lower than field capacity 17 83 and observed transpiration was mostly in the zone with soil moisture lower than the critical point around 9 5 shown in fig 5 hence it was evident that soil water availability often limited transpiration during the study period based on previous studies irvine et al 1998 sperry and sullivan 1992 poyatos et al 2007 plant can adjust hydraulic resistance in the soil to plant pathway to prevent excessive xylem embolism cavitation during drought stress one of the most common ways plants use in this process is limiting stomata aperture by regulating aba concentration since stomata aperture is directly linked with water use activity it is reasonable that soil water content can exert a significant effect on jujube transpiration modeling under widespread water deficit conditions however soil water content less than 20 volumetric was not observed in the sugar maple forest during their experimental period water stress was not likely a problem in their study thus soil moisture was not more predominant than other environmental factors in their transpiration simulation study moreover to guarantee the safety of water potential water consumption during plant growing period in dry environments tends to be more hydraulically constrained than in wet environments lin et al 2015 therefore difference in water stress degree can lead to the differences in water use sensitivities to other environmental factors another possible reason for the distinct environmental response between the two studies is the difference in anatomical and biochemical features of the different plant species caemmerer and evans 2015 as stated by sage and kubien 2007 environmental response of stomatal conductance is highly variable between species even though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood different key environmental drivers of transpiration of the two plants led to different results further emphasizing the need to recognize the main factors that drive transpiration for different plants to achieve this analyzing multiple datasets for distinct region and plants following a similar methodology can be helpful in evaluating and interpreting the contributions of environmental factors and the corresponding constraint functions in terms of transpiration modelling practice using the jarvis sub model in rain fed jujube plantations in the loess plateau region inclusion of soil moisture in canopy resistance calculation is highly suggested to improve transpiration model quality but just constraint function of w3 could be used in case soil moisture data is not available involving par t or vpd in jarvis sub model could achieve acceptable transpiration model performance and in this process constraint function of r3 and t2 should be firstly adopted for par and t respectively while the three constraint functions of vpd can be considered equally as they displayed small difference in contribution to transpiration modelling in this study even though the mcmc approach provided a powerful tool for calibrating jujube transpiration model parameters the tendency for underestimation in the early growth stage and overestimation in some high transpiration values by model with the best dic was noted underestimation can partly be caused by relatively large lai measurement errors during the period of low leaf area this is because the equipment measurement of lai in this study was based on the gap fraction theory then several factors can apparently influence lai retrieval including assumptions on the spatial distribution of leaves classification principles of images and the presence of non photosynthetic elements weiss et al 2004 these influences are more predominant when lai is low liu et al 2013 resulting in comparatively large model error during the early growth phase also in our study bayesian parameter estimation was performed on the whole time series in a year nevertheless physiologically related model parameters of plants can vary over the time course of plant organs e g leaf expansion aging and senescing wilson et al 2000 medlyn et al 2002 furthermore during development plants generally experience and acclimatize various biotic and abiotic stresses this can also lead to changes in relevant parameter values crucial for long term modeling xu and baldocchi 2003 zhu et al 2011 however seasonal variations in parameters were not considered in this study using fixed parameter values in prediction lasting throughout an entire growth period can lead to overestimation of high transpiration values to balance and compensate for underestimation of low transpiration values in the early growth stage besides the underestimation and overestimation mentioned above discrepancies were noted in model quality among different constraint function forms in this study moreover better model performance was detected under good soil water conditions as also revealed by zhang et al 2008 and rana et al 1997 the three aspects highlight the necessity for further extension or appropriate modification of jarvis model to improve the accuracy and reliability in transpiration simulation possible ways to do this include 1 testing other constraint function forms for different environmental factors 2 using additional variables such as leaf water potential medlyn et al 2011 leaf temperature li et al 2010 ambient co2 concentration samanta et al 2008 or some chemical and hydraulic signals e g xylem aba concentration ahmadi et al 2009 3 adding details in key processes like water storage in internal tissues paudel et al 2015 describing canopy characteristics in more detail mackay et al 2012 interprinting stomatal regulation combining transpiration with photosynthesis lin et al 2015 etc however this could make models more complex require more parameters for calibration and increase the requirements for additional observation data samanta et al 2007 all of these could in turn decrease model quality by making models more susceptible to over fitting during calibration and posing difficulties in obtaining data not commonly available dekker et al 2001 samanta et al 2007 it is therefore necessary to look for a balance by further developing and identifying optimal model structures that are more accurate and reliable not only having small uncertainties but also having relatively simple forms and few parameters the achievement of accurate transpiration estimation is necessary for developing viable water saving management strategies to improve water use efficiency and economic benefits for example combining with evapotranspiration et data our transpiration modelling method can be used to perform et partition dividing plant transpiration and soil evaporation components which is of great importance in irrigation operation kato et al 2004 tourula and heikinheimo 1998 transpiration simulation approaches with high precise are preferable in partition et dynamics than empirical dual coefficient crop factor method in agricultural applications kato et al 2004 qiu et al 1999 in dry farming systems where irrigation is not available compressive understanding of how environment limits plant water use is essential to develop sustainable cultivation strategies for example in chinese semiarid loess plateau region with dry climate and severe water shortage high water consumptions of some afforestation trees induce soil desiccation and ecological degradation cao et al 2010 accurate transpiration modelling is efficient for compressively quantifying plant water use under changing climate conditions based on which proper vegetation types can be evaluated and selected for afforestation adaptationally reasonable transpiration control strategies that maintain acceptable amount of productivity and avoid continuous soil water deficit can be developed to ensure sustainability of water resources management in orchards under such prevailing fragile ecology chen et al 2016 for these strategies the complex relationships between local environment plant water consumption fruit yield and soil water condition should be determined in this process precise transpiration estimation supports more possibilities for extensive explorations therefore this study provides useful information for effective water management in both irrigated and rain fed jujube plantations in the loess plateau region 5 conclusions based on the above discussions the main findings of the study were summarized as follows 1 different constraint function forms of an environmental factor in jarvis sub model differed in contribution to jujube transpiration modeling and there were discrepancies in sensitivity of transpiration to constraint function forms among different environmental factors 2 embedding the key environmental factor in jarvis canopy resistance sub model did not always result in an improvement in jujube transpiration model performance and such improvements depended on selected constraint function forms also increases in model complexity did not always accompanied with improvement in model quality 3 the bayesian approach provided a powerful method for parameter estimation and model comparison with the best configuration of canopy resistance sub model in this study the penman monteith transpiration model generated a good and acceptable performance for jujube

10633,soil salinization in agricultural environments is a major soil degradation process particularly in dry regions soil salinization puts at risk the natural ecosystem and the agricultural crops which are usually sensitive to elevated salinities in this work a conceptual model is proposed and tested experimentally to examine the impact of root system dimension and distribution on solute transport and accumulation in the root zone for this purpose tomatoes were grown in growing chambers under conditions of salty water irrigation root density salt concentration and soil water content distributions were measured and correlations between the three parameters were found for different root system sizes results show that confined root systems were highly salinized with a strong correlation between root location and salt distribution in the soil broad root systems on the other hand showed a reduction in soil bulk salinity at the root zone and that about 50 of the root system is under conditions of low salinity the physical reasons for this observation are proposed herein and it is suggested that in the future development of crops with large root systems could be considered as another tool to cope with soil salinization keywords soil salinity root zone dimension root density solute transport root water uptake drip irrigation 1 introduction soil is an important resource for agriculture as it affects the availability of water nutrients and air to the plants via the roots the rapidly growing food demand of humanity due to increased population and life quality leads to the need for intense agriculture where soil and water resources are over exploited and their availability and quality are gradually decreasing lambin and meyfroidt 2011 the fact that water is a critical resource which is also important for domestic and industrial uses leads to the use of low quality water for agriculture in situations of water shortage such water includes treated wastewater salty water and grey water gray 2017 which are all relatively rich in solutes gray and becker 2002 tchobanoglus et al 2003 friedler 2004 consequently in many cases soil fertility is degraded due to increased soil salinity and sodicity shrivastava and rajesh 2015 thus improving efficiency of salty water irrigation practices and the development of sustainable irrigation methods are important in dry areas one of the most effective irrigation methods is drip irrigation that provides the needed amount of water and nutrients directly to the root zone mmolawa and or 2000 without wetting of the foliage and fruits which is critical when using low quality water mantell et al 1985 however the downside of drip irrigation with low quality water is that the wash of the solutes out of the root zone is limited and over time soil salinization and reduction of fertility may occur shalhevet 1994 currently there are two major approaches to cope with salty water irrigation and soil salinization 1 a biological approach where salt tolerant crops are used qadir et al 2000 and 2 a physical approach where removal of solutes from the root zone is achieved by leaching salt with excess irrigation water corwin et al 2007a letey et al 2011 in the latter maximization of crop yields when salinity of irrigation water is high depends on providing plant water needs and evaporative losses as well as on maintaining minimal soil solution salinity through leaching letey et al 2011 the leaching fraction is the relative volume of applied water that carries the solutes out of the root zone the minimum leaching fraction that will keep the soil salinity below a required level is defined as the leaching requirement while high leaching requirement leads to favorable growing conditions for the plant and maximizes yield it has negative impacts associated with water conservation and groundwater pollution alsaeedi and elprince 1999 therefore optimization of the leaching requirement values is important both for economic reasons to the farmer and for environmental concerns the impact of soil properties and irrigation sequencing on soil leaching and salt removal from the root zone is well understood thanks to numerous previous works beltrán 1999 corwin et al 2007b letey et al 2011 berezniak et al 2017 both for surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems hanson et al 2008 berezniak et al 2017 our understanding of root soil water interactions under saline conditions is limited as it is relatively complicated to simultaneously and non destructively observe roots and measure soil salinity therefore most studies and models that have explored soil leaching from the root zone have considered the root system to be homogeneously distributed and to have uniform water uptake and constant growth rate hanson et al 2008 berezniak et al 2017 moreover most studies assumed homogeneous or at least symmetrical distribution of water and nutrients at the root zone naturally these assumptions are not realistic especially for saline conditions as it is well known that salinity greatly affects root growth and water uptake younis and hatata 1971 jenny 1994 a recent study showed that manipulation of soil texture at the root zone consisting of coarse texture medium at the center of the root system surrounded by finer material under conditions of brackish water drip irrigation led to improved leaching of salt from the root zone and generation of a wider and deeper root system berezniak et al 2017 results from this study indicated that broad root systems may be favorable for plants under conditions of salty water drip irrigation nevertheless in that study the impact of the root system dimensions and densities on salt accumulation at the root zone was not segregated from the impact of soil texture manipulation it was impossible to determine whether the broad root systems developed as such due to the physical properties of the soil that led to high leaching rates of solutes out of the root zone or if the large root systems also contributed for the observed moderated salinity in here a conceptual model about the impact of root system size and density on solute transport and accumulation at the root zone under conditions of drip irrigation is being proposed discussed and compared to experimental observations 2 research hypothesis and conceptual model the overarching hypothesis of this research is that under conditions of drip irrigation with water high in salts plants with well developed deep and broad root systems would enjoy favorable conditions in respect to soil salinization compared to plants with small and confined root systems the typical pattern of salt accumulation near a dripper is of relatively low salt accumulation just below the dripper due to high leaching and marked accumulation of salt at the soil surface due to bare soil evaporation fig 1 a and at the deeper parts of the root system due to water uptake by the roots to replenish transpiration fig 1b shalhevet 1994 both water uptake by the roots and bare soil evaporation consume the water and lead to increased solute concentration in the soil pore water yaron et al 1973 berezniak et al 2017 bare soil evaporation and transpiration are usually lumped together as evapotranspiration koorevaar et al 1983 nevertheless there are marked differences between the two processes bare soil evaporation is the process of water phase change from liquid to gas and it is most dominant at the soil surface where vapor advection and diffusion transport processes are maximal bare soil evaporation is highly affected by the physical boundary conditions along the soil surface such as potential evaporation soil water potential and hydraulic properties of the soil radcliffe and rasmussen 2002 in respect to soil salinization evaporation is usually associated with salt accumulation and precipitation at the soil surface often as efflorescence or subflorescence salt crusts nachshon and weisbrod 2015 transpiration is a passive process of water loss from the plant to the atmosphere through the leaf stomata while they are open for the exchange of c02 and o2 for the process of photosynthesis water deficit is replenished by water uptake by the roots and the driving force for the transpiration stream is the large potential difference between the water in the soil and in the atmosphere koorevaar et al 1983 while bare soil evaporation is mainly a soil surface process especially in respect to salt accumulation transpiration and resultant root water uptake is usually treated as a distributed sink within the root zone consequently root water uptake affects soil salinization at the subsurface moreover root growth root water uptake and solutes accumulation at the root zone are related processes affecting one another hillel 2000 romero aranda et al 2001 in the light of this knowledge it is hypothesized here that three mechanisms result in improved conditions in respect to soil salinization for broad root systems as detailed below 1 root system depth it is hypothesized that lowering the center of mass of the root system to greater depths would diminish the impact of bare soil evaporation and resulting salt accumulation at soil surface on the plant fig 1a it is anticipated that a lowered root system will not be affected by the highly salinized soil at soil surface thus water consumption by the roots would be more efficient a smaller leaching fraction could be applied and consequently the overall salt input into soil would be reduced 2 root system volume it is hypothesized that a greater volume of the root system would reduce salt build up at the root zone and resulting salt concentration as aforementioned salt accumulation at the root zone is a result of water uptake by the roots assuming a similar water uptake by confined and broad root systems in a broad root system soil bulk salinity would be decreased since solute distribution will take place over a greater soil volume fig 1b the mass of salt accumulation in the root zone m kg is a function of irrigation water solute concentration ci kg m3 root water uptake wu m3 and leaching of solutes out of the root zone for conditions of limited leaching and under the assumption that water uptake is approximately equal to irrigation m is equal to 1 m c i w u for simplicity the volume of soil that contains the root system can be considered as a sphere with radius r m even though root distribution within the sphere is not completely homogeneous and therefore salt distribution may be uneven for a given m the soil bulk salinity cs kg m3 within the sphere could be estimated as a function of r 2 c s 3 m 4 π r 3 it is seen by eq 2 and fig 2 which visually display the connections between m r and cs that small changes to r have a major impact on cs for example in fig 2 it is demonstrated that in order to maintain a uniform cs of 1 kg m3 in the root zone as r decreases from 0 5 m to 0 1 m m has to be decreased by two orders of magnitude 3 heterogeneous salt distribution it is hypothesized that different parts of the root zone may have varied degrees of soil salinity due to a non uniform water flow and distribution b non uniform root distribution and water uptake c physical changes of the soil texture and structure and d any combination of these three mechanisms in a broad root system there is a much greater chance for these changes in water flow root density and soil properties to occur and thus different areas within the root system may have relatively low degrees of salinity which may function as favorable areas of water uptake by the roots on the contrary in a confined root system even if some regions had a low rate of salt accumulation the proximity to highly salinized areas and solute transport processes mainly by diffusion are likely to unify salinity and to mask these sporadic and small scale differences fig 1c in order to test these proposed hypotheses an experimental study was conducted to examine the interactions between root density and salt distribution at the root zone soil in the presence of tomato plants root systems with varied dimensions and densities 3 materials and methods in order to study the impact of root system dimension on salt distribution at the root zone tomato plants were grown in narrow growing chambers where root and salt distribution could be measured growing chamber dimensions were 50 5 x 50 cm fig 3 a the front and back walls of the chambers were made of glass to enable observation marking and documentation of the growth of the root systems when desired fig 3b excluding the short time periods of root system observations an opaque cardboard to avoid any impact of light and radiation on root growth was used to cover the glass walls at the bottom of each chamber a nozzle was installed to enable free drainage of the system the chambers were filled with quartz sand with a typical grain diameter of 100 μm and air entry pressure was in the order of 35 cm full details and physical characterization of the sand is found in berezniak et al 2017 in the center of each chamber a tomato seed a cross between m82 and penelli was sowed at a depth of 1 cm and irrigated as detailed in fig 4 each day at 08 00 am three types of irrigation water were applied 1 fresh water 2 fresh water fertilizers and 3 salty water table 1 presents composition and salinity measured by electric conductivity ec of the various irrigation water treatments during the first 35 days of the growing period in order to ensure good development of the root systems and to avoid any impact of salinity on the roots fresh water was used for irrigation with a weekly addition of fertilizers following this for an additional 6 days fresh water fertilizers were used and then for ten more days the salty water was used to result in buildup of salinity at the root zone fig 4 presents irrigation sequencing cumulative irrigation and salt accumulation in the soil based on observed roots along the glass walls the circumference of the root systems were designated prior to the onset of salty water irrigation day 42 and at the end of the salty water irrigation period day 52 fig 3b in order to have a qualitative sense of root growth and distribution with time and the impact of salinity on root growth two sets of experiments were conducted separately where in each set three growing chambers were installed two out of the three chambers were placed on a scale bwlc 60 120 c2k mrc israel with a precision of 0 5 g to measure daily changes of water storage s kg by knowing the volume of daily irrigation water i kg drainage d kg and s it is possible to compute evapotranspiration et kg by using a simple mass balance equation 3 et i d s the two experimental sets were conducted one after the other in a greenhouse where temperature and relative humidity were recorded by a rht10 probe extech instruments ma usa in order to maintain similar lighting conditions for both experimental sets we used a plant growing lamp master greenpower cg t 400 w e40 1sl 12 belgium which was turned on daily from sunset to midnight more information about the physical conditions of the greenhouse for each experimental set are detailed in table 2 the differences in environmental conditions mainly average air temperature between the two sets resulted in major differences in the root systems sizes which are the focus of this paper at the end of the growing periods when the root systems were well developed and a sufficient amount of salt was added to the systems the growing chambers were disassembled and soil samples with a volume of 5 5 5 cm 100 samples were collected to measure water content root density dry mass and soil salinity as detailed by berezniak et al 2017 in principle the wet mass of the soil samples was weighed on a high precision scale precision balance pfb kern germany 0 001 g precision then the samples were oven dried for 48 h at 105 c subsequently roots and sand were separated using a fine mesh sieve with opening of 125 250 μm and root mass and sand mass were weighed again to determine root density and water content wc respectively salt concentration of the soil samples was measured by electrical conductivity ec of water extraction from a 1 1 paste corwin and lesch 2003 zhang et al 2005 the ec of the extracted solution was measured by a standard ec meter 86505 ph orp cond tds salinity meter az instruments in order to estimate actual salinity of the pore water measured ec of the extracted water was divided by measured wc in each soil sample corwin and lesch 2003 dry mass of above ground plants was measured by weighing the plants after oven drying at 70 c for 7 days 4 results experimental results include information about the plants vegetative mass evapotranspiration et root system mass and spatial distribution and salinity at the root zone all measurements were incorporated to shed more light on salt dynamics at the root zone and the interactions between root system sizes and soil salinity 4 1 evapotranspiration and plant vegetative mass salt accumulation in the root zone is highly affected by the plant water uptake which results in increase of solute concentration in the pore water consequently estimation of actual et is important in order to discuss salt buildup in the root zone especially when comparing different plants from two experimental sets fig 5 presents measured cumulative et for the two plants that were placed on the scales from each experimental set a notable increase in et is observed for the second experimental set with a cumulative et 1 5 fold higher than the first set this is in agreement with elevated ambient temperatures of the second experimental set table 2 which result in increased bare soil evaporation and transpiration the observed increase of dry mass of the root systems and above ground plant parts for the second experimental set as detailed in table 3 also support the assumption that transpiration was elevated in the second experimental set however the two plants taken from each set had almost identical et values mainly for the first 45 days of the experiments fig 5 this similarity is surprising as in table 3 there were large discrepancies in sizes of the plants and roots even within the same experimental set one possibility is that during the first 45 days of the experiments the major water loss mechanism was through bare soil evaporation as the plants were too small to generate a notable loss of water by transpiration at around day 45 however some differences in et were developed in between the plants of the same experimental set this disparity may hint that at this stage the plants were sufficiently big to result in transpiration rates that were high enough to affect the overall cumulative et also within each experimental set the larger plants upon table 3 had a greater cumulative et the vegetative mass discrepancies within each experimental set are likely a result of uncontrolled differences in the physical conditions between the three replicas these differences may include random changes in soil packing within the growing chambers small variations in the locations of the drip irrigation emitters radiation and temperature differences at the greenhouse and other uncontrolled and non monitored physical and maybe even biological parameters these random changes within each experimental set may cause differences in root growth and salt distribution in the root zone nevertheless measured et fig 5 and vegetative mass differences table 3 between the two experimental sets are significantly higher compare to the observed differences between the three replicas of each experimental set therefore hereon the focus of the paper will be about the differences between the two experimental sets and not so much about the differences between the three replicas of each set 4 2 spatial distribution of soil salinity and root density dissecting soil samples from the growing chambers at 5 5 5 cm resolution enabled to map the spatial distribution of soil water content soil salinity and root distribution and to look for interactions between the three parameters fig 6 presents measured soil salinity by color maps and root density and distribution marked by the black contours for all cases the highest salinity was measured in the top 10 cm of the soil also in regions with no roots a result of bare soil evaporation that increases solute concentration in the pore water the warmer environmental conditions of the second experimental set led to higher salinity at the soil surface compared to the first experimental set a result of elevated bare soil evaporation and transpiration rates in all cases below the drippers where the seeds were sown a reduction in salinity was measured attributed to the daily wash of this region by the dripped irrigation water which leaches the solutes downward and sideways consequently this region supports favorable conditions for root growth due to relatively high wc and low salinity as seen in fig 6 a notable difference was observed in the sizes of the root systems between the first and second experimental sets which coincides with measured differences in et fig 5 and vegetative mass table 3 in the first experimental set root systems were confined to the top 10 cm of the soil profile just below the location of drip irrigation with maximal density in the range of 0 3 0 5 g per 125 cm3 of soil at depths greater than 10 cm root growth was minor fig 7 conversely in the second experimental set where environmental conditions were warmer much larger root systems were developed throughout the soil volume with maximum root growth at depths of 20 cm and below fig 7 hereafter the root systems of the first and second experimental sets will be referred to as confined and broad respectively fig 6 shows that for the confined root systems fig 6a c most of the region that is occupied by roots is also saline this is expected as root water uptake leads to increased solute concentration in the soil pore water hillel 2000 however in the broad root systems even though total et was higher and resultant increase in solute concentration in the pore water is expected to be higher a large proportion of the root system is located in regions that have a relatively low degree of salinity fig 8 presents measurements of soil salinity root mass and wc readings from soil samples following the disassembling of the growing chambers only from locations that included roots in other words soil samples from the growing chambers that did not contain roots root density 0 are not included in this analysis a clear difference is observed in respect to root density and distribution between the confined and broad root systems in the former fig 8a c more than 90 of the root system volumes have a root density lower than 0 2 g per 125 cm3 of soil with averaged root densities for the entire root systems volumes in the order of 0 07 0 06 g per soil volume of 125 cm3 on the other hand in the broad root systems fig 8d f 50 of the root system has a root density higher than 0 2 g per 125 cm3 of soil and the average root density is 0 23 0 04 g per 125 cm3 of soil in agreement with the observed differences in the root densities and measured et between the confined and broad root systems a notable difference is observed in respect to measured water content which is more than two fold higher in the first experimental set compared to the second as for soil salinity and its interaction with root density it is evident that for the confined root systems as root density increases soil salinity increases fig 8a c root densities of the confined root systems were in the range of 0 1 0 5 g per 125 cm3 of soil and were in association with soil salinities which were in the order of 5 19 ds cm in contrast in the broad root systems fig 8 d f much higher root densities were observed while associated soil salinities were much lower in the order of 1 8 ds cm it is noteworthy that the highest salinities in the order of 40 ds cm were observed for the broad root systems but these high readings were from the soil surface a result of intense bare soil evaporation under the warm environmental conditions of the second experimental set table 2 4 3 root growth estimation of root growth over time was achieved by direct observation and documentation of root distribution along the transparent glass walls of the growing chambers fig 3b this approach is qualitative and there is a lack of information about root distribution within the soil but it gives a good sense of the root systems sizes density distribution and growth with time fig 9 presents the sizes of the various root systems prior to the onset of salty water irrigation at day 42 and at day 52 the end of the salty water irrigation period in the first experimental set confined root systems at day 42 maximal depth of observed roots was at the order of 20 cm below the soil surface and maximal lateral distribution was at the order of 10 20 cm fig 9a c at equivalent times at the second experimental set broad root systems two plants had deep root penetration down to 40 cm and lateral distribution in the order of 20 cm fig 9d f and another plant penetrated only down to 40 cm but its lateral distribution was much bigger in the order of 35 cm fig 9e these differences in root growth between the two experimental sets at day 42 are attributed to the differences in ambient temperature which was the main environmental condition difference between the two sets moreover up to this point day 42 no salty water was added thus the different patterns of root growth between the confined and broad root systems cannot be related to root saline water interactions at the end of the experiments after the ten days of irrigation with salty water similar trends and differences in root distribution and growth were observed between the first and second experimental sets in the first experimental set root systems moderately developed sideways and downwards and did not go below the depth of 30 cm fig 9a c the roots of the broad root systems kept on growing downward and sideways and filled most of the growing chambers volume one may notice that there are some differences in root distribution between the visually observed roots fig 9 and the measured mass of the roots fig 6 as in fig 9 root systems are wider and deeper compared to fig 6 this disparity is because in the visual approach any single and minor root that was observed through the glass was marked and considered to determine the size of the root system even if overall root density in this region was minor however the mass measuring approach is more sensitive and quantitative than the visual approach since it takes into consideration root density in the soil nevertheless both measuring methods point to similar trends and differences in root systems sizes between the first and second experimental sets 5 discussion in agreement with research hypotheses experimental results under examined conditions show that as the volume of the root system increases a larger proportion of the roots is associated with lower values of soil salinity this was found to be true even when cumulative et and root water uptake were higher for the broad root systems compared to the confined ones moreover confined and broad root systems were formed with distinct morphological differences regardless of salt distribution in the soil fig 9 probably a result of ambient air temperature differences between the first and second experimental sets since salty water irrigation was applied after confined and broad root systems were already relatively well developed with notable differences in root spatial distribution between the two it is likely to assume that the observed differences in salt distribution between the confined and broad root systems are a result of the differences in root systems size and density with this notion the experimental results support the conceptual models fig 1 which were hypothesized to explain the positive effect of a broad root system on root zone soil salinization as detailed below 5 1 root system depth and distance from saline soil surface in agreement with hypothesis number one figs 6 and 7 show that in the larger root systems on top of the fact that the roots extend to deeper depths and larger distances the center mass of the root system also moves downward while for the confined root systems maximal root density was concentrated within the top 10 cm of the soil profile for the broad root systems maximal densities were measured at depths of about 20 cm and deeper the descent of the center mass of the root system to greater depths resulted in a greater distance between the salinized soil surface due to bare soil evaporation and the root system as conceptually presented in fig 1a consequently in the broad root systems the center of mass of the root systems is exposed to reduced osmotic stress which is in favor for the plant in respect to water uptake root elongation and uptake of ions into plant cells pritchard et al 2000 shabala and lew 2002 aroca et al 2011 soil surface salinization is a gradual process resulted by the cumulative effect of evaporation on salt accumulation at the soil surface therefore it is speculated here that the rate of root growth compared to the rate of salt accumulation at the soil surface could be a key factor affecting the potential of the root system to grow and develop further investigation of this concept is needed but it is suggested here that if the natural elongation rate of the roots is lower than the rate of salt accumulation at the soil surface then the increased osmotic stress close to the soil surface will postpone further elongation of the root system thus most of the root system will be concentrated at the upper parts of the soil profile and as salinity increases the abiotic stress of the plant will worsen however if the initial root growth rate is faster than salt accumulation rate at the soil surface then in a short period of time the growing root system will be far enough from the salinized soil surface and further development and growth of the roots would be possible consequently the negative impact of the salinized soil surface on the roots and plant will be minimized on top of that a broad root system has other advantages in respect to soil salinity as presented by the research hypotheses and supported by the experimental results 5 2 root system volume and soil bulk salinity experimental results show that for the confined root systems a large proportion of the root zone was under saline conditions in the order of 5 19 ds cm with no locations that had a significant amount of roots and low salinity however in the broad root systems even though their cumulative water uptake was slightly higher than the confined root systems fig 5 soil salinity of the root system was in the range of 1 8 ds cm and almost half of the root system was under conditions of relatively high density of roots yet low salinity figs 6 and 8 it is argued here that as proposed by hypothesis number two a large root system provides favorable conditions for the plant to cope with salinity as the bulk salinity of the root zone soil decreases as the root zone volume increases this is conceptually demonstrated in fig 1b where the same amount of salt is concentrated in confined and broad root systems hence soil bulk densities are different in theory reduction of the soil solution salinity as observed in here for the broad root system plants will enable to reduce the leaching fraction and by that to save water reduce the net amount of salt entering the root zone with the irrigation water and increase irrigation efficiency beltrán 1999 5 3 heterogeneous salt distribution experimental results supported hypothesis number three as at the broad root systems high variation of soil salinity was recorded while at the confined root systems the entire volume of the root systems was salinized at relatively high levels in the confined root systems areas that had high root densities exhibited also high values of salinity figs 6 and 8 however in the broad root systems a notable part of the root system 50 was of high root density with a relatively low degree of salinity figs 6 and 8 it is suggested herein that the occurrence of salt free regions in broad root systems is an important advantage as these allow the plants to consume water from low salt concentration regions while reducing water uptake from the salinized regions mulholland et al 2002 showed by the use of a split root system experimental setup that tomato plants can consume water differentially as roots from salt free regions consume enough water to compensate for low water uptake from salinized regions moreover it is suggested here that in broad root systems as salinity increases in certain parts of the root system due to water uptake by the roots the osmotic pressure of the water in that region gradually increases and consequently water consumption is reduced in this time the relatively saline regions where water uptake is paused will be leached by the infiltrating irrigation water and with time the leached regions will become relatively non saline again and reactivation of water uptake by the roots will occur nevertheless this mechanism of alternating water uptake has to be tested in future studies 5 4 generation of broad root systems the results of this study point to the positive impact that broad root systems may have under conditions of irrigation with water rich in solutes on soil salinization and irrigation efficiency one may control root growth and distribution in the soil by manipulation of soil texture distribution at the root zone berezniak et al 2017 as well as controlling of water and nutrients distribution at the soil drew 1975 mahajan and singh 2006 however implementation of such methods in commercial fields is limited due to high labor intensity and the need of complicated precise and expensive fertigation practices another approach may be the use of genetic editing and modification of different plants to develop plants with broad root systems for example several works have shown that hybrid introgression lines of tomatoes may have different root growth phenotypes while other biological and physiological properties are similar eshed and zamir 1995 ron et al 2013 halperin et al 2017 another possibility is to consider the size of root systems of various plants as another factor to decide which crop to grow along the crop rotation cycle while taking into account also the meteorological conditions irrigation needs and water quality along the year 6 conclusions this work explored the impact of root system size and root densities on salt distribution at the root zone soil salt concentration root density and water uptake were measured in narrow growing chambers it was shown that tomato plants with broad root systems enjoyed favorable conditions in respect to salinization of the root system volume due to 1 migrating of the root system deeper into the soil away from the soil surface which is highly salinized due to bare soil evaporation 2 reduction of the root system volume bulk salinity with increased volume of the root system and 3 formation of areas in the root system with high root densities yet low salt concentration which enables the plant to consume water with relatively low salt concentration and to compensate for low water uptake rates from the salinized regions this study shows the important impact that root system physical properties has on soil salinization at the root zone this study and others may lead eventually to the development of another

10633,soil salinization in agricultural environments is a major soil degradation process particularly in dry regions soil salinization puts at risk the natural ecosystem and the agricultural crops which are usually sensitive to elevated salinities in this work a conceptual model is proposed and tested experimentally to examine the impact of root system dimension and distribution on solute transport and accumulation in the root zone for this purpose tomatoes were grown in growing chambers under conditions of salty water irrigation root density salt concentration and soil water content distributions were measured and correlations between the three parameters were found for different root system sizes results show that confined root systems were highly salinized with a strong correlation between root location and salt distribution in the soil broad root systems on the other hand showed a reduction in soil bulk salinity at the root zone and that about 50 of the root system is under conditions of low salinity the physical reasons for this observation are proposed herein and it is suggested that in the future development of crops with large root systems could be considered as another tool to cope with soil salinization keywords soil salinity root zone dimension root density solute transport root water uptake drip irrigation 1 introduction soil is an important resource for agriculture as it affects the availability of water nutrients and air to the plants via the roots the rapidly growing food demand of humanity due to increased population and life quality leads to the need for intense agriculture where soil and water resources are over exploited and their availability and quality are gradually decreasing lambin and meyfroidt 2011 the fact that water is a critical resource which is also important for domestic and industrial uses leads to the use of low quality water for agriculture in situations of water shortage such water includes treated wastewater salty water and grey water gray 2017 which are all relatively rich in solutes gray and becker 2002 tchobanoglus et al 2003 friedler 2004 consequently in many cases soil fertility is degraded due to increased soil salinity and sodicity shrivastava and rajesh 2015 thus improving efficiency of salty water irrigation practices and the development of sustainable irrigation methods are important in dry areas one of the most effective irrigation methods is drip irrigation that provides the needed amount of water and nutrients directly to the root zone mmolawa and or 2000 without wetting of the foliage and fruits which is critical when using low quality water mantell et al 1985 however the downside of drip irrigation with low quality water is that the wash of the solutes out of the root zone is limited and over time soil salinization and reduction of fertility may occur shalhevet 1994 currently there are two major approaches to cope with salty water irrigation and soil salinization 1 a biological approach where salt tolerant crops are used qadir et al 2000 and 2 a physical approach where removal of solutes from the root zone is achieved by leaching salt with excess irrigation water corwin et al 2007a letey et al 2011 in the latter maximization of crop yields when salinity of irrigation water is high depends on providing plant water needs and evaporative losses as well as on maintaining minimal soil solution salinity through leaching letey et al 2011 the leaching fraction is the relative volume of applied water that carries the solutes out of the root zone the minimum leaching fraction that will keep the soil salinity below a required level is defined as the leaching requirement while high leaching requirement leads to favorable growing conditions for the plant and maximizes yield it has negative impacts associated with water conservation and groundwater pollution alsaeedi and elprince 1999 therefore optimization of the leaching requirement values is important both for economic reasons to the farmer and for environmental concerns the impact of soil properties and irrigation sequencing on soil leaching and salt removal from the root zone is well understood thanks to numerous previous works beltrán 1999 corwin et al 2007b letey et al 2011 berezniak et al 2017 both for surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems hanson et al 2008 berezniak et al 2017 our understanding of root soil water interactions under saline conditions is limited as it is relatively complicated to simultaneously and non destructively observe roots and measure soil salinity therefore most studies and models that have explored soil leaching from the root zone have considered the root system to be homogeneously distributed and to have uniform water uptake and constant growth rate hanson et al 2008 berezniak et al 2017 moreover most studies assumed homogeneous or at least symmetrical distribution of water and nutrients at the root zone naturally these assumptions are not realistic especially for saline conditions as it is well known that salinity greatly affects root growth and water uptake younis and hatata 1971 jenny 1994 a recent study showed that manipulation of soil texture at the root zone consisting of coarse texture medium at the center of the root system surrounded by finer material under conditions of brackish water drip irrigation led to improved leaching of salt from the root zone and generation of a wider and deeper root system berezniak et al 2017 results from this study indicated that broad root systems may be favorable for plants under conditions of salty water drip irrigation nevertheless in that study the impact of the root system dimensions and densities on salt accumulation at the root zone was not segregated from the impact of soil texture manipulation it was impossible to determine whether the broad root systems developed as such due to the physical properties of the soil that led to high leaching rates of solutes out of the root zone or if the large root systems also contributed for the observed moderated salinity in here a conceptual model about the impact of root system size and density on solute transport and accumulation at the root zone under conditions of drip irrigation is being proposed discussed and compared to experimental observations 2 research hypothesis and conceptual model the overarching hypothesis of this research is that under conditions of drip irrigation with water high in salts plants with well developed deep and broad root systems would enjoy favorable conditions in respect to soil salinization compared to plants with small and confined root systems the typical pattern of salt accumulation near a dripper is of relatively low salt accumulation just below the dripper due to high leaching and marked accumulation of salt at the soil surface due to bare soil evaporation fig 1 a and at the deeper parts of the root system due to water uptake by the roots to replenish transpiration fig 1b shalhevet 1994 both water uptake by the roots and bare soil evaporation consume the water and lead to increased solute concentration in the soil pore water yaron et al 1973 berezniak et al 2017 bare soil evaporation and transpiration are usually lumped together as evapotranspiration koorevaar et al 1983 nevertheless there are marked differences between the two processes bare soil evaporation is the process of water phase change from liquid to gas and it is most dominant at the soil surface where vapor advection and diffusion transport processes are maximal bare soil evaporation is highly affected by the physical boundary conditions along the soil surface such as potential evaporation soil water potential and hydraulic properties of the soil radcliffe and rasmussen 2002 in respect to soil salinization evaporation is usually associated with salt accumulation and precipitation at the soil surface often as efflorescence or subflorescence salt crusts nachshon and weisbrod 2015 transpiration is a passive process of water loss from the plant to the atmosphere through the leaf stomata while they are open for the exchange of c02 and o2 for the process of photosynthesis water deficit is replenished by water uptake by the roots and the driving force for the transpiration stream is the large potential difference between the water in the soil and in the atmosphere koorevaar et al 1983 while bare soil evaporation is mainly a soil surface process especially in respect to salt accumulation transpiration and resultant root water uptake is usually treated as a distributed sink within the root zone consequently root water uptake affects soil salinization at the subsurface moreover root growth root water uptake and solutes accumulation at the root zone are related processes affecting one another hillel 2000 romero aranda et al 2001 in the light of this knowledge it is hypothesized here that three mechanisms result in improved conditions in respect to soil salinization for broad root systems as detailed below 1 root system depth it is hypothesized that lowering the center of mass of the root system to greater depths would diminish the impact of bare soil evaporation and resulting salt accumulation at soil surface on the plant fig 1a it is anticipated that a lowered root system will not be affected by the highly salinized soil at soil surface thus water consumption by the roots would be more efficient a smaller leaching fraction could be applied and consequently the overall salt input into soil would be reduced 2 root system volume it is hypothesized that a greater volume of the root system would reduce salt build up at the root zone and resulting salt concentration as aforementioned salt accumulation at the root zone is a result of water uptake by the roots assuming a similar water uptake by confined and broad root systems in a broad root system soil bulk salinity would be decreased since solute distribution will take place over a greater soil volume fig 1b the mass of salt accumulation in the root zone m kg is a function of irrigation water solute concentration ci kg m3 root water uptake wu m3 and leaching of solutes out of the root zone for conditions of limited leaching and under the assumption that water uptake is approximately equal to irrigation m is equal to 1 m c i w u for simplicity the volume of soil that contains the root system can be considered as a sphere with radius r m even though root distribution within the sphere is not completely homogeneous and therefore salt distribution may be uneven for a given m the soil bulk salinity cs kg m3 within the sphere could be estimated as a function of r 2 c s 3 m 4 π r 3 it is seen by eq 2 and fig 2 which visually display the connections between m r and cs that small changes to r have a major impact on cs for example in fig 2 it is demonstrated that in order to maintain a uniform cs of 1 kg m3 in the root zone as r decreases from 0 5 m to 0 1 m m has to be decreased by two orders of magnitude 3 heterogeneous salt distribution it is hypothesized that different parts of the root zone may have varied degrees of soil salinity due to a non uniform water flow and distribution b non uniform root distribution and water uptake c physical changes of the soil texture and structure and d any combination of these three mechanisms in a broad root system there is a much greater chance for these changes in water flow root density and soil properties to occur and thus different areas within the root system may have relatively low degrees of salinity which may function as favorable areas of water uptake by the roots on the contrary in a confined root system even if some regions had a low rate of salt accumulation the proximity to highly salinized areas and solute transport processes mainly by diffusion are likely to unify salinity and to mask these sporadic and small scale differences fig 1c in order to test these proposed hypotheses an experimental study was conducted to examine the interactions between root density and salt distribution at the root zone soil in the presence of tomato plants root systems with varied dimensions and densities 3 materials and methods in order to study the impact of root system dimension on salt distribution at the root zone tomato plants were grown in narrow growing chambers where root and salt distribution could be measured growing chamber dimensions were 50 5 x 50 cm fig 3 a the front and back walls of the chambers were made of glass to enable observation marking and documentation of the growth of the root systems when desired fig 3b excluding the short time periods of root system observations an opaque cardboard to avoid any impact of light and radiation on root growth was used to cover the glass walls at the bottom of each chamber a nozzle was installed to enable free drainage of the system the chambers were filled with quartz sand with a typical grain diameter of 100 μm and air entry pressure was in the order of 35 cm full details and physical characterization of the sand is found in berezniak et al 2017 in the center of each chamber a tomato seed a cross between m82 and penelli was sowed at a depth of 1 cm and irrigated as detailed in fig 4 each day at 08 00 am three types of irrigation water were applied 1 fresh water 2 fresh water fertilizers and 3 salty water table 1 presents composition and salinity measured by electric conductivity ec of the various irrigation water treatments during the first 35 days of the growing period in order to ensure good development of the root systems and to avoid any impact of salinity on the roots fresh water was used for irrigation with a weekly addition of fertilizers following this for an additional 6 days fresh water fertilizers were used and then for ten more days the salty water was used to result in buildup of salinity at the root zone fig 4 presents irrigation sequencing cumulative irrigation and salt accumulation in the soil based on observed roots along the glass walls the circumference of the root systems were designated prior to the onset of salty water irrigation day 42 and at the end of the salty water irrigation period day 52 fig 3b in order to have a qualitative sense of root growth and distribution with time and the impact of salinity on root growth two sets of experiments were conducted separately where in each set three growing chambers were installed two out of the three chambers were placed on a scale bwlc 60 120 c2k mrc israel with a precision of 0 5 g to measure daily changes of water storage s kg by knowing the volume of daily irrigation water i kg drainage d kg and s it is possible to compute evapotranspiration et kg by using a simple mass balance equation 3 et i d s the two experimental sets were conducted one after the other in a greenhouse where temperature and relative humidity were recorded by a rht10 probe extech instruments ma usa in order to maintain similar lighting conditions for both experimental sets we used a plant growing lamp master greenpower cg t 400 w e40 1sl 12 belgium which was turned on daily from sunset to midnight more information about the physical conditions of the greenhouse for each experimental set are detailed in table 2 the differences in environmental conditions mainly average air temperature between the two sets resulted in major differences in the root systems sizes which are the focus of this paper at the end of the growing periods when the root systems were well developed and a sufficient amount of salt was added to the systems the growing chambers were disassembled and soil samples with a volume of 5 5 5 cm 100 samples were collected to measure water content root density dry mass and soil salinity as detailed by berezniak et al 2017 in principle the wet mass of the soil samples was weighed on a high precision scale precision balance pfb kern germany 0 001 g precision then the samples were oven dried for 48 h at 105 c subsequently roots and sand were separated using a fine mesh sieve with opening of 125 250 μm and root mass and sand mass were weighed again to determine root density and water content wc respectively salt concentration of the soil samples was measured by electrical conductivity ec of water extraction from a 1 1 paste corwin and lesch 2003 zhang et al 2005 the ec of the extracted solution was measured by a standard ec meter 86505 ph orp cond tds salinity meter az instruments in order to estimate actual salinity of the pore water measured ec of the extracted water was divided by measured wc in each soil sample corwin and lesch 2003 dry mass of above ground plants was measured by weighing the plants after oven drying at 70 c for 7 days 4 results experimental results include information about the plants vegetative mass evapotranspiration et root system mass and spatial distribution and salinity at the root zone all measurements were incorporated to shed more light on salt dynamics at the root zone and the interactions between root system sizes and soil salinity 4 1 evapotranspiration and plant vegetative mass salt accumulation in the root zone is highly affected by the plant water uptake which results in increase of solute concentration in the pore water consequently estimation of actual et is important in order to discuss salt buildup in the root zone especially when comparing different plants from two experimental sets fig 5 presents measured cumulative et for the two plants that were placed on the scales from each experimental set a notable increase in et is observed for the second experimental set with a cumulative et 1 5 fold higher than the first set this is in agreement with elevated ambient temperatures of the second experimental set table 2 which result in increased bare soil evaporation and transpiration the observed increase of dry mass of the root systems and above ground plant parts for the second experimental set as detailed in table 3 also support the assumption that transpiration was elevated in the second experimental set however the two plants taken from each set had almost identical et values mainly for the first 45 days of the experiments fig 5 this similarity is surprising as in table 3 there were large discrepancies in sizes of the plants and roots even within the same experimental set one possibility is that during the first 45 days of the experiments the major water loss mechanism was through bare soil evaporation as the plants were too small to generate a notable loss of water by transpiration at around day 45 however some differences in et were developed in between the plants of the same experimental set this disparity may hint that at this stage the plants were sufficiently big to result in transpiration rates that were high enough to affect the overall cumulative et also within each experimental set the larger plants upon table 3 had a greater cumulative et the vegetative mass discrepancies within each experimental set are likely a result of uncontrolled differences in the physical conditions between the three replicas these differences may include random changes in soil packing within the growing chambers small variations in the locations of the drip irrigation emitters radiation and temperature differences at the greenhouse and other uncontrolled and non monitored physical and maybe even biological parameters these random changes within each experimental set may cause differences in root growth and salt distribution in the root zone nevertheless measured et fig 5 and vegetative mass differences table 3 between the two experimental sets are significantly higher compare to the observed differences between the three replicas of each experimental set therefore hereon the focus of the paper will be about the differences between the two experimental sets and not so much about the differences between the three replicas of each set 4 2 spatial distribution of soil salinity and root density dissecting soil samples from the growing chambers at 5 5 5 cm resolution enabled to map the spatial distribution of soil water content soil salinity and root distribution and to look for interactions between the three parameters fig 6 presents measured soil salinity by color maps and root density and distribution marked by the black contours for all cases the highest salinity was measured in the top 10 cm of the soil also in regions with no roots a result of bare soil evaporation that increases solute concentration in the pore water the warmer environmental conditions of the second experimental set led to higher salinity at the soil surface compared to the first experimental set a result of elevated bare soil evaporation and transpiration rates in all cases below the drippers where the seeds were sown a reduction in salinity was measured attributed to the daily wash of this region by the dripped irrigation water which leaches the solutes downward and sideways consequently this region supports favorable conditions for root growth due to relatively high wc and low salinity as seen in fig 6 a notable difference was observed in the sizes of the root systems between the first and second experimental sets which coincides with measured differences in et fig 5 and vegetative mass table 3 in the first experimental set root systems were confined to the top 10 cm of the soil profile just below the location of drip irrigation with maximal density in the range of 0 3 0 5 g per 125 cm3 of soil at depths greater than 10 cm root growth was minor fig 7 conversely in the second experimental set where environmental conditions were warmer much larger root systems were developed throughout the soil volume with maximum root growth at depths of 20 cm and below fig 7 hereafter the root systems of the first and second experimental sets will be referred to as confined and broad respectively fig 6 shows that for the confined root systems fig 6a c most of the region that is occupied by roots is also saline this is expected as root water uptake leads to increased solute concentration in the soil pore water hillel 2000 however in the broad root systems even though total et was higher and resultant increase in solute concentration in the pore water is expected to be higher a large proportion of the root system is located in regions that have a relatively low degree of salinity fig 8 presents measurements of soil salinity root mass and wc readings from soil samples following the disassembling of the growing chambers only from locations that included roots in other words soil samples from the growing chambers that did not contain roots root density 0 are not included in this analysis a clear difference is observed in respect to root density and distribution between the confined and broad root systems in the former fig 8a c more than 90 of the root system volumes have a root density lower than 0 2 g per 125 cm3 of soil with averaged root densities for the entire root systems volumes in the order of 0 07 0 06 g per soil volume of 125 cm3 on the other hand in the broad root systems fig 8d f 50 of the root system has a root density higher than 0 2 g per 125 cm3 of soil and the average root density is 0 23 0 04 g per 125 cm3 of soil in agreement with the observed differences in the root densities and measured et between the confined and broad root systems a notable difference is observed in respect to measured water content which is more than two fold higher in the first experimental set compared to the second as for soil salinity and its interaction with root density it is evident that for the confined root systems as root density increases soil salinity increases fig 8a c root densities of the confined root systems were in the range of 0 1 0 5 g per 125 cm3 of soil and were in association with soil salinities which were in the order of 5 19 ds cm in contrast in the broad root systems fig 8 d f much higher root densities were observed while associated soil salinities were much lower in the order of 1 8 ds cm it is noteworthy that the highest salinities in the order of 40 ds cm were observed for the broad root systems but these high readings were from the soil surface a result of intense bare soil evaporation under the warm environmental conditions of the second experimental set table 2 4 3 root growth estimation of root growth over time was achieved by direct observation and documentation of root distribution along the transparent glass walls of the growing chambers fig 3b this approach is qualitative and there is a lack of information about root distribution within the soil but it gives a good sense of the root systems sizes density distribution and growth with time fig 9 presents the sizes of the various root systems prior to the onset of salty water irrigation at day 42 and at day 52 the end of the salty water irrigation period in the first experimental set confined root systems at day 42 maximal depth of observed roots was at the order of 20 cm below the soil surface and maximal lateral distribution was at the order of 10 20 cm fig 9a c at equivalent times at the second experimental set broad root systems two plants had deep root penetration down to 40 cm and lateral distribution in the order of 20 cm fig 9d f and another plant penetrated only down to 40 cm but its lateral distribution was much bigger in the order of 35 cm fig 9e these differences in root growth between the two experimental sets at day 42 are attributed to the differences in ambient temperature which was the main environmental condition difference between the two sets moreover up to this point day 42 no salty water was added thus the different patterns of root growth between the confined and broad root systems cannot be related to root saline water interactions at the end of the experiments after the ten days of irrigation with salty water similar trends and differences in root distribution and growth were observed between the first and second experimental sets in the first experimental set root systems moderately developed sideways and downwards and did not go below the depth of 30 cm fig 9a c the roots of the broad root systems kept on growing downward and sideways and filled most of the growing chambers volume one may notice that there are some differences in root distribution between the visually observed roots fig 9 and the measured mass of the roots fig 6 as in fig 9 root systems are wider and deeper compared to fig 6 this disparity is because in the visual approach any single and minor root that was observed through the glass was marked and considered to determine the size of the root system even if overall root density in this region was minor however the mass measuring approach is more sensitive and quantitative than the visual approach since it takes into consideration root density in the soil nevertheless both measuring methods point to similar trends and differences in root systems sizes between the first and second experimental sets 5 discussion in agreement with research hypotheses experimental results under examined conditions show that as the volume of the root system increases a larger proportion of the roots is associated with lower values of soil salinity this was found to be true even when cumulative et and root water uptake were higher for the broad root systems compared to the confined ones moreover confined and broad root systems were formed with distinct morphological differences regardless of salt distribution in the soil fig 9 probably a result of ambient air temperature differences between the first and second experimental sets since salty water irrigation was applied after confined and broad root systems were already relatively well developed with notable differences in root spatial distribution between the two it is likely to assume that the observed differences in salt distribution between the confined and broad root systems are a result of the differences in root systems size and density with this notion the experimental results support the conceptual models fig 1 which were hypothesized to explain the positive effect of a broad root system on root zone soil salinization as detailed below 5 1 root system depth and distance from saline soil surface in agreement with hypothesis number one figs 6 and 7 show that in the larger root systems on top of the fact that the roots extend to deeper depths and larger distances the center mass of the root system also moves downward while for the confined root systems maximal root density was concentrated within the top 10 cm of the soil profile for the broad root systems maximal densities were measured at depths of about 20 cm and deeper the descent of the center mass of the root system to greater depths resulted in a greater distance between the salinized soil surface due to bare soil evaporation and the root system as conceptually presented in fig 1a consequently in the broad root systems the center of mass of the root systems is exposed to reduced osmotic stress which is in favor for the plant in respect to water uptake root elongation and uptake of ions into plant cells pritchard et al 2000 shabala and lew 2002 aroca et al 2011 soil surface salinization is a gradual process resulted by the cumulative effect of evaporation on salt accumulation at the soil surface therefore it is speculated here that the rate of root growth compared to the rate of salt accumulation at the soil surface could be a key factor affecting the potential of the root system to grow and develop further investigation of this concept is needed but it is suggested here that if the natural elongation rate of the roots is lower than the rate of salt accumulation at the soil surface then the increased osmotic stress close to the soil surface will postpone further elongation of the root system thus most of the root system will be concentrated at the upper parts of the soil profile and as salinity increases the abiotic stress of the plant will worsen however if the initial root growth rate is faster than salt accumulation rate at the soil surface then in a short period of time the growing root system will be far enough from the salinized soil surface and further development and growth of the roots would be possible consequently the negative impact of the salinized soil surface on the roots and plant will be minimized on top of that a broad root system has other advantages in respect to soil salinity as presented by the research hypotheses and supported by the experimental results 5 2 root system volume and soil bulk salinity experimental results show that for the confined root systems a large proportion of the root zone was under saline conditions in the order of 5 19 ds cm with no locations that had a significant amount of roots and low salinity however in the broad root systems even though their cumulative water uptake was slightly higher than the confined root systems fig 5 soil salinity of the root system was in the range of 1 8 ds cm and almost half of the root system was under conditions of relatively high density of roots yet low salinity figs 6 and 8 it is argued here that as proposed by hypothesis number two a large root system provides favorable conditions for the plant to cope with salinity as the bulk salinity of the root zone soil decreases as the root zone volume increases this is conceptually demonstrated in fig 1b where the same amount of salt is concentrated in confined and broad root systems hence soil bulk densities are different in theory reduction of the soil solution salinity as observed in here for the broad root system plants will enable to reduce the leaching fraction and by that to save water reduce the net amount of salt entering the root zone with the irrigation water and increase irrigation efficiency beltrán 1999 5 3 heterogeneous salt distribution experimental results supported hypothesis number three as at the broad root systems high variation of soil salinity was recorded while at the confined root systems the entire volume of the root systems was salinized at relatively high levels in the confined root systems areas that had high root densities exhibited also high values of salinity figs 6 and 8 however in the broad root systems a notable part of the root system 50 was of high root density with a relatively low degree of salinity figs 6 and 8 it is suggested herein that the occurrence of salt free regions in broad root systems is an important advantage as these allow the plants to consume water from low salt concentration regions while reducing water uptake from the salinized regions mulholland et al 2002 showed by the use of a split root system experimental setup that tomato plants can consume water differentially as roots from salt free regions consume enough water to compensate for low water uptake from salinized regions moreover it is suggested here that in broad root systems as salinity increases in certain parts of the root system due to water uptake by the roots the osmotic pressure of the water in that region gradually increases and consequently water consumption is reduced in this time the relatively saline regions where water uptake is paused will be leached by the infiltrating irrigation water and with time the leached regions will become relatively non saline again and reactivation of water uptake by the roots will occur nevertheless this mechanism of alternating water uptake has to be tested in future studies 5 4 generation of broad root systems the results of this study point to the positive impact that broad root systems may have under conditions of irrigation with water rich in solutes on soil salinization and irrigation efficiency one may control root growth and distribution in the soil by manipulation of soil texture distribution at the root zone berezniak et al 2017 as well as controlling of water and nutrients distribution at the soil drew 1975 mahajan and singh 2006 however implementation of such methods in commercial fields is limited due to high labor intensity and the need of complicated precise and expensive fertigation practices another approach may be the use of genetic editing and modification of different plants to develop plants with broad root systems for example several works have shown that hybrid introgression lines of tomatoes may have different root growth phenotypes while other biological and physiological properties are similar eshed and zamir 1995 ron et al 2013 halperin et al 2017 another possibility is to consider the size of root systems of various plants as another factor to decide which crop to grow along the crop rotation cycle while taking into account also the meteorological conditions irrigation needs and water quality along the year 6 conclusions this work explored the impact of root system size and root densities on salt distribution at the root zone soil salt concentration root density and water uptake were measured in narrow growing chambers it was shown that tomato plants with broad root systems enjoyed favorable conditions in respect to salinization of the root system volume due to 1 migrating of the root system deeper into the soil away from the soil surface which is highly salinized due to bare soil evaporation 2 reduction of the root system volume bulk salinity with increased volume of the root system and 3 formation of areas in the root system with high root densities yet low salt concentration which enables the plant to consume water with relatively low salt concentration and to compensate for low water uptake rates from the salinized regions this study shows the important impact that root system physical properties has on soil salinization at the root zone this study and others may lead eventually to the development of another

10634,under conditions of water shortage utilizing unconventional waters such as treated urban wastewater and or seawater in combination with soil amendments such as zeolite can reduce the harmful effects of drought stress on crop yield to investigate the agronomic and physiological effects of a mix of water qualities and soil treatments on sorghum a randomized split plot research was conducted at gharakheil agricultural research station ghaemshahr northeast iran six combinations of water qualities and three different use of soil amendments were tested over two seasons in 2016 and 2017 the water quality treatments with increasing salinity included well water as the control w1 75 well water and 25 seawater w2 25 well water and 75 seawater w3 100 treated urban wastewater alternating with

although water covers two thirds the surface of the earth only a small portion of this water is suitable for human consumption during the last decades droughts and water scarcity have become one of the major concerns for governments organizations policy makers water users and water managers in many parts of the world owusu sekyere et al 2017 this concern is obvious in countries like iran that are in arid and semiarid areas the current water shortage problem in iran has been caused by multiple factors some of which may be related to mismanagement madani 2014 and some of which are related to natural causes such as climate change and persistent drought conditions in recent years the lack of water resources has increased the use of unconventional waters such as seawater urban and industrial wastewater wastewater can have a positive effect on the soil and eventually crop growth as it is often rich in organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen potassium and phosphorus ghanbari et al 2007 use of this huge resource in agriculture may allow increases in cultivated area and yields and may also decrease environmental pollution another unconventional water resource is saline water which is widely available in particular the water of the caspian sea is a good option for use in agriculture machekposhti er al 2017 as the salinity of the caspian sea waters is much lower than that of open seas dordipour et al 2004 it can be an alternative water resources for the northern provinces of iran however to use this particular low quality water only crops that are salt resistant can be grown sorghum is one such crop sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is the fifth major staple crop worldwide after maize wheat rice and barley paterson 2008 it is the main staple food for more than half a billion people particularly in the semi arid regions such as south asia and sub saharan africa mace et al 2013 sorghum is also important for livestock forage and forage health has a direct effect on human health al jaloud et al 1995 sorghum with its high tolerance to environmental stresses such as salinity drought and heat can grow relatively well under adverse conditions fao 1985 teetor et al 2011 sorghum in iran is cultivated both as irrigated and rain fed crop in summer mostly tall varieties are sown for fodder production that can resist drought and hot weather recently one of the issues that attracted the attention of researchers and environmentalists is unconventional waters chemicals and heavy metals especially those which can penetrate into soil plant and finally food chain ashworth and alloway 2003 heavy metals represent a portion of important environmental pollutants which causes pollution problems by increasing their use in products in recent decades cadmium in food and the environment is considered not only because of its high toxicity but also because of its high levels of sustainability as the most dangerous element in the environment perez lopez et al 2008 since one way of human exposure to cadmium is to get this element through food assessing and controlling the amount of contaminated food sources and identifying the sources of contaminants and modifying or eliminating them plays a significant role in the health and longevity of humans rahimi and raisi 1999 chromium is considered as an environmental pollutant released into the atmosphere due to its use in large industries chromium is a well known human carcinogenic agent and many reputable organizations have confirmed lung cancer as a result of exposure to it tirger et al 2008 therefore the study of the behaviour of these two heavy metals due to their higher concentrations compared to other heavy elements such as lead and zinc which could be neglected because of their low density was considered in this study the use of zeolites is an appropriate option to improve soil conditions through the absorption of harmful salts as well as the maintenance of water for the crop under conditions of use of caspian sea water or wastewater zeolites are aluminosilicate minerals containing exchangeable alkali or alkaline earth metal cations normally na k ca2 and mg2 in addition to water in their structural framework their physical structure is porous containing interconnected cavities within metal ions and water molecules gottardi and galli 1985 zeolite are microporous aluminosilicate frameworks with three dimensional networks of corner sharing to4 tetrahedra in which t usually represents silicon or aluminium the framework composed of purely sio4 units is neutral when al with a charge of 3 is an isomorphous substitute for si with a charge of 4 the framework becomes negatively charged compensated by extra framework cations leading to its cation exchange capacity hong et al 2018 zeolites can adsorb more than 41 of their weight in water and they can keep elements such as nitrogen potassium calcium magnesium and micronutrients in the root environment and then release them according to the crop s needs ultimately improving crop growth mumpton 1999 zeolites in soil increase the ph of soil which reduces the absorption and bioavailability of heavy metals by plants the increase in ph increases the adsorption of heavy metals and their oxides on the surfaces of zeolites shi et al 2009 application of zeolites in the soil significantly reduced the cd uptake by a wheat crop chang et al 1997 dheri et al 2007 moreover application of natural zeolites increased protein content biomass root length and root dry weight of alfalfa zeolite is an efficient amendment to reduce cd translocation in plant tissues hasanabadi et al 2015 amendments of zeolite reduced the adverse effects of cd and cr and ultimately increased dry weight as compared to the control therefore application of zeolites as soil amendment increases the soil ph due to replacement of na and h ions between the soil and the zeolites increase in soil ph increased the cd ion adsorption at the surface of iron oxide and reduced bioavailability and uptake by plants in arid and semi arid environments materials such as zeolite can increase a soil s water holding capacity as well as buffer nutrient absorption and release to avoid damage caused by stress to the photosynthetic apparatus polat et al 2004 mao et al 2011 zeolites appear to be an appropriate option to test for managing soil conditions through the absorption of harmful salts as well as the maintenance of water for crops under conditions of using caspian sea water or wastewater for irrigation however reports of zeolite applications for sorghum have been rare furthermore little is known about biomass quality of sorghum irrigated with combination of wastewater and seawater with zeolite therefore in this work we explored the effect of using zeolite with unconventional water on sorghum yield and quality as well as soil salinity accumulation in soil profile the specific objectives of this study are to evaluate the yield and quality of sorghum and soil salinity accumulation in responses to zeolite application in north of iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and climatic conditions during 2016 2017

field was about 120 cm below the soil surface at the beginning of the growing season and then it continues to fall to 200 cm below the soil surface by the end of the season in the late winter of both growing seasons 2016 and 2017 the soil was prepared by ploughing to a depth of 25 cm immediately before sowing may the soil was tilled using a double disking harrow finally a field cultivator was used to prepare the seedbed after the preparation of the land and before planting certain quantities of zeolite one kilogram per square meter of soil seif et al 2016 and najafinezhad et al 2014 were spread by hand over the field and ploughed to the depth of 25 cm again the natural clinoptilolite zeolite were obtained from semnan region in the north east of iran 2 3 experimental design and crop management a split plot experimental design was used to evaluate the effects of different water qualities well water treated wastewater and seawater on three soil treatments no zeolite z1 calsic

receives urban wastewater the treatment process consisted of screening de gritting pre aeration primary settling aeration secondary settling and disinfection ganjegunte et al 2018 the field experiment consisted of six irrigation treatments with well water during the entire period of growing season as the control there were three replicates for each irrigation treatment which were carried out in a randomized complete block design table 3 each plot was 3 3 m2 with a 1 meter distance between plots and 1 5 meter distances between replications the sorghum speed feed was planted manually the last week of may in both 2016 and 2017 at a depth of 5 cm using two seeds per hole crop row and crop spacing was 60 cm 10 cm the forage was harvested at the soft dough stage of grain maturity in august soil samples were collected from top to the depth of 80 cm in three levels 0 25 cm 25 50 cm and 50 80 cm before each irrigation surface irrigation was used with irrigation intervals of 7 12 days totally 6 and 7 irrigations were given in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for each irrigation event the irrigation requirement in mm was calculated using 1 i n n 1 m θ f c i θ b c i d i

forage was determined using a shimadzo aa 670 atomic absorption spectrophotometer sparks 1996 procedures for heavy metal analysis in plants and soil harvested plant samples were chopped into small pieces packed in paper bags and dried in oven at 80 c for 48 h after complete drying the samples were finely grinded into powdered using an electric grinder one gram each of the dried samples was digested with 15 ml of concentrated nitric acid hno3 overnight digested samples were then heated up to 250 c until white fumes were produced and heating was continued for another thirty minutes

water and subsequent filtration with filter paper the concentrations of cd and cr were detected in the samples via atomic absorption spectrophotometer at their respective wavelengths as described earlier ullah et al 2011 madiha et al 2012 the dry matter was determined on sampled plants by using a dry oven at 65 c for 48 h at the end of the sorghum cycle the first week of august in 2016 and the second week of august in 2017 all plants were harvested and the above ground biomass production was determined leaves area of sorghums in one square meters were measured and the leaf area index lai

in the w6 z2 treatment in 2016 and minimum yield 46 9 ton ha 1 in the w3 z1 treatment in 2017 table 5 a higher average yield for all treatments was observed in 2016 99 3 ton ha 1 compared to 2017 91 83 ton ha 1 that can be partially attributed to the slightly more evenly distributed rainfall in 2016 110 mm higher previous studies have shown that amount of irrigation water significantly influences sorghum production in semi arid regions saeed and el nadi 1998 cotton et al 2013 cosentino et al 2012 reported that sorghum produced 21 1 ton ha 1 dry matter under 334 mm irrigation conditions versus 7 5 ton ha 1 dry matter with 80 mm irrigation seif et al 2016 also reported that application of zeolite has significant effect on forage yield the average crop yields in the treated wastewater treatments w4 w5 and w6 were significantly higher than the yield in the control treatment w1 by 23 6 26 3 and 36 5 respectively there was no significant effect between the w2 and w1 treatments but the yield in w3 was significantly lower compared to w1 25 nadia 2005 and ghanbari et al 2007 both reported similar increases in yield with irrigation with wastewater instead of well water for both sorghum and wheat this was attributed to the high amount of nutrient in the wastewater the treatments with zeolites significantly increased the forage fresh yield of sorghum table 5 in both years crop yields in the z2 average 100 8 ton h 1 and z3 average 98 ton h 1 treatments were respectively 22 and 18 higher that the control z1 with an average yield of 82 8 ton ha 1 naseri et al 2012 and bernardi et al 2011 have reported similar increases in corn and sorghum yields by applying zeolite according to torkashvand and shadparvar 2013 application of zeolite could be beneficial with respect to increased water holding capacity of soil similarly ahmed et al 2010 suggested that zeolite application not only increase the uptake of n p and k but also increase the efficiency of their use by plants valadabadi et al 2010 reported significant improvement in the yield of rapeseed by the application of zeolite under drought stress similar type of improvement was reported by najafinezhad et al 2014 in corn crop 3 2 2 irrigation and water use efficiency in the growing season in 2016 rainfall was 110 mm more than in 2017 table 6 consequently total irrigation in 2017 was about 12 more than in 2016 daily reference evaporation eto varied between 0 1 8 6 mm day 1 with a mean of 5 9 mm day 1 totalling 329 mm day 1 in the 2016 and daily reference evaporation eto varied between 1 2 9 4 mm day 1 with a mean of 5 9 mm day 1 totalling 466 mm day 1 in the 2017 growing season the two year averages of the irrigation water use efficiency iwue of the treated wastewater treatments w4 w5 and w6 were significantly higher than the average in the control w1 by respectively 11 7 17 6 and 29 4 table 7 the average value of w3 was significantly lower than the average value w1 by 29 4 with increasing salinity from 5 2 11 7 ds m 1 the iwue decreased the average iwue of various water qualities in 2016 across all z applications reached 1 82 kg m 3 which was 10 greater than that of 2017 treatments of zeolites significantly affected the iwue of sorghum the two year averages of the iwue for the zeolites treatments z1 z2 and z3 were 1 53 1 89 and 1 83 kg m 3 respectively the two year average iwue of calsic zeolite was 3 2 and 23 5 higher than that of z3 and z1 respectively in both years z2 and z3 treatments had maximum iwue while the lowest iwue was related to z1 the no zeolite control irrigation gifts are in line with fao data but the values of the iwue were well above the range 0 6 and 1 0 kg m3 for a good commercial yield http www fao org land water databases and software crop information en the range of iwue was rather high compared to other studies as well e g mastrorilli et al 1999 and steduto et al 1997 this can be attributed to the combined effects of the use of zeolite and because irrigation was based on the actual measurement of the soil water content before irrigation as a consequent the irrigation interval was often more frequent compared to the normal practices in northern iran javanijouni et al 2018 reduced water availability is harmful to plant development because it reduces cell division and prevents bloating due to reduced cellular inflammation valentia et al 1992 in this way the leaf area and subsequently the amount of dry matter decrease wan et al 2010 3 2 3 leaf area index the average leaf area indexes lai of the six water treatments w1 w2 w3 w4 w5

between w2 and w1 that showed this salinity of water w2 had not such effect on the leaf area of sorghum the average value of w3 was significantly lower than the average value w1 by 34 7 with increasing salinity from 5 2 11 7 ds m 1 the leaf area decreased 26 6 the average lai of various water qualities in 2016 across all z applications reached 6 24 cm2 cm 2 which was 8 9 greater than that of 2017 there was no significant difference between treatments w4 and w5 but these treatments composing of wastewater and seawater had higher lai about 2 3 than the control treatment the leaf area is one of the most sensitive parts of the plant to salinity parida and das 2005 and its reduction has been reported with increasing salinity levels of irrigation water in other studies the osmotic stress caused by salinity with the increase of the inflammatory pressure threshold for the growth of leaf cells and the reduction of intercellular space on the one hand and the formation of ionic poisoning due to the accumulation of sodium and chloride ions and consequently damage to the membrane and protein molecules on the other causes reduced leaf area croser et al 2001 reducing leaf area also reduces light absorption and photosynthesis and ultimately reduces the production of photosynthetic products for leaf growth so it effects development of new leaves treatments of zeolites significantly affected the lai of sorghum the average lai of zeolites application z1 z2 and z3 across two experimental years were 5 65 6 30 and 6 02 cm2 cm 2 respectively the two year average lai of calsic zeolite was 4 6 and 11 5 higher than that of z3 and z1 respectively in both years z2 and z3 treatments had maximum lai while the z1 control had the lowest lai khan et al 2011 conducted greenhouse experiment and found that lai and plant height of soybean were significantly enhanced by z application kavoosi 2007 reported that z application significantly increased n uptake nucleic acid amides and hence cell multiplication which increased leaf area and rice plant height it indicated that use of z could increase nutrition uptake and enhance cell multiplication then resulted in higher lai and biomass in this experiment z application significantly enhanced sorghum lai and biomass 3 3 effects of water qualities and zeolites on sorghum and soil quality components 3 3 1 leaf and stem protein in both years in terms of water qualities the highest protein contents were related to the w6 treatment and the lowest content was related to the w3 an inverse relationship was observed the salinity of the irrigation water and the leaf and stem protein content tables 9 and 10 the greatest leaf protein and the greatest stem protein values for all water qualities and both years was in the treated wastewater treatment w6 in the second year by 14 83 and 8 1 respectively this was anticipated since wastewater is full of nutrients and specifically nitrogen which plays a basic role in protein making in plants jacobs et al 1998 other studies have also shown a significant increase of protein in sorghum by wastewater application ghanbari et al 2007 day and tucker 1977 the presence of nutrient elements in wastewater can have an important role in increased nitrogen uptake possibly existence of micronutrients in rhizosphere causes to more nitrogen uptake and eventually may enhance protein production in particular cu and zn have been associated with protein structure and nitrogen metabolism jacobs et al 1998 treatments of zeolites significantly affected the protein of leaf and stem the average percentage of leaf and stem protein of zeolites application z1 z2 and z3 across two experimental years were 9 1 9 93 and 9 69 for leaf and 5 33 6 08 and 5 81 for stem respectively in both years z2 treatment had maximum protein in leaf and stem while the z1 control had the lowest percentage in some of the previous studies nitrogen has been identified as the most important food ingredient affected by salt stress and their findings indicate a reduction in its absorption due to saline water use sato et al 2006 sairam and tyagi 2004 the most important reason for decreasing nitrogen uptake in treatment w3 could be because of reduction of root permeation reduction of nitrogen mineralization due to decreased soil microbial activity reduction of nitrification rate severe competition of chlorine ion in saline water with nitrate and sodium ion with ammonium for receiving positions in plasma membrane kafkafi et al 1992 rubisco is the most important and most abundant soluble protein in a leaf every kind of reduction in the protein content of leaf is a sign of reduced rubisco concentrations which can be followed to reduce the current photosynthetic activity saeidi et al 2010 the increased rate of protein caused by the application of zeolites could be due to improved photosynthesis and moderating stress conditions caused by the beneficial effects of amendments on soil properties najafinezhad et al 2014 increased rate of protein due to the application of zeolites have also been reported seif et al 2016 eskandarizanjani et al 2012 islam et al 2011 3 3 2 cadmium cd and chromium cr of soil and sorghum the cd concentration in seawater and tww was 0 104 and 0 0001 mg l 1 and the cr concentration in seawater and tww was 0 109 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively the cd and cr concentrations increased when using seawater and decreased when using zeolite in both the soil and the plant fig 2 maximum concentration of cd and cr was seen in the root of sorghum rather than stem and leaf and it was clear that maximum reduction of cd and cr concentration was in w6 and treatment with zeolites there were no significant different between concentration of cd in soil in w5 and w6 treatments and also z1 and z2 treatments the w6 treatment had the lowest amount of cd concentration in soil and also in plant fig 2a and 2c the z3 treatment had the lowest concentration of cr in stem and leaf fig 2b both cd and cr are considered environmental pollutants cd is a nonessential toxic element that has inhibitory effects on crop growth and chlorophyll synthesis cr ranks seventh in abundance in the earth crust various studies have documented the positive role of zeolites in stabilizing and reducing the absorption of heavy metals by roots gworek 1992 rahakova et al 2004 zeolites are mostly used for removing heavy metals because of their high capacity for cation exchange and ion adsorption in wide ranges this leads to a reduction in the cd concentration in soils containing zeolite reducing absorption by the crop ponizovsky and tsadilas 2003 eshghi et al 2010 have stated that zeolite can decrease the cd accumulation in soybean shoots rangasamy et al 2013 reported that the zeolite material can adsorb chromium very effectively and can be recommended for water and wastewater treatment 3 3 3 soil salinity the accumulation of salt in the root zone is one of the most important environmental hazards that can lead to reduced crop yield and soil degradation in all treatments soil salinity levels were low table 11 far below the fao threshold values for yield reduction fao 2018 however the treatments with more than 25 seawater w3 w4 w5 did result in a slight increase in soil salinity over the two year period thus there is a risk for salinization using these alternative irrigation water mixtures treatments with a higher salinity level in the irrigation water show an increase in soil salinity in the soil profile especially in the top layer fig 3 shows the soil salinity profile in treatments w2 to w6 for 2016 and 2017 in the zeolite containing treatments z2 and z3 the amount of salt accumulation in the upper layer of the soil is greater this would be due to zeolite s capacity to adsorb salts although rainfall in 2017 was lower than in 2016 resulting in a 12 higher irrigation gift in 2017 table 6 this did not significantly increase soil salinity levels 4 conclusions irrigation with wastewater increased the quantitative and qualitative properties in forage sorghum with increasing salinity the forage yield decreased significantly the combination of treated wastewater and calsic zeolite had the best effect on crop yield iwue lai and leaf and stem protein of sorghum wastewater application resulted in an increase in protein which is an important property of forage both zeolites with low salinity of water positively influenced the biomass yield and the quality components of sorghum under saline water conditions protein and forage fresh yield were decreased to address the increasing water shortage issues being faced in north of iran we would recommend using treated urban wastewater in combination with calsic zeolite to optimize production of sorghum declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10634,under conditions of water shortage utilizing unconventional waters such as treated urban wastewater and or seawater in combination with soil amendments such as zeolite can reduce the harmful effects of drought stress on crop yield to investigate the agronomic and physiological effects of a mix of water qualities and soil treatments on sorghum a randomized split plot research was conducted at gharakheil agricultural research station ghaemshahr northeast iran six combinations of water qualities and three different use of soil amendments were tested over two seasons in 2016 and 2017 the water quality treatments with increasing salinity included well water as the control w1 75 well water and 25 seawater w2 25 well water and 75 seawater w3 100 treated urban wastewater alternating with 100 seawater w4 50 seawater and 50 treated urban wastewater w5 and 100 treated urban wastewater w6 the soil amendments were no zeolite as the control z1 and calsic z2 and potasic z3 zeolite with increasing salinity the forage yield decreased significantly maximum and minimum forage yield were respectively 129 6 ton ha 1 inw6 z2 in 2016 and 46 9 ton ha 1 in w3 z1 in 2017 irrigation water use efficiency iwue was the highest with the treated urban wastewater in combination with zeolite all six combinations w4 z2 w4 z3 w5 z2 w5 z3 w6 z2 and w6 z3 had significantly higher iwues range 2 0 2 4 compared to the control iwue 1 7 and the other soil and water treatments the combinations of 75 seawater and no zeolite had by far the lowest iwue range 1 1 1 7 the same trends were observed for the leaf area index lai and leaf and stem protein the use of saline sea water increased the soil salinity levels significantly but the levels were still well below the fao threshold values for yield reduction overall we can recommend use of treated wastewater in combination with calsic zeolite soil amendment as the combination that had the best effect on crop yield iwue lai and leaf and stem protein for sorghum production under the conditions of north of iran keywords seawater treated urban wastewater clinoptilolite zeolite protein water use efficiency soil salinity sorghum 1 introduction although water covers two thirds the surface of the earth only a small portion of this water is suitable for human consumption during the last decades droughts and water scarcity have become one of the major concerns for governments organizations policy makers water users and water managers in many parts of the world owusu sekyere et al 2017 this concern is obvious in countries like iran that are in arid and semiarid areas the current water shortage problem in iran has been caused by multiple factors some of which may be related to mismanagement madani 2014 and some of which are related to natural causes such as climate change and persistent drought conditions in recent years the lack of water resources has increased the use of unconventional waters such as seawater urban and industrial wastewater wastewater can have a positive effect on the soil and eventually crop growth as it is often rich in organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen potassium and phosphorus ghanbari et al 2007 use of this huge resource in agriculture may allow increases in cultivated area and yields and may also decrease environmental pollution another unconventional water resource is saline water which is widely available in particular the water of the caspian sea is a good option for use in agriculture machekposhti er al 2017 as the salinity of the caspian sea waters is much lower than that of open seas dordipour et al 2004 it can be an alternative water resources for the northern provinces of iran however to use this particular low quality water only crops that are salt resistant can be grown sorghum is one such crop sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is the fifth major staple crop worldwide after maize wheat rice and barley paterson 2008 it is the main staple food for more than half a billion people particularly in the semi arid regions such as south asia and sub saharan africa mace et al 2013 sorghum is also important for livestock forage and forage health has a direct effect on human health al jaloud et al 1995 sorghum with its high tolerance to environmental stresses such as salinity drought and heat can grow relatively well under adverse conditions fao 1985 teetor et al 2011 sorghum in iran is cultivated both as irrigated and rain fed crop in summer mostly tall varieties are sown for fodder production that can resist drought and hot weather recently one of the issues that attracted the attention of researchers and environmentalists is unconventional waters chemicals and heavy metals especially those which can penetrate into soil plant and finally food chain ashworth and alloway 2003 heavy metals represent a portion of important environmental pollutants which causes pollution problems by increasing their use in products in recent decades cadmium in food and the environment is considered not only because of its high toxicity but also because of its high levels of sustainability as the most dangerous element in the environment perez lopez et al 2008 since one way of human exposure to cadmium is to get this element through food assessing and controlling the amount of contaminated food sources and identifying the sources of contaminants and modifying or eliminating them plays a significant role in the health and longevity of humans rahimi and raisi 1999 chromium is considered as an environmental pollutant released into the atmosphere due to its use in large industries chromium is a well known human carcinogenic agent and many reputable organizations have confirmed lung cancer as a result of exposure to it tirger et al 2008 therefore the study of the behaviour of these two heavy metals due to their higher concentrations compared to other heavy elements such as lead and zinc which could be neglected because of their low density was considered in this study the use of zeolites is an appropriate option to improve soil conditions through the absorption of harmful salts as well as the maintenance of water for the crop under conditions of use of caspian sea water or wastewater zeolites are aluminosilicate minerals containing exchangeable alkali or alkaline earth metal cations normally na k ca2 and mg2 in addition to water in their structural framework their physical structure is porous containing interconnected cavities within metal ions and water molecules gottardi and galli 1985 zeolite are microporous aluminosilicate frameworks with three dimensional networks of corner sharing to4 tetrahedra in which t usually represents silicon or aluminium the framework composed of purely sio4 units is neutral when al with a charge of 3 is an isomorphous substitute for si with a charge of 4 the framework becomes negatively charged compensated by extra framework cations leading to its cation exchange capacity hong et al 2018 zeolites can adsorb more than 41 of their weight in water and they can keep elements such as nitrogen potassium calcium magnesium and micronutrients in the root environment and then release them according to the crop s needs ultimately improving crop growth mumpton 1999 zeolites in soil increase the ph of soil which reduces the absorption and bioavailability of heavy metals by plants the increase in ph increases the adsorption of heavy metals and their oxides on the surfaces of zeolites shi et al 2009 application of zeolites in the soil significantly reduced the cd uptake by a wheat crop chang et al 1997 dheri et al 2007 moreover application of natural zeolites increased protein content biomass root length and root dry weight of alfalfa zeolite is an efficient amendment to reduce cd translocation in plant tissues hasanabadi et al 2015 amendments of zeolite reduced the adverse effects of cd and cr and ultimately increased dry weight as compared to the control therefore application of zeolites as soil amendment increases the soil ph due to replacement of na and h ions between the soil and the zeolites increase in soil ph increased the cd ion adsorption at the surface of iron oxide and reduced bioavailability and uptake by plants in arid and semi arid environments materials such as zeolite can increase a soil s water holding capacity as well as buffer nutrient absorption and release to avoid damage caused by stress to the photosynthetic apparatus polat et al 2004 mao et al 2011 zeolites appear to be an appropriate option to test for managing soil conditions through the absorption of harmful salts as well as the maintenance of water for crops under conditions of using caspian sea water or wastewater for irrigation however reports of zeolite applications for sorghum have been rare furthermore little is known about biomass quality of sorghum irrigated with combination of wastewater and seawater with zeolite therefore in this work we explored the effect of using zeolite with unconventional water on sorghum yield and quality as well as soil salinity accumulation in soil profile the specific objectives of this study are to evaluate the yield and quality of sorghum and soil salinity accumulation in responses to zeolite application in north of iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and climatic conditions during 2016 2017 a two year field investigation was carried out in a 672 m2 12 56 m sorghum field at the gharakheil agricultural research station ghaemshahr mazandaran province iran 36 29 n 52 46 e the mean elevation of the site is 14 m above mean sea level based on the demarten method oliver 2005 the climate is classified as humid the annual average rainfall and temperature over the period 1980 2017 are respectively 725 mm and 17 c with rainfall events mainly concentrated in autumn and late winter and almost absent in the spring and summer seasons the total rainfall was higher in 2016 than in 2017 fig 1 rainfall data were recorded at the agro meteorological station located at ghaemshahr less than 500 m from the experimental site 2 2 site conditions and preparation before sowing the soil of the experimental plots was sampled at three depths 0 0 25 0 25 0 50 and 0 50 0 80 m soil texture was classified using the hydrometer method usda soil survey staff 1975 table 1 chemical properties of the

planting the field capacity and permanent wilting point of the soil samples were determined using a pressure plate apparatus in a gravimetric way percentage of organic matter was determined with the burning method horwitz 2005 total soil nitrogen by the kjeldahl method rusan et al 2007 plant available phosphorus by the olsen method ghanbari et al 2007 the average water table in the experimental field was about 120 cm below the soil surface at the beginning of the growing season and then it continues to fall to 200 cm below the soil surface by the end of the season in the late winter of both growing seasons 2016 and 2017 the soil was prepared by ploughing to a depth of 25 cm immediately before sowing may the soil was tilled using a double disking harrow finally a field cultivator was used to prepare the seedbed after the preparation of the land and before planting certain quantities of zeolite one kilogram per square meter of soil seif et al 2016 and najafinezhad et al 2014 were spread by hand over the field and ploughed to the depth of 25 cm again the natural clinoptilolite zeolite were obtained from semnan region in the north east of iran 2 3 experimental design and crop management a split plot experimental design was used to evaluate the effects of different water qualities well water treated wastewater and seawater on three soil treatments no zeolite z1 calsic zeolite z2 and potasic zeolite z3 replicated three times the water quality treatments with increasing salinity included well water as the control w1 75 well water and 25 seawater w2 25 well water and 75 seawater w3 100 treated urban wastewater alternating with 100 seawater w4 50 seawater and 50 treated urban wastewater w5 and 100 treated urban wastewater w6 the soil amendments were no zeolite as the control z1 and calsic z2 and potasic z3 zeolite the ec of each irrigation treatment is shown in table 2 the source of the treated wastewater was the nearby sari wastewater treatment plant that receives urban wastewater the treatment process consisted of screening de gritting pre aeration primary settling aeration secondary settling and disinfection ganjegunte et al 2018 the field experiment consisted of six irrigation treatments with well water during the entire period of growing season as the control there were three replicates for each irrigation treatment which were carried out in a randomized complete block design table 3 each plot was 3 3 m2 with a 1 meter distance between plots and 1 5 meter distances between replications the sorghum speed feed was planted manually the last week of may in both 2016 and 2017 at a depth of 5 cm using two seeds per hole crop row and crop spacing was 60 cm 10 cm the forage was harvested at the soft dough stage of grain maturity in august soil samples were collected from top to the depth of 80 cm in three levels 0 25 cm 25 50 cm and 50 80 cm before each irrigation surface irrigation was used with irrigation intervals of 7 12 days totally 6 and 7 irrigations were given in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for each irrigation event the irrigation requirement in mm was calculated using 1 i n n 1 m θ f c i θ b c i d i i n n 1 m θ f c i θ b i i d i where in is the net irrigation depth mm of the nth irrigation event θ fci is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity cm3 cm 3 of the ith soil layer θ bci is the average volumetric soil water content of the ith soil layer cm3 cm 3 before irrigation di is the soil layer thickness mm i is the soil layer and m refers to the number of soil layers down to a specific soil depth m 3 θ bci was measured before each irrigation event by drying soil samples in an oven to measure soil moisture before each irrigation soil samples were taken every 25 cm to a depth of 80 cm for each treatment using an auger it is assumed that after irrigation the soil water content was close to field capacity irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated as the ratio between crop produced y in kg ha 1 and the total volume of irrigation water delivered to the plot vtot in m3 ha 1 and was expressed in kg m 3 ali and talukder 2008 2 w u e y v t o t crops were harvested to determine their total nitrogen uptake n in the stem and leaves and the leaf area index three plants per plot were harvested the oven dried at 70 c weight of each part of a plant stem and leaves was determined total nitrogen content was determined using kjeldahl s method automated with the kjeltec nelson and sommers 1980 cadmium cd and chromium cr concentrations in the dry matter of forage was determined using a shimadzo aa 670 atomic absorption spectrophotometer sparks 1996 procedures for heavy metal analysis in plants and soil harvested plant samples were chopped into small pieces packed in paper bags and dried in oven at 80 c for 48 h after complete drying the samples were finely grinded into powdered using an electric grinder one gram each of the dried samples was digested with 15 ml of concentrated nitric acid hno3 overnight digested samples were then heated up to 250 c until white fumes were produced and heating was continued for another thirty minutes allowed to cool down to room temperature twenty five ml of distilled water was added to each digested sample the concentrations of cd and cr were detected in the samples via atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 8100 japan at their respective wavelengths for soil samples one gram dry soil sample was weighed and digested in 15 ml of concentrated nitric acid overnight followed by acid digestion carried out in a fume hood till the appearance of reddish brown flames the digested soil samples were allowed to cool down at room temperature and then diluted with 25 ml distilled water and subsequent filtration with filter paper the concentrations of cd and cr were detected in the samples via atomic absorption spectrophotometer at their respective wavelengths as described earlier ullah et al 2011 madiha et al 2012 the dry matter was determined on sampled plants by using a dry oven at 65 c for 48 h at the end of the sorghum cycle the first week of august in 2016 and the second week of august in 2017 all plants were harvested and the above ground biomass production was determined leaves area of sorghums in one square meters were measured and the leaf area index lai was determined as follows yoshida 1981 3 lai la x a 1 m2 m 2 4 la l x w x 0 75 where lai is the leaf area index m2 m 2 la the area of leaves of sorghums in one square meters of land m2 and a the land area m2 occupied by the crop l the length of leaf m w the maximum width of the leaf m length and maximum width of leaf was measured by ruler at harvest the above discussed parameters as well as crop yield were determined for each treatment crops were harvested on august 3 2016 day 65 and on august 12 2017 day 79 2 4 statistical analysis appropriate standard errors of means were calculated using

six water treatments w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 and w6 during 2016 and 2017 were 85 5 83 3 64 1 105 7 108 and 116 7 ton h 1 respectively table 3 for the entire experiment maximum yield 129 6 ton h 1 was obtained in the w6 z2 treatment in 2016 and minimum yield 46 9 ton ha 1 in the w3 z1 treatment in 2017 table 5 a higher average yield for all treatments was observed in 2016 99 3 ton ha 1 compared to 2017 91 83 ton ha 1 that can be partially attributed to the slightly more evenly distributed rainfall in 2016 110 mm higher previous studies have shown that amount of irrigation water significantly influences sorghum production in semi arid regions saeed and el nadi 1998 cotton et al 2013 cosentino et al 2012 reported that sorghum produced 21 1 ton ha 1 dry matter under 334 mm irrigation conditions versus 7 5 ton ha 1 dry matter with 80 mm irrigation seif et al 2016 also reported that application of zeolite has significant effect on forage yield the average crop yields in the treated wastewater treatments w4 w5 and w6 were significantly higher than the yield in the control treatment w1 by 23 6 26 3 and 36 5 respectively there was no significant effect between the w2 and w1 treatments but the yield in w3 was significantly lower compared to w1 25 nadia 2005 and ghanbari et al 2007 both reported similar increases in yield with irrigation with wastewater instead of well water for both sorghum and wheat this was attributed to the high amount of nutrient in the wastewater the treatments with zeolites significantly increased the forage fresh yield of sorghum table 5 in both years crop yields in the z2 average 100 8 ton h 1 and z3 average 98 ton h 1 treatments were respectively 22 and 18 higher that the control z1 with an average yield of 82 8 ton ha 1 naseri et al 2012 and bernardi et al 2011 have reported similar increases in corn and sorghum yields by applying zeolite according to torkashvand and shadparvar 2013 application of zeolite could be beneficial with respect to increased water holding capacity of soil similarly ahmed et al 2010 suggested that zeolite application not only increase the uptake of n p and k but also increase the efficiency of their use by plants valadabadi et al 2010 reported significant improvement in the yield of rapeseed by the application of zeolite under drought stress similar type of improvement was reported by najafinezhad et al 2014 in corn crop 3 2 2 irrigation and water use efficiency in the growing season in 2016 rainfall was 110 mm more than in 2017 table 6 consequently total irrigation in 2017 was about 12 more than in 2016 daily reference evaporation eto varied between 0 1 8 6 mm day 1 with a mean of 5 9 mm day 1 totalling 329 mm day 1 in the 2016 and daily reference evaporation eto varied between 1 2 9 4 mm day 1 with a mean of 5 9 mm day 1 totalling 466 mm day 1 in the 2017 growing season the two year averages of the irrigation water use efficiency iwue of the treated wastewater treatments w4 w5 and w6 were significantly higher than the average in the control w1 by respectively 11 7 17 6 and 29 4 table 7 the average value of w3 was significantly lower than the average value w1 by 29 4 with increasing salinity from 5 2 11 7 ds m 1 the iwue decreased the average iwue of various water qualities in 2016 across all z applications reached 1 82 kg m 3 which was 10 greater than that of 2017 treatments of zeolites significantly affected the iwue of sorghum the two year averages of the iwue for the zeolites treatments z1 z2 and z3 were 1 53 1 89 and 1 83 kg m 3 respectively the two year average iwue of calsic zeolite was 3 2 and 23 5 higher than that of z3 and z1 respectively in both years z2 and z3 treatments had maximum iwue while the lowest iwue was related to z1 the no zeolite control irrigation gifts are in line with fao data but the values of the iwue were well above the range 0 6 and 1 0 kg m3 for a good commercial yield http www fao org land water databases and software crop information en the range of iwue was rather high compared to other studies as well e g mastrorilli et al 1999 and steduto et al 1997 this can be attributed to the combined effects of the use of zeolite and because irrigation was based on the actual measurement of the soil water content before irrigation as a consequent the irrigation interval was often more frequent compared to the normal practices in northern iran javanijouni et al 2018 reduced water availability is harmful to plant development because it reduces cell division and prevents bloating due to reduced cellular inflammation valentia et al 1992 in this way the leaf area and subsequently the amount of dry matter decrease wan et al 2010 3 2 3 leaf area index the average leaf area indexes lai of the six water treatments w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 and w6 during 2016 and 2017 were 6 04 5 71 4 43 6 17 6 19 and 7 38 cm2 cm 2 respectively table 8 the average values from treated wastewater treatments w4 w5 and w6 were significantly higher than the average for the control w1 by 2 1 2 5 and 22 1 respectively day and tucker 1977 reported similar results that irrigation with wastewater increased the leaf width there were no significant effects between w2 and w1 that showed this salinity of water w2 had not such effect on the leaf area of sorghum the average value of w3 was significantly lower than the average value w1 by 34 7 with increasing salinity from 5 2 11 7 ds m 1 the leaf area decreased 26 6 the average lai of various water qualities in 2016 across all z applications reached 6 24 cm2 cm 2 which was 8 9 greater than that of 2017 there was no significant difference between treatments w4 and w5 but these treatments composing of wastewater and seawater had higher lai about 2 3 than the control treatment the leaf area is one of the most sensitive parts of the plant to salinity parida and das 2005 and its reduction has been reported with increasing salinity levels of irrigation water in other studies the osmotic stress caused by salinity with the increase of the inflammatory pressure threshold for the growth of leaf cells and the reduction of intercellular space on the one hand and the formation of ionic poisoning due to the accumulation of sodium and chloride ions and consequently damage to the membrane and protein molecules on the other causes reduced leaf area croser et al 2001 reducing leaf area also reduces light absorption and photosynthesis and ultimately reduces the production of photosynthetic products for leaf growth so it effects development of new leaves treatments of zeolites significantly affected the lai of sorghum the average lai of zeolites application z1 z2 and z3 across two experimental years were 5 65 6 30 and 6 02 cm2 cm 2 respectively the two year average lai of calsic zeolite was 4 6 and 11 5 higher than that of z3 and z1 respectively in both years z2 and z3 treatments had maximum lai while the z1 control had the lowest lai khan et al 2011 conducted greenhouse experiment and found that lai and plant height of soybean were significantly enhanced by z application kavoosi 2007 reported that z application significantly increased n uptake nucleic acid amides and hence cell multiplication which increased leaf area and rice plant height it indicated that use of z could increase nutrition uptake and enhance cell multiplication then resulted in higher lai and biomass in this experiment z application significantly enhanced sorghum lai and biomass 3 3 effects of water qualities and zeolites on sorghum and soil quality components 3 3 1 leaf and stem protein in both years in terms of water qualities the highest protein contents were related to the w6 treatment and the lowest content was related to the w3 an inverse relationship was observed the salinity of the irrigation water and the leaf and stem protein content tables 9 and 10 the greatest leaf protein and the greatest stem protein values for all water qualities and both years was in the treated wastewater treatment w6 in the second year by 14 83 and 8 1 respectively this was anticipated since wastewater is full of nutrients and specifically nitrogen which plays a basic role in protein making in plants jacobs et al 1998 other studies have also shown a significant increase of protein in sorghum by wastewater application ghanbari et al 2007 day and tucker 1977 the presence of nutrient elements in wastewater can have an important role in increased nitrogen uptake possibly existence of micronutrients in rhizosphere causes to more nitrogen uptake and eventually may enhance protein production in particular cu and zn have been associated with protein structure and nitrogen metabolism jacobs et al 1998 treatments of zeolites significantly affected the protein of leaf and stem the average percentage of leaf and stem protein of zeolites application z1 z2 and z3 across two experimental years were 9 1 9 93 and 9 69 for leaf and 5 33 6 08 and 5 81 for stem respectively in both years z2 treatment had maximum protein in leaf and stem while the z1 control had the lowest percentage in some of the previous studies nitrogen has been identified as the most important food ingredient affected by salt stress and their findings indicate a reduction in its absorption due to saline water use sato et al 2006 sairam and tyagi 2004 the most important reason for decreasing nitrogen uptake in treatment w3 could be because of reduction of root permeation reduction of nitrogen mineralization due to decreased soil microbial activity reduction of nitrification rate severe competition of chlorine ion in saline water with nitrate and sodium ion with ammonium for receiving positions in plasma membrane kafkafi et al 1992 rubisco is the most important and most abundant soluble protein in a leaf every kind of reduction in the protein content of leaf is a sign of reduced rubisco concentrations which can be followed to reduce the current photosynthetic activity saeidi et al 2010 the increased rate of protein caused by the application of zeolites could be due to improved photosynthesis and moderating stress conditions caused by the beneficial effects of amendments on soil properties najafinezhad et al 2014 increased rate of protein due to the application of zeolites have also been reported seif et al 2016 eskandarizanjani et al 2012 islam et al 2011 3 3 2 cadmium cd and chromium cr of soil and sorghum the cd concentration in seawater and tww was 0 104 and 0 0001 mg l 1 and the cr concentration in seawater and tww was 0 109 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively the cd and cr concentrations increased when using seawater and decreased when using zeolite in both the soil and the plant fig 2 maximum concentration of cd and cr was seen in the root of sorghum rather than stem and leaf and it was clear that maximum reduction of cd and cr concentration was in w6 and treatment with zeolites there were no significant different between concentration of cd in soil in w5 and w6 treatments and also z1 and z2 treatments the w6 treatment had the lowest amount of cd concentration in soil and also in plant fig 2a and 2c the z3 treatment had the lowest concentration of cr in stem and leaf fig 2b both cd and cr are considered environmental pollutants cd is a nonessential toxic element that has inhibitory effects on crop growth and chlorophyll synthesis cr ranks seventh in abundance in the earth crust various studies have documented the positive role of zeolites in stabilizing and reducing the absorption of heavy metals by roots gworek 1992 rahakova et al 2004 zeolites are mostly used for removing heavy metals because of their high capacity for cation exchange and ion adsorption in wide ranges this leads to a reduction in the cd concentration in soils containing zeolite reducing absorption by the crop ponizovsky and tsadilas 2003 eshghi et al 2010 have stated that zeolite can decrease the cd accumulation in soybean shoots rangasamy et al 2013 reported that the zeolite material can adsorb chromium very effectively and can be recommended for water and wastewater treatment 3 3 3 soil salinity the accumulation of salt in the root zone is one of the most important environmental hazards that can lead to reduced crop yield and soil degradation in all treatments soil salinity levels were low table 11 far below the fao threshold values for yield reduction fao 2018 however the treatments with more than 25 seawater w3 w4 w5 did result in a slight increase in soil salinity over the two year period thus there is a risk for salinization using these alternative irrigation water mixtures treatments with a higher salinity level in the irrigation water show an increase in soil salinity in the soil profile especially in the top layer fig 3 shows the soil salinity profile in treatments w2 to w6 for 2016 and 2017 in the zeolite containing treatments z2 and z3 the amount of salt accumulation in the upper layer of the soil is greater this would be due to zeolite s capacity to adsorb salts although rainfall in 2017 was lower than in 2016 resulting in a 12 higher irrigation gift in 2017 table 6 this did not significantly increase soil salinity levels 4 conclusions irrigation with wastewater increased the quantitative and qualitative properties in forage sorghum with increasing salinity the forage yield decreased significantly the combination of treated wastewater and calsic zeolite had the best effect on crop yield iwue lai and leaf and stem protein of sorghum wastewater application resulted in an increase in protein which is an important property of forage both zeolites with low salinity of water positively influenced the biomass yield and the quality components of sorghum under saline water conditions protein and forage fresh yield were decreased to address the increasing water shortage issues being faced in north of iran we would recommend using treated urban wastewater in combination with calsic zeolite to optimize production of sorghum declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
