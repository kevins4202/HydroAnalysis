extended across six major continents the virtual species were designed under the assumption that fundamental ecological niches are convex taking the general form of ellipsoids as empirical results

distributions under changing climate conditions e g araújo et al 2011 barbet massin et al 2012b harrigan et al 2014 ecological niches were designed so as to have potential distributional areas across

allows us to assess model predictive performance strictly based on model transferability among populations in distant areas fourcade et al 2018 to this end we generated two environmental dimensions summarizing 99 of overall variation in 17 global bioclimatic dimensions appendix a hijmans et al 2005 using pca routines in nichea version 3 0 qiao et al 2016 fig 1 niche space for this virtual species was designed as a minimum volume ellipsoid mves van aelst and rousseeuw 2009 which were delimitated along the medium of first principal component i e pc1 and the low of second principal component i e pc2 environmental combinations inside this ellipsoid constituted the fundamental niche of this virtual specie the ellipsoid volume were then projected onto the globe i e threshold approach to design virtual species meynard et al 2019a 2019b representing a subtropics species with very little dispersal limitation across the globe fig 1 it included six disjunct populations with each on a different continent i e africa af australia au east asia ea europe and central asia eu north america na south america sa fig 1 a presence absence matrix was generated from projection of the mve onto the entire earth with different numbers of points simulating presence and absence of the species across six continents presence and absence records in af 1767 and 3166 au 2257 and 4252 ea 3224 and 5938 eu 10 083 and 18 491 na 6485 and 8911 and sa 2277 and 6088 respectively the different numbers of points by region reflect the spatial extent of suitable and unsuitable conditions in those regions and the sum of presence and absence records per species and continent reflect the size of model calibration areas realized niche occupied by these six populations were displayed and comparted in environmental and geographic spaces appendix b 2 2 model construction and consensus niche models were calibrated for each population from each continent as a proxy of a native area from which the species might have dispersed to other continents models were then transferred worldwide to predict the potential distribution for each continent these models were calibrated using 70 of the points presence and absence records in af model 1245 and 2209 au model 1561 and 2996 ea model 2251 and 4163 eu model 7054 and 12 948 na model 4534 and 6244 and sa model 1572 and 4284 respectively the remaining 30 were used in interpolative model evaluations records from the remaining other continents were used for model evaluation as regards transferability here the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve i e auc is used for assessing the discriminatory capacity of enm predictions swets 1988 jiménez valverde 2012 it juxtaposes correct and incorrect predictions over a range of thresholds i e threshold independent to ensure that specific divisions of the occurrence data did not influence model quality we repeated the process 5 times for each population each time with a different partition of presence and absence points we explored models based on four environmental datasets i e all variables all jackknifed dataset jk low collinearity dataset lc pca dataset pca appendix a representing different degrees of dimensionality spatial correlation and ecological relevance climatic similarity and novelty between continents were assessed using mobility oriented parity mop metric for the four environmental datasets mop is a correction of and improvement on the basic idea of multivariate environmental similarity surfaces elith et al 2011 owens et al 2013 as it refers calculations of environmental novelty to the nearest part of the reference area rather than to the centroid in environmental space owens et al 2013 to explore the relationship between model interpolative capability and transferability we calculated auc difference i e auc difference extra auc inter auc inter and extra aucs represent auc values in model training and transfer areas respectively for all individual and consensus models see raw auc values at https osf io qes3k this auc differences were then compared with the inter auc to examine the interpolation and transferability relationship we then plotted extra auc against climate novelty to examine the relationship between individual model transferability and climate novelty here climate novelty i e non analogue climate conditions in model transferred area was calculated as proportion of pixels that were in strict extrapolation in model transfer areas representing the hardest challenge during model transferring see owens et al 2013 for strict extrapolation appendix c five commonly used niche modeling algorithms including generalized additive models gam generalized boosted models gbm generalized linear models glm random forests rf and maximum entropy models maxent were used to fit individual models individual gam gbm glm rf and maxent models were developed under a presence absence framework using default parameters in biomod2 thuiller 2003 implemented in r r core team 2015 to standardize protocols and allow replicability of experiments details of implementation of each algorithm are provided in appendix d in all 20 individual models 4 datasets 5 algorithms were calibrated for each native population on each continent serving as the basis for producing consensus models see summary of model protocols in appendix e an anova was used to determine the degree to which model algorithm environmental datasets and replicates affected model interpolative and extrapolative auc values all anova analyses were conducted using jmp statistical discovery software jmp version 13 2 3 model consensus and evaluation individual models were transferred to global extent and evaluated with the independent points not used in model calibration individual models were combined via four ensemble approaches mean median wa and pcam pcam is based on the median of half of the single model outputs which were preselected by a principal component analysis that performed on individual model predictions component loading in pca i e the weights that were given to individual model prediction within that component represent the relative importance of individual prediction within components the first principal component i e pc1 is equivalent to a line passing through the centroid of all sets of individual model predictions and it minimizes the square of the distance of each set of predictions to that line while pc1 also called the consensus axis thuiller 2004 is as close to all of the data as possible the subsequent axes also seek to represent as much variation as possible but they are unrelated and becoming less important to the previous principal component the component loadings can be used to identify the group of predictions that were more related to the pc1 and pcam selects the median of half of individual models that have high component loadings that are most related to pc1 wold et al 1987 thuiller 2004 araújo et al 2005 zhu et al 2017 we used the classical approach of auc values based on the 30 interpolative testing data to produce consensus models as commonly done for wa consensus models e g araújo et al 2011 engler et al 2011 harrigan et al 2014 for comparing and evaluating models we used both auc values and omission and commission error rates all individual models i e individual models based on five algorithms and four environmental datasets were used to generate consensus models performance of consensus models was compared with that of the individual models on which they were based appendix e auc values were calculated via a presence absence framework for both interpolative and transferability evaluations for individual and consensus models using internal testing data and independent points not used during model calibration in addition binary omission and commission rates were calculated for model transferability evaluations by calculating the proportion of independent testing points not correctly predicted at a threshold we plotted omission and commission errors across the spectrum of model thresholds specifically we calculated omission and commission errors at increments of 0 01 against the total 1 which were rescaled from the original outputs of 1000 i e the original output of biomod2 prediction 3 results 3 1 individual model performance results showed that algorithms and environmental datasets had significant effects on both interpolative and extrapolative auc values anova p 0 05 but model replicates did not anova p 0 05 as such we selected one replicate for presenting and illustrating our results many variations were observed on individual model performances i e auc difference where less variations were observed in consensus models fig 2 among individual models gbm and rf models showed less variation and generally outperformed others where maxent models sometimes outperformed others but showed more variations across continents and environmental datasets fig 2 individual model performance did not show perceptible trends across environmental datasets in either model training or transfer areas the interpolative auc values were generally high in interpolative challenges but declined when model predictions were transferred to other continents as many negative auc difference values were observed either in individual or consensus model fig 2 models calibrated on europe and north america generally outperformed those calibrated on the other four continents which showed auc increasing after models were transferred fig 2 many instances of strict extrapolation were observed in models calibrated in australia and africa where less climate novelty was observed in europe and north america appendix b and c fifteen individual models calibrated in europe showed auc increasing when transferred onto the other continents followed by 10 and 8 individual models in north america and east asia respectively and fourteen individual models calibrated in europe showed good performance in both interpolative and extrapolative challenges i e auc 0 90 followed by 13 individual models in north america individual model transferability generally declined with increasing climate novelty in transfer areas fig 3 nonetheless among model algorithms gbm and rf showed less variations and outperformed others when models were transferred into non analogue conditions i e climate novelty fig 3 3 2 comparison of consensus and individual models across the six continents the omission and commission error curves of consensus models fell within the cloud of curves of the individual models on which the consensus models had been based fig 4 5 consensus models outperformed some poorly performing individual models but failed to equal the performance of other individual models similar patterns were also observed in the auc difference values between individual and consensus models as auc difference of consensus models were clustered and fell into the auc ranges of individual models fig 2 performances of four protocols used to generate consensus models were indistinguishable in auc values fig 2 nonetheless their ability to anticipate presence and absence points on other continents varied across thresholds which were detected in omission and commission error curves fig 4 5 pcam outperformed mean median and wa in terms of low omission error across the spectrum of model thresholds in africa and east asia fig 4 in australia and north america pcam outperformed wa and mean but performed similarly to median pcam performed similarly to mean and wa in europe but outperformed them in south america at threshold of 0 6 fig 4 mean and wa performed similarly across the six continents whereas median performed better in europe north america and south america fig 4 in term of commission error i e capability of predicting absence pcam outperformed wa in africa australia and south america showing lower commission errors at threshold of 0 3 but not at threshold of 0 4 they were indistinguishable in east asia and north america fig 5 consensus model produced use median method generally showed lower commission errors in six continents fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 challenges we acknowledge limitations on protocols employed in present study as our results were based on a threshold virtual species approach which is unlikely to be realistic meynard et al 2019a 2019b nonetheless our virtual species scheme has a broad range of intercontinental invasive species representatives for example hyphantria cuneais is native to north america but has established populations in asia and europe zhu and peterson 2017 and halyomorpha halys native to east asia and has established populations in north america and europe zhu et al 2012 here we seek to create virtual species that have binary distribution from which we can sample presence and absence records to fit and test model in model evaluations we plotted omission and commission errors across the spectrum of model threshold to compare individual and consensus model performances this approach can examine model performance thoroughly i e model predictions across at every specific threshold but it cannot lead us to a definitive statement on whether a model is better than b model as model performances varied across thresholds the enm community has not come to a conclusion about how best to evaluate niche model predictions commonly used metrics i e auc and tss for niche model evaluation have been questioned e g lobo et al 2008 leroy et al 2018 other researchers recommend jaccard s or sørensen s similarity index for model evaluation e g leory et al 2018 the former index nonetheless neglected true negatives where the later maximize true positives but minimize false positives and false negatives with respect to true positives e g leory et al 2018 these two metrics were based on a specific threshold and might work better when reliable absence data were not available or the purpose of study was to predict potential distribution rather than realized distribution peterson et al 2011 here auc value failed to distinguish performance of consensus models https osf io qes3k whereas omission and commission error curves revealed detailed differences of model performance across multiple thresholds figs 4 5 other studies also suggest the shape of receiver operating characteristic curves i e combination of omission and commission error curves are more important than simple reporting auc values in model evaluations jiménez valverde 2012 we explored the challenge of maximizing model transferability across space and found that for individual models extrapolative accuracy was generally lower than interpolative accuracy fig 2 these phenomena have been noted by other authors e g heikkinen et al 2012 niche models calibrated on europe and north america showed good transferability which may relate to their large sample size of points across diverse geographic regions appendix b or to less non analogue climate conditions during model transfer appendix c in contrast individual models calibrated in africa and australia performed poorly possibly owing to the novel climate conditions in model transfer areas as the accuracy of niche models prediction generally declines with increasing climate novelty tingley et al 2016 fitzpatrick et al 2018 fig 3 nonetheless among algorithms gbm and rf showed less variation and generally outperformed other approaches fig 2 notice that these model performances would be impacted by the proportion of presence and absence records in training data barbet massin et al 2012a another challenge is that of finding best approaches for selecting informative environmental variables for enm our former studies showed that jk data produced models that attained the best transferability in hyphantria cunea zhu and peterson 2017 here however performance of jk based models was inconsistent with performances varied across continents and among model algorithms thus underlining the challenge of selecting relevant variables for niche modeling ecological relevance and spatial correlation need to be considered when selecting environmental datasets but relevance to the species in question is likely more important thibaud et al 2014 yiwen et al 2016 however a recent comparison of statistical approaches to selecting variables for a weed species suggests that no silver bullets exist in selecting ecologically relevant variables and that the best statistical approach to selecting relevant variables likely varies across species model algorithms and model settings fan et al 2018 4 2 consensus reflected central tendency of individuals ensemble consensus models are used frequently to overcome problems of variability in forecasting extinction risk from climate change e g araújo et al 2005 or identifying areas of potential distribution during biological invasions e g zhu and peterson 2017 the consensus approach is based on the idea that different individual predictions are different versions or estimates of possible states of the real distributions assuming that all projections are equally likely and that they collectively delimit the range of uncertainties associated with the prediction thuiller 2004 a relevant combination of several unbiased model outputs would thus result in a more accurate prediction here consensus models showed less variation and fell into the performance cloud of individual model that used to produce them fig 2 4 5 they generally do not outperform all individuals they outperformed some poor performed models but not equaling the best models qiao et al 2015 zhu and peterson 2017 hao et al 2020 fig 4 5 uncertainty and variations exist among protocols used to process individual models for ensemble forecasting fig 4 our study suggests that consensus outputs follow majority trends but do not outperform individual models fig 4 5 therefore selecting best models is crucial to predicting potential distributions of species however selecting the best individual model that responds optimally to the challenges of model transfer requires independent testing points this approach thus might work acceptably in biological invasion or hindcasted forecasting in which invasive populations may exist on other continents e g jiménez valverde et al 2011 or fossil records were available e g nogués bravo 2009 but not in a future climate change context as future independent testing points are generally unavailable 4 3 pcam outperformed wa in inter and extra challenges the term consensus refers to a majority view or to an agreement of different predictions thuiller 2004 the ideal consensus model would thus reflect the majority view or central tendency among individual model predictions among four protocols assessed in this study the mean approach seeks to summarize variation by averaging individual predictions however this protocol was not robust since it was influenced overmuch by extreme values of individual predictions the median protocol uses the median of the ranges but may not reflect the central tendency of the different individual model projections compared to these two protocols the pcam protocol was not impacted by extremes and reflected better the central tendency of individuals it generally showed lower omission and commission errors and often outperformed other protocols although this approach is not readily available in present software e g biomod2 fig 4 5 it was recognized and seeing used in ensemble forecasting e g araújo et al 2006 garcia et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 faurby and araújo 2018 wa approach is used widely in processing individuals to produce consensus models in ensemble forecasting e g araújo et al 2011 barbet massin et al 2012b harrigan et al 2014 however this protocol uses metrics of interpolative performance of individual models as weights which depends on interpolative accuracy being an appropriate predictor of accuracy of transfer predictions tradeoffs between interpolative accuracy and transferability across space will affect outcomes of wa approach profoundly heikkinen et al 2012 fig 2 although answers to whether good interpolative prediction accuracy for models comes at the expense of transferability remain up in the air peterson et al 2007 barbosa et al 2009 heikkinen et al 2012 fig 2 comparing to wa pcam was not impacted by the challenge of maximizing interpolation and extrapolation such that most pcam models showed low omission and commission errors and always outperformed wa fig 4 5 a general protocol is to use a best subset of models or weight heavily on models that show good interpolative performance to produce consensus models however such protocols have the risk of calibrating complex consensus models before transferring our results imply that consensus models for transfers must be designed carefully taking model complexity and generality into consideration and individual candidate models for consensus processing must reflect the fact that species distributions manifest a complex interplay of abiotic factors biotic factors and dispersal constraints that together determine distributional limits peterson et al 2011 when using ensemble forecasting approaches we recommend using pcam rather than was to produce consensus models whether for model transfers or not as it captures the original intent of ensemble forecasting which is to reflect the central tendency of multiple models funding national nature science foundation of china grant number 31870523 and 31401962 to gz tianjin 131 creative talent

3224 and 5938 eu 10 083 and 18 491 na 6485 and 8911 and sa 2277 and 6088 respectively the different numbers of points by region reflect the spatial extent of suitable and unsuitable conditions in those regions and the sum of presence and absence records per species and continent reflect the size of model calibration areas realized niche occupied by these six populations were displayed and comparted in environmental and geographic spaces appendix b 2 2 model construction and consensus niche models were calibrated for each population from each continent as a proxy of a native area from which the species might have dispersed to other continents models were then transferred worldwide to predict the potential distribution for each continent these models were calibrated using 70 of the points presence and absence records in af model 1245 and 2209 au model 1561 and 2996 ea model 2251 and 4163 eu model 7054 and 12 948 na model 4534 and 6244 and sa model 1572 and 4284 respectively the remaining 30 were used in interpolative model evaluations records from the remaining other continents were used for model evaluation as regards transferability here the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve i e auc is used for assessing the discriminatory capacity of enm predictions swets 1988 jiménez valverde 2012 it juxtaposes correct and incorrect predictions over a range of thresholds i e threshold independent to ensure that specific divisions of the occurrence data did not influence model quality we repeated the process 5 times for each population each time with a different partition of presence and absence points we explored models based on four environmental datasets i e all variables all jackknifed dataset jk low collinearity dataset lc pca dataset pca appendix a representing different degrees of dimensionality spatial correlation and ecological relevance climatic similarity and novelty between continents were assessed using mobility oriented parity mop metric for the four environmental datasets mop is a correction of and improvement on the basic idea of multivariate environmental similarity surfaces elith et al 2011 owens et al 2013 as it refers calculations of environmental novelty to the nearest part of the reference area rather than to the centroid in environmental space owens et al 2013 to explore the relationship between model interpolative capability and transferability we calculated auc difference i e auc difference extra auc inter auc inter and extra aucs represent auc values in model training and transfer areas respectively for all individual and consensus models see raw auc values at https osf io qes3k this auc differences were then compared with the inter auc to examine the interpolation and transferability relationship we then plotted extra auc against climate novelty to examine the relationship between individual model transferability and climate novelty here climate novelty i e non analogue climate conditions in model transferred area was calculated as proportion of pixels that were in strict extrapolation in model transfer areas representing the hardest challenge during model transferring see owens et al 2013 for strict extrapolation appendix c five commonly used niche modeling algorithms including generalized additive models gam generalized boosted models gbm generalized linear models glm random forests rf and maximum entropy models maxent were used to fit individual models individual gam gbm glm rf and maxent models were developed under a presence absence framework using default parameters in biomod2 thuiller 2003 implemented in r r core team 2015 to standardize protocols and allow replicability of experiments details of implementation of each algorithm are provided in appendix d in all 20 individual models 4 datasets 5 algorithms were calibrated for each native population on each continent serving as the basis for producing consensus models see summary of model protocols in appendix e an anova was used to determine the degree to which model algorithm environmental datasets and replicates affected model interpolative and extrapolative auc values all anova analyses were conducted using jmp statistical discovery software jmp version 13 2 3 model consensus and evaluation individual models were transferred to global extent and evaluated with the independent points not used in model calibration individual models were combined via four ensemble approaches mean median wa and pcam pcam is based on the median of half of the single model outputs which were preselected by a principal component analysis that performed on individual model predictions component loading in pca i e the weights that were given to individual model prediction within that component represent the relative importance of individual prediction within components the first principal component i e pc1 is equivalent to a line passing through the centroid of all sets of individual model predictions and it minimizes the square of the distance of each set of predictions to that line while pc1 also called the consensus axis thuiller 2004 is as close to all of the data as possible the subsequent axes also seek to represent as much variation as possible but they are unrelated and becoming less important to the previous principal component the component loadings can be used to identify the group of predictions that were more related to the pc1 and pcam selects the median of half of individual models that have high component loadings that are most related to pc1 wold et al 1987 thuiller 2004 araújo et al 2005 zhu et al 2017 we used the classical approach of auc values based on the 30 interpolative testing data to produce consensus models as commonly done for wa consensus models e g araújo et al 2011 engler et al 2011 harrigan et al 2014 for comparing and evaluating models we used both auc values and omission and commission error rates all individual models i e individual models based on five algorithms and four environmental datasets were used to generate consensus models performance of consensus models was compared with that of the individual models on which they were based appendix e auc values were calculated via a presence absence framework for both interpolative and transferability evaluations for individual and consensus models using internal testing data and independent points not used during model calibration in addition binary omission and commission rates were calculated for model transferability evaluations by calculating the proportion of independent testing points not correctly predicted at a threshold we plotted omission and commission errors across the spectrum of model thresholds specifically we calculated omission and commission errors at increments of 0 01 against the total 1 which were rescaled from the original outputs of 1000 i e the original output of biomod2 prediction 3 results 3 1 individual model performance results showed that algorithms and environmental datasets had significant effects on both interpolative and extrapolative auc values anova p 0 05 but model replicates did not anova p 0 05 as such we selected one replicate for presenting and illustrating our results many variations were observed on individual model performances i e auc difference where less variations were observed in consensus models fig 2 among individual models gbm and rf models showed less variation and generally outperformed others where maxent models sometimes outperformed others but showed more variations across continents and environmental datasets fig 2 individual model performance did not show perceptible trends across environmental datasets in either model training or transfer areas the interpolative auc values were generally high in interpolative challenges but declined when model predictions were transferred to other continents as many negative auc difference values were observed either in individual or consensus model fig 2 models calibrated on europe and north america generally outperformed those calibrated on the other four continents which showed auc increasing after models were transferred fig 2 many instances of strict extrapolation were observed in models calibrated in australia and africa where less climate novelty was observed in europe and north america appendix b and c fifteen individual models calibrated in europe showed auc increasing when transferred onto the other continents followed by 10 and 8 individual models in north america and east asia respectively and fourteen individual models calibrated in europe showed good performance in both interpolative and extrapolative challenges i e auc 0 90 followed by 13 individual models in north america individual model transferability generally declined with increasing climate novelty in transfer areas fig 3 nonetheless among model algorithms gbm and rf showed less variations and outperformed others when models were transferred into non analogue conditions i e climate novelty fig 3 3 2 comparison of consensus and individual models across the six continents the omission and commission error curves of consensus models fell within the cloud of curves of the individual models on which the consensus models had been based fig 4 5 consensus models outperformed some poorly performing individual models but failed to equal the performance of other individual models similar patterns were also observed in the auc difference values between individual and consensus models as auc difference of consensus models were clustered and fell into the auc ranges of individual models fig 2 performances of four protocols used to generate consensus models were indistinguishable in auc values fig 2 nonetheless their ability to anticipate presence and absence points on other continents varied across thresholds which were detected in omission and commission error curves fig 4 5 pcam outperformed mean median and wa in terms of low omission error across the spectrum of model thresholds in africa and east asia fig 4 in australia and north america pcam outperformed wa and mean but performed similarly to median pcam performed similarly to mean and wa in europe but outperformed them in south america at threshold of 0 6 fig 4 mean and wa performed similarly across the six continents whereas median performed better in europe north america and south america fig 4 in term of commission error i e capability of predicting absence pcam outperformed wa in africa australia and south america showing lower commission errors at threshold of 0 3 but not at threshold of 0 4 they were indistinguishable in east asia and north america fig 5 consensus model produced use median method generally showed lower commission errors in six continents fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 challenges we acknowledge limitations on protocols employed in present study as our results were based on a threshold virtual species approach which is unlikely to be realistic meynard et al 2019a 2019b nonetheless our virtual species scheme has a broad range of intercontinental invasive species representatives for example hyphantria cuneais is native to north america but has established populations in asia and europe zhu and peterson 2017 and halyomorpha halys native to east asia and has established populations in north america and europe zhu et al 2012 here we seek to create virtual species that have binary distribution from which we can sample presence and absence records to fit and test model in model evaluations we plotted omission and commission errors across the spectrum of model threshold to compare individual and consensus model performances this approach can examine model performance thoroughly i e model predictions across at every specific threshold but it cannot lead us to a definitive statement on whether a model is better than b model as model performances varied across thresholds the enm community has not come to a conclusion about how best to evaluate niche model predictions commonly used metrics i e auc and tss for niche model evaluation have been questioned e g lobo et al 2008 leroy et al 2018 other researchers recommend jaccard s or sørensen s similarity index for model evaluation e g leory et al 2018 the former index nonetheless neglected true negatives where the later maximize true positives but minimize false positives and false negatives with respect to true positives e g leory et al 2018 these two metrics were based on a specific threshold and might work better when reliable absence data were not available or the purpose of study was to predict potential distribution rather than realized distribution peterson et al 2011 here auc value failed to distinguish performance of consensus models https osf io qes3k whereas omission and commission error curves revealed detailed differences of model performance across multiple thresholds figs 4 5 other studies also suggest the shape of receiver operating characteristic curves i e combination of omission and commission error curves are more important than simple reporting auc values in model evaluations jiménez valverde 2012 we explored the challenge of maximizing model transferability across space and found that for individual models extrapolative accuracy was generally lower than interpolative accuracy fig 2 these phenomena have been noted by other authors e g heikkinen et al 2012 niche models calibrated on europe and north america showed good transferability which may relate to their large sample size of points across diverse geographic regions appendix b or to less non analogue climate conditions during model transfer appendix c in contrast individual models calibrated in africa and australia performed poorly possibly owing to the novel climate conditions in model transfer areas as the accuracy of niche models prediction generally declines with increasing climate novelty tingley et al 2016 fitzpatrick et al 2018 fig 3 nonetheless among algorithms gbm and rf showed less variation and generally outperformed other approaches fig 2 notice that these model performances would be impacted by the proportion of presence and absence records in training data barbet massin et al 2012a another challenge is that of finding best approaches for selecting informative environmental variables for enm our former studies showed that jk data produced models that attained the best transferability in hyphantria cunea zhu and peterson 2017 here however performance of jk based models was inconsistent with performances varied across continents and among model algorithms thus underlining the challenge of selecting relevant variables for niche modeling ecological relevance and spatial correlation need to be considered when selecting environmental datasets but relevance to the species in question is likely more important thibaud et al 2014 yiwen et al 2016 however a recent comparison of statistical approaches to selecting variables for a weed species suggests that no silver bullets exist in selecting ecologically relevant variables and that the best statistical approach to selecting relevant variables likely varies across species model algorithms and model settings fan et al 2018 4 2 consensus reflected central tendency of individuals ensemble consensus models are used frequently to overcome problems of variability in forecasting extinction risk from climate change e g araújo et al 2005 or identifying areas of potential distribution during biological invasions e g zhu and peterson 2017 the consensus approach is based on the idea that different individual predictions are different versions or estimates of possible states of the real distributions assuming that all projections are equally likely and that they collectively delimit the range of uncertainties associated with the prediction thuiller 2004 a relevant combination of several unbiased model outputs would thus result in a more accurate prediction here consensus models showed less variation and fell into the performance cloud of individual model that used to produce them fig 2 4 5 they generally do not outperform all individuals they outperformed some poor performed models but not equaling the best models qiao et al 2015 zhu and peterson 2017 hao et al 2020 fig 4 5 uncertainty and variations exist among protocols used to process individual models for ensemble forecasting fig 4 our study suggests that consensus outputs follow majority trends but do not outperform individual models fig 4 5 therefore selecting best models is crucial to predicting potential distributions of species however selecting the best individual model that responds optimally to the challenges of model transfer requires independent testing points this approach thus might work acceptably in biological invasion or hindcasted forecasting in which invasive populations may exist on other continents e g jiménez valverde et al 2011 or fossil records were available e g nogués bravo 2009 but not in a future climate change context as future independent testing points are generally unavailable 4 3 pcam outperformed wa in inter and extra challenges the term consensus refers to a majority view or to an agreement of different predictions thuiller 2004 the ideal consensus model would thus reflect the majority view or central tendency among individual model predictions among four protocols assessed in this study the mean approach seeks to summarize variation by averaging individual predictions however this protocol was not robust since it was influenced overmuch by extreme values of individual predictions the median protocol uses the median of the ranges but may not reflect the central tendency of the different individual model projections compared to these two protocols the pcam protocol was not impacted by extremes and reflected better the central tendency of individuals it generally showed lower omission and commission errors and often outperformed other protocols although this approach is not readily available in present software e g biomod2 fig 4 5 it was recognized and seeing used in ensemble forecasting e g araújo et al 2006 garcia et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 faurby and araújo 2018 wa approach is used widely in processing individuals to produce consensus models in ensemble forecasting e g araújo et al 2011 barbet massin et al 2012b harrigan et al 2014 however this protocol uses metrics of interpolative performance of individual models as weights which depends on interpolative accuracy being an appropriate predictor of accuracy of transfer predictions tradeoffs between interpolative accuracy and transferability across space will affect outcomes of wa approach profoundly heikkinen et al 2012 fig 2 although answers to whether good interpolative prediction accuracy for models comes at the expense of transferability remain up in the air peterson et al 2007 barbosa et al 2009 heikkinen et al 2012 fig 2 comparing to wa pcam was not impacted by the challenge of maximizing interpolation and extrapolation such that most pcam models showed low omission and commission errors and always outperformed wa fig 4 5 a general protocol is to use a best subset of models or weight heavily on models that show good interpolative performance to produce consensus models however such protocols have the risk of calibrating complex consensus models before transferring our results imply that consensus models for transfers must be designed carefully taking model complexity and generality into consideration and individual candidate models for consensus processing must reflect the fact that species distributions manifest a complex interplay of abiotic factors biotic factors and dispersal constraints that together determine distributional limits peterson et al 2011 when using ensemble forecasting approaches we recommend using pcam rather than was to produce consensus models whether for model transfers or not as it captures the original intent of ensemble forecasting which is to reflect the central tendency of multiple models funding national nature science foundation of china grant number 31870523 and 31401962 to gz tianjin 131 creative talent

24636,wildfires are a critical phenomenon in terrestrial ecosystems and the intensity and frequency of these events have increased in recent years high temperatures in the topsoil during wildfires can induce changes in soil physical chemical and biological properties due to the loss of soil organic matter som therefore the main objective of this study was to develop a numerical model to predict som decay during wildfire events the model identifies the main parameters controlling som decay and predicts its decline by coupling the energy balance for soil heating and species conservation for water and som using high temperature induced vaporization and combustion kinetics fluid flow was not included however the radiative energy conducted through soil pores was incorporated as a volumetric pore radius function when the radiative term in the thermal conductivity was not considered the model predicted the soil thermal evolution with a determination coefficient r2 0 91 and with an r2 0 98 when the volumetric pore radius was adjusted the main parameters controlling som decay were soil texture oxygen availability and initial soil water and som contents som decay was also dependent on the wildfire temperature and exposure time in terms of soil texture som decay increases as sand increases or clay reduces the main results showed that the soil water content controlled the amount of heat consumed during vaporization the normalized som decay does not depend on the initial som content and the restricted oxidation limited som decay finally this study reduces the number of parameters when studying som decay and second order fire effects for post fire assessment and restoration also because it provides a better understanding of how wildfires affect som implemented as an additional routine the model can enhance other existing computer models for describing ecological processes keywords soil heating surface fire soil organic matter decay thermochemical approach wildfires 1 introduction wildfires are a common phenomenon in terrestrial ecosystems with increasing intensity and frequency in recent years bonilla et al 2014 bowman et al 2017 these extreme fire seasons are related to droughts and high temperature periods driven by climate change turco et al 2019 wildfires can be classified into three groups according to the fuel consumed crown fires surface fires and ground fires when trees and shrub burn it is classified as a crown fire whereas when litter and dead or living fuels at the ground surface burn mostly by flaming combustion it is named a surface fire when organic material under the litter layer burns primarily by smoldering combustion it is known as a ground fire although soil heating from crown fires is usually low substantial soil heating can be expected from long duration fires like surface and ground fires neary et al 2005 smoldering combustion peak temperatures range from 500 to 700 c while flaming combustion temperatures can rise to 1500 c drysdale 2004 however wildfires spread rate is highly variable ranging from 1 m h for smoldering fires to 1 km h for extreme fire behavior johnston et al 2018 on the other hand prescribed fires are those actively implemented for land management such as fuel reduction and ecological burn ryan et al 2013 grebner et al 2013 the objective of these fires is to reduce fire risk through a controlled burn of hazardous fuel and the last use fire when fires have been suppressed over long periods to restore the natural role of fire santín and doerr 2016 high temperatures in the topsoil during wildfires can affect soil physical chemical and biological properties including soil hydrology soil structure nutrient cycling ph cation exchange capacity microorganisms vegetation and soil organic matter som debano 1991 hungerford et al 1991 neary et al 2005 ekinci et al 2008 zavala et al 2014 araya et al 2016 2017 previous studies have shown that changes in many soil properties after high temperature occurrence relate to som loss neary et al 2005 araya et al 2016 2017 so ignition differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis are used for measuring the change in weight siewert 2004 fernández et al 2012 pallasser et al 2013 hoogsteen et al 2015 kristl et al 2016 these studies found that som decomposition occurred between 200 c and 550 c with peaks near 300 c 350 c and 400 c 450 c siewert 2004 pallasser et al 2013 kristl et al 2016 while som is not the only component lost at this temperature range it significantly correlates with thermogravimetric weight loss between 200 c and 550 c siewert 2004 hoogsteen et al 2015 derived guidelines for ignition conditions they studied loss on ignition for sandy and silt loam soils to determine temperatures at which som is completely removed and the effect of exposure time however it is not entirely understood the temperature duration relationship for partial som decay the effect of wildfires on som and the subsequent effects on soil properties is still unclear it is necessary to understand the changes induced in som during wildfires to identify potential areas of concern for post fire management practices zavala et al 2014 wieting et al 2017 additionally a better understanding of the organic matter consumption mechanisms enables its inclusion in combustion and heat transfer models allowing the replacement of empirical studies with these models neary et al 2005 several studies have developed models based on heat transfer theory to predict soil heating during wildfires campbell et al 1994 studied soil thermal conductivity during high temperatures based on the devries 1963 model incorporating its thermal dependency later campbell et al 1995 and massman 2012 2015 focused on soil heating models at high temperatures to study how the soil water content evolves during these events these models showed good agreement between simulated and experimental soil temperature and each version demonstrated improvements when modeling soil water content changes a more elaborated model for wildfire effects is the first order fire effects model fofem lutes 2020 this computer program couples above ground wildfire effects including tree mortality fuel consumption and smoke emissions and the massman 2015 soil heating model regardless of the advances these models do not account for high temperature induced som decay or combustion some models describing biomass combustion have been developed to understand the fuel combustion process huang and rein 2014 2016 2017 el houssami et al 2016 2018 some have focused on fuel beds grasslands and peat huang and rein 2014 2016 el houssami et al 2016 2018 while others have concentrated on wildfire spread and behavior morvan et al 2009 agranat and perminov 2020 huang and rein 2014 2016 focused on developing kinetics schemes and the parameters needed for modeling peat combustion at the matter 1 mg and bench 100 g scales these studies recommend using a four step kinetics scheme as an equilibrium of simplicity and accuracy to reproduce the material thermogravimetric experiment this four step model accounts for one pyrolysis and three oxidations to describe the biomass degradation at high temperatures peat is considered soil rich in dead organic matter and formed through the incomplete humification of various dead plants huang and rein 2016 as such peat may be considered representative of som as it consists of living soil fauna and microflora partially decomposed plant and animal residues and humic substances bot and benites 2005 therefore the objective of this study was to develop a model for a better understanding of how wildfires affect som and identify the main parameters controlling som decay a numerical model representing the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil heating and som decay during wildfires was built to address this objective the model was tested with different parameters and ranges to identify those more influential on som decay ultimately this study aims to provide a model to assess som decay during wildfires and assist when selecting the variables to describe in field or laboratory experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the model is a vertical one dimensional 1d model coupling the energy balance for soil heating and species conservation for water content and som determined by high temperature induced vaporization and combustion kinetics vaporization and som species decay are incorporated using the arrhenius type reaction the model doesn t consider fluid flow and variations in soil porosity and bulk density but includes radiative energy conducted through soil pores as a function of the volumetric pore radius the model simulates soil temperature water content som α and β char contents ash content and oxygen mass fraction the governing non linear equations are solved using a linearized fully implicit iterative scheme with the generalized thomas algorithm as described in patankar 1980 fig 1 shows a flowchart depicting the link between the model s different processes the equations and parameters related to these processes are described in the following sections 2 1 1 energy balance for soil heating the energy balance is expressed as follows 1 ρ s c s t t z λ t z k 1 k q k where t k is soil temperature t t is time z l is soil depth positive downwards ρscs m t 2 l 1 k 1 is the soil volumetric heat capacity λ m l t 3 k 1 is the soil thermal conductivity and q k m l 1 t 3 is the heat of reaction k per unit volume the model considers heat transfer by conduction and heat sources sinks from vaporization and combustion reactions the soil volumetric heat capacity is expressed as the sum of the product between each soil component volumetric fraction ϕi l3 l 3 and its volumetric heat capacity ρici m t 2 l 1 k 1 as follows campbell and norman 1998 2 ρ s c s ϕ i ρ i c i the soil thermal conductivity is expressed as the sum of two terms the first λsoil was obtained from lu et al 2014 and the second λrad from massman 2015 and bauer 1993 the λsoil is a simple model calculated from soil bulk density ρb m l 3 volumetric water content θ l3 l 3 saturated volumetric water content θ s l3 l 3 θ s 1 ρb 2 65 g cm 3 clay fraction fcl m 1 and sand fraction fsa m 1 as follows 3 λ s o i l λ d r y exp β θ α 4 λ d r y 0 56 θ s 0 51 5 β 1 97 f s a 1 87 ρ b 1 36 f s a ρ b 0 95 6 α 0 67 f c l 0 24 this thermal conductivity model was selected to provide a robust model with few input variables the simplicity of the model allows dispensing the use of models to describe the vapor term due to latent heat in the apparent thermal conductivity of air where a water retention curve model needs incorporation as per the thermo dependent model developed by campbell et al 1994 the second term λrad incorporates the radiant energy conducted through soil pores at high temperatures this term was derived from a general analytical approach for heat conduction in porous media with a random distribution of spherical pores bauer 1993 and can be expressed as massman 2015 7 λ r a d 3 8 σ n 2 r p t 3 8 n 1 θ 3 θ s where σ m t 3 k 4 is the boltzmann constant n is the medium s index of refraction and rp l is the volumetric pore radius 2 1 2 som decay biomass pyrolyzes bp and oxidizes bo separately when heated in an oxidative atmosphere such as air producing α and β char respectively at higher temperatures 300 c these two chars oxidize αo and βo producing ash if som is considered biomass som combustion is described in the model by a four step kinetic scheme as recommended in huang and rein 2016 this four step kinetic scheme includes one pyrolysis and three oxidations as follows 9 som ν α b p α char ν g b p gas bp som ν o 2 b o o 2 ν β b o β char ν g b o gas bo β char ν o 2 β o o 2 ν a β o ash ν g β o gas β o α char ν o 2 α o o 2 ν a α o ash ν g α o gas α o where ν is the mass stoichiometric coefficient subscripts α β o2 g and a represent α char β char oxygen gas and ash respectively and subscripts bp bo αo and βo represent the biomass pyrolysis biomass oxidation α oxidation and β oxidation reactions respectively each of these heterogeneous reactions may be described on a general mass basis as follows 10 a k j 1 n ν j k gas j ν b k b k j 1 n ν j k gas j where the subscript k refers to the corresponding reaction j refers to the corresponding gas phase species a and b are the condensed phase reactants and products respectively and νb ν and ν are the mass stoichiometric coefficient of the condensed phase products gas phase reactants and gas phase products respectively the decay rate of species a in a reaction k ω dak m t 1 ω dak 0 is expressed by the arrhenius type reaction as follows 11 ω d a k m o 0 z k exp e k r t m a m o 0 n k g y o 2 where mo0 m is the initial som mass zk t 1 is the preexponential term ek m l2 t 2 mol 1 is the activation energy r m l2 t 2 mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant ma m is the species mass nk is the reaction order and g yo2 is the mass action function of oxygen the formation rate of species b in a reaction k ω fbk m t 1 is computed as the product of the rate of decay of species ak and the mass stoichiometric coefficient νb k m 1 the heat of reaction k q k is computed as the product of the decay rate of species ak and the enthalpy of reaction k δhk l2 t 2 as follows 12 ω f b k ν b k ω d a k 13 q k δ h k ω d a k the mass action function of oxygen becomes a unit value if the process is nonoxidative or it is a function of oxygen mass fraction in the air phase yo2 m 1 this is described by the oxidation order no2 k as follows 14 g y o 2 1 n o n o x i d a t i v e 1 y o 2 n o 2 k 1 o x i d a t i v e the species conservation is considered as follows 15 m i t ω f i ω d i where m is mass m subscript i refers to the corresponding species and subscripts d and f refers to decay and formation respectively som is composed of living soil fauna and microflora partially decomposed plants and animal residues and humic substances bot and benites 2005 in contrast peat is considered soil rich in dead organic matter and is formed through the incomplete humification of various dead plants huang and rein 2016 peats from huang and rein 2016 were considered representative biomass for som as they have similar temperature ranges for thermal decomposition moreover the parameters to describe som were also obtained from this study 2 1 3 soil water content vaporization when soil is heated water vaporizes near 100 c a process expressed by a single dissociation step huang and rein 2016 where liquid water completely vaporizes into water vapor the water vaporization or soil drying rate is expressed by the arrhenius type reaction as follows 16 ω d w m w 0 z d r exp e d r r t m w m w 0 n d r where mw0 is the initial water mass zdr log zdr 136 8 log s 1 is the preexponential term edr edr 1000 kj mol 1 is the activation energy mw is the water mass and ndr ndr 1 is the order of the reaction the heat of vaporization q dr is computed as the product of the drying rate and the enthalpy of vaporization δhdr δhdr 2 26 mj kg 1 as follows 17 q d r δ h d r ω d w water mass conservation neglecting fluid flow is computed as follows 18 m w t ω d w parameters to describe the water vaporization kinetic were adjusted to reflect rapid vaporization near 100 c this approach provides a simple vaporization model that enables heat consumption computing to get the thermal evolution at high temperatures 2 1 4 solution domain initial and boundary conditions considering the difficulties of measuring field values before a wildfire this model sets the initial conditions for soil temperature soil volumetric water content som and oxygen mass fraction as uniform profiles the initial oxygen mass fraction was set to yo2 0 23 representing oxygen concentration in atmospheric air it was assumed that there was no initial char and ash content during wildfires radiation is the primary heat transfer mechanism ahead of the flame front silvani and morandini 2009 morandini et al 2018 however inside the flaming region there is a mixed radiative convective environment where the relative contribution to total energy is dependent on fuel environment and gas velocity silvani and morandini 2009 tihay et al 2014 neglecting the convective fraction underestimates the heat flux into the soil but allows an understanding of how model parameters affect som decay thus in this model fire is represented as a radiative flux boundary condition at the soil surface q m t 3 determined by the wildfire or heat source temperature twf k as 19 q λ t z z 0 σ ε t w f 4 t z 0 4 where ε is the soil surface emissivity ε 0 95 an average from the equation obtained from massman 2012 this parametrization doesn t account for the distance between the heat source and soil surface because soil temperature data or heat flux in soils during wildfires is not well documented the lower boundary was set as a no flux boundary condition at a depth where heat flow does not affect soil temperature the model considers a uniform grid with a spacing of 5 mm for all simulations the time step was considered a product of the von neumann stability condition for diffusion dominated problems with dry soil neglecting the radiative term and a time step corrector which ranged from 0 01 to 0 001 2 2 comparison of thermal evolution the temperature evolution of the model was compared with experimental data from campbell et al 1995 as was undertaken with the campbell et al 1995 and massman 2012 2015 models in campbell et al 1995 soil temperature during experimentation was measured with copper constantan thermocouples at the soil surface and at 5 15 25 35 65 and 95 mm soil depth as the models from campbell et al 1995 and massman 2015 agree with experimental temperatures despite having different soil water content evolutions it is expected that accurate temperature evolution can be achieved without a fully representative soil water content evolution additionally this model does not intend to represent the detailed evaporation process during heating and as such soil water content was not compared in this study campbell et al 1995 heated eight soil samples with different soil classifications and soil water content the soil columns were heated with a propane fired infrared portable construction heater model mh14tc mr heater corp cleveland oh as the model incorporates the surface boundary condition in terms of the heat source temperature this temperature was adjusted to achieve similar soil surface temperatures the initial conditions were also set as uniform profiles as per the experiments the soil temperature evolution data was digitized from the digital version of the manuscript by campbell et al 1995 there was no data on the soil surface for experiment c from campbell et al 1995 so it was not included in the comparison table 1 summarizes the soil parameters to represent soils from campbell et al 1995 as the original research did not provide all the required model inputs the sand and clay contents the soil bulk density and the initial som values were obtained from buol et al 2011 for palouse b suliman et al 2017 for quincy sand sharratt 1990 for volkmar and the united stated department of agriculture usda national cooperative soil survey 2013 for bouldercreek although these soils only consider sand and silty loam soils they cover a wide soil water content and bulk density range 2 3 model parameters analysis 2 3 1 model inputs analyzed all model parameters were tested with values shown in table 2 for each soil texture to identify the main parameters affecting som decay wildfire temperatures were considered between 200 and 1000 c at intervals of 100 c and exposure times up to 6 h in table 2 model parameters are ordered in three classes soil description initial conditions and som combustion from the soil description to determine how variations of fsa and fcl within a soil texture affect the som decay the base condition was considered the centroid of the soil texture each case combines the standard deviations of fsa and fcl combinations that do not correspond to the analyzed texture were not considered furthermore to determine how different textures affect som decay each soil texture was contrasted based on its centroid the soil bulk density was considered from 0 8 to 1 6 g cm3 to account for various soil compactions as per the thermal evolution comparison the volumetric pore radius enhances model performance with values ranging between 1 0 to 2 0 mm thus this parameter was tested between 1 0 to 2 0 mm from the initial conditions two ranges were used for the initial soil water content the first range included the dry to saturated conditions and the second range was from permanent wilting point pwp to field capacity fc water contents within these ranges are expected values in the field being θ the average of the range initial som is considered from 0 to 8 initial soil temperature analysis considers a range from 20 to 40 c in terms of som combustion the oxygen availability analysis has two conditions restricted oxidation oxygen is consumed during oxidation and unrestricted oxidation no oxygen is consumed and remains constant over time also simulations for moss and forest peat from huang and rein 2016 were computed 2 3 2 model outputs the studied model outputs are listed in table 3 and include the temperature profile and variables related to the som profile the temperature profile evolution considered depths with temperatures greater than 60 c to avoid the computation of insignificant temperature variations the som profile evolution normalized with the initial som content was evaluated considering depths with a normalized som fraction less than 0 9 to avoid values where the profile was not altered table 3 also includes outputs to understand how the model parameters affect the soil depth at which som is entirely removed the topsoil som considering different depth layers and the depth at which the som is affected by the heat source the minimum and maximum outputs values in table 3 were obtained to evaluate the outputs variability for each model input these values were compared in a 1 1 line computing the determination coefficient r2 as r 1 r2 parameters with r 0 have no difference between the maximum and minimum value thus parameters with r 0 05 were considered influential for an output 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal evolution this section presents the results of simulations representing experiments from campbell et al 1995 the left column in fig 2 shows the measured values the simulated values neglecting the radiative term in soil thermal conductivity and the simulated values adjusting the volumetric pore radius to fit the data for comparison case 1 the middle column presents the measured data with the simulated data neglecting the soil thermal conductivity s radiative term the column on the right illustrates the comparison with the adjusted volumetric pore radius both columns considered the seven comparison cases the adjusted volumetric pore radius and r2 values are shown in table 4 the thermal evolution comparison showed that the model underestimates soil temperature moreover neglecting the radiative term in the soil thermal conductivity results in an r2 0 91 and adjusting the volumetric pore radius between 1 and 2 mm produces an r2 0 98 the main soil thermal evolution features were simulated for soils to compare with the campbell et al 1995 data for instance the model was able to predict the soil temperature evolution and agrees with a plateau near 100 c corresponding to the vaporization temperature this plateau is related to the high amount of heat consumed from the soil impeding to reach higher temperatures until the soil water content is very low the main differences between the experimental data and the simulations can be attributed to a underestimating the thermal conductivity model developed for ambient conditions and b overestimating the amount of heat absorbed during vaporization which prevents heat spreading however enhanced model performance for a higher volumetric pore radius is a consequence of increasing the radiative term of soil thermal conductivity at depths with high temperatures which compensates for underestimation of soil thermal conductivity 3 2 model parameters analysis fig 3 shows the results from model testing with the inputs listed in table 2 and their influence on the outputs presented in table 3 parameters with r 0 05 were considered influential on the output this figure shows that variations in bulk density initial temperature and fsa and fcl within a soil texture did not produce significant differences in the outputs on the other hand changes in the initial water content oxygen availability and soil texture led to substantial differences in all outputs however variations in the initial som volumetric pore radius between 1 and 2 mm and the peat type produced differences only at depth in which som was consumed entirely the results showed that som decay increased with the sand fraction and decreased with the clay fraction the temperature and som profiles for silty loamy and sandy soils are shown in fig 4 the differences between soil textures relate to the initial water content as this controls the amount of heat consumed during vaporization the base case for the initial water content was the average between the pwp and fc a value that is higher for silt than sandy soils in terms of soil bulk density high temperatures near the surface evaporate the water the near surface thermal conductivity was equivalent to the dry thermal conductivity which showed almost no difference when varying bulk density lu et al 2014 thus variations in soil bulk density do not produce significant effects in som decay although the volumetric pore radius enhanced the soil thermal conductivity at depths with high temperatures variations between 1 and 2 mm did not produce significant effects in som decay as the som content can reach a minimum value related to total consumption or restricted oxidation an enhancement of thermal conductivity at high temperatures increased the depth at which som was removed entirely fig 3 the initial water content variations between dry and saturated conditions greatly influence som decay however variations between pwp and fc had a low influence drier soils can reach high temperatures near the surface faster than wet soils because there is a reduced amount of water to vaporize and subsequently a lower heat consumption during vaporization fig 5 shows the initial water content effect in the thermal and som evolution in a sandy soil because of the high temperatures the highest som decay was predicted for dry soils as thermal conductivity in dry soil depends only on soil bulk density no differences among soil textures were found for the dry condition only dry soils showed som decay at 200 c for a simulated 6 h exposure fig 3 shows that the soil temperature and normalized som profile evolution was not affected by the initial som content which indicates that a proportional decay occurred for different initial som contents however because the som decay is proportional soils with a low initial som content will reach the consumption threshold 0 01 more rapidly fig 6 for example the fraction needed to achieve the threshold for an initial 10 of som is 0 001 while for an initial 1 som the fraction is 0 01 10 times larger than for the high initial condition thus the depth at which som is completely consumed is influenced by the initial som content fig 3 the initial soil temperature did not produce significant changes in model outputs the soil thermal evolution for depths with high temperatures was similar for all initial temperature conditions thus no significant variation in som decay was found for different initial soil temperatures fig 7 shows the soil temperature and som profile in a silty loamy and sandy soil with restricted and unrestricted oxidation when oxidation was not restricted the high enthalpy produced enough heat to spread a heating front deep in the soil as shown for the sand profile in fig 7 as silty soils have a higher base case for initial water content than sandy soils silty soils consume a significant amount of heat released by the oxidation reactions in contrast sandy soils consume a low amount of heat enabling the spreading of the heating front which leads to a chain reaction of oxidation and heating that accelerates the heating and decay front thus soils with higher water contents have fewer variations in the thermal profile when oxidation is not restricted when oxidation is restricted som decay is mainly induced by pyrolysis unlike oxidation this reaction is not strong enough to consume all som fig 8 shows the change in time for the depth at which som was consumed in a sandy clay loam soil with and without restricted oxidation abrupt decays in the figure were related to oxidation low decays to pyrolysis and constant depth to the heating of lower soil layers where temperatures were not enough to consume som soil temperature and som profiles were not affected by the peat type however fig 3 shows that peat type affects the depth at which som was consumed as an example fig 9 shows the depth at which som is consumed in a sandy soil with the two peat types used in this study as oxidation is restricted and the primary reaction is biomass pyrolysis and the reaction rate is more significant for moss peat than forest peat huang and rein 2016 in moss peat all the som is consumed 4 conclusions a numerical model was developed to describe the som decay during wildfires the model couples the energy balance for soil heating and species conservation for water content and som determined by high temperature induced vaporization and combustion kinetics the model does not consider fluid flow and variations in bulk density and its subsequent effects as water evaporation and condensation oxygen movement and soil shrinking the soil thermal conductivity considers thermal dependency by the inclusion of conduction of radiative energy through soil pores the model analysis demonstrates that the soil parameters that explained most som decay differences were soil texture initial soil water and som contents the model also showed significant differences in som decay when considering restricted or unrestricted oxidation som decay was also dependent on the fire temperature and exposure time in contrast soil bulk density initial temperature and the volumetric pore radius did not have a significant influence on som decay as oxidation was restricted the different peat types exhibited similar som decay levels as decay was mainly associated with pyrolysis the results show that variations in the sand and clay contents within a soil texture class do not affect som decay however increasing the sand fraction or decreasing the clay content to a change in the soil texture class increases som decay the initial soil water content played a role as a heat absorber preventing som decay it controls the amount of heat consumed during vaporization however when the initial value was between permanent wilting point and field capacity almost no difference was found in som decay conversely normalized som evolution was independent of the initial som content so the som decay was proportional for all initial som contents also unrestricted oxidation produced a chain reaction of combustion and heating due to the high enthalpy of the oxidative reactions even though the model excludes a physically based soil thermal conductivity model and water evaporation it provides a suitable representation of soil thermal evolution during extreme heating events thus the coupled thermal model with the parametrized biomass combustion offers a novel alternative representing the thermal evolution and som decay during wildfires a better understanding of the above ground fire dynamics and inclusion of fluid flow equations would lead to a better representation of the thermal boundary conditions and the oxidation processes in som combustion respectively enhancing the model representation

24636,wildfires are a critical phenomenon in terrestrial ecosystems and the intensity and frequency of these events have increased in recent years high temperatures in the topsoil during wildfires can induce changes in soil physical chemical and biological properties due to the loss of soil organic matter som therefore the main objective of this study was to develop a numerical model to predict som decay during wildfire events the model identifies the main parameters controlling som decay and predicts its decline by coupling the energy balance for soil heating and species conservation for water and som using high temperature induced vaporization and combustion kinetics fluid flow was not included however the radiative energy conducted through soil pores was incorporated as a volumetric pore radius function when the radiative term in the thermal conductivity was not considered the model predicted the soil thermal evolution with a determination coefficient r2 0 91 and with an r2 0 98 when the volumetric pore radius was adjusted the main parameters controlling som decay were soil texture oxygen availability and initial soil water and som contents som decay was also dependent on the wildfire temperature and exposure time in terms of soil texture som decay increases as sand increases or clay reduces the main results showed that the soil water content controlled the amount of heat consumed during vaporization the normalized som decay does not depend on the initial som content and the restricted oxidation limited som decay finally this study reduces the number of parameters when studying som decay and second order fire effects for post fire assessment and restoration also because it provides a better understanding of how wildfires affect som implemented as an additional routine the model can enhance other existing computer models for describing ecological processes keywords soil heating surface fire soil organic matter decay thermochemical approach wildfires 1 introduction wildfires are a common phenomenon in terrestrial ecosystems with increasing intensity and frequency in recent years bonilla et al 2014 bowman et al 2017 these extreme fire seasons are related to droughts and high temperature periods driven by climate change turco et al 2019 wildfires can be classified into three groups according to the fuel consumed crown fires surface fires and ground fires when trees and shrub burn it is classified as a crown fire whereas when litter and dead or living fuels at the ground surface burn mostly by flaming combustion it is named a surface fire when organic material under the litter layer burns primarily by smoldering combustion it is known as a ground fire although soil heating from crown fires is usually low substantial soil heating can be expected from long duration fires like surface and ground fires neary et al 2005 smoldering combustion peak temperatures range from 500 to 700 c while flaming combustion temperatures can rise to 1500 c drysdale 2004 however wildfires spread rate is highly variable ranging from 1 m h for smoldering fires to 1 km h for extreme fire behavior johnston et al 2018 on the other hand prescribed fires are those actively implemented for land management such as fuel reduction and ecological burn ryan et al 2013 grebner et al 2013 the objective of these fires is to reduce fire risk through a controlled burn of hazardous fuel and the last use fire when fires have been suppressed over long periods to restore the natural role of fire santín and doerr 2016 high temperatures in the topsoil during wildfires can affect soil physical chemical and biological properties including soil hydrology soil structure nutrient cycling ph cation exchange capacity microorganisms vegetation and soil organic matter som debano 1991 hungerford et al 1991 neary et al 2005 ekinci et al 2008 zavala et al 2014 araya et al 2016 2017 previous studies have shown that changes in many soil properties after high temperature occurrence relate to som loss neary et al 2005 araya et al 2016 2017 so ignition differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis are used for measuring the change in weight siewert 2004 fernández et al 2012 pallasser et al 2013 hoogsteen et al 2015 kristl et al 2016 these studies found that som decomposition occurred between 200 c and 550 c with peaks near 300 c 350 c and 400 c 450 c siewert 2004 pallasser et al 2013 kristl et al 2016 while som is not the only component lost at this temperature range it significantly correlates with thermogravimetric weight loss between 200 c and 550 c siewert 2004 hoogsteen et al 2015 derived guidelines for ignition conditions they studied loss on ignition for sandy and silt loam soils to determine temperatures at which som is completely removed and the effect of exposure time however it is not entirely understood the temperature duration relationship for partial som decay the effect of wildfires on som and the subsequent effects on soil properties is still unclear it is necessary to understand the changes induced in som during wildfires to identify potential areas of concern for post fire management practices zavala et al 2014 wieting et al 2017 additionally a better understanding of the organic matter consumption mechanisms enables its inclusion in combustion and heat transfer models allowing the replacement of empirical studies with these models neary et al 2005 several studies have developed models based on heat transfer theory to predict soil heating during wildfires campbell et al 1994 studied soil thermal conductivity during high temperatures based on the devries 1963 model incorporating its thermal dependency later campbell et al 1995 and massman 2012 2015 focused on soil heating models at high temperatures to study how the soil water content evolves during these events these models showed good agreement between simulated and experimental soil temperature and each version demonstrated improvements when modeling soil water content changes a more elaborated model for wildfire effects is the first order fire effects model fofem lutes 2020 this computer program couples above ground wildfire effects including tree mortality fuel consumption and smoke emissions and the massman 2015 soil heating model regardless of the advances these models do not account for high temperature induced som decay or combustion some models describing biomass combustion have been developed to understand the fuel combustion process huang and rein 2014 2016 2017 el houssami et al 2016 2018 some have focused on fuel beds grasslands and peat huang and rein 2014 2016 el houssami et al 2016 2018 while others have concentrated on wildfire spread and behavior morvan et al 2009 agranat and perminov 2020 huang and rein 2014 2016 focused on developing kinetics schemes and the parameters needed for modeling peat combustion at the matter 1 mg and bench 100 g scales these studies recommend using a four step kinetics scheme as an equilibrium of simplicity and accuracy to reproduce the material thermogravimetric experiment this four step model accounts for one pyrolysis and three oxidations to describe the biomass degradation at high temperatures peat is considered soil rich in dead organic matter and formed through the incomplete humification of various dead plants huang and rein 2016 as such peat may be considered representative of som as it consists of living soil fauna and microflora partially decomposed plant and animal residues and humic substances bot and benites 2005 therefore the objective of this study was to develop a model for a better understanding of how wildfires affect som and identify the main parameters controlling som decay a numerical model representing the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil heating and som decay during wildfires was built to address this objective the model was tested with different parameters and ranges to identify those more influential on som decay ultimately this study aims to provide a model to assess som decay during wildfires and assist when selecting the variables to describe in field or laboratory experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the model is a vertical one dimensional 1d model coupling the energy balance for soil heating and species conservation for water content and som determined by high temperature induced vaporization and combustion kinetics vaporization and som species decay are incorporated using the arrhenius type reaction the model doesn t consider fluid flow and variations in soil porosity and bulk density but includes radiative energy conducted through soil pores as a function of the volumetric pore radius the model simulates soil temperature water content som α and β char contents ash content and oxygen mass fraction the governing non linear equations are solved using a linearized fully implicit iterative scheme with the generalized thomas algorithm as described in patankar 1980 fig 1 shows a flowchart depicting the link between the model s different processes the equations and parameters related to these processes are described in the following sections 2 1 1 energy balance for soil heating the energy balance is expressed as follows 1 ρ s c s t t z λ t z k 1 k q k where t k is soil temperature t t is time z l

51 5 β 1 97 f s a 1 87 ρ b 1 36 f s a ρ b 0 95 6 α 0 67 f c l 0 24 this thermal conductivity model was selected to provide a robust model with few input variables the simplicity of the model allows dispensing the use of models to describe the vapor term due to latent heat in the apparent thermal conductivity of air where a water retention curve model needs incorporation as per the thermo dependent model developed by campbell et al 1994 the second term λrad incorporates the radiant energy conducted through soil pores at high temperatures this term was derived from a general analytical approach for heat conduction in porous media with a random distribution of spherical pores bauer 1993 and can be expressed as massman 2015 7 λ r a d 3 8 σ n 2 r p t 3 8 n 1 θ 3 θ s where σ m t 3 k 4 is the boltzmann constant n is the medium s index of refraction and rp l is the volumetric pore radius 2 1 2 som decay biomass pyrolyzes bp and oxidizes bo separately when heated in an oxidative atmosphere such as air producing α and β char respectively at higher temperatures 300 c these two chars oxidize αo and βo producing ash if som is considered biomass som combustion is described in the model by a four step kinetic scheme as recommended in huang and rein 2016 this four step kinetic scheme includes one pyrolysis and three oxidations as follows 9 som ν α b p α char ν g b p gas bp som ν

β o2 g and a represent α char β char oxygen gas and ash respectively and subscripts bp bo αo and βo represent the biomass pyrolysis biomass oxidation α oxidation and β oxidation reactions respectively each of these heterogeneous reactions may be described on a general mass basis as follows 10 a k j 1 n ν j k gas j ν b k b k j 1 n ν j k gas j where the subscript k refers to the corresponding reaction j refers to the corresponding gas phase species a and b are the condensed phase reactants and products respectively and νb ν and ν are the mass stoichiometric coefficient of the condensed

i t ω f i ω d i where m is mass m subscript i refers to the corresponding species and subscripts d and f refers to decay and formation respectively som is composed of living soil fauna and microflora partially decomposed plants and animal residues and humic substances bot and benites 2005 in contrast peat is considered soil rich in dead organic matter and is formed through the incomplete humification of various dead plants huang and rein 2016 peats from huang and rein 2016 were considered representative biomass for som as they have similar temperature ranges for thermal decomposition moreover the parameters to describe som were also obtained from this study 2 1 3 soil water content vaporization when soil is heated water vaporizes near 100 c a process expressed by a single dissociation step huang and rein 2016 where liquid water completely vaporizes into water vapor the water vaporization or soil drying rate is expressed by the arrhenius type reaction as follows 16 ω d

r ω d w water mass conservation neglecting fluid flow is computed as follows 18 m w t ω d w parameters to describe the water vaporization kinetic were adjusted to reflect rapid vaporization near 100 c this approach provides a simple vaporization model that enables heat consumption computing to get the thermal evolution at high temperatures 2 1 4 solution domain initial and boundary conditions considering the difficulties of measuring field values before a wildfire this model sets the initial conditions for soil temperature soil volumetric water content som and oxygen mass fraction as uniform profiles the initial oxygen mass fraction was set to yo2 0 23 representing oxygen concentration in atmospheric air it was assumed that there was no initial char and ash content during wildfires radiation is the primary heat transfer mechanism ahead of the flame front silvani and morandini 2009 morandini et al 2018 however inside the flaming region there is a mixed radiative convective environment where the relative contribution to total energy is dependent on fuel environment and gas velocity silvani and morandini 2009 tihay et al 2014 neglecting the convective fraction underestimates the heat flux into the soil but allows an understanding of how model parameters affect som decay thus in this model fire is represented as a radiative flux boundary condition at the soil surface q m t 3 determined by the wildfire or heat source temperature twf k as 19 q λ t z z 0 σ ε t w f 4 t z 0 4 where ε is the soil surface emissivity ε 0 95 an average from the equation obtained from massman 2012 this parametrization doesn t account for the distance between the heat source and soil surface because soil temperature data or heat flux in soils during wildfires is not well documented the lower boundary was set as a no flux boundary condition at a depth where heat flow does not affect soil temperature the model considers a uniform grid with a spacing of 5 mm for all simulations the time step was considered a product of the von neumann stability condition for diffusion dominated problems with dry soil neglecting the radiative term and a time step corrector which ranged from 0 01 to 0 001 2 2 comparison of thermal evolution the temperature evolution of the model was compared with experimental data from campbell et al 1995 as was undertaken with the campbell et al 1995 and massman 2012 2015 models in campbell et al 1995 soil temperature during experimentation was measured with copper constantan thermocouples at the soil surface and at 5 15 25 35 65 and 95 mm soil depth as the models from campbell et al 1995 and massman 2015 agree with experimental temperatures despite having different soil water content evolutions it is expected that accurate temperature evolution can be achieved without a fully representative soil water content evolution additionally this model does not intend to represent the detailed evaporation process during heating and as such soil water content was not compared in this study campbell et al 1995 heated eight soil samples with different soil classifications and soil water content the soil columns were heated with a propane fired infrared portable construction heater model mh14tc mr heater corp cleveland oh as the model incorporates the surface boundary condition in terms of the heat source temperature this temperature was adjusted to achieve similar soil surface temperatures the initial conditions were also set as uniform profiles as per the experiments the soil temperature evolution data was digitized from the digital version of the manuscript by campbell et al 1995 there was no data on the soil surface for experiment c from campbell et al 1995 so it was not included in the comparison table 1 summarizes the soil parameters to represent soils from campbell et al 1995 as the original research did not provide all the required model inputs the sand and clay contents the soil bulk density and the initial som values were obtained from buol et al 2011 for palouse b suliman et al 2017 for quincy sand sharratt 1990 for volkmar and the united stated department of agriculture usda national cooperative soil survey 2013 for bouldercreek although these soils only consider sand and silty loam soils they cover a wide soil water content and bulk density range 2 3 model parameters analysis 2 3 1 model inputs analyzed all model parameters were tested with values shown in table 2 for each soil texture to identify the main parameters affecting som decay wildfire temperatures were considered between 200 and 1000 c at intervals of 100 c and exposure times up to 6 h in table 2 model parameters are ordered in three classes soil description initial conditions and som combustion from the soil description to determine how variations of fsa and fcl within a soil texture affect the som decay the base condition was considered the centroid of the soil texture each case combines the standard deviations of fsa and fcl combinations that do not correspond to the analyzed texture were not considered furthermore to determine how different textures affect som decay each soil texture was contrasted based on its centroid the soil bulk density was considered from 0 8 to 1 6 g cm3 to account for various soil compactions as per the thermal evolution comparison the volumetric pore radius enhances model performance with values ranging between 1 0 to 2 0 mm thus this parameter was tested between 1 0 to 2 0 mm from the initial conditions two ranges were used for the initial soil water content the first range included the dry to saturated conditions and the second range was from permanent wilting point pwp to field capacity fc water contents within these ranges are expected values in the field being θ the average of the range initial som is considered from 0 to 8 initial soil temperature analysis considers a range from 20 to 40 c in terms of som combustion the oxygen availability analysis has two conditions restricted oxidation oxygen is consumed during oxidation and unrestricted oxidation no oxygen is consumed and remains constant over time also simulations for moss and forest peat from huang and rein 2016 were computed 2 3 2 model outputs the studied model outputs are listed in table 3 and include the temperature profile and variables related to the som profile the temperature profile evolution considered depths with temperatures greater than 60 c to avoid the computation of insignificant temperature variations the som profile evolution normalized with the initial som content was evaluated considering depths with a normalized som fraction less than 0 9 to avoid values where the profile was not altered table 3 also includes outputs to understand how the model parameters affect the soil depth at which som is entirely removed the topsoil som considering different depth layers and the depth at which the som is affected by the heat source the minimum and maximum outputs values in table 3 were obtained to evaluate the outputs variability for each model input these values were compared in a 1 1 line computing the determination coefficient r2 as r 1 r2 parameters with r 0 have no difference between the maximum and minimum value thus parameters with r 0 05 were considered influential for an output 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal evolution this section presents the results of simulations representing experiments from campbell et al 1995 the left column in fig 2 shows the measured values the simulated values neglecting the radiative term in soil thermal conductivity and the simulated values adjusting the volumetric pore radius to fit the data for comparison case 1 the middle column presents the measured data with the simulated data neglecting the soil thermal conductivity s radiative term the column on the right illustrates the comparison with the adjusted volumetric pore radius both columns considered the seven comparison cases the adjusted volumetric pore radius and r2 values are shown in table 4 the thermal evolution comparison showed that the model underestimates soil temperature moreover neglecting the radiative term in the soil thermal conductivity results in an r2 0 91 and adjusting the volumetric pore radius between 1 and 2 mm produces an r2 0 98 the main soil thermal evolution features were simulated for soils to compare with the campbell et al 1995 data for instance the model was able to predict the soil temperature evolution and agrees with a plateau near 100 c corresponding to the vaporization temperature this plateau is related to the high amount of heat consumed from the soil impeding to reach higher temperatures until the soil water content is very low the main differences between the experimental data and the simulations can be attributed to a underestimating the thermal conductivity model developed for ambient conditions and b overestimating the amount of heat absorbed during vaporization which prevents heat spreading however enhanced model performance for a higher volumetric pore radius is a consequence of increasing the radiative term of soil thermal conductivity at depths with high temperatures which compensates for underestimation of soil thermal conductivity 3 2 model parameters analysis fig 3 shows the results from model testing with the inputs listed in table 2 and their influence on the outputs presented in table 3 parameters with r 0 05 were considered influential on the output this figure shows that variations in bulk density initial temperature and fsa and fcl within a soil texture did not produce significant differences in the outputs on the other hand changes in the initial water content oxygen availability and soil texture led to substantial differences in all outputs however variations in the initial som volumetric pore radius between 1 and 2 mm and the peat type produced differences only at depth in which som was consumed entirely the results showed that som decay increased with the sand fraction and decreased with the clay fraction the temperature and som profiles for silty loamy and sandy soils are shown in fig 4 the differences between soil textures relate to the initial water content as this controls the amount of heat consumed during vaporization the base case for the initial water content was the average between the pwp and fc a value that is higher for silt than sandy soils in terms of soil bulk density high temperatures near the surface evaporate the water the near surface thermal conductivity was equivalent to the dry thermal conductivity which showed almost no difference when varying bulk density lu et al 2014 thus variations in soil bulk density do not produce significant effects in som decay although the volumetric pore radius enhanced the soil thermal conductivity at depths with high temperatures variations between 1 and 2 mm did not produce significant effects in som decay as the som content can reach a minimum value related to total consumption or restricted oxidation an enhancement of thermal conductivity at high temperatures increased the depth at which som was removed entirely fig 3 the initial water content variations between dry and saturated conditions greatly influence som decay however variations between pwp and fc had a low influence drier soils can reach high temperatures near the surface faster than wet soils because there is a reduced amount of water to vaporize and subsequently a lower heat consumption during vaporization fig 5 shows the initial water content effect in the thermal and som evolution in a sandy soil because of the high temperatures the highest som decay was predicted for dry soils as thermal conductivity in dry soil depends only on soil bulk density no differences among soil textures were found for the dry condition only dry soils showed som decay at 200 c for a simulated 6 h exposure fig 3 shows that the soil temperature and normalized som profile evolution was not affected by the initial som content which indicates that a proportional decay occurred for different initial som contents however because the som decay is proportional soils with a low initial som content will reach the consumption threshold 0 01 more rapidly fig 6 for example the fraction needed to achieve the threshold for an initial 10 of som is 0 001 while for an initial 1 som the fraction is 0 01 10 times larger than for the high initial condition thus the depth at which som is completely consumed is influenced by the initial som content fig 3 the initial soil temperature did not produce significant changes in model outputs the soil thermal evolution for depths with high temperatures was similar for all initial temperature conditions thus no significant variation in som decay was found for different initial soil temperatures fig 7 shows the soil temperature and som profile in a silty loamy and sandy soil with restricted and unrestricted oxidation when oxidation was not restricted the high enthalpy produced enough heat to spread a heating front deep in the soil as shown for the sand profile in fig 7 as silty soils have a higher base case for initial water content than sandy soils silty soils consume a significant amount of heat released by the oxidation reactions in contrast sandy soils consume a low amount of heat enabling the spreading of the heating front which leads to a chain reaction of oxidation and heating that accelerates the heating and decay front thus soils with higher water contents have fewer variations in the thermal profile when oxidation is not restricted when oxidation is restricted som decay is mainly induced by pyrolysis unlike oxidation this reaction is not strong enough to consume all som fig 8 shows the change in time for the depth at which som was consumed in a sandy clay loam soil with and without restricted oxidation abrupt decays in the figure were related to oxidation low decays to pyrolysis and constant depth to the heating of lower soil layers where temperatures were not enough to consume som soil temperature and som profiles were not affected by the peat type however fig 3 shows that peat type affects the depth at which som was consumed as an example fig 9 shows the depth at which som is consumed in a sandy soil with the two peat types used in this study as oxidation is restricted and the primary reaction is biomass pyrolysis and the reaction rate is more significant for moss peat than forest peat huang and rein 2016 in moss peat all the som is consumed 4 conclusions a numerical model was developed to describe the som decay during wildfires the model couples the energy balance for soil heating and species conservation for water content and som determined by high temperature induced vaporization and combustion kinetics the model does not consider fluid flow and variations in bulk density and its subsequent effects as water evaporation and condensation oxygen movement and soil shrinking the soil thermal conductivity considers thermal dependency by the inclusion of conduction of radiative energy through soil pores the model analysis demonstrates that the soil parameters that explained most som decay differences were soil texture initial soil water and som contents the model also showed significant differences in som decay when considering restricted or unrestricted oxidation som decay was also dependent on the fire temperature and exposure time in contrast soil bulk density initial temperature and the volumetric pore radius did not have a significant influence on som decay as oxidation was restricted the different peat types exhibited similar som decay levels as decay was mainly associated with pyrolysis the results show that variations in the sand and clay contents within a soil texture class do not affect som decay however increasing the sand fraction or decreasing the clay content to a change in the soil texture class increases som decay the initial soil water content played a role as a heat absorber preventing som decay it controls the amount of heat consumed during vaporization however when the initial value was between permanent wilting point and field capacity almost no difference was found in som decay conversely normalized som evolution was independent of the initial som content so the som decay was proportional for all initial som contents also unrestricted oxidation produced a chain reaction of combustion and heating due to the high enthalpy of the oxidative reactions even though the model excludes a physically based soil thermal conductivity model and water evaporation it provides a suitable representation of soil thermal evolution during extreme heating events thus the coupled thermal model with the parametrized biomass combustion offers a novel alternative representing the thermal evolution and som decay during wildfires a better understanding of the above ground fire dynamics and inclusion of fluid flow equations would lead to a better representation of the thermal boundary conditions and the oxidation processes in som combustion respectively enhancing the model representation

24637,baited remote underwater video systems bruvs have become an important and frequently used tool by resource managers to monitor relative abundances for a variety of marine species as with any abundance survey method fundamental assumptions of the technique are that counts derived from videos accurately reflect true changes to abundances while being robust to changes in density independent factors we tested these assumptions using a newly developed spatially explicit individual based simulation model for two of the most commonly used video survey metrics of relative abundance maxn and meancount simulating a 1 km2 area over a 60 min bruv deployment targeting elasmobranch species we evaluated how resulting estimates of each metric were influenced by swimming speed relative directness of movement patterns relative attraction strength to bait bait plume size and camera visibility range while shark density was held constant by simulating both standard 120 and full spherical fs 360 fields of view fov we were also able to explore if newly developed fs cameras could help reduce the impact of these density independent factors results from both generalized linear models and visual inspection of simulations indicated that density as well as non density related factors were highly significant in predicting camera counts regardless of the camera s fov or count metric used collectively these findings illustrate that video survey metrics are sensitive to factors unrelated to changes in density and researchers should carefully consider their potential influence on survey results as well as potential management decisions based on these data keywords individual based model video surveys spatial ecology simulation elasmobranchs 1 introduction the use of baited remote underwater video systems bruvs to study fish communities in the marine environment has dramatically increased over the last two decades cappo et al 2007 harvey et al 2013 whitmarsh et al 2017 the popularity of the method stems from its ease of use low cost minimal invasiveness and because of the insights into species behavior and habitat use that it provides bacheler et al 2013 klages et al 2014 roberts et al 2016 whitmarsh et al 2017 although there is no single accepted protocol bruvs generally involve deploying a camera mounted to a platform with an attached bait source for an extended period of time e g 60 mins cappo et al 2007 whitmarsh et al 2017 one critical assumption of this method is that individuals who come in contact with the bait plume will search for and encounter the bait source at some point during the deployment where they can be sampled by the camera cappo et al 2007 the non extractive property of bruvs makes them a preferred method to study many depleted species and populations but also presents unique challenges not found in fishing based surveys chiefly fishes have the potential to be observed multiple times in a single deployment and thus simply recording raw counts could artificially inflate abundance estimates cappo et al 2007 accordingly various methods have been developed to enumerate species observed on bruvs methods to quantify fishes from bruvs include time in time out tito time at first occurrence t1st meancount and maxn the tito metric is calculated by monitoring both the time of entry and exit for each animal observed on the bruv video data and is most commonly used for behavioral studies schobernd et al 2014 similarly t1st refers to the first time a species is observed on a video and can be used to get an idea of the distance the animal was from the bait source and or the strength of attraction to bait for that species campbell et al 2015 to monitor the relative abundance of species through time and space either meancount or maxn is typically employed campbell et al 2015 whitmarsh et al 2017 of these two maxn is the most commonly used method and is simply defined as the maximum number of individuals for a species of interest observed on any single video frame over the course of the deployment ellis and demartini 1995 by limiting counts to this conservative approach researchers prevent the possibility of counting the same individual multiple times meancount calculates a mean estimate of abundance over the duration of the bruv by averaging the counts for each species of interest at a specified sampling interval i e every 5 10 30 or 60 s bacheler et al 2013 schobernd et al 2014 campbell et al 2015 as with any survey index metrics of relative abundance derived from video data have a number of inherent biases however a distinct advantage of camera systems is these biases can be readily explored understanding acknowledging and mitigating these biases is essential for implementing video surveys and enabling the correct interpretation of survey results for assessment purposes in particular the relationship between the calculated metric and true changes to local population sizes aka density must be understood in fisheries this relationship is often assumed to be linear maunder and starr 2003 despite many indices exhibiting non linear relationships with the true abundance hilborn and walters 1992 erisman et al 2011 failing to understand these relationships can lead to hyperstability or hyperdepletion whereby survey metrics remain constant even as the actual abundance is changing meancount was developed in response to concerns that maxn had a non linear relationship with true abundance schobernd et al 2014 and has been shown through simulations and empirical data to reduce issues of non linearity under certain conditions schobernd et al 2014 campbell et al 2015 however this improved linearity was not observed for large elasmobranch species for which both maxn and meancount were shown to be ineffective at reflecting changes in abundance at high densities kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 these findings highlight that no single count method is consistently superior for all research purposes species or environments furthermore it is possible that these count methods are theoretically sound but are simply limited by the camera technology often employed for example advances in full spherical fs cameras have demonstrated that by increasing the observed field of view fov both maxn and meancount can maintain a linear relationship with true abundance across a wider range of localized densities campbell et al 2015 2018 kilfoil et al 2017 whitmarsh et al 2018 in addition to preserving a linear relationship with changes in abundance survey metrics must also be robust to fluctuations in factors independent of changes to local densities e g abiotic conditions if this relationship does not hold true for a chosen metric it becomes difficult to determine if changes detected by a survey are caused by true changes in species densities or are instead a byproduct of previously unconsidered variables although it is widely accepted that density independent factors such as swimming speed ward paige et al 2010 movement patterns watson et al 1995 fewster et al 2008 and environmental conditions gruss et al 2017 can influence survey metrics it is often assumed either implicitly or explicitly that these biases are negligible and or constant thus having a minimal impact on survey results further obscuring our understanding of the potential impacts of density independent factors on survey results is the inability of researchers to isolate the effects of any one variable this issue is problematic in both field and laboratory experiments and is particularly difficult for large bodied highly mobile species such as sharks given that bruvs are frequently used to study and inform management decisions for elasmobranch species e g bond et al 2012 goetze and fullwood 2013 murray et al 2019 winter and de graaf 2019 there remains a need to understand how density independent factors may influence metrics of relative abundance for this group accordingly we explored these questions within a simulated spatially explicit individual based modeling approach specifically our objectives were to determine how density independent factors including swimming speed directness of movement patterns species attraction strength to bait bait plume size and visibility influence estimates of maxn and meancount for bruvs moreover we explored how these relationships varied between standard and fs cameras although we limited the scope of our study to elasmobranch species the results have broad applications to bruvs and other underwater video surveys used to gather fisheries independent data 2 methods to simulate a bruv survey aimed at enumerating elasmobranchs we constructed an individual based model ibm within the r core environment r core team 2018 for simplicity our ibm simulation represented a featureless two dimensional space having an origin in the lower left quadrant 0 0 x y and an upper bound of 1000 for each axis representing a 1 km2 area every simulation occurred in discrete time steps representing one second intervals and was comprised of three primary components bait plume shark movement and camera detection field 2 1 bait plume to generate bait plumes in our two dimensional space we used a simple bait odor particle dispersal model developed by vabø et al 2004 following this general procedure an odor source was placed one meter down current of the center of the study site 501 500 x y with a large number of initial odor particles s 0 randomly placed within a small region 645cm2 representing a bait bag bb at this location at each time step the leaching rate λ determined how many particles were released from the bb using the equation s t s 0 1 λ t where s t represents the amount of odor particles remaining in the bb at time step t these released odor particles o p then moved through the simulated space based on their previous xy position a current vector u which was assumed to be constant throughout the study region and a small degree of diffusion with random movement specifically at any time step the xy position of each particle o p x t and o p y t respectively was defined by the equations o p x t o p x t 1 u x d d f o p y t o p y t 1 u y d d f where d denotes a random error with a uniform distribution between a positive and negative displacement parameter d s p and d f represents a constant diffusion rate this process was repeated for 300 time steps representing a burn in period for bruv surveys whereby researchers do not review footage this burn in period is typically used to allow for sediment to resettle the fov to clear and to reduce the impact of potential attraction or avoidance behaviors of fishes to the platform although rarely considered it is also likely that during this time the gear affected area of the bruv defined as the size of the bait plume has its largest variation as the bait disperses through the water column the current vector direction was set to be held constant for all simulation runs and by varying the speed of the current we were able to generate bait plumes of varying sizes and shapes odor particle point data were then smoothed at the end of the burn in to give a realistic odor gradient by converting to raster data using a high bandwidth bandwidth 15 kernel density estimation procedure in the kernsmooth package wand 2015 these resulting raster data were then rescaled with the highest value equal to one and the total number of raster cells containing positive odor particle values used to calculate bait plume sizes fig 1 2 2 shark movement swimming behaviors for simulated sharks were also modelled using an individual based approach each simulated shark s movement properties and behavioral rules were tracked and generally defined in relation to common foraging strategies i e scavenging whereby each simulated shark had a total length of one meter at the initial time step t 0 a total number of sharks nsharks were randomly populated within the study region and given a random heading from 0 360 the number of sharks was held constant throughout the simulation and was set to 10 for baseline conditions see simulation scenarios below at each time step every shark determined the odor particle concentration of the raster cell associated with its xy location which was used to assign the shark to one of four behavioral states plume search bait search near bait or bait found each behavioral state had its own set of rules that determined how each shark moved by influencing their selected step length a k a distance moved and heading choice plume search behavior was assigned when the shark had yet to detect any odor particles within its current cell under plume search behavior the shark selects a step length from a normal distribution defined by a mean μ s p e e d and variance σ s p e e d 2 to avoid biologically unrealistic step lengths a maximum step length of 7 m and a minimum of 0 m was set for each time step these values cover a range of speeds for a number of shark species including bull sharks carcharhinus leucas with a burst swimming speed of 5 3m s 1 gray 1971 nurse sharks ginglymostoma cirratum that often rest on the sea floor and thus average swimming speeds of 0m s 1 over long durations webb and keyes 1982 to bonnethead sphryna tiburo at 0 65 m s 1 lowe 1996 and lemon sharks carcharhinus brevirostris at 0 72 m s 1 graham et al 1990 however this range does not cover the maximum speed of all shark species such as the shortfin mako isurus oxyrinchus which has reported sustained speeds of up to 22 m s in the wild 80km hr 1 holts and bedford 1993 its heading options were then limited to any three cells in front of their current heading representing a range of 45 0 or 45 with an equal probability of selection initially assumed which falls within observed ranges for reef sharks ward paige et al 2010 however the probability of selecting its current heading was then multiplied by a directionality strength parameter d s which varied from 1 5 where 1 would indicate no directness of movements while 5 would be considered a highly directed movement pattern as it was 5x more likely to move in the same direction than to choose a neighboring cell all sharks were also assigned a spatial memory of their last 25 time steps whereby a shark would not select a cell within this list if a shark detected an odor particle concentration of greater than zero within its raster cell it moved from plume search to bait search behavior and would not re enter plume search behavior for the remainder of the simulation while in bait search a shark s step length was selected from the same normal distribution as defined in plume search but with its mean parameter doubled to simulate an excited response to bait by increasing swimming speed this procedure is similar to other simulations that have modeled the response behavior of fishes to bait e g vabø et al 2004 its heading options were again restricted to its previous heading or either adjacent cell with an assumed equal probability of selection for each however the odor values for each potential heading were evaluated by the shark prior to selection with the highest having its probability of selection multiplied by an attraction strength parameter a that could vary from 1 5 if however this value was less than 95 of the shark s current cell value across a smoothed raster surface the shark would then determine that it was likely moving away from the source of the bait and instead picked a random heading in another direction i e 90 135 180 225 or 270 relative to current heading if the shark moved to a raster cell adjacent to the bb its movements were governed by near bait behavioral rules these movement rules were very similar to bait search behavior but reduced the mean value defining the step length distribution to half of its initial value thus slowing the sharks down by roughly half as they approached the bait source determined from personal observations of sharks interacting with bait bag from bruv footage lastly if a shark was in contact with b b meaning in the same raster cell its movements were then governed by bait found behavioral rules the rules governing this behavior were very similar to the previously described near bait behavior the shark used the same step length distribution and heading selection rules but had a 50 probability of implementing its chosen step length and a 50 probability of selecting a step length of 0 instead thus remaining in contact with the bait in addition to these behavioral types shark movements were dictated by a set of rules which were held throughout the simulation to maintain a constant shark density throughout the simulation the study site was set up as a closed system meaning sharks could not go outside the x and y axis bounds if a shark s selected heading and step length did go outside these bounds the shark instead choose a random heading that did not go outside the study region secondly each raster cell had a maximum of 4 sharks allowed at any time step in its represented 1 m2 area if sharks movements resulted in having more than 4 individuals in any one raster n sharks were randomly selected to move into adjacent cells n n 4 where n is the total number of sharks found in the cell at the beginning of the time step allowing for sharks to displace one another the resulting shark tracks generated by the ibm fig 2 were then visually compared to shark tracks gathered in previous empirical heithaus et al 2002 and simulation ward paige et al 2010 studies to verify if the movement patterns were biologically realistic 2 3 camera detection field for each simulation we modeled a bruv deployment with two simultaneous camera recording systems the first camera assumed a 120 fov referred to as standard camera while the second assumed 360 referred to as full spherical fs cameras were fixed at the center of the study area 500 500 for the duration of the simulation cameras were oriented in the same direction as the current vector for each simulated deployment both cameras were assigned two visibility parameters fig 3 the first lower visibility l v defined the distance meters within which a camera could detect a shark 100 of the time given the shark was within the camera s fov the second upper visibility u v was set to 1 5 l v and defined the distance behind which sharks could not be detected by the cameras a linear decline in detection probability was assumed between l v and u v resulting in steeper declines in detection rates for lower visibility environments to simulate the cameras shooting at 30 frames per second shark movements between time steps 1 s were broken into 30 equal segments with the median of the positive detection probabilities from these segments selected to represent the detection probability over that 1 s interval if a shark was detected within a camera s fov it cast a 5 visual shadow behind which subsequent sharks could not be detected by the camera for each simulation run the number of sharks detected by each camera type was reported at every time step 2 4 simulation scenarios and analyses to determine the influence of density and density independent factors on maxn and meancount estimates 6 variables were considered these variables included aspects of shark behavior swimming speed attraction strength to bait directness of movement patterns environmental conditions visibility bait plume size and density to test the individual effects of each of these factors a simulation scenario was established for each where the variable of interest varied over a range of biologically acceptable values e g burst swimming for carcharhinus leucas of 5 3 m s 1 gray 1971 while all other parameters were held constant table 1 each scenario was run for 3600 time steps representing a 60 min deployment and replicated 1000 times for each simulation run the estimated maxn and meancount using a 10 s sampling interval were noted for each camera the resulting metric estimates were then plotted against the simulated parameter to visually explore the effects of changing parameter values on resulting bruv counts lastly a simulation scenario was conducted where all parameter values were allowed to vary between their lower and upper bounds and was replicated 1000 times from this scenario output we created a generalized linear model glm trying a variety of appropriate distributions i e poisson gamma negative binomial tweedie with video survey metrics of relative abundance for each camera type modeled using all factors as predictor variables allowing for main effects from these the best model was selected using aic with the mass package stepaic function venables and ripley 2002 3 results a total of 7000 simulation runs were conducted consisting of 1000 runs for each simulation scenario the baseline run whereby density was varied from 1 50 sharks while all other parameter values were held constant indicated that our simulated bruvs were capable of detecting changes in localized abundance for fs cameras both maxn and meancount demonstrated a linear relationship with site abundance fig 4 in contrast maxn estimates from standard cameras had an apparent change in slope after the number of sharks exceeded 10 fig 4 similar to previous empirical work i e kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 however this trend did not occur for meancount estimates on the standard camera when density is held constant the null assumption often made by researchers is that the influence of density independent factors would be negligible or constant over a wide range of parameter values in contrast to this null expectation nearly all of the tested variables strongly influenced metric estimates regardless of the camera type or metric used more importantly their influence on resulting count estimates was not constant over a range of their respective values fig 4 with the exception of plume size which had no apparent impact on maxn or meancount estimates all density independent factors had an apparent positive relationship with metric estimates whereby an increase in a parameter value resulted in an increase in count estimates even though simulated densities were held constant at 10 sharks the glm was parameterized with a number of different error distributions but ultimately poisson and gamma were deemed most appropriate for maxn and meancount estimation respectively regardless of camera type the results of each glm indicated that while density was the most influential factor in predicting metric values all density independent factors were also found to be highly significant p 0 001 fig 5 furthermore the estimated coefficient of each parameter standardized by their means was similar regardless of the camera fov but differed in their magnitude between count metrics e g visibility fig 5 for maxn speed visibility and attraction strength to bait all appeared to have similar estimated coefficients followed by directionality and plume size for meancount estimates visibility and attraction strength to bait appeared to have the greatest influence among density independent factors while speed directionality and plume size were less influential fig 5 4 discussion the results of the present study quantified the potential influence of environmental factors and aspects of species behavior for two of the most widely used video survey metrics of relative abundance meancount and maxn overall our simulations highlighted that factors other than changes in localized abundance can significantly impact video survey results and that their relative influence is dictated both by the chosen count metric and the camera s fov visibility had a strong influence on counts derived from video data particularly for meancount estimates suggesting that if not accounted for differences in visibility may lead to decreased precision and misinterpretation of bruv survey results unaccounted for changes in visibility over a bruv deployment could be considered the fishing based survey equivalent of using a net that is constantly changing size unbeknownst to the surveyor this results in a non constant survey catchability coefficient which violates the base assumption often used to create indices of abundance derived from survey data rago 2004 researchers should therefore make it standard practice to quantify the approximate visibility range over the survey period e g examining water clarity visibility via secchi disk or transmissivity turbidity sensors or ideally quantifying how visibility changes over the course of the bruv deployment using stereo camera systems in addition to visibility swimming speed significantly influenced shark count estimates from our simulated bruv deployments this is in agreement with previous research which found that highly mobile fishes are over counted in underwater visual censuses ward paige et al 2010 given that speed is highly correlated with the size age of elasmobranchs this pattern could lead to inaccurate estimates of population size age structures whereby juveniles have a lower probability of being sampled than adults furthermore similar issues could arise if researchers attempt to compare species with differing speeds mobility and behavioral patterns in habitat use species specific movement characteristics could skew relative abundance data derived from bruv surveys whereby faster more mobile species appear more abundant and could overstate their contribution to the overall community structure these same issues apply when trying to compare individuals or species which differ in their relative attraction towards the bait which our simulation found to positively bias bruv counts attraction towards bait is known to vary by the amount of bait used as well as the type of bait selected dorman et al 2012 and has been shown to be species specific harvey et al 2007 sharks differ in the size and morphology of their olfactory bulbs zeiske et al 1987 meredith and kajiura 2010 yopak et al 2015 and thus likely differ in their relative attraction and ability to detect odor particles that are dispersed during bruv deployments lastly in line with previous simulation work which has shown that the directness of shark movements can influence visual survey count estimates ward paige et al 2010 we found a significant positive effect on counts as directness of movements increased the turning angle of sharks can vary greatly depending on diving behavior andrzejaczek et al 2018 as well as between species and across spatial scales papastamatiou et al 2011 accordingly researchers should carefully consider how such behavioral characteristics of sharks may influence bruv survey results the popularity of maxn and meancount as metrics of relative abundance is likely because of their ease of use relatively short processing times ability to compare results to previously published literature using the same techniques and prevention of double counting individuals which could otherwise artificially inflate estimates willis and babcock 2000 cappo 2010 however to be a viable means for monitoring populations estimates must not only be conservative but ideally maintain a linear relationship with true abundance or at the very least have this relationship be clearly understood previous research using simulations and empirical data have indicated that this assumption is likely violated under certain conditions for either maxn campbell et al 2015 kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 or meancount kilfoil et al 2017 reasons for this divergence from linearity are not well understood but could be caused by species exhibiting non uniform spatial distribution around bruvs campbell et al 2015 or saturation of the camera under high densities kilfoil et al 2017 not surprisingly researchers have found that by increasing the camera fov used in video surveys both maxn and meancount can preserve a linear relationship with true abundance over a wider range of values campbell et al 2015 2018 kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 whitmarsh et al 2018 our simulation results support these previous findings with maxn estimates deviating from linearity as local abundance increases when using the standard view camera however it should be noted that the deviation from linearity was only observed under simulations with high densities approximately 10 sharks km2 and thus may not be of concern if those levels are not realized in situ e g territorial species or low density areas species though densities exceeding this threshold do occur particularly in protected coral systems e g kilfoil et al 2017 a recent global assessment of reef sharks using bruvs found that the vast majority of deployments did not exceed a maxn of 8 sharks macneil et al 2020 by increasing the simulated fov to mimic newly developed full spherical fs cameras both metrics proved capable of maintaining a linear relationship with true abundance unfortunately this advantage for fs cameras did not extend to reducing the influence of density independent factors on metric estimates meancount and maxn estimates from both fs and standard cameras were highly sensitive to changes in factors other than density including swimming speed attraction to bait directness of movements and distance at which you can positively identify fish from camera footage camera visibility range as with any simulation our ibm attempted to simplify inherently complex biological and ecological processes to improve our understanding of how these factors may interact in situ though relatively simple additional complexities could be integrated into our model depending on the research questions one wishes to answer though not the intended focus of the present study future iterations could explore how results may vary under different models of species movement patterns e g levy vs correlated random walks additional sources of attraction e g visual acoustic predatory strategies e g lie and wait vs roving predators interactions effects between density independent variables and density and added complexities to the simulation s spatial structure e g incorporating habitat complexity given the two dimensional structure of the simulation presented here future efforts should also explore how these factors may interact if a third dimension is added particularly focusing on the potential benefits of full spherical cameras to capture sharks distributing themselves vertically in the water column furthermore though the aim of this paper was to cover a potential set of parameter values for a wide range of shark species researchers could use this simulation framework and restrict parameter values to test similar questions focusing on specific species or environments this may be further refined by using stereo camera footage of similar species and environments to extract reasonable parameter ranges for bait approach behaviors swimming speeds or track tortuosity additionally further efforts should explore the potential influence of bait plume size on survey metrics and animal behavioral responses interestingly our simulation results indicated that bait plume size had a relatively small but significant negative impact on estimates of relative abundance this is in contrast to previous studies harvey et al 2007 heagney et al 2007 bernard and gotz 2012 dorman et al 2012 and may be caused by the closed system structure of our ibm or the behavioral rules imposed on simulated sharks by restricting the survey to a 1 km2 area it is possible that the effects of relatively large bait plumes are dampened since their greatest impact may be caused by attracting sharks from farther away than this limit though not considered by our simulations the effects of bait plume size are further complicated in the real world as plume size can change over the course of the bruv deployments and may have a diminished ability to attract species over time however previous studies have found that using bait can increase video survey precision while also more effectively surveying the entire fish community particularly for large carnivorous species bernard and gotz 2012 therefore researchers should carefully consider the potential benefits as well as the potential biases that may be introduced by using bait when choosing a survey approach overall our simulation study indicates that density independent factors can significantly skew metrics of relative abundance derived from video data given that bruvs are frequently used by resource managers to monitor populations trends barord et al 2014 gain insights on species richness mallet and pelletier 2014 andradi brown et al 2016 and to evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas sanguinetti 2013 bond et al 2012 it is critical that researchers understand how their survey results may be impacted by factors other than density baited remote underwater video systems are still a viable survey method capable of detecting and tracking changes to local population sizes with minimal impact on the animals and habitats in which they are employed however until more robust metrics of relative abundance are developed and tested or the biases of current metrics are further explored and accounted for researchers must carefully evaluate if differences observed in video data are driven by differences in population size or some other unrelated factors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

24637,baited remote underwater video systems bruvs have become an important and frequently used tool by resource managers to monitor relative abundances for a variety of marine species as with any abundance survey method fundamental assumptions of the technique are that counts derived from videos accurately reflect true changes to abundances while being robust to changes in density independent factors we tested these assumptions using a newly developed spatially explicit individual based simulation model for two of the most commonly used video survey metrics of relative abundance maxn and meancount simulating a 1 km2 area over a 60 min bruv deployment targeting elasmobranch species we evaluated how resulting estimates of each metric were influenced by swimming speed relative directness of movement patterns relative attraction strength to bait bait plume size and camera visibility range while shark density was held constant by simulating both standard 120 and full spherical fs 360 fields of view fov we were also able to explore if newly developed fs cameras could help reduce the impact of these density independent factors results from both generalized linear models and visual inspection of simulations indicated that density as well as non density related factors were highly significant in predicting camera counts regardless of the camera s fov or count metric used collectively these findings illustrate that video survey metrics are sensitive to factors unrelated to changes in density and researchers should carefully consider their potential influence on survey results as well as potential management decisions based on these data keywords individual based model video surveys spatial ecology simulation elasmobranchs 1 introduction the use of baited remote underwater video systems bruvs to study fish communities in the marine environment has dramatically increased over the last two decades cappo et al 2007 harvey et al 2013 whitmarsh et al 2017 the popularity of the method stems from its ease of use low cost minimal invasiveness and because of the insights into species behavior and habitat use that it provides bacheler et al 2013 klages et al 2014 roberts et al 2016 whitmarsh et al 2017 although there is no single accepted protocol bruvs generally involve deploying a camera mounted to a platform with an attached bait source for an extended period of time e g 60 mins cappo et al 2007 whitmarsh et al 2017 one critical assumption of this method is that individuals who come in contact with the bait plume will search for and encounter the bait source at some point during the deployment where they can be sampled by the camera cappo et al 2007 the non extractive property of bruvs makes them a preferred method to study many depleted species and populations but also presents unique challenges not found in fishing based surveys chiefly fishes have the potential to be observed multiple times in a single deployment and thus simply recording raw counts could artificially inflate abundance estimates cappo et al 2007 accordingly various methods have been developed to enumerate species observed on bruvs methods to quantify fishes from bruvs include time in time out tito time at first occurrence t1st meancount and maxn the tito metric is calculated by monitoring both the time of entry and exit for each animal observed on the bruv video data and is most commonly used for behavioral studies schobernd et al 2014 similarly t1st refers to the first time a species is observed on a video and can be used to get an idea of the distance the animal was from the bait source and or the strength of attraction to bait for that species campbell et al 2015 to monitor the relative abundance of species through time and space either meancount or maxn is typically employed campbell et al 2015 whitmarsh et al 2017 of these two maxn is the most commonly used method and is simply defined as the maximum number of individuals for a species of interest observed on any single video frame over the course of the deployment ellis and demartini 1995 by limiting counts to this conservative approach researchers prevent the possibility of counting the same individual multiple times meancount calculates a mean estimate of abundance over the duration of the bruv by averaging the counts for each species of interest at a specified sampling interval i e every 5 10 30 or 60 s bacheler et al 2013 schobernd et al 2014 campbell et al 2015 as with any survey index metrics of relative abundance derived from video data have a number of inherent biases however a distinct advantage of camera systems is these biases can be readily explored understanding acknowledging and mitigating these biases is essential for implementing video surveys and enabling the correct interpretation of survey results for assessment purposes in particular the relationship between the calculated metric and true changes to local population sizes aka density must be understood in fisheries this relationship is often assumed to be linear maunder and starr 2003 despite many indices exhibiting non linear relationships with the true abundance hilborn and walters 1992 erisman et al 2011 failing to understand these relationships can lead to hyperstability or hyperdepletion whereby survey metrics remain constant even as the actual abundance is changing meancount was developed in response to concerns that maxn had a non linear relationship with true abundance schobernd et al 2014 and has been shown through simulations and empirical data to reduce issues of non linearity under certain conditions schobernd et al 2014 campbell et al 2015 however this improved linearity was not observed for large elasmobranch species for which both maxn and meancount were shown to be ineffective at reflecting changes in abundance at high densities kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 these findings highlight that no single count method is consistently superior for all research purposes species or environments furthermore it is possible that these count methods are theoretically sound but are simply limited by the camera technology often employed for example advances in full spherical fs cameras have demonstrated that by increasing the observed field of view fov both maxn and meancount can maintain a linear relationship with true abundance across a wider range of localized densities campbell et al 2015 2018 kilfoil et al 2017 whitmarsh et al 2018 in addition to preserving a linear relationship with changes in abundance survey metrics must also be robust to fluctuations in factors independent of changes to local densities e g abiotic conditions if this relationship does not hold true for a chosen metric it becomes difficult to determine if changes detected by a survey are caused by true changes in species densities or are instead a byproduct of previously unconsidered variables although it is widely accepted that density independent factors such as swimming speed ward paige et al 2010 movement patterns watson et al 1995 fewster et al 2008 and environmental conditions gruss et al 2017 can influence survey metrics it is often assumed either implicitly or explicitly that these biases are negligible and or constant thus having a minimal impact on survey results further obscuring our understanding of the potential impacts of density independent factors on survey results is the inability of researchers to isolate the effects of any one variable this issue is problematic in both field and laboratory experiments and is particularly difficult for large bodied highly mobile species such as sharks given that bruvs are frequently used to study and inform management decisions for elasmobranch species e g bond et al 2012 goetze and fullwood 2013 murray et al 2019 winter and de graaf 2019 there remains a need to understand how density independent factors may influence metrics of relative abundance for this group accordingly we explored these questions within a simulated spatially explicit individual based modeling approach specifically our objectives were to determine how density independent factors including swimming speed directness of movement patterns species attraction strength to bait bait plume size and visibility influence estimates of maxn and meancount for bruvs moreover we explored how these relationships varied between standard and fs cameras although we limited the scope of our study to elasmobranch species the results have broad applications to bruvs and other underwater video surveys used to gather fisheries independent data 2 methods to simulate a bruv survey aimed at enumerating elasmobranchs we constructed an individual based model ibm within the r core environment r core team 2018 for simplicity our ibm simulation represented a featureless two dimensional space having an origin in the lower left quadrant 0 0 x y and an upper bound of 1000 for each axis representing a 1 km2 area every simulation occurred in discrete time steps representing one second intervals and was comprised of three primary components bait plume shark movement and camera detection field 2 1 bait plume to generate bait plumes in our two dimensional space we used a simple bait odor particle dispersal model developed by vabø et al 2004 following this general procedure an odor source was placed one meter down current of the center of the study site 501 500 x y with a large number of initial odor particles s 0 randomly placed within a small region 645cm2 representing a bait bag bb at this location at each time step the leaching rate λ determined how many particles were released from the bb using the equation s t s 0 1 λ t where s t represents the amount of odor particles remaining in the bb at time step t these released odor particles o p then moved through the simulated space based on their previous xy position a current vector u which was assumed to be constant throughout the study region and a small degree of diffusion with random movement specifically at any time step the xy position of each particle o p x t and o p y t respectively was defined by the equations o p x t o p x t 1 u x d d f o p y t o p y t 1 u y d d f where d denotes a random error with a uniform distribution between a positive and negative displacement parameter d s p and d f represents a constant diffusion rate this process was repeated for 300 time steps representing a burn in period for bruv surveys whereby researchers do not review footage this burn in period is typically used to allow for sediment to resettle the fov to clear and to reduce the impact of potential attraction or avoidance behaviors of fishes to the platform although rarely considered it is also likely that during this time the gear affected area of the bruv defined as the size of the bait plume has its largest variation as the bait disperses through the water column the current vector direction was set to be held constant for all simulation runs and by varying the speed of the current we were able to generate bait plumes of varying sizes and shapes odor particle point data were then smoothed at the end of the burn in to give a realistic odor gradient by converting to raster data using a high bandwidth bandwidth 15 kernel density estimation procedure in the kernsmooth package wand 2015 these resulting raster data were then rescaled with the highest value equal to one and the total number of raster cells containing positive odor particle values used to calculate bait plume sizes fig 1 2 2 shark movement swimming behaviors for simulated sharks were also modelled using an individual based approach each simulated shark s movement properties and behavioral rules were tracked and generally defined in relation to common foraging strategies i e scavenging whereby each simulated shark had a total length of one meter at the initial time step t 0 a total number of sharks nsharks were randomly populated within the study region and given a random heading from 0 360 the number of sharks was held constant throughout the simulation and was set to 10 for baseline conditions see simulation scenarios below at each time step every shark determined the odor particle concentration of the raster cell associated with its xy location which was used to assign the shark to one of four behavioral states plume search bait search near bait or bait found each behavioral state had its own set of rules that determined how each shark moved by influencing their selected step length a k a distance moved and heading choice plume search behavior was assigned when the shark had yet to detect any odor particles within its current cell under plume search behavior the shark selects a step length from a normal distribution defined by a mean μ s p e e d and variance σ s p e e d 2 to avoid biologically unrealistic step lengths a maximum step length of 7 m and a minimum of 0 m was set for each time step these values cover a range of speeds for a number of shark species including bull sharks carcharhinus leucas with a burst swimming speed of 5 3m s 1 gray 1971 nurse sharks ginglymostoma cirratum that often rest on the sea floor and thus average swimming speeds of 0m s 1 over long durations webb and keyes 1982 to bonnethead sphryna tiburo at 0 65 m s 1 lowe 1996 and lemon sharks carcharhinus brevirostris at 0 72 m s 1 graham et al 1990 however this range does not cover the maximum speed of all shark species such as the shortfin mako isurus oxyrinchus which has reported sustained speeds of up to 22 m s in the wild 80km hr 1 holts and bedford 1993 its heading options were then limited to any three cells in front of their current heading representing a range of 45 0 or 45 with an equal probability of selection initially assumed which falls within observed ranges for reef sharks ward paige et al 2010 however the probability of selecting its current heading was then multiplied by a directionality strength parameter d s which varied from 1 5 where 1 would indicate no directness of movements while 5 would be considered a highly directed movement pattern as it was 5x more likely to move in the same direction than to choose a neighboring cell all sharks were also assigned a spatial memory of their last 25 time steps whereby a shark would not select a cell within this list if a shark detected an odor particle concentration of greater than zero within its raster cell it moved from plume search to bait search behavior and would not re enter plume search behavior for the remainder of the simulation while in bait search a shark s step length was selected from the same normal distribution as defined in plume search but with its mean parameter doubled to simulate an excited response to bait by increasing swimming speed this procedure is similar to other simulations that have modeled the response behavior of fishes to bait e g vabø et al 2004 its heading options were again restricted to its previous heading or either adjacent cell with an assumed equal probability of selection for each however the odor values for each potential heading were evaluated by the shark prior to selection with the highest having its probability of selection multiplied by an attraction strength parameter a that could vary from 1 5 if however this value was less than 95 of the shark s current cell value across a smoothed raster surface the shark would then determine that it was likely moving away from the source of the bait and instead picked a random heading in another direction i e 90 135 180 225 or 270 relative to current heading if the shark moved to a raster cell adjacent to the bb its movements were governed by near bait behavioral rules these movement rules were very similar to bait search behavior but reduced the mean value defining the step length distribution to half of its initial value thus slowing the sharks down by roughly half as they approached the bait source determined from personal observations of sharks interacting with bait bag from bruv footage lastly if a shark was in contact with b b meaning in the same raster cell its movements were then governed by bait found behavioral rules the rules governing this behavior were very similar to the previously described near bait behavior the shark used the same step length distribution and heading selection rules but had a 50 probability of implementing its chosen step length and a 50 probability of selecting a step length of 0 instead thus remaining in contact with the bait in addition to these behavioral types shark movements were dictated by a set of rules which were held throughout the simulation to maintain a constant shark density throughout the simulation the study site was set up as a closed system meaning sharks could not go outside the x and y axis bounds if a shark s selected heading and step length did go outside these bounds the shark instead choose a random heading that did not go outside the study region secondly each raster cell had a maximum of 4 sharks allowed at any time step in its represented 1 m2 area if sharks movements resulted in having more than 4 individuals in any one raster n sharks were randomly selected to move into adjacent cells n n 4 where n is the total number of sharks found in the cell at the beginning of the time step allowing for sharks to displace one another the resulting shark tracks generated by the ibm fig 2 were then visually compared to shark tracks gathered in previous empirical heithaus et al 2002 and simulation ward paige et al 2010 studies to verify if the movement patterns were biologically realistic 2 3 camera detection field for each simulation we modeled a bruv deployment with two simultaneous camera recording systems the first camera assumed a 120 fov referred to as standard camera while the second assumed 360 referred to as full spherical fs cameras were fixed at the center of the study area 500 500 for the duration of the simulation cameras were oriented in the same direction as the current vector for each simulated deployment both cameras were assigned two visibility parameters fig 3 the first lower visibility l v defined the distance meters within which a camera could detect a shark 100 of the time given the shark was within the camera s fov the second upper visibility u v was set to 1 5 l v and defined the distance behind which sharks could not be detected by the cameras a linear decline in detection probability was assumed between l v and u v resulting in steeper declines in detection rates for lower visibility environments to simulate the cameras shooting at 30 frames per second shark movements between time steps 1 s were broken into 30 equal segments with the median of the positive detection probabilities from these segments selected to represent the detection probability over that 1 s interval if a shark was detected within a camera s fov it cast a 5 visual shadow behind which subsequent sharks could not be detected by the camera for each simulation run the number of sharks detected by each camera type was reported at every time step 2 4 simulation scenarios and analyses to determine the influence of density and density independent factors on maxn and meancount estimates 6 variables were considered these variables included aspects of shark behavior swimming speed attraction strength to bait directness of movement patterns environmental conditions visibility bait plume size and density to test the individual effects of each of these factors a simulation scenario was established for each where the variable of interest varied over a range of biologically acceptable values e g burst swimming for carcharhinus leucas of 5 3 m s 1 gray 1971 while all other parameters were held constant table 1 each scenario was run for 3600 time steps representing a 60 min deployment and replicated 1000 times for each simulation run the estimated maxn and meancount using a 10 s sampling interval were noted for each camera the resulting metric estimates were then plotted against the simulated parameter to visually explore the effects of changing parameter values on resulting bruv counts lastly a simulation scenario was conducted where all parameter values were allowed to vary between their lower and upper bounds and was replicated 1000 times from this scenario output we created a generalized linear model glm trying a variety of appropriate distributions i e poisson gamma negative binomial tweedie with video survey metrics of relative abundance for each camera type modeled using all factors as predictor variables allowing for main effects from these the best model was selected using aic with the mass package stepaic function venables and ripley 2002 3 results a total of 7000 simulation runs were conducted consisting of 1000 runs for each simulation scenario the baseline run whereby density was varied from 1 50 sharks while all other parameter values were held constant indicated that our simulated bruvs were capable of detecting changes in localized abundance for fs cameras both maxn and meancount demonstrated a linear relationship with site abundance fig 4 in contrast maxn estimates from standard cameras had an apparent change in slope after the number of sharks exceeded 10 fig 4 similar to previous empirical work i e kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 however this trend did not occur for meancount estimates on the standard camera when density is held constant the null assumption often made by researchers is that the influence of density independent factors would be negligible or constant over a wide range of parameter values in contrast to this null expectation nearly all of the tested variables strongly influenced metric estimates regardless of the camera type or metric used more importantly their influence on resulting count estimates was not constant over a range of their respective values fig 4 with the exception of plume size which had no apparent impact on maxn or meancount estimates all density independent factors had an apparent positive relationship with metric estimates whereby an increase in a parameter value resulted in an increase in count estimates even though simulated densities were held constant at 10 sharks the glm was parameterized with a number of different error distributions but ultimately poisson and gamma were deemed most appropriate for maxn and meancount estimation respectively regardless of camera type the results of each glm indicated that while density was the most influential factor in predicting metric values all density independent factors were also found to be highly significant p 0 001 fig 5 furthermore the estimated coefficient of each parameter standardized by their means was similar regardless of the camera fov but differed in their magnitude between count metrics e g visibility fig 5 for maxn speed visibility and attraction strength to bait all appeared to have similar estimated coefficients followed by directionality and plume size for meancount estimates visibility and attraction strength to bait appeared to have the greatest influence among density independent factors while speed directionality and plume size were less influential fig 5 4 discussion the results of the present study quantified the potential influence of environmental factors and aspects of species behavior for two of the most widely used video survey metrics of relative abundance meancount and maxn overall our simulations highlighted that factors other than changes in localized abundance can significantly impact video survey results and that their relative influence is dictated both by the chosen count metric and the camera s fov visibility had a strong influence on counts derived from video data particularly for meancount estimates suggesting that if not accounted for differences in visibility may lead to decreased precision and misinterpretation of bruv survey results unaccounted for changes in visibility over a bruv deployment could be considered the fishing based survey equivalent of using a net that is constantly changing size unbeknownst to the surveyor this results in a non constant survey catchability coefficient which violates the base assumption often used to create indices of abundance derived from survey data rago 2004 researchers should therefore make it standard practice to quantify the approximate visibility range over the survey period e g examining water clarity visibility via secchi disk or transmissivity turbidity sensors or ideally quantifying how visibility changes over the course of the bruv deployment using stereo camera systems in addition to visibility swimming speed significantly influenced shark count estimates from our simulated bruv deployments this is in agreement with previous research which found that highly mobile fishes are over counted in underwater visual censuses ward paige et al 2010 given that speed is highly correlated with the size age of elasmobranchs this pattern could lead to inaccurate estimates of population size age structures whereby juveniles have a lower probability of being sampled than adults furthermore similar issues could arise if researchers attempt to compare species with differing speeds mobility and behavioral patterns in habitat use species specific movement characteristics could skew relative abundance data derived from bruv surveys whereby faster more mobile species appear more abundant and could overstate their contribution to the overall community structure these same issues apply when trying to compare individuals or species which differ in their relative attraction towards the bait which our simulation found to positively bias bruv counts attraction towards bait is known to vary by the amount of bait used as well as the type of bait selected dorman et al 2012 and has been shown to be species specific harvey et al 2007 sharks differ in the size and morphology of their olfactory bulbs zeiske et al 1987 meredith and kajiura 2010 yopak et al 2015 and thus likely differ in their relative attraction and ability to detect odor particles that are dispersed during bruv deployments lastly in line with previous simulation work which has shown that the directness of shark movements can influence visual survey count estimates ward paige et al 2010 we found a significant positive effect on counts as directness of movements increased the turning angle of sharks can vary greatly depending on diving behavior andrzejaczek et al 2018 as well as between species and across spatial scales papastamatiou et al 2011 accordingly researchers should carefully consider how such behavioral characteristics of sharks may influence bruv survey results the popularity of maxn and meancount as metrics of relative abundance is likely because of their ease of use relatively short processing times ability to compare results to previously published literature using the same techniques and prevention of double counting individuals which could otherwise artificially inflate estimates willis and babcock 2000 cappo 2010 however to be a viable means for monitoring populations estimates must not only be conservative but ideally maintain a linear relationship with true abundance or at the very least have this relationship be clearly understood previous research using simulations and empirical data have indicated that this assumption is likely violated under certain conditions for either maxn campbell et al 2015 kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 or meancount kilfoil et al 2017 reasons for this divergence from linearity are not well understood but could be caused by species exhibiting non uniform spatial distribution around bruvs campbell et al 2015 or saturation of the camera under high densities kilfoil et al 2017 not surprisingly researchers have found that by increasing the camera fov used in video surveys both maxn and meancount can preserve a linear relationship with true abundance over a wider range of values campbell et al 2015 2018 kilfoil et al 2017 sherman et al 2018 whitmarsh et al 2018 our simulation results support these previous findings with maxn estimates deviating from linearity as local abundance increases when using the standard view camera however it should be noted that the deviation from linearity was only observed under simulations with high densities approximately 10 sharks km2 and thus may not be of concern if those levels are not realized in situ e g territorial species or low density areas species though densities exceeding this threshold do occur particularly in protected coral systems e g kilfoil et al 2017 a recent global assessment of reef sharks using bruvs found that the vast majority of deployments did not exceed a maxn of 8 sharks macneil et al 2020 by increasing the simulated fov to mimic newly developed full spherical fs cameras both metrics proved capable of maintaining a linear relationship with true abundance unfortunately this advantage for fs cameras did not extend to reducing the influence of density independent factors on metric estimates meancount and maxn estimates from both fs and standard cameras were highly sensitive to changes in factors other than density including swimming speed attraction to bait directness of movements and distance at which you can positively identify fish from camera footage camera visibility range as with any simulation our ibm attempted to simplify inherently complex biological and ecological processes to improve our understanding of how these factors may interact in situ though relatively simple additional complexities could be integrated into our model depending on the research questions one wishes to answer though not the intended focus of the present study future iterations could explore how results may vary under different models of species movement patterns e g levy vs correlated random walks additional sources of attraction e g visual acoustic predatory strategies e g lie and wait vs roving predators interactions effects between density independent variables and density and added complexities to the simulation s spatial structure e g incorporating habitat complexity given the two dimensional structure of the simulation presented here future efforts should also explore how these factors may interact if a third dimension is added particularly focusing on the potential benefits of full spherical cameras to capture sharks distributing themselves vertically in the water column furthermore though the aim of this paper was to cover a potential set of parameter values for a wide range of shark species researchers could use this simulation framework and restrict parameter values to test similar questions focusing on specific species or environments this may be further refined by using stereo camera footage of similar species and environments to extract reasonable parameter ranges for bait approach behaviors swimming speeds or track tortuosity additionally further efforts should explore the potential influence of bait plume size on survey metrics and animal behavioral responses interestingly our simulation results indicated that bait plume size had a relatively small but significant negative impact on estimates of relative abundance this is in contrast to previous studies harvey et al 2007 heagney et al 2007 bernard and gotz 2012 dorman et al 2012 and may be caused by the closed system structure of our ibm or the behavioral rules imposed on simulated sharks by restricting the survey to a 1 km2 area it is possible that the effects of relatively large bait plumes are dampened since their greatest impact may be caused by attracting sharks from farther away than this limit though not considered by our simulations the effects of bait plume size are further complicated in the real world as plume size can change over the course of the bruv deployments and may have a diminished ability to attract species over time however previous studies have found that using bait can increase video survey precision while also more effectively surveying the entire fish community particularly for large carnivorous species bernard and gotz 2012 therefore researchers should carefully consider the potential benefits as well as the potential biases that may be introduced by using bait when choosing a survey approach overall our simulation study indicates that density independent factors can significantly skew metrics of relative abundance derived from video data given that bruvs are frequently used by resource managers to monitor populations trends barord et al 2014 gain insights on species richness mallet and pelletier 2014 andradi brown et al 2016 and to evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas sanguinetti 2013 bond et al 2012 it is critical that researchers understand how their survey results may be impacted by factors other than density baited remote underwater video systems are still a viable survey method capable of detecting and tracking changes to local population sizes with minimal impact on the animals and habitats in which they are employed however until more robust metrics of relative abundance are developed and tested or the biases of current metrics are further explored and accounted for researchers must carefully evaluate if differences observed in video data are driven by differences in population size or some other unrelated factors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

24638,protozoa are significant components of activated sludge which purify the effluent of free swimming bacteria as well as trigger floc formation in addition their presence is often used as an indicator of process quality in classical models the impact of protozoa on biomass is implicitly included in the bacteria decay rates which in most cases gives a sufficient level of detail however modeling of certain processes such as bioaugmentation would greatly benefit from a functional model including protozoa grazing explicitly to further establish the approach for protozoa grazing modeling the authors have summarized the current state of knowledge in this area as well as pointed out crucial elements that have to be considered aspects of the endogenous oxygen uptake rate our the preference of protozoa towards particular bacteria groups and alternative sources of nutrient are presented and discussed based on the drawn conclusions the authors have proposed a modeling concept towards protozoa grazing that will maintain both stability and accordance with generally accepted activated sludge models asm the presented approach includes a division of each bacteria group into dispersed and flocculated bacteria that emerge from newly formed flocculation and deflocculation processes with a different level of grazing on both components graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protozoa modeling biomass decay free swimming bacteria substitute decay rate 1 introduction computer modeling is steadily gaining interest both as a useful tool for the design and operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as well as research studies on environmental biotechnologies using computer simulation not only saves time which in other case will have to be invested in running long term experiments but also makes it possible to investigate scenarios being impossible to be done in conventional way due to financial aspect or practical reasons activated sludge models asm are main branch of wastewater systems modeling being offspring of monod equation functioning from as early as 1987 henze and gujer 1987 over the years they have been updated and upgraded first as new versions prepared by iwa group asm2d asm3 and later by science community as extensions to already existing models in asm models some phenomena are taken into account in a quite simplified way fig 1 shows the asm web food model in the overwhelming majority of cases subtle aspects of modeled processes are not as important as its general output thus simplifications are often used to save time and work demand during building and calibrating model itself however there are situations where a more detailed approach is condition for the adequacy of the model case studied by hao et al 2011 concerning minimization of sludge production which today is becoming a grave problem in wwtps as restrictions imposed on sludge disposal are more and more tightened indicated the crucial importance of deeper understanding of protozoa impact on biomass decay process of particular interest from a practical and scientific point of view is optimization of process conditions for the cultivation of nitrifiers or other bacteria on sludge liquors from anaerobic digestion and inoculating by them the mainstream activated sludge reactors in wwtp figdore et al 2018a 2018b tang and chen 2015 the problem is very complex and calls for a proper mathematical model explicitly accounting for protozoa grazing on bacteria both in the nitrifiers cultivation reactor and the bioaugmented activated sludge reactor generally speaking gaining knowledge of how predators interact with other biomass components especially nitrifiers and how those interactions are affected by environmental conditions is a prerequisite for building an adequate mathematical model one of the simplified aspects of asm models is modeling of the bacteria decay all processes leading to loss of bacteria such as death lysis or grazing of protozoa despite of their different nature are grouped in one process called decay henze et al 2015 with decay rate coefficients bbh and bba fig 1 for heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria respectively consequently asm models predict a stable levels of bacterial concentration heterotrophic and nitrifying in activated sludge reactors cruz bournazou et al 2012 liu and wang 2015 without the cyclical fluctuations typical for the predator prey protozoa bacteria relationship angerbjörn et al 1999 lambin et al 2000 it is in accord with the results of the experiments which confirm such stability concerning bacteria and protozoa concentrations in real activated sludge systems in most cases such a simplified approach to protozoa grazing proved to be sufficient enabling calibrated models to simulate activated sludge behavior correctly and accordingly to reality however if an investigation of interactions between predators and biomass is of interest or protozoa are eliminated from sludge a separation of protozoa grazing from other decay processes is required unfortunately current knowledge in this area is far incomplete and ambiguous cases which may gain from separate protozoa grazing modeling are maximization of nitrifiers yield the analysis of bioaugmentation failure due to grazing bouchez et al 2000 ikeda ohtsubo et al 2013 as well as investigation of protozoa influence on secondary effluent quality and efforts to minimize sludge production hao et al 2011 bouchez et al 2000 indicated that reducing the amount of protozoa in bioreactor should result in increased nitrifiers yield while sludge exposed to predator selective pressure will enhance floc forming seviour et al 2010 and increase survival rate in mainstream reactor literature contains examples of few attempts to build an activated sludge model explicitly including protozoa grazing component moussa et al 2005 hao et al 2011 ni et al 2009 moussa et al 2005 developed a model that includes separate protozoa grazing on all types of bacteria and used this model to successfully simulate the performance of two sbr reactors with different sludge retention times hao et al 2011 used a similar model to predict the influence of protozoa on sludge production model used by both authors included protozoa grazing as separate process however it assumed that rate of grazing was independent from protozoa number which is clearly not true and further development is necessary ni et al 2009 developed a model of protozoa grazing on a heterotrophic biomass and showed that this model could successfully predict changes in heterotrophic oxygen uptake rates and process parameters in the presence and absence of protozoa however that model does not enable analysis of protozoa interactions with nitrifiers which highly restraints its utility regarding technologies such as bioaugmentation for nitrification improvement besides neither of the studies mentioned above does not consider the quality of effluent which is believed to be closely related to predatory organisms present in activated sludge esteban et al 1991 pauli et al 2001a the relevant food web model of protozoa grazing according to asm framework is shown in fig 2 this food web model is partially created by ni et al 2009 with only heterotrophs being prey for protozoa like in the standard asm model it is assumed that all particulate fractions of pollutants x as well as bacteria xbh xba and protozoa xpr remain completely entrapped in the activated sludge flocs the result is that the modeled protozoa graze on bacteria contained in the activated sludge flocs rather than dispersed ones which are not incorporated in classical asm frame henze et al 2015 moreover such a model structure entails the predator prey dynamics leading to predictions displaying oscillatory populations of bacteria and protozoa such oscillatory fluctuation of the bacteria and protozoa concentrations in activated sludge is contradictory to experimental data this structural inadequacy by itself does not exclude the ability to fit the model to a particular set of empirical data brute force curve fitting approach but most probably would fail rigorous verification with independent data sets the assumption of fully flocculated biomass adopted in classical models is particularly unfortunate in the case of modeling real activated sludge system augmented with highly dispersed nitrifiers biomass grown on liquors from anaerobic sludge digestion another issue that furthers makes modeling protozoa in activated sludge harder is scarcity of kinetic data as well as no clear definition of protozoa interactions with particular biomass components although protozoa are considered important for activated sludge food web they were mainly used as a marker for evaluation of process condition hu et al 2013 madoni 2011 data on their quantity is in fairly broad range expressed in different units which hinders evaluation if model response is in compliance with actual state additionally as opposed to heterotrophs and nitrifiers no effective experimental test is developed to determine protozoa concentration in the sludge sample presenting serious problems in model calibration procedures these barriers have to be removed to gain substantial progress duly focused fundamental laboratory research on the kinetics and physiology of protozoa as well as conceptual and theoretical studies regarding the mechanistic mathematical model of protozoa activity in activated sludge are required it is worth to underline that the improved protozoa grazing model should be elaborated within the framework of the accepted asm models that is it should respect widely accepted mechanistic modeling methodology henze et al 2015 new models must comply with the results of ecological studies including protozoa kinetics and known ranges of their quantities in activated sludge at the same time predictions of such models should be consistent with the results obtained with successfully calibrated previous models it means that the combined rate of bacterial loss by new decay processes that exclude protozoa grazing plus the new separate protozoa grazing must comply with classical decay rates moreover as the removal of dispersed bacteria is the most noticeable effect of protozoa this phenomenon should be included in a way enabling the new models to simulate the dispersed bacteria concentration finally as protozoa remain in predator prey relation with bacteria the construction of the new models must exclude high oscillations of prey mass such oscillations are not observed in real activated sludge reactors but predicted by current protozoa grazing models fig 2 1 1 aim of paper the main aim of this paper is to show what constraints and requirements should be fulfilled by models with grazing as a separate process for the models to be compliant with the current state of knowledge concerning protozoa as well as comply with successfully calibrated existing models in particular with a view to eliminate faulty oscillations of activated sludge biomass predicted by current fig 2 protozoa models and to incorporate into the new models grazing on dispersed rather than on flocculated particles aiming at adequate mechanistic modeling of nitrifiers activity in bioaugmentation systems 2 current state of knowledge and its influence on the modeling of protozoa 2 1 maximum rate of protozoa grazing analysis of decay rates of nitrifiers currently protozoa grazing is included in decay processes a different approach is chosen in numerous models for the modeling decay process of biomass components early studies in mathematical modeling assumed decay to occur solely in aerobic conditions henze and gujer 1987 however with the introduction of asm3 gujer et al 1999 a distinction between decay with and without the presence of oxygen was presented further studies conducted by many authors resulted in the creation of other equations illustrating this part of population dynamics most of equations used for modeling decay incorporate more than one term each responsible for decay in varying conditions oxic anoxic anaerobic the generally accepted approach towards modeling oxic decay is associated with the switch on off function consisting of dissolved oxygen concentration in a reactor so and the oxygen affinity constant ko i for the corresponding bacteria group anoxic decay is mostly resolved by adding either one or two terms that illustrate the influence of nitrite sno2 and nitrate sno3 in a similar manner to oxygen since the observed decay rate in anoxic conditions is lower when compared to aerobic conditions it is either resolved by including a reduction factor η or a separate decay rate coefficient for the anoxic conditions the majority of authors present decay in the absence of oxygen as a nitrate function some exceptions are ganigué et al 2010 who incorporated the term responsible for decay under nitrite and munz et al 2011 who expressed the overall loss of bacteria as the combination of oxic and anaerobic conditions tables 1 and 2 presents both oxic and anoxic decay rates with the corresponding kinetic expression and conditions found in literature the considerably lower values in anoxic conditions are probably associated with no predation activity as well as lower endogenous respiration these are two components included in the frequently used modeled decay rate with others being lysis maintenance motility or death although the impact of each process on the overall decay rate is hard to predict there are suggestions that protozoa activity may be the main reason for the higher values of that parameter in oxic conditions typical values of oxic decay rates are 0 1 0 2 d 1 while values in anoxic conditions are about 3 10 fold lower for this reason the incorporation of a separate protozoa grazing process should result in the base decay rate being lowered in order to avoid a doubling predation effect on the biomass results of asm calibration based on long term 56 days experiments confirm that for stable operating conditions the maximum decay rate remains fairly constant and does not fluctuate it can be concluded that nitrifier s decay rates greatly impact the predicted behavior of simulated systems its value resulting from calibrated models usually does not exceed 20 daily at 20 c it means that protozoa grazing being one of that rate components should not be larger than a dozen percent furthermore assuming protozoa are strict aerobes their impact on biomass is bounded by the difference between oxic and anoxic decay rates as long term simulations of a stable operating system present good fit to experimental data over time with the same set of kinetic parameters it can be assumed that decay rates of bacteria populations do not fluctuate over time it should be taken into account when creating a new concept for biomass loss 2 2 protozoa general description and kinetics creating modeling concept for protozoa grazing needs to be based on real data on those organisms within activated sludge its number in activated sludge are of the order of 3 20 106 cells l 1 madoni 2011 protozoa may directly or indirectly interact with bacterial populations examples of indirect interactions are the competition for dissolved substrates or the excretion of substances that are toxic to certain bacterial populations and stimulatory to others however although the occurrence of these interactions cannot be excluded for these experiments the direct interaction by grazing on the bacteria is assumed to be the most important way that protozoa influence bacterial populations curds and cockburn 1968 this grazing is especially important in the case of the removal of dispersed bacteria protozoa therefore play an important role in the purification of wastewater as they consume suspended bacteria and provide a better effluent quality madoni 2011 their presence triggers floc formation due to the bacteria in flocs being less prone to consumption these organisms also support biomass flocculation by producing fecal pellets and mucus and they function to break up large floc masses through motility protozoa are therefore studied extensively in regard to process condition taxonomic classification of these organisms is based on motility the six basic groups observed in activated sludge are flagellates amoebae free swimming ciliates stalked ciliates rotifers and a few other invertebrates richard 1989 it is believed that among protozoa found in activated sludge ciliates play the most important role in removing most dispersed bacteria esteban et al 1991 pauli et al 2001a most ciliates in activated sludge feed on free swimming or loosely floc bound bacteria the experiments of neubacher and co authors showed that ciliates feed on scattered nitrifiers as effectively as on other free swimming bacteria neubacher et al 2008 and the removal of protozoa leads to an increase in dispersed biomass nevertheless the current state of knowledge does not allow for conclusive statements in this regard therefore it would be premature to undertake an attempt to build a protozoa grazing mathematical model explicitly embracing the activity of the diverse groups of organisms therefore the term protozoa in this article should be understood as a state variable representing averaged activity of the entire mixed population of protozoa species despite protozoa being a significant part of microbial food webs their feeding preferences and effects in the case of activated sludge is not entirely obvious and well understood protozoan predation can significantly affect changes in bacterial physiology and population composition in spite that protozoa are extensively studied in various fields the wastewater treatment related investigations rarely focus on kinetic aspects so the relevant information regarding kinetics is scarce the available experimental data on kinetics as well as the quantity of protozoa in activated sludge are presented in table 3 scant data on protozoa kinetics as well as a wide range of their quantity in wastewater systems may create several problems during calibration of models with newly formed processes and components another aspect is that the information found in literature is often given in different units or focusses on particular protozoa species for example madoni 2011 defined protozoa in activated sludge as microorganisms that can reach up to 20 mln cells l 1 which corresponds to 250 mg of dry weight per liter on the other hand pauli et al 2001a in their review work reported the protozoa number from 3 different plants with a distinction between respective species in the three wastewater treatment plants ciliates were the dominant group reaching up to 99 mg l 1 while flagellates had lower maximums up to 83 mg l 1 in all corresponding samples as for protozoa kinetics the maximum growth rate is the parameter most accessible in literature however its wide range shows that it would be very difficult to estimate a single value without knowledge of the composition of activated sludge richard 1989 stated that most protozoa found in activated sludge have growth rates of ca 1 per day particular protozoa species were described by sudo and aiba 1971 as well as by curds and cockburn 1968 and had growth rates starting from 1 2 d 1 for aspidisca species extending up to 5 3 d 1 for ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis the above works of sudo and aiba 1971 and curds and cockburn 1968 serve as the only source of other kinetic parameters such as yield coefficient the θ arrhenius temperature coefficient and the michaelis substrate coefficient curds and cockburn 1968 determined the yield coefficient for tetrahymena pyriformis on proteose peptone yeast equal to 0 37 and on klebsiella aerogenes which was 0 46 the influence of temperature on protozoa kinetics were studied by sudo and aiba 1971 and the θ arrhenius coefficient was calculated at 0 086 1 k the michaelis substrate coefficient considering protozoa organisms was only studied by curds and cockburn 1968 and was determined to be 5 5 g c l 1 of dispersed bacteria for ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis the fact that it was expressed on the basis of dispersed bacteria as well as relatively high predation rates that have been found are evidence of the high contribution of those organisms to effluent clarification further discussed is presented in section 2 3 no decay rates have been found for activated sludge protozoa in summary it can be stated that data found in the literature indicates that the mass of protozoa in activated sludge is significant up to the point when it exceeds the amount of nitrifiers provided abundance of prey the protozoa can grow much faster than nitrifiers even under non limiting substrate conditions scant data on kinetic parameters of the activated sludge protozoa may cause problems at the model calibration stage 2 3 the influence of protozoa on effluent quality the most noticeable effect of the presence of protozoa is the clarity of effluent curds and cockburn 1968 operated a reactor with and without protozoa and noticed that the introduction of protozoa leads to a decrease of biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids in effluent by ca 70 farrah et al 1985 showed that the removal of protozoa leads to a significant increase of freely suspended bacteria with the presence of protozoa less than 20 and often nearly none of bacteria were found in supernatant while after the addition of sodium azide and the removal of protozoa this amount increased to 60 80 esteban et al 1991 showed that the effluent quality in large wwtp was inversely correlated with the number of ciliates and a higher number of ciliates lead to less bod and cod in the effluent these results have been confirmed in the pilot and full scale studies carried out by pauli et al 2001b it seems impossible to maintain proper effluent quality without protozoa these phenomena cannot be modeled by existing models as they assume that all biomass and inanimate particles are permanently incorporated in flocs and their transfer between flocs and bulk water is not modeled protozoa have high substrate affinity to free swimming bacteria curds and cockburn 1968 estimated the half saturation concentration of klebsiella aerogenes to be 5 5 mg c l 1 for protozoa tetrahymena pyriformis protozoa clears wastewater from suspended bacteria in a very efficient manner filtration rates in ranges of 12 156 nl h 1 per one individual have been reported pauli et al 2001b assuming a protozoa density of 10 000 ml 1 and a filtration rate of 100 nl h 1 all the liquid in an activated sludge plant would be filtered in less than 1 hour pauli et al 2001b the above arguments are confirmed by experiments when elimination protozoa from activated sludge led to a significant deterioration of effluent quality 2 4 protozoa ability to graze on bacteria in flocs in general protozoan grazing on bacteria is selective in terms of physical attributes such as bacteria cell size most protozoa preferentially graze on medium sized cells in the range of 0 4 2 4 μm because predation on smaller or larger bacterial cells is less effective size selective feeding does not require active predator choice bacteria smaller than 0 4 μm are seen as weakly affected by protozoan grazing and those larger than 2 4 μm are seen as grazing resistant hahn and höfle 2001 a common trait affecting the selectivity of grazing is bacteria cell shape for example coccus shaped bacteria are more preferably eaten than bacilli ones the characteristic of the bacterial cell surface also plays a significant role gram negative bacteria are preferred because their digestion lasts longer than gram positive bacteria pernthaler 2005 besides the more hydrophobic the surface of bacterial cells are the more often they become prey another feature that determines the feeding preferences of protozoa is the speed of movement of the prey which can work in two ways on the one hand fast swimming bacteria have a better chance to escape from the predator but on the other hand the high speed of movement increases the frequency of contact with protozoa and thus the threat of grazing taking into account such high filtration rates as mentioned above point 2 3 and the generally observed stability of activated sludge process it is evident that most protozoa are unable to graze on bacteria in flocs otherwise the pressure of protozoa should lead to complete extermination of bacteria moreover the ability to form flocs is believed to be mainly provoked by the selection pressure of protozoa as a result the overwhelming majority of bacteria are protected from protozoa grazing inside the activated sludge flocs 2 5 protozoa feeding on inanimate organic fractions taylor 1977 stated that larger ciliates are very limited in their ability to discriminate against particles in favor of bacteria the inability of protozoa to distinguish between bacteria and other particles may come from feeding behavior the food taken by protozoa concentrates while filtered out from the liquid sleigh 1989 water currents are created and drag particles toward a ciliary sieve where particles of size 0 3 to 5 μm are strain out pauli et al 2001b this process is inclusive and therefore abiotic and inorganic particles are also ingested sherr 1988 showed that flagellates could feed on high molecular weight polysaccharide curds and cockburn 1968 cultivated ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis on a pure protease peptone yeast extract medium protozoa grazing on organics other than bacteria is probably negligible bacteria remains their main source of food experiments conducted by hrudey 1982 showed that ciliates are unable to proliferate efficiently on peptone and their mass increase only after bacteria concentration rise since the food of protozoa is strain out from liquid on bases of the particles size apparently without any additional selection mechanisms grazing on other than bacteria organic fractions detached from activated sludge flocs should be considered the literature about the ability of the activated sludge protozoa to grow on organic fractions other than bacteria is contradictive this ambiguity should be resolved since it greatly influences the extent of selective pressure exerted on bacteria and raises a question of whether protozoa compete with heterotrophic bacteria for abiotic organic fractions 2 6 stability of the activated sludge process direct implementation of separate protozoa grazing on entire population of bacteria would create similar model behavior to the predator prey lotka volterra model lotka 1909 such models are known to predict high fluctuations of predator and prey populations resulting from strong coupling of growth kinetics of both components pauli et al 2001a with a decreasing prey population the source of food for predators the latter starts to decay due to insufficient food to population ratio it results in lower pressure on the prey population which steadily strives to its maximum while predators repeat the cycle fig 3 typical sludge retention time required to sustain heterotrophic bacteria is in range of days while in case of autotrophic bacteria in range of weeks even considering that the influent of raw wastewater contains an additional 106 bacteria per ml the ciliate population being around 10 000 ml 1 and achieving unit filtration rate of around 100 nl per hour should be able to digest all the bacteria during treatment leading to the complete removal of them from the system as a result biochemical transformation rates would strongly fluctuate causing catastrophic instability of wastewater treatment efficiency however such a situation does not occur in real wwtp therefore several aspects of modeling protozoa pressure on bacteria have to be addressed in order to avoid such instability the current modifications of the asm model moussa et al 2005 hao et al 2011 ni et al 2009 cannot be considered satisfactory the assumed model structure fig 2 generates wrong highly fluctuating time courses of bacteria and protozoa concentrations especially when real growth rates of protozoa table 1 would be considered the new model structure should eliminate such inadequate predictions the typical kinetic formula used to describe the relationship between bacteria and their substrates is given by eq 1 1 ds dt f x b s k s where s is the substrate xb is the bacteria thriving on a given substrate and k is the saturation coefficient assuming that the kinetic equations describing protozoa grazing on bacteria are analogous to those describing bacterial growth kinetics it would be possible to set up conditions that lead to the complete removal of bacteria if protozoa kinetic parameters are similar to those presented in table 1 it will be necessary to implement high values of bacteria saturation coefficients to avoid the complete removal of bacteria however it will still be possible to force a model to generate instability e g by artificially doubling protozoa mass but given the current knowledge about the activated sludge it is unlikely that the addition of protozoa to bioreactor could lead to the process failure it seems that a mechanism that prevents protozoa from exterminating all activated sludge bacteria is based on an intrinsic inability to get access to most of the bacteria gathered in flocs it is worth emphasizing that these phenomena cannot be correctly modeled based solely on the saturation coefficient 3 discussion and further model development the current approach to modeling decay with separate protozoa grazing processes poses both certain limitations to what extent such models can be used as well as question if it complies with actual knowledge on predatory organisms in activated sludge creating a common approach towards further studies in that subject should be based on a discussion of opposing facts found in literature keeping in mind the need for relative simplicity enabling model calibration under real conditions of its use information found regarding activated sludge protozoa indicates both their large number in that environment as well as growth rates exceeding those of nitrifiers under favorable conditions of substrate availability it would lead to complete decay of nitrifiers population and failure of the process such a situation does not occur in real activated sludge processes decay rates calculated solely based on protozoa number and their kinetics under the assumption of unrestricted access of protozoa to prey including entrapped inside sludge flocs are incorrect when confronted with values of decay rates found in the literature the decay rate values resulting from successful calibrations of current asm models mostly do not exceed 20 meaning that protozoa grazing being one of the decay components should not be higher than a dozen percent furthermore assuming protozoa are aerobes their predatory impact on activated sludge biomass under anoxic and anaerobic conditions should be accordingly lowered concerning dissolved oxygen concentration taking this into account the maximum grazing impact should not exceed the difference between respective maximum oxic and anoxic anaerobic decay rates another argument against highly intense grazing arises from the fact that it would lead to high oscillations in both protozoa and bacteria mass similar to the behavior of predator prey models such as the lotka volterra model such fluctuations are not observed in real activated sludge systems and are not predicted by current asm models the models properly predict relatively constant stationary biomass concentrations and stable decay rates the above points to additional factors regulating the relation between protozoa and activated sludge bacteria one of those may be associated with how protozoa feed filtration mechanism even though eliminating dispersed bacteria with deadly efficiency without distinction between particular species poses certain limitation in terms of size of particles prone to digestion elimination of protozoa leads to a substantial increase in the number of dispersed particles including bacteria causing severe deterioration of final clarifier effluent yet as mentioned above no steep process deterioration of process quality is observed which is likely caused by the fact that most of the biomass present in the activated sludge reactors is in the form of flocs which size exceeds that which can be digested by protozoa interrelation between dispersed and flocculated biomass has not been widely examined however strong indications are found that it is mainly associated with predator organisms selective pressure which intensifies flocculation of bacteria that fact should also be somehow included in future models as it may be crucial for ensuring stable predictions by models with separate grazing even if not clear it is worth mentioning that there is a possibility that protozoa may feed on other components of activated sludge such as organic fractions filtration mechanism of digestion suggest that this could happen but studies found in that topic contradict themselves making it inconclusive assuming that the rate of absorption of organic compounds by protozoa is proportional to the share of these compounds in the overall concentration of particles together with bacteria available to protozoa this would result in a decrease in pressure on bacteria groups question remains to what extent protozoa would be able to compete with heterotrophs towards their substrates and how this limit could be included in model equations as can be seen in brief discussion above several issues should be considered before modeling concept for protozoa activity is set up enabling adequate simulation of the actual process without undue complexity of the model that would require impractical calibration procedures the arguments presented above prove that modeling protozoa grazing as a separate process in models from the asm family has to be further studied in particular the aspect of instability has to be addressed due to its crucial impact on overall model behavior in this section the authors propose several modifications that could be possible solution since protozoa feed mostly on free swimming bacteria rather than flocs the authors propose to divide the simulated bacteria population heterotrophs aob nob depending on model complexity into two groups each of them would either simulate dispersed not flocculated bacteria xd or flocculated biomass xfl while free swimming bacteria would be in the vast majority consumed by protozoa the flocculated biomass would be highly resistant to predation due to its size exceeding mouth apparatus limitations the general concept of the new model is illustrated in fig 4 heterotrophic bacteria xh and nitrifiers xa without division into aob and nob are included both are divided into flocculated xh f and xa f and deflocculated xh d and xa d forms an extension for aob and nob is straightforward the authors propose that a fraction of each group in overall biomass concentration results from flocculation deflocculation and grazing steady state pseudo equilibrium and could be calculated from an expression similar to that of the reaction rate constant eq 2 however its value should depend on additional factors such as protozoa concentration as infers from numerous studies bossier and verstraete 1996 de schryver et al 2008 pauli et al 2001a these studies show that with increasing predation the pressure on floc forming processes is much stronger hence f x pr has been incorporated into the equation therefore with an increasing concentration of protozoa in activated sludge the k should tend to lower values reflecting stronger tendency for floc formation as opposed to a situation where protozoa are a small fraction in activated sludge leading to higher values of k and a more dispersed profile of biomass 2 k x d x pr x f 1 f x pr the rate of transformation between two biomass states eqs 3 and 4 is said to be dependent on the newly introduced flocculation and deflocculation coefficients kf and kd the values have yet to be established but it must be underlined that their values should be in close relation to the decay rate values presented in literature given the deadly efficiency of protozoa grazing on free swimming bacteria it can be assumed that dispersed bacteria are fully consumed by protozoa when taking into account the decay rates in the classic asm models the protozoa grazing rate should not exceed the difference between oxic and anoxic decay rates as it would lead to a lack of accordance with the data in literature additionally to simplify the development of future models the authors suggest the omitting of grazing on flocculated bacteria and instead include that process being a minor factor in the newly proposed deflocculation coefficient by slightly increasing its value 3 d x b f dt k d 4 d x b d dt k f the appropriate form of the right hand side in formula 3 and 4 requires research it seems that the first order formula with respect to the xb d and xb f concentrations would be a good first choice for deflocculation and flocculation rates respectively although there is no direct clue of protozoa preference towards any bacteria group as energy source the discussion presented in chapter 2 4 points at such possibility concerning ammonia oxidizers which are located close to the surface of activated sludge flocs thus can be more prone to protozoa grazing this fact should be taken into consideration even though as stated above protozoa graze mostly on dispersed bacteria with the deflocculation process this matter could be resolved by a slightly higher value of the deflocculation coefficient for aob than for nob the proposed modifications should not lead to overall predation rates higher than those found in literature therefore a careful approach has to be taken when elaborating new kinetic expressions and relationships between simulated components due to the scarce data on predation rates point 2 2 this aspect would likely be a major subject in further studies the authors are aware of the substantial level of complexity when trying to implement the above modifications fortunately experience with developing asm models suggests that such full detailed approach will probably be unnecessary in most cases significant simplifications proved fruitful we believe that the current highly simplified description of decay in the asm models could be significantly improved enabling modeling of bioaugmentation while maintaining the practicality of the model a simplified model of activated sludge flocs flocculation deflocculation plus a simple model of protozoa taken as one entity grazing only on dispersed bacteria probably would be enough these three additional processes will require a few kinetic parameters in addition to the 18 in the asm1 model and 54 in the asm2d model neither building nor calibration of such a model has yet been performed preliminary modeling studies performed by the authors of this paper look promising and will therefore be the subject of our future research considering that biomass loss is the composition of two processes in models with separate protozoa grazing to validate its accordance with existing and generally accepted models the sum of impact of both processes that lead to biomass decay has to be calculated therefore the authors propose the creation of an additional parameter called the substitute decay rate which could serve as a useful tool during calibration procedures the substitute decay rate is a sum of the decay rate and the rate of bacteria loss due to grazing for example consider the model presented by moussa et al 2005 where the mass of ammonia oxidizers is reduced in the process of decay as well as in the process of grazing the overall biomass loss rate coefficient can be calculated from eq 5 5 b a o b s u b b n h 4 k n h s n h k n h k o 2 s o 2 k o 2 μ p r e d s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 p r e d x n h x n h x n o x h such an equation can be compiled for every model it is clear that the overall biomass loss due to combined processes of decay and grazing b sub must be in comply with the values of the aerobic decay rates shown in table 2 in other words the value of the substitute decay rate coefficient should not be higher than the one found by fitting the classical model to the data additionally the value of the second term expressing the influence of protozoa in eq 1 should not be higher than the difference between the oxic and anoxic decay rate coefficients in the classical model 4 conclusions protozoa are widely studied in fields not directly connected to activated sludge modeling information gathered in those studies contain clues on the relationships between protozoa and other components of the activated sludge process data on the kinetic parameters of protozoa deduced from direct measurements are scarce however it can be assumed that maximum growth rates are equal or higher than 1 0 d 1 and somewhere between the growth rates of nitrifiers and heterotrophic bacteria only one set of data on the yield saturation constant and temperature coefficient has been found the values of aerobic decay rates obtained during calibrations of classical models include the influence of protozoa the typical values of aerobic decay rates for nitrifiers are ca 0 15 d 1 20 c and 0 3 0 4 d 1 20 c for heterotrophic bacteria in the case of separate modeling of protozoa grazing the cumulative rate of biomass loss due to a new decay process and grazing must comply with rates obtained in classical models it is proposed to check compliance by calculating a new variable called the substitute decay rate and compare its value to values of decay rates from classical models as protozoa are strictly aerobic the difference between classical aerobic and anoxic decay rates include the influence of protozoa therefore the rate of biomass loss due to protozoa activity cannot be higher than differences between classical aerobic and anoxic decay rate coefficient which are typically 0 05 0 15 d 1 20 c for nitrifiers and 0 2 0 3 d 1 20 c for heterotrophic bacteria all calibrations of new models with separate grazing should be checked for this compliance protozoa thrive mainly on free swimming bacteria this phenomenon should be included in models and the mass of bacteria available as prey for protozoa must not include most of the bacteria in flocs the rate of protozoa grazing should be limited by the available mass of free swimming bacteria and not by the saturation constant otherwise instability of model may occur as well as that approach would be inconsistent with mechanism of grazing it is proposed to divide bacteria into two groups dispersed and flocculated biomass the mass transfer for these two groups is modelled with flocculation and deflocculation constants it is believed that a steady state proportions of dispersed and flocculated biomass can be described with a formula similar to equilibrium constant protozoa only consumes dispersed bacteria this approach enables the modeling of the clarification effect as well as ensures that the model predicts the stability of the activated sludge process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

24638,protozoa are significant components of activated sludge which purify the effluent of free swimming bacteria as well as trigger floc formation in addition their presence is often used as an indicator of process quality in classical models the impact of protozoa on biomass is implicitly included in the bacteria decay rates which in most cases gives a sufficient level of detail however modeling of certain processes such as bioaugmentation would greatly benefit from a functional model including protozoa grazing explicitly to further establish the approach for protozoa grazing modeling the authors have summarized the current state of knowledge in this area as well as pointed out crucial elements that have to be considered aspects of the endogenous oxygen uptake rate our the preference of protozoa towards particular bacteria groups and alternative sources of nutrient are presented and discussed based on the drawn conclusions the authors have proposed a modeling concept towards protozoa grazing that will maintain both stability and accordance with generally accepted activated sludge models asm the presented approach includes a division of each bacteria group into dispersed and flocculated bacteria that emerge from newly formed flocculation and deflocculation processes with a different level of grazing on both components graphical abstract image graphical

operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as well as research studies on environmental biotechnologies using computer simulation not only saves time which in other case will have to be invested in running long term experiments but also makes it possible to investigate scenarios being impossible to be done in conventional way due to financial aspect or practical reasons activated sludge models asm are main branch of wastewater systems modeling being offspring of monod equation functioning from as early as 1987 henze and gujer 1987 over the years they have been updated and upgraded first as new versions prepared by iwa group asm2d asm3 and later by science community as extensions to already existing models in asm models some phenomena are taken into account in a quite simplified way fig 1 shows the asm web food model in the overwhelming majority of cases subtle aspects of modeled processes are not as important as its general output thus simplifications are often used to save time and work demand during building and calibrating model itself however there are situations where a more detailed approach is condition for the adequacy of the model case studied by hao et al 2011 concerning minimization of sludge production which today is becoming a grave problem in wwtps as restrictions imposed on sludge disposal are more and more tightened indicated the crucial importance of deeper understanding of protozoa impact on biomass decay process of particular interest from a practical and scientific point of view is optimization of process conditions for the cultivation of nitrifiers or other bacteria on sludge liquors from anaerobic digestion and inoculating by them the mainstream activated sludge reactors in wwtp figdore et al 2018a 2018b tang and chen 2015 the problem is very complex and calls for a proper mathematical model explicitly accounting for protozoa grazing on bacteria both in the nitrifiers cultivation reactor and the bioaugmented activated sludge reactor generally speaking gaining knowledge of how predators interact with other biomass components especially nitrifiers and how those interactions are affected by environmental conditions is a prerequisite for building an adequate mathematical model one of the simplified aspects of asm models is modeling of the bacteria decay all processes leading to loss of bacteria such as death lysis or grazing of protozoa despite of their different nature are grouped in one process called decay henze et al 2015 with decay rate coefficients bbh and bba fig 1 for heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria respectively consequently asm models predict a stable levels of bacterial concentration heterotrophic and nitrifying in activated sludge reactors cruz bournazou et al 2012 liu and wang 2015 without the cyclical fluctuations typical for the predator prey protozoa bacteria relationship angerbjörn et al 1999 lambin et al 2000 it is in accord with the results of the experiments which confirm such stability concerning bacteria and protozoa concentrations in real activated sludge systems in most cases such a simplified approach to protozoa grazing proved to be sufficient enabling calibrated models to simulate activated sludge behavior correctly and accordingly to reality however if an investigation of interactions between predators and biomass is of interest or protozoa are eliminated from sludge a separation of protozoa grazing from other decay processes is required unfortunately current knowledge in this area is far incomplete and ambiguous cases which may gain from separate protozoa grazing modeling are maximization of nitrifiers yield the analysis of bioaugmentation failure due to grazing bouchez et al 2000 ikeda ohtsubo et al 2013 as well as investigation of protozoa influence on secondary effluent quality and efforts to minimize sludge production hao et al 2011 bouchez et al 2000 indicated that reducing the amount of protozoa in bioreactor should result in increased nitrifiers yield while sludge exposed to predator selective pressure will enhance floc forming seviour et al 2010 and increase survival rate in mainstream reactor literature contains examples of few attempts to build an activated sludge model explicitly including protozoa grazing component moussa et al 2005 hao et al 2011 ni et al 2009 moussa et al 2005 developed a model that includes separate protozoa grazing on all types of bacteria and used this model to successfully simulate the performance of two sbr reactors with different sludge retention times hao et al 2011 used a similar model to predict the influence of protozoa on sludge production model used by both authors included protozoa grazing as separate process however it assumed that rate of grazing was independent from protozoa number which is clearly not true and further development is necessary ni et al 2009 developed a model of protozoa grazing on a heterotrophic biomass and showed that this model could successfully predict changes in heterotrophic oxygen uptake rates and process parameters in the presence and absence of protozoa however that model does not enable analysis of protozoa interactions with nitrifiers which highly restraints its utility regarding technologies such as bioaugmentation for nitrification improvement besides neither of the studies mentioned above does not consider the quality of effluent which is believed to be closely related to predatory organisms present in activated sludge esteban et al 1991 pauli et al 2001a the relevant food web model of protozoa grazing according to asm framework is shown in fig 2 this food web model is partially created by ni et al 2009 with only heterotrophs being prey for protozoa like in the standard asm model it is assumed that all particulate fractions of pollutants x as well as bacteria xbh xba and protozoa xpr remain completely entrapped in the activated sludge flocs the result is that the modeled protozoa graze on bacteria contained in the activated sludge flocs rather than dispersed ones which are not incorporated in classical asm frame henze et al 2015 moreover such a model structure entails the predator prey dynamics leading to predictions displaying oscillatory populations of bacteria and protozoa such oscillatory fluctuation of the bacteria and protozoa concentrations in activated sludge is contradictory to experimental data this structural inadequacy by itself does not exclude the ability to fit the model to a particular set of empirical data brute force curve fitting approach but most probably would fail rigorous verification with independent data sets the assumption of fully flocculated biomass adopted in classical models is particularly unfortunate in the case of modeling real activated sludge system augmented with highly dispersed nitrifiers biomass grown on liquors from anaerobic sludge digestion another issue that furthers makes modeling protozoa in activated sludge harder is scarcity of kinetic data as well as no clear definition of protozoa interactions with particular biomass components although protozoa are considered important for activated sludge food web they were mainly used as a marker for evaluation of process condition hu et al 2013 madoni 2011 data on their quantity is in fairly broad range expressed in different units which hinders evaluation if model response is in compliance with actual state additionally as opposed to heterotrophs and nitrifiers no effective experimental test is developed to determine protozoa concentration in the sludge sample presenting serious problems in model calibration procedures these barriers have to be removed to gain substantial progress duly focused fundamental laboratory research on the kinetics and physiology of protozoa as well as conceptual and theoretical studies regarding the mechanistic mathematical model of protozoa activity in activated sludge are required it is worth to underline that the improved protozoa grazing model should be elaborated within the framework of the accepted asm models that is it should respect widely accepted mechanistic modeling methodology henze et al 2015 new models must comply with the results of ecological studies including protozoa kinetics and known ranges of their quantities in activated sludge at the same time predictions of such models should be consistent with the results obtained with successfully calibrated previous models it means that the combined rate of bacterial loss by new decay processes that exclude protozoa grazing plus the new separate protozoa grazing must comply with classical decay rates moreover as the removal of dispersed bacteria is the most noticeable effect of protozoa this phenomenon should be included in a way enabling the new models to simulate the dispersed bacteria concentration finally as protozoa remain in predator prey relation with bacteria the construction of the new models must exclude high oscillations of prey mass such oscillations are not observed in real activated sludge reactors but predicted by current protozoa grazing models fig 2 1 1 aim of paper the main aim of this paper is to show what constraints and requirements should be fulfilled by models with grazing as a separate process for the models to be compliant with the current state of knowledge concerning protozoa as well as comply with successfully calibrated existing models in particular with a view to eliminate faulty oscillations of activated sludge biomass predicted by current fig 2 protozoa models and to incorporate into the new models grazing on dispersed rather than on flocculated particles aiming at adequate mechanistic modeling of nitrifiers activity in bioaugmentation systems 2 current state of knowledge and its influence on the modeling of protozoa 2 1 maximum rate of protozoa grazing analysis of decay rates of nitrifiers currently protozoa grazing is included in decay processes a different approach is chosen in numerous models for the modeling decay process of biomass components early studies in mathematical modeling assumed decay to occur solely in aerobic conditions henze and gujer 1987 however with the introduction of asm3 gujer et al 1999 a distinction between decay with and without the presence of oxygen was presented further studies conducted by many authors resulted in the creation of other equations illustrating this part of population dynamics most of equations used for modeling decay incorporate more than one term each responsible for decay in varying conditions oxic anoxic anaerobic the generally accepted approach towards modeling oxic decay is associated with the switch on off function consisting of dissolved oxygen concentration in a reactor so and the oxygen affinity constant ko i for the corresponding bacteria group anoxic decay is mostly resolved by adding either one or two terms that illustrate the influence of nitrite sno2 and nitrate sno3 in a similar manner to oxygen since the observed decay rate in anoxic conditions is lower when compared to aerobic conditions it is either resolved by including a reduction factor η or a separate decay rate coefficient for the anoxic conditions the majority of authors present decay in the absence of oxygen as a nitrate function some exceptions are ganigué et al 2010 who incorporated the term responsible for decay under nitrite and munz et al 2011 who expressed the overall loss of bacteria as the combination of oxic and anaerobic conditions tables 1 and 2 presents both oxic and anoxic decay rates with the corresponding kinetic expression and conditions found in literature the considerably lower values in anoxic conditions are probably associated with no predation activity as well as lower endogenous respiration these are two components included in the frequently used modeled decay rate with others being lysis maintenance motility or death although the impact of each process on the overall decay rate is hard to predict there are suggestions that protozoa activity may be the main reason for the higher values of that parameter in oxic conditions typical values of oxic decay rates are 0 1 0 2 d 1 while values in anoxic conditions are about 3 10 fold lower for this reason the incorporation of a separate protozoa grazing process should result in the base decay rate being lowered in order to avoid a doubling predation effect on the biomass results of asm calibration based on long term 56 days experiments confirm that for stable operating conditions the maximum decay rate remains fairly constant and does not fluctuate it can be concluded that nitrifier s decay rates greatly impact the predicted behavior of simulated systems its value resulting from calibrated models usually does not exceed 20 daily at 20 c it means that protozoa grazing being one of that rate components should not be larger than a dozen percent furthermore assuming protozoa are strict aerobes their impact on biomass is bounded by the difference between oxic and anoxic decay rates as long term simulations of a stable operating system present good fit to experimental data over time with the same set of kinetic parameters it can be assumed that decay rates of bacteria populations do not fluctuate over time it should be taken into account when creating a new concept for biomass loss 2 2 protozoa general description and kinetics creating modeling concept for protozoa grazing needs to be based on real data on those organisms within activated sludge its number in activated sludge are of the order of 3 20 106 cells l 1 madoni 2011 protozoa may directly or indirectly interact with bacterial populations examples of indirect interactions are the competition for dissolved substrates or the excretion of substances that are toxic to certain bacterial populations and stimulatory to others however although the occurrence of these interactions cannot be excluded for these experiments the direct interaction by grazing on the bacteria is assumed to be the most important way that protozoa influence bacterial populations curds and cockburn 1968 this grazing is especially important in the case of the removal of dispersed bacteria protozoa therefore play an important role in the purification of wastewater as they consume suspended bacteria and provide a better effluent quality madoni 2011 their presence triggers floc formation due to the bacteria in flocs being less prone to consumption these organisms also support biomass flocculation by producing fecal pellets and mucus and they function to break up large floc masses through motility protozoa are therefore studied extensively in regard to process condition taxonomic classification of these organisms is based on motility the six basic groups observed in activated sludge are flagellates amoebae free swimming ciliates stalked ciliates rotifers and a few other invertebrates richard 1989 it is believed that among protozoa found in activated sludge ciliates play the most important role in removing most dispersed bacteria esteban et al 1991 pauli et al 2001a most ciliates in activated sludge feed on free swimming or loosely floc bound bacteria the experiments of neubacher and co authors showed that ciliates feed on scattered nitrifiers as effectively as on other free swimming bacteria neubacher et al 2008 and the removal of protozoa leads to an increase in dispersed biomass nevertheless the current state of knowledge does not allow for conclusive statements in this regard therefore it would be premature to undertake an attempt to build a protozoa grazing mathematical model explicitly embracing the activity of the diverse groups of organisms therefore the term protozoa in this article should be understood as a state variable representing averaged activity of the entire mixed population of protozoa species despite protozoa being a significant part of microbial food webs their feeding preferences and effects in the case of activated sludge is not entirely obvious and well understood protozoan predation can significantly affect changes in bacterial physiology and population composition in spite that protozoa are extensively studied in various fields the wastewater treatment related investigations rarely focus on kinetic aspects so the relevant information regarding kinetics is scarce the available experimental data on kinetics as well as the quantity of protozoa in activated sludge are presented in table 3 scant data on protozoa kinetics as well as a wide range of their quantity in wastewater systems may create several problems during calibration of models with newly formed processes and components another aspect is that the information found in literature is often given in different units or focusses on particular protozoa species for example madoni 2011 defined protozoa in activated sludge as microorganisms that can reach up to 20 mln cells l 1 which corresponds to 250 mg of dry weight per liter on the other hand pauli et al 2001a in their review work reported the protozoa number from 3 different plants with a distinction between respective species in the three wastewater treatment plants ciliates were the dominant group reaching up to 99 mg l 1 while flagellates had lower maximums up to 83 mg l 1 in all corresponding samples as for protozoa kinetics the maximum growth rate is the parameter most accessible in literature however its wide range shows that it would be very difficult to estimate a single value without knowledge of the composition of activated sludge richard 1989 stated that most protozoa found in activated sludge have growth rates of ca 1 per day particular protozoa species were described by sudo and aiba 1971 as well as by curds and cockburn 1968 and had growth rates starting from 1 2 d 1 for aspidisca species extending up to 5 3 d 1 for ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis the above works of sudo and aiba 1971 and curds and cockburn 1968 serve as the only source of other kinetic parameters such as yield coefficient the θ arrhenius temperature coefficient and the michaelis substrate coefficient curds and cockburn 1968 determined the yield coefficient for tetrahymena pyriformis on proteose peptone yeast equal to 0 37 and on klebsiella aerogenes which was 0 46 the influence of temperature on protozoa kinetics were studied by sudo and aiba 1971 and the θ arrhenius coefficient was calculated at 0 086 1 k the michaelis substrate coefficient considering protozoa organisms was only studied by curds and cockburn 1968 and was determined to be 5 5 g c l 1 of dispersed bacteria for ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis the fact that it was expressed on the basis of dispersed bacteria as well as relatively high predation rates that have been found are evidence of the high contribution of those organisms to effluent clarification further discussed is presented in section 2 3 no decay rates have been found for activated sludge protozoa in summary it can be stated that data found in the literature indicates that the mass of protozoa in activated sludge is significant up to the point when it exceeds the amount of nitrifiers provided abundance of prey the protozoa can grow much faster than nitrifiers even under non limiting substrate conditions scant data on kinetic parameters of the activated sludge protozoa may cause problems at the model calibration stage 2 3 the influence of protozoa on effluent quality the most noticeable effect of the presence of protozoa is the clarity of effluent curds and cockburn 1968 operated a reactor with and without protozoa and noticed that the introduction of protozoa leads to a decrease of biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids in effluent by ca 70 farrah et al 1985 showed that the removal of protozoa leads to a significant increase of freely suspended bacteria with the presence of protozoa less than 20 and often nearly none of bacteria were found in supernatant while after the addition of sodium azide and the removal of protozoa this amount increased to 60 80 esteban et al 1991 showed that the effluent quality in large wwtp was inversely correlated with the number of ciliates and a higher number of ciliates lead to less bod and cod in the effluent these results have been confirmed in the pilot and full scale studies carried out by pauli et al 2001b it seems impossible to maintain proper effluent quality without protozoa these phenomena cannot be modeled by existing models as they assume that all biomass and inanimate particles are permanently incorporated in flocs and their transfer between flocs and bulk water is not modeled protozoa have high substrate affinity to free swimming bacteria curds and cockburn 1968 estimated the half saturation concentration of klebsiella aerogenes to be 5 5 mg c l 1 for protozoa tetrahymena pyriformis protozoa clears wastewater from suspended bacteria in a very efficient manner filtration rates in ranges of 12 156 nl h 1 per one individual have been reported pauli et al 2001b assuming a protozoa density of 10 000 ml 1 and a filtration rate of 100 nl h 1 all the liquid in an activated sludge plant would be filtered in less than 1 hour pauli et al 2001b the above arguments are confirmed by experiments when elimination protozoa from activated sludge led to a significant deterioration of effluent quality 2 4 protozoa ability to graze on bacteria in flocs in general protozoan grazing on bacteria is selective in terms of physical attributes such as bacteria cell size most protozoa preferentially graze on medium sized cells in the range of 0 4 2 4 μm because predation on smaller or larger bacterial cells is less effective size selective feeding does not require active predator choice bacteria smaller than 0 4 μm are seen as weakly affected by protozoan grazing and those larger than 2 4 μm are seen as grazing resistant hahn and höfle 2001 a common trait affecting the selectivity of grazing is bacteria cell shape for example coccus shaped bacteria are more preferably eaten than bacilli ones the characteristic of the bacterial cell surface also plays a significant role gram negative bacteria are preferred because their digestion lasts longer than gram positive bacteria pernthaler 2005 besides the more hydrophobic the surface of bacterial cells are the more often they become prey another feature that determines the feeding preferences of protozoa is the speed of movement of the prey which can work in two ways on the one hand fast swimming bacteria have a better chance to escape from the predator but on the other hand the high speed of movement increases the frequency of contact with protozoa and thus the threat of grazing taking into account such high filtration rates as mentioned above point 2 3 and the generally observed stability of activated sludge process it is evident that most protozoa are unable to graze on bacteria in flocs otherwise the pressure of protozoa should lead to complete extermination of bacteria moreover the ability to form flocs is believed to be mainly provoked by the selection pressure of protozoa as a result the overwhelming majority of bacteria are protected from protozoa grazing inside the activated sludge flocs 2 5 protozoa feeding on inanimate organic fractions taylor 1977 stated that larger ciliates are very limited in their ability to discriminate against particles in favor of bacteria the inability of protozoa to distinguish between bacteria and other particles may come from feeding behavior the food taken by protozoa concentrates while filtered out from the liquid sleigh 1989 water currents are created and drag particles toward a ciliary sieve where particles of size 0 3 to 5 μm are strain out pauli et al 2001b this process is inclusive and therefore abiotic and inorganic particles are also ingested sherr 1988 showed that flagellates could feed on high molecular weight polysaccharide curds and cockburn 1968 cultivated ciliate tetrahymena pyriformis on a pure protease peptone yeast extract medium protozoa grazing on organics other than bacteria is probably negligible bacteria remains their main source of food experiments conducted by hrudey 1982 showed that ciliates are unable to proliferate efficiently on peptone and their mass increase only after bacteria concentration rise since the food of protozoa is strain out from liquid on bases of the particles size apparently without any additional selection mechanisms grazing on other than bacteria organic fractions detached from activated sludge flocs should be considered the literature about the ability of the activated sludge protozoa to grow on organic fractions other than bacteria is contradictive this ambiguity should be resolved since it greatly influences the extent of selective pressure exerted on bacteria and raises a question of whether protozoa compete with heterotrophic bacteria for abiotic organic fractions 2 6 stability of the activated sludge process direct implementation of separate protozoa grazing on entire population of bacteria would create similar model behavior to the predator prey lotka volterra model lotka 1909 such models are known to predict high fluctuations of predator and prey populations resulting from strong coupling of growth kinetics of both components pauli et al 2001a with a decreasing prey population the source of food for predators the latter starts to decay due to insufficient food to population ratio it results in lower pressure on the prey population which steadily strives to its maximum while predators repeat the cycle fig 3 typical sludge retention time required to sustain heterotrophic bacteria is in range of days while in case of autotrophic bacteria in range of weeks even considering that the influent of raw wastewater contains an additional 106 bacteria per ml the ciliate population being around 10 000 ml 1 and achieving unit filtration rate of around 100 nl per hour should be able to digest all the bacteria during treatment leading to the complete removal of them from the system as a result biochemical transformation rates would strongly fluctuate causing catastrophic instability of wastewater treatment efficiency however such a situation does not occur in real wwtp therefore several aspects of modeling protozoa pressure on bacteria have to be addressed in order to avoid such instability the current modifications of the asm model moussa et al 2005 hao et al 2011 ni et al 2009 cannot be considered satisfactory the assumed model structure fig 2 generates wrong highly fluctuating time courses of bacteria and protozoa concentrations especially when real growth rates of protozoa table 1 would be considered the new model structure should eliminate such inadequate predictions the typical kinetic formula used to describe the relationship between bacteria and their substrates is given by eq 1 1 ds dt f x b s k s where s is the substrate xb is the bacteria thriving on a given substrate and k is the saturation coefficient assuming that the kinetic equations describing protozoa grazing on bacteria are analogous to those describing bacterial growth kinetics it would be possible to set up conditions that lead to the complete removal of bacteria if protozoa kinetic parameters are similar to those presented in table 1 it will be necessary to implement high values of bacteria saturation coefficients to avoid the complete removal of bacteria however it will still be possible to force a model to generate instability e g by artificially doubling protozoa mass but given the current knowledge about the activated sludge it is unlikely that the addition of protozoa to bioreactor could lead to the process failure it seems that a mechanism that prevents protozoa from exterminating all activated sludge bacteria is based on an intrinsic inability to get access to most of the bacteria gathered in flocs it is worth emphasizing that these phenomena cannot be correctly modeled based solely on the saturation coefficient 3 discussion and further model development the current approach to modeling decay with separate protozoa grazing processes poses both certain limitations to what extent such models can be used as well as question if it complies with actual knowledge on predatory organisms in activated sludge creating a common approach towards further studies in that subject should be based on a discussion of opposing facts found in literature keeping in mind the need for relative simplicity enabling model calibration under real conditions of its use information found regarding activated sludge protozoa indicates both their large number in that environment as well as growth rates exceeding those of nitrifiers under favorable conditions of substrate availability it would lead to complete decay of nitrifiers population and failure of the process such a situation does not occur in real activated sludge processes decay rates calculated solely based on protozoa number and their kinetics under the assumption of unrestricted access of protozoa to prey including entrapped inside sludge flocs are incorrect when confronted with values of decay rates found in the literature the decay rate values resulting from successful calibrations of current asm models mostly do not exceed 20 meaning that protozoa grazing being one of the decay components should not be higher than a dozen percent furthermore assuming protozoa are aerobes their predatory impact on activated sludge biomass under anoxic and anaerobic conditions should be accordingly lowered concerning dissolved oxygen concentration taking this into account the maximum grazing impact should not exceed the difference between respective maximum oxic and anoxic anaerobic decay rates another argument against highly intense grazing arises from the fact that it would lead to high oscillations in both protozoa and bacteria mass similar to the behavior of predator prey models such as the lotka volterra model such fluctuations are not observed in real activated sludge systems and are not predicted by current asm models the models properly predict relatively constant stationary biomass concentrations and stable decay rates the above points to additional factors regulating the relation between protozoa and activated sludge bacteria one of those may be associated with how protozoa feed filtration mechanism even though eliminating dispersed bacteria with deadly efficiency without distinction between particular species poses certain limitation in terms of size of particles prone to digestion elimination of protozoa leads to a substantial increase in the number of dispersed particles including bacteria causing severe deterioration of final clarifier effluent yet as mentioned above no steep process deterioration of process quality is observed which is likely caused by the fact that most of the biomass present in the activated sludge reactors is in the form of flocs which size exceeds that which can be digested by protozoa interrelation between dispersed and flocculated biomass has not been widely examined however strong indications are found that it is mainly associated with predator organisms selective pressure which intensifies flocculation of bacteria that fact should also be somehow included in future models as it may be crucial for ensuring stable predictions by models with separate grazing even if not clear it is worth mentioning that there is a possibility that protozoa may feed on other components of activated sludge such as organic fractions filtration mechanism of digestion suggest that this could happen but studies found in that topic contradict themselves making it inconclusive assuming that the rate of absorption of organic compounds by protozoa is proportional to the share of these compounds in the overall concentration of particles together with bacteria available to protozoa this would result in a decrease in pressure on bacteria groups question remains to what extent protozoa would be able to compete with heterotrophs towards their substrates and how this limit could be included in model equations as can be seen in brief discussion above several issues should be considered before modeling concept for protozoa activity is set up enabling adequate simulation of the actual process without undue complexity of the model that would require impractical calibration procedures the arguments presented above prove that modeling protozoa grazing as a separate process in models from the asm family has to be further studied in particular the aspect of instability has to be addressed due to its crucial impact on overall model behavior in this section the authors propose several modifications that could be possible solution since protozoa feed mostly on free swimming bacteria rather than flocs the authors propose to divide the simulated bacteria population heterotrophs aob nob depending on model complexity into two groups each of them would either simulate dispersed not flocculated bacteria xd or flocculated biomass xfl while free swimming bacteria would be in the vast majority consumed by protozoa the flocculated biomass would be highly resistant to predation due to its size exceeding mouth apparatus limitations the general concept of the new model is illustrated in fig 4 heterotrophic bacteria xh and nitrifiers xa without division into aob and nob are included both are divided into flocculated xh f and xa f and deflocculated xh d and xa d forms an extension for aob and nob is straightforward the authors propose that a fraction of each group in overall biomass concentration results from flocculation deflocculation and grazing steady state pseudo equilibrium and could be calculated from an expression similar to that of the reaction rate constant eq 2 however its value should depend on additional factors such as protozoa concentration as infers from numerous studies bossier and verstraete 1996 de schryver et al 2008 pauli et al 2001a these studies show that with increasing predation the pressure on floc forming processes is much stronger hence f x pr has been incorporated into the equation therefore with an increasing concentration of protozoa in activated sludge the k should tend to lower values reflecting stronger tendency for floc formation as opposed to a situation where protozoa are a small fraction in activated sludge leading to higher values of k and a more dispersed profile of biomass 2 k x d x pr x f 1 f x pr the rate of transformation between two biomass states eqs 3 and 4 is said to be dependent on the newly introduced flocculation and deflocculation coefficients kf and kd the values have yet to be established but it must be underlined that their values should be in close relation to the decay rate values presented in literature given the deadly efficiency of protozoa grazing on free swimming bacteria it can be assumed that dispersed bacteria are fully consumed by protozoa when taking into account the decay rates in the classic asm models the protozoa grazing rate should not exceed the difference between oxic and anoxic decay rates as it would lead to a lack of accordance with the data in literature additionally to simplify the development of future models the authors suggest the omitting of grazing on flocculated bacteria and instead include that process being a minor factor in the newly proposed deflocculation coefficient by slightly increasing its value 3 d x b f dt k d 4 d x b d dt k f the appropriate form of the right hand side in formula 3 and 4 requires research it seems that the first order formula with respect to the xb d and xb f concentrations would be a good first choice for deflocculation and flocculation rates respectively although there is no direct clue of protozoa preference towards any bacteria group as energy source the discussion presented in chapter 2 4 points at such possibility concerning ammonia oxidizers which are located close to the surface of activated sludge flocs thus can be more prone to protozoa grazing this fact should be taken into consideration even though as stated above protozoa graze mostly on dispersed bacteria with the deflocculation process this matter could be resolved by a slightly higher value of the deflocculation coefficient for aob than for nob the proposed modifications should not lead to overall predation rates higher than those found in literature therefore a careful approach has to be taken when elaborating new kinetic expressions and relationships between simulated components due to the scarce data on predation rates point 2 2 this aspect would likely be a major subject in further studies the authors are aware of the substantial level of complexity when trying to implement the above modifications fortunately experience with developing asm models suggests that such full detailed approach will probably be unnecessary in most cases significant simplifications proved fruitful we believe that the current highly simplified description of decay in the asm models could be significantly improved enabling modeling of bioaugmentation while maintaining the practicality of the model a simplified model of activated sludge flocs flocculation deflocculation plus a simple model of protozoa taken as one entity grazing only on dispersed bacteria probably would be enough these three additional processes will require a few kinetic parameters in addition to the 18 in the asm1 model and 54 in the asm2d model neither building nor calibration of such a model has yet been performed preliminary modeling studies performed by the authors of this paper look promising and will therefore be the subject of our future research considering that biomass loss is the composition of two processes in models with separate protozoa grazing to validate its accordance with existing and generally accepted models the sum of impact of both processes that lead to biomass decay has to be calculated therefore the authors propose the creation of an additional parameter called the substitute decay rate which could serve as a useful tool during calibration procedures the substitute decay rate is a sum of the decay rate and the rate of bacteria loss due to grazing for example consider the model presented by moussa et al 2005 where the mass of ammonia oxidizers is reduced in the process of decay as well as in the process of grazing the overall biomass loss rate coefficient can be calculated from eq 5 5 b a o b s u b b n h 4 k n h s n h k n h k o 2 s o 2 k o 2 μ p r e d s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 p r e d x n h x n h x n o x h such an equation can be compiled for every model it is clear that the overall biomass loss due to combined processes of decay and grazing b sub must be in comply with the values of the aerobic decay rates shown in table 2 in other words the value of the substitute decay rate coefficient should not be higher than the one found by fitting the classical model to the data additionally the value of the second term expressing the influence of protozoa in eq 1 should not be higher than the difference between the oxic and anoxic decay rate coefficients in the classical model 4 conclusions protozoa are widely studied in fields not directly connected to activated sludge modeling information gathered in those studies contain clues on the relationships between protozoa and other components of the activated sludge process data on the kinetic parameters of protozoa deduced from direct measurements are scarce however it can be assumed that maximum growth rates are equal or higher than 1 0 d 1 and somewhere between the growth rates of nitrifiers and heterotrophic bacteria only one set of data on the yield saturation constant and temperature coefficient has been found the values of aerobic decay rates obtained during calibrations of classical models include the influence of protozoa the typical values of aerobic decay rates for nitrifiers are ca 0 15 d 1 20 c and 0 3 0 4 d 1 20 c for heterotrophic bacteria in the case of separate modeling of protozoa grazing the cumulative rate of biomass loss due to a new decay process and grazing must comply with rates obtained in classical models it is proposed to check compliance by calculating a new variable called the substitute decay rate and compare its value to values of decay rates from classical models as protozoa are strictly aerobic the difference between classical aerobic and anoxic decay rates include the influence of protozoa therefore the rate of biomass loss due to protozoa activity cannot be higher than differences between classical aerobic and anoxic decay rate coefficient which are typically 0 05 0 15 d 1 20 c for nitrifiers and 0 2 0 3 d 1 20 c for heterotrophic bacteria all calibrations of new models with separate grazing should be checked for this compliance protozoa thrive mainly on free swimming bacteria this phenomenon should be included in models and the mass of bacteria available as prey for protozoa must not include most of the bacteria in flocs the rate of protozoa grazing should be limited by the available mass of free swimming bacteria and not by the saturation constant otherwise instability of model may occur as well as that approach would be inconsistent with mechanism of grazing it is proposed to divide bacteria into two groups dispersed and flocculated biomass the mass transfer for these two groups is modelled with flocculation and deflocculation constants it is believed that a steady state proportions of dispersed and flocculated biomass can be described with a formula similar to equilibrium constant protozoa only consumes dispersed bacteria this approach enables the modeling of the clarification effect as well as ensures that the model predicts the stability of the activated sludge process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

24639,african elephants loxodonta africana are well studied and inhabit diverse landscapes that are being transformed by both humans and natural forces most tools currently in use are limited in their ability to predict how elephants will respond to novel changes in the environment individual or agent based modeling abm may extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental conditions over time we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to simulate elephant space use and validated the model with movement data from elephants in kruger national park knp and chobe national park cnp we simulated movement at an hourly scale as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources including forage water and shade known internal drivers of elephant movement including perceived temperature and the time since an individual last visited a water source were linked to the external environment through behavior based movement rules simulations were run on model landscapes representing the wet season and the hot dry season for both parks the model outputs including home range size daily displacement distance net displacement distance and maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons to actual elephant movement data from both knp and cnp the abm was successful in reproducing the differences in daily displacements between seasons in each park and in distances traveled from a permanent water source between parks and seasons other movement characteristics including differences in home range sizes and net daily displacements were partially reproduced out of the all the statistical comparisons made between the empirical and simulated movement patterns the majority were classified as discrepancies of medium or small effect size we have shown that a resource driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data simulating hourly movement as our model does may be useful in predicting how finer scale patterns of space use such as those created by foraging movements are influenced by finer spatio temporal changes in the environment keywords pattern oriented modeling savanna elephants movement behavior 1 introduction fine scale data on the location of individual animals combined with statistical models facilitate the understanding of movement patterns and spatial use for many wildlife species hooten and johnson 2017 langrock and patterson 2016 leos barajas et al 2017 moorcroft 2012 patterson et al 2008 semeniuk et al 2011 this information may also allow us to predict the adaptive responses of animals to environmental changes including unprecedented human induced changes guo et al 2009 patterson et al 2017 2008 individual or agent based modeling can extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental change over time the flexibility of the agent based modeling abm framework makes it a useful tool for simulating fine scale animal movement as empirical data on the assumed drivers of movement e g extrinsic and intrinsic factors can be employed to devise movement rules associated with habitat utilization these rules in turn can then be linked to a model environment characterized by relevant attributes including and not limited to habitat quality resource availability and prey densities aben et al 2014 carter et al 2015 philips 2020 watkins et al 2015 consequentially abms enable the emergence of movement properties from small scale interactions through time and allow for predictions of patterns at a larger scale by comparing abm outputs to individual level movement data we can begin to uncover how external factors internal states navigation capabilities and motion capacities interact to drive the decision processes that shape individual movement phases and ultimately the movement path nathan et al 2008 because movement decisions determine whether and how an individual will obtain critical resources modeling movement is a first step in predicting the influence of changing environments on populations folse et al 1989 many abms designed to simulate wildlife movement with the intention of utilizing the models for conservation or management purposes are context specific and focus on specific populations for instance abms with management intentions have been developed for huemul deer hippocamelus bisulcus in chile lópez alfaro et al 2012 and for assessing landscape connectivity for bighorn sheep ovis canadensis in british columbia allen et al 2016 questions that have been posed regarding any model developed for particular management purposes include the following how well does the model describe the ecological system being simulated in this case space utilization of individuals further can the model be applied to other ecological systems of similar type in different geographical areas or spatial contexts evans et al 2013 latombe et al 2011 sun et al 2016 confidence that models adequately capture the mechanisms that comprise the natural system may be limited if they are tested only under a limited set of conditions savanna elephants loxodonta africana provide an example of a well studied species inhabiting variable landscapes that are being increasingly altered by both humans and natural causes that may alter their behaviors gara et al 2016a mpakairi 2019a vanak et al 2010 wilkie and douglas hamilton 2018 how elephants utilize and move through an environment has implications for the effect elephants have on the landscape coverdale 2016 valeix et al 2011 other species e g nasseri et al 2010 tambling et al 2013 guldemond and van aarde 2007 guldemond et al 2017 and people e g jackson et al 2008 sitati et al 2003 additionally the movement patterns of elephants directly influence their population dynamics robson and van aarde 2018 young and van aarde 2010 their movement patterns and consequent spatial distribution are strongly influenced by a combination of factors duffy et al 2011 harris et al 2008 roever et al 2012 roever et al 2013b roever et al 2014 knegt et al 2011 loarie et al 2009 et al western and lindsay 1984 etc including vegetation greenness distribution of water sources and environmental temperature branco et al 2019 gara et al 2017 2016 kinahan et al 2007 loarie et al 2009a loarie et al 2009b mpakairi et al 2019 purdon and van aarde 2017b thaker et al 2019 wall et al 2013 wato et al 2018 recently an abm has been developed to simulate elephant presence and absence in kenya and tanzania s amboseli basin wherein daily relocations to and from dispersal areas were assumed to be driven by vegetation quality vegetation quantity and the availability of water boult et al 2018 their model displayed relatively good fit with the observed presence and absence of real elephants suggesting that resource driven models are effective at predicting the onset of large scale movement and range shifts however many of the environmental changes that are likely to impact elephants in the future may elicit behavioral responses at finer scales for example increases in environmental temperature increase the occurrence of thermoregulatory behaviors such as shade use and wetting possibly at the expense of foraging behavior mole et al 2016 thus to explore how environmental factors such as changes in temperature or the distribution and availability of water across a reserve alter spatial use and ultimately population dynamics movement must be simulated at finer spatiotemporal scales such a spatially explicit movement model would then be used to inform future management and conservation planning of elephants across africa more importantly fine scale movement models can be integrated with broader scale models such as those simulating migration or range shifts like boult s et al 2018 model connecting movement processes across scales to draw a more comprehensive picture of elephant spatial use patterns through time to test the applicability of a resource driven model of elephant space utilization we developed a spatially explicit abm for their movement we aimed to assess the utility of the abm in simulating finer scale elephant movement patterns and subsequent space utilization than the model used by boult et al 2018 we simulated movement at an hourly scale as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources including forage water and shade the goal was to validate a model for elephant movement and use it to reproduce movement responses to heterogeneity and current conditions we used published information derived from the extensive literature see tables 2 and 3 for model assumptions relevant parameters and supporting references rather than directly calibrating the model with empirical data our abm then allowed movement characteristics including commonly calculated home range sizes diel displacements total distance traveled daily and net daily displacements distance between last location and first location of each day to emerge from conditions experienced by the individual elephant or family unit termed agent in the abm such as the sensitivity of the agent to ambient temperatures grimm and railsback 2012 suggest the use of multiple patterns to test applicability of an abm that is to assess the abm by its ability to fit multiple observed patterns in data reasonably well rather than focusing on fitting one observed pattern very well in the case of modeling animal movement if expected patterns arise under multiple conditions or scenarios there is a greater possibility that the structure of the model accurately represents the processes that shape the spatiotemporal movements of individuals through complex environments grimm and railsback 2012 to test the model s robustness to different landscape conditions we implemented a cell based or raster approach representing two geographical areas with different spatiotemporal characteristics and patterns of food abundance water availability and distribution tree cover and temperature we incorporated published external and internal drivers of elephant movement and linked these drivers to the external environment through hierarchical behavior based movement rules in this way we extended our modeling framework to test the generality of an abm for elephant movement over a range of environmental conditions 2 methods 2 1 study sites model landscapes chobe national park cnp and surrounding protected areas in botswana and kruger national park knp in south africa are home to large populations of elephants these two areas were used as our model landscapes and movement data from elephants living there were used for model validation simulations were run separately for each study site we excluded the northern portion of the area comprising cnp see fig 1 and all movement data there as towns and human activity in the area altered elephant movement tempe et al 2017 for both parks the dry season extends from june to october while the wet season extends from november to march april and may signal the end of the wet season and beginning of the dry season respectively cnp and the surrounding reserves used in the model span about 17 000 km2 in northern botswana and are characterized by woodland savanna and grassland ecosystems cnp is unfenced and elephants moved between the park and several bordering areas knp spans an area of about 19 000 km2 and is partially fenced arid bushveld and lowveld bushveld are present in the north and south respectively codron et al 2006 venter et al 2003 vegetation is dominated by mopane colophospermum mopane woodlands in the north and combretum and acacia species in the south 2 2 model overview movement was simulated by incorporating the assumed main drivers of elephant movement into a hierarchal decision making process where the higher priorities were to respond behaviorally to ambient temperature and the need to drink water and foraging became an option once those needs were met each behavioral response was accomplished by directed movement a complete and detailed model description following the overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 grimm et al 2020 is contained in the supplementary information the entities within the model were the agents landscape cells and environment here the agent was represented by an elephant family unit which is one of the simplest levels of social hierarchy in elephant populations wittemyer et al 2005 the agent was mobile and responded to the environment by changing its movement across the landscape the agent was characterized by the following state variables and attributes 1 its state which represented the sensitivity of the agent to ambient temperatures 2 its position on the landscape x and y coordinates at any given time step 3 the time since it last visited a water source 4 the behavior that it was employing i e wetting shade use drinking or foraging and 5 the ambient temperature that it was experiencing at a given time step perceived temperature model entities and state variables are described in table 1 attributes of landscape cells were 1 greenness updated every time step to reflect vegetation change 2 percent tree cover and 3 a binary value indicating whether or not water sources were present in the cell state variables included 1 environmental temperature hourly temperature was downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national center for environmental information and missing values were estimated using spline interpolation samanta et al 2012 and 2 the number of cells within the landscape that increased in greenness the model landscapes comprised separate rasters representing the aforementioned attributes of our study areas during the wet and dry season fig 1 the spatial extent for the two areas differed and was approximately 360 km by 120 km for knp and 160 km by 128 km for cnp and surrounding protected areas each of the cells comprising the model landscape had a spatial resolution of 30 m by 30 m for greenness we utilized landsat s remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index a spectral vegetation index calculated as the ratio of reflected energy in the near infrared and visible portions of the light spectrum hereafter evi evi is a useful proxy for resource availability and the quality of vegetation he et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 pettorelli et al 2011 ryan et al 2012 the date associated with the evi data used for each simulation corresponded to the time of movement tracking for elephants in each park and each season simulations were run for 336 time steps representing a temporal resolution of one hour and a temporal extent of two weeks we used 336 time steps as the duration of our simulations to strike a balance between having a trajectory that was ecologically meaningful in representing spatial use and to minimize computational intensity additionally a simulation duration of 2 weeks closely matched the time differences in consecutive satellite images 16 days used to determine changes in vegetation greenness through out the simulation each simulation was paired with one empirical trajectory that started at the same location the main processes within the model which were repeated every time step constituted the agent s decision making as it moved through a landscape the agent first decided whether it sought shade or water to maintain homeothermy this decision was influenced by the current perceived temperature the agent s state and the temperature threshold above which behavioral thermoregulation was likely to occur agents moved within a specified search radius which represented the maximum distance that elephants were likely to move in one hour and differed depending on the behavior employed there was a higher probability of forming a smaller search radius than a larger search radius 0 9 km and 1 8 km respectively when employing thermoregulatory behavior we assumed that elephants preferred to employ wetting behavior if a water source was within the search radius due to the benefits of evaporative cooling if no water source was present in the search radius the agent employed shade use within the smaller search radius the agent s state was a binary variable meant to represent the differences in sensitivity to environmental temperatures between family groups with calves and those without calves mole et al 2016 and differences in mobility between family groups with and without calves ngene et al 2010 if the agent did not have to employ thermoregulation it then decided whether to drink this decision was determined based on the time since the agent last visited a water source including instances of wetting and the perceived environmental temperature as the time since the agent last visited a water source increased and as the environmental temperature increased there was an increased probability of it drinking we incorporated spatial memory relating to water sources in our model by allowing our elephant agents to sense the location of water sources across the landscape and to move in the direction of the closest water source several studies reported that elephants make directed movements towards close water sources and have knowledge on the spatial distribution of water sources in the landscape polansky et al 2015 wato et al 2018 agents could move within a search radius of 1 8 km if the agent did not employ thermoregulatory behavior or drinking the model assumed it would forage we incorporated memory relating to the vegetation quality of areas that the agent has recently visited by allowing the agent to remember the quality of recently visited areas and adjust its movement tortuosity to remain in relatively higher quality areas the agent was assumed to be aware of the evi values for areas within its search radius that were visited recently within the last three time steps and used a running average of these values to decide which cell was likely to be the best to next visit to forage movement resembling area restricted search was performed if evi values were greater than or equal to the running average in its memory and more directed movement was performed if evi values were less than the running average the agent moved anywhere within a smaller or larger search radius depending on its state agents representing family groups with calves moved up to 0 9 km when foraging while those without calves moved up to 1 8 km this difference represented the limitations that calves may impose on family groups when moving table 2 describes model parameters for each behavior and supporting references and table 3 describes cell selection strategies the agent uses for each behavior and supporting references a simplified flowchart of the agent s decision making process is depicted in fig 2 we ran ten simulations for each empirical trajectory with each simulated trajectory starting at the same location as its corresponding empirical trajectory we aimed to generate enough simulated trajectories per empirical trajectory such that the resulting average value of each movement characteristic calculated from the ten simulated trajectories would be an accurate representation of model performance examples of an empirical trajectory and corresponding simulated trajectories are depicted in fig 3 examples of a simulated trajectory segmented by time of day is depicted in fig 4 3 model validation 3 1 movement data for elephants in cnp and knp between 2012 and 2014 satellite collars africa wildlife tracking pretoria south africa were placed on elephant cows from areas within and surrounding cnp and knp the satellite collars recorded locations at about hourly intervals only movement data from elephants with trajectories confined to the raster areas shown in fig 1 were include in our analysis as such movement data from four elephants in cnp and nine elephants in knp were considered in the analysis all elephants whose movement data were used were from different family units movement paths were segmented into two week 14 day trajectories and the first two week trajectory of every month was used for each elephant we used dynamic brownian bridge movement models to calculate home range size for each trajectory as it has been suggested to better estimate the utilization distribution of animals wilson et al 2020 and has been used to identify utilization distributions for african and sumatran elephant populations in other recent studies evans et al 2020 wilson et al 2020 wilson et al 2021 methods for determining 1 home range size 2 diel and 3 net daily displacement as well as 4 maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source are described in the appendix section 2 3 1 1 activity budgets of real elephants to validate the activity budgets calculated from the abm we used parameters derived from the relevant literature see table 2 for patterns present in the literature chamaillé jammes et al 2013 mole et al 2016 purdon van aarde 2017 shannon et al 2008 3 2 analyzing movement patterns of elephants we used linear mixed models lmms to identify differences in the mean of the four movement characteristics between parks and seasons for the empirical data the full model for each response variable included season dry vs wet park knp vs cnp and their interaction as fixed effects with a random effect of year nested within individual elephant id to account for both repeated observations of individuals and individual variation in movement patterns among years p values for each model effect were determined using likelihood ratio tests comparing simpler nested models lacking the effect with the more complex model including the effect using the anova function in r for a qualitative comparison between simulated and empirical data rather than identifying whether significant differences existed between the simulated and empirical data we used lmms to determine whether the model was able to reproduce the patterns in movement characteristics that were present in the empirical data the full lmm included the same variables as the one described above for a quantitative comparison we also used lmms to identify differences in the movement characteristics between the simulated and empirical data a final term to indicate whether the data was simulated or empirical was included within these lmms as well as interactions between this term and the fixed effects data were transformed to meet assumptions of parametric statistics we then standardized the data to express all parameter estimates in terms of effect sizes a more detailed description of the full models for each response variable is included in the appendix section 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis a one factor at a time local sensitivity analysis of the model determined the sensitivity of the model outputs to parameter uncertainties we varied each input parameter from the original reference values table a3 by 10 and observed the magnitude of the corresponding change in model outputs as effect sizes this was again accomplished using linear mixed models lmms in which we compared the original model outputs with the outputs obtained when a given parameter was altered 4 results 4 1 empirical elephant movement patterns elephants generally moved greater distances in cnp than in knp this is reflected in cnp having larger home range sizes p 0 007 greater ddds p 0 001 greater ndds p 0 004 and longer maximum distances traveled to and from water p 0 002 elephants additionally tended to move greater distances in the wet season than in the dry season this is again reflected in the wet season having larger home range sizes p 0 001 greater net daily displacement distances p 0 001 and longer maximum distance traveled from water p 0 001 for diel displacement distance there was a significant interaction between park and season p 0 002 this reflects a significantly greater diel displacement distance in the wet season than in the dry season at knp p 0 001 but no difference between seasons in cnp p 0 974 for more detailed analysis of the empirical movement data see the appendix section 3 4 2 validation results 4 2 1 qualitative comparison to empirical data to qualitatively explore model performance we assessed whether our model was able to reproduce the nine movement patterns present in the empirical data see table 4 four movement patterns including those associated with diel displacement distance and maximum distances moved from a permanent water source were reproduced fig 5 the other movement patterns were at least partially reproduced table 4 4 2 2 quantitative comparisons to empirical data four of the 16 statistical comparisons between empirical and simulated movement patterns were categorized as discrepancies of large effect size three as discrepancies of medium effect size while the remainder were categorized as of small to very small differences cohen 1988 table 5 discrepancies of large effect sizes associated with home range size diel displacement distance and net displacement distance were mainly driven by the simulations underestimating movement characteristics in cnp while overestimating those in knp 4 2 3 activity budgets table 6 shows patterns associated with activity budgets for simulated agents and those found in relevant literature including the time spent employing thermoregulatory and foraging behavior and the links between these behaviors and environmental temperature 4 3 sensitivity analysis movement characteristics were most sensitive to 1 increases in the probability of employing drinking behavior at any given time since the agent last visited a water source 2 increases and decreases in the parameters determining the turning angles when the agent foraged and 3 decreases in the temperature threshold for employing behavioral thermoregulation tables a 5 a 8 changes in the paramaters associated with turning angles resulted in the greatest effect sizes ranging from 0 133 to 0 359 indicating that simulated movement is particularly sensitive to changes in this parameter of the four movement characteristics home range size and net displacement were most sensitive to changes in the parameters associated with turning angles a more detailed description of the sensitivity analysis is provided in the appendix section 4 5 discussion simulated and empirical home range sizes differed statistically between parks and between seasons however the direction of the seasonal and park effect generally matched between simulated and empirical home range sizes our abm was also successful at reproducing some differences in ddd and ndd between seasons particularly for knp the increased rainfall associated with the transition from dry to wet season increased the availability of forage and water relaxing movement constraints to permanent water and triggering an expansion of movement and of the home range birkett et al 2012 buchholtz et al 2019 loarie et al 2009 stokke and du toit 2002 the seasonal differences in water availability were likely the major reason why our abm was able to simulate the increased movement increased fine scale heterogeneity associated with wet season conditions may have prompted increased movement as the potential gain from food resources outweighed the cost of moving see polansky et al 2013 simulated elephants moving through areas with consistently homogenous forage quality when the average evi of the search radius was greater than or equal to the running average evi of recently visited locations tended to display more tortuous and shorter movements increasing the likelihood of remaining in high evi areas however if our evi raster layer captured the increased fine scale heterogeneity associated with the wet season simulated elephants should have increased daily displacements relative to the dry season because the quality of cells that are farther away from the agent may inevitably outweigh the cost of moving to those cells our simulated elephants also traveled farther from permanent water in cnp compared to knp and during the wet season compared to the dry season a general pattern found in real elephant populations bastille rousseau et al 2020 jackson et al 2008 loarie et al 2009 stokke and du toit 2002 in cnp and the surrounding protected areas the chobe river constitutes the major source of permanent water fox and alexander 2015 and elephants often disperse many kilometers inland to seasonal water sources alwij et al 2010 this is in contrast to the abundance and wide distribution of both seasonal and permanent water in knp where it is physically not possible for elephants to move too far from permanent water purdon and van aarde 2017b redfern 2003 the temporal patterns of movement of our elephant agents are similar to those observed in real elephants model agents spent a total number of hours foraging that were comparable to real elephants and spent more time avoiding heat in the afternoon when temperatures were higher guy 1976 mole et al 2016 shannon et al 2008 5 1 discrepancies between the model outputs and empirical data discrepancies of medium to large effect size in three of the four movement characteristics between the empirical and simulated data were not unexpected as model outputs rarely fit actual data perfectly rather than try to explain why there were some quantitative differences between movement characteristics calculated for simulated and empirical data we focused on identifying potential reasons for the model s limited ability to reproduce certain patterns between study areas and between seasons 5 1 1 human interference our model was not able to reproduce the significantly greater ndd and ddd observed in cnp compared to knp based on the empirical data these discrepancies may be due in part to the exclusion of anthropogenic influences on elephants within the model throughout the time period that elephant movement was monitored knp experienced one instance of elephant poaching lunstrum 2014 in botswana however a steady increase in poaching has been documented since 2010 lindsay et al 2017 schlossberg et al 2019 2020 poaching affects the movement of elephant populations by creating a landscape of fear in which individuals move in straighter lines ihwagi et al 2019 or shift their ranges goldenberg et al 2018 away from areas where poaching activity is higher neil et al 2020 developed an abm which incorporated adaptive poacher agents rangers and elephants to predict how the interactions between these entities affect elephant poaching levels the authors suggested that incorporating avoidance of poaching hotspots in the model could alter elephant distribution and subsequent poaching levels neil et al 2020 the presence of humans not associated with poaching may also shape an elephant s landscape of fear jackson et al 2008 mpakairi 2019a roever et al 2013a songhurst et al 2020 wittemyer et al 2017 within the model areas favorable for foraging will generally elicit movement with greater tortuosity and shorter step lengths however if the corresponding area in the real world is also a risky area the movements of actual elephants may potentially be much straighter and of longer duration in order to quickly move through the area graham et al 2009 ihwagi et al 2019 vollrath 2005 small villages border knp cook et al 2015 but there are no villages within our study area in knp there are however several villages bordering the chobe forest reserve included within our study area near cnp failing to account for the increased risk perceived by elephants passing through these human impacted areas may have contributed to the model producing trajectories with lower ddds and ndds than expected in cnp including poaching hot spots and areas of human habitation as raster layers within the model may be more important for cnp compared to knp and would allow agents to employ realistic avoidance behavior other models have incorporated risky areas into habitat selection models for elephants roever et al 2013a roever et al 2013b for example by including carcass locations as representations of risky areas in a habitat selection model for elephants in northern botswana roever et al 2013a found that protected areas were not necessarily associated with decreases in mortality risk as one would expect roever et al 2013a 5 1 2 environmental predictability and spatial memory spatial memory can shape animal space utilization patterns by allowing for non random returns to locations within the landscape gautestad 2011 gautestad and mysterud 2010a tsalyuk et al 2019 found that elephant movement was influenced by long term vegetation conditions more so than current conditions it is possible to simulate long term spatial memory within abms by incorporating past conditions into the model environment and allowing the agent to make decisions based on these conditions bracis and mueller 2017 developed an abm in which zebra agents remembered long term averages of past habitat conditions represented by averaging remotely sensed vegetation indices in the past and made movement decisions based on these long term averages of habitat conditions rather than on current conditions spatial memory may be represented by two streams that make up a memory map one stream prevents an individual from returning to areas recently visited while the other draws individuals to attractive habitats also referred to as reference and working memory respectively bracis et al 2015 folse et al 1989 van moorter et al 2009 whether spatial memory influences fine scale movement decisions in areas where the quality of forage resources is not easily predictable remains to be further studied we suggest that modeling spatial memory relating to water sources arguably the strongest driver of elephant movement during the dry season was sufficient to produce a relatively good fit between the model and the empirical data in the dry season the need to return to water sources may regularly override the desire to re visit traditionally favorable foraging sites during the wet season the increased abundance and quality of food may decrease the need to remember specific areas and increase exploratory movements tsalyuk et al 2019 spatial memory may thus play a less important role in accessing food resources for elephants than it does in accessing water sources to augment our foraging submodel to capture spatial memory processes related to food resources we would need a better understanding of the extent to which spatial memory related to vegetation characteristics plays a role in dictating movement decisions during the wet season 5 1 3 foraging preferences and the issue of scale to improve our foraging sub model we would need a greater understanding of the spatial scale at which elephants make foraging decisions at hourly time steps whether our vegetation greenness evi raster s resolution of 30 m represents too fine of a spatial scale for elephants to base their foraging decisions on remains to be tested de knegt et al 2011 contended that fine scale foraging decisions may be made after elephants select larger scale areas of high forage availability within the spatial constraints of water we know that elephants prefer greener than average vegetation at the scale of 250 and 500 m loarie et al 2009 and can select favorable patches even at scales of 100 m2s pretorius et al 2011 thus it is possible that elephants may make hourly foraging decisions at finer spatial scales to exploit preferential feeding sites our model does not include any spatial information that would allow our agents to base their movement decisions on preferences for specific feeding sites in the wet season when vegetation is more variable elephants may make exploratory movements to seek out areas with high quality forage loarie et al 2009 tsalyuk et al 2019 young et al 2009 if real elephants are exploring the landscape for preferred feeding sites in the wet season rather than simply selecting for greenness within their vicinity they may travel greater distances than our elephant agents and display less tortuous movement the inability of our simulated elephants to make exploratory movements may be one of the reasons for our model underestimating wet season home range sizes daily displacement distances and net daily displacement distances for cnp 5 1 4 social interactions previous studies have revealed the impact of socioecological factors including social rank status on movement characteristics such as daily travel distance polansky et al 2013 wittemyer et al 2008 and use of preferred habitats wittemyer et al 2007 via resource competition within the model the rules dictating the agent s behavior reflect potential decision making processes in which it selects for the highest quality resources available on the landscape if socioecological factors are altering elephants decision rules such that they can no longer select for the preferred high quality resources we will see discrepancies between our model outputs and empirical data 6 conclusions we have shown that a resource driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data by analyzing the differences in the model s ability to reproduce realistic movement for elephants in cnp and knp we were able to identify potential causes for the discrepancies between model outputs and empirical data the addition of location specific information on risky areas may be the most immediately feasible way to extend the applicability of our movement model particularly for cnp coarser scale movement models such as boult et al 2018 which predicts the presence or absence of elephants in the study area are suitable for predicting how dispersal movements may be influenced by landscape features in contrast simulating hourly movement as our model does may be more useful in predicting how finer scale patterns of space use such as those created by foraging movements are influenced by finer spatio temporal changes in the environment these include changes in daily temperatures and in the distribution of water and shade that in the future may change in response to climate change for example our model was able to predict how elephants travel further from permanent water in the wet season compared to the dry season by tracking hourly differences in the movement of simulated elephants we can deduce that simulated elephants were able to take advantage of the increase in surface water availability by using the seasonal water sources in addition to the permanent water sources using our model with artificial landscapes in which we decrease the availability of surface water to simulate the conditions predicted for southern africa under scenarios of climate change kusangaya et al 2014 we can explore potential hypotheses regarding changes in spatial use for example whether a decrease in water availability will further constrain movement and limit access to forage resources ultimately movement is a fundamental process that connects individuals with the resources needed to survive thus impacting population dynamics nathan et al 2008 a spatially explicit movement model such as the one we have described here can be combined with a bioenergetics model that tracks energy acquisition and expenditure of multiple elephant agents through time scales longer than two weeks we would then be able to explore the effects that changing availabilities and distributions of critical resources may

24639,african elephants loxodonta africana are well studied and inhabit diverse landscapes that are being transformed by both humans and natural forces most tools currently in use are limited in their ability to predict how elephants will respond to novel changes in the environment individual or agent based modeling abm may extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental conditions over time we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to simulate elephant space use and validated the model with movement data from elephants in kruger national park knp and chobe national park cnp we simulated movement at an hourly scale as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources including forage water and shade known internal drivers of elephant movement including perceived temperature and the time since an individual last visited a water source were linked to the external environment through behavior based movement rules simulations were run on model landscapes representing the wet season and the hot dry season for both parks the model outputs including home range size daily displacement distance net displacement distance and maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons to actual elephant movement data from both knp and cnp the abm was successful in reproducing the differences in daily displacements between seasons in each park and in distances traveled from a permanent water source between parks and seasons other movement characteristics including differences in home range sizes and net daily displacements were partially reproduced out of the all the statistical comparisons made between the empirical and simulated movement patterns the majority were classified as discrepancies of medium or small effect size we have shown that a resource driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data simulating hourly movement as our model does may be useful in predicting how finer scale patterns of space use such as those created by foraging movements are influenced by finer spatio temporal changes in the environment keywords pattern oriented modeling savanna elephants movement behavior 1 introduction fine scale data on the location of individual animals combined with statistical models facilitate the understanding of movement patterns and spatial use for many wildlife species hooten and johnson 2017 langrock and patterson 2016 leos barajas et al 2017 moorcroft 2012 patterson et al 2008 semeniuk et al 2011 this information may also allow us to predict the adaptive responses of animals to environmental changes including unprecedented human induced changes guo et al 2009 patterson et al 2017 2008 individual or agent based modeling can extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental change over time the flexibility of the agent based modeling abm framework makes it a useful tool for simulating fine scale animal movement as empirical data on the assumed drivers of movement e g extrinsic and intrinsic factors can be employed to devise movement rules associated with habitat utilization these rules in turn can then be linked to a model environment characterized by relevant attributes including and not limited to habitat quality resource availability and prey densities aben et al 2014 carter et al 2015 philips 2020 watkins et al 2015 consequentially abms enable the emergence of movement properties from small scale interactions through time and allow for predictions of patterns at a larger scale by comparing abm outputs to individual level movement data we can begin to uncover how external factors internal states navigation capabilities and motion capacities interact to drive the decision processes that shape individual movement phases and ultimately the movement path nathan et al 2008 because movement decisions determine whether and how an individual will obtain critical resources modeling movement is a first step in predicting the influence of changing environments on populations folse et al 1989 many abms designed to simulate wildlife movement with the intention of utilizing the models for conservation or management purposes are context specific and focus on specific populations for instance abms with management intentions have been developed for huemul deer hippocamelus bisulcus in chile lópez alfaro et al 2012 and for assessing landscape connectivity for bighorn sheep ovis canadensis in british columbia allen et al 2016 questions that have been posed regarding any model developed for particular management purposes include the following how well does the model describe the ecological system being simulated in this case space utilization of individuals further can the model be applied to other ecological systems of similar type in different geographical areas or spatial contexts evans et al 2013 latombe et al 2011 sun et al 2016 confidence that models adequately capture the mechanisms that comprise the natural system may be limited if they are tested only under a limited set of conditions savanna elephants loxodonta africana provide an example of a well studied species inhabiting variable landscapes that are being increasingly altered by both humans and natural causes that may alter their behaviors gara et al 2016a mpakairi 2019a vanak et al 2010 wilkie and douglas hamilton 2018 how elephants utilize and move through an environment has implications for the effect elephants have on the landscape coverdale 2016 valeix et al 2011 other species e g nasseri et al 2010 tambling et al 2013 guldemond and van aarde 2007 guldemond et al 2017 and people e g jackson et al 2008 sitati et al 2003 additionally the movement patterns of elephants directly influence their population dynamics robson and van aarde 2018 young and van aarde 2010 their movement patterns and consequent spatial distribution are strongly influenced by a combination of factors duffy et al 2011 harris et al 2008 roever et al 2012 roever et al 2013b roever et al 2014 knegt et al 2011 loarie et al 2009 et al western and lindsay 1984 etc including vegetation greenness distribution of water sources and environmental temperature branco et al 2019 gara et al 2017 2016 kinahan et al 2007 loarie et al 2009a loarie et al 2009b mpakairi et al 2019 purdon and van aarde 2017b thaker et al 2019 wall et al 2013 wato et al 2018 recently an abm has been developed to simulate elephant presence and absence in kenya and tanzania s amboseli basin wherein daily relocations to and from dispersal areas were assumed to be driven by vegetation quality vegetation quantity and the availability of water boult et al 2018 their model displayed relatively good fit with the observed presence and absence of real elephants suggesting that resource driven models are effective at predicting the onset of large scale movement and range shifts however many of the environmental changes that are likely to impact elephants in the future may elicit behavioral responses at finer scales for example increases in environmental temperature increase the occurrence of thermoregulatory behaviors such as shade use and wetting possibly at the expense of foraging behavior mole et al 2016 thus to explore how environmental factors such as changes in temperature or the distribution and availability of water across a reserve alter spatial use and ultimately population dynamics movement must be simulated at finer spatiotemporal scales such a spatially explicit movement model would then be used to inform future management and conservation planning of elephants across africa more importantly fine scale movement models can be integrated with broader scale models such as those simulating migration or range shifts like boult s et al 2018 model connecting movement processes across scales to draw a more comprehensive picture of elephant spatial use patterns through time to test the applicability of a resource driven model of elephant space utilization we developed a spatially explicit abm for their movement we aimed to assess the utility of the abm in simulating finer scale elephant movement patterns and subsequent space utilization than the model used by boult et al 2018 we simulated movement at an hourly scale as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources including forage water and shade the goal was to validate a model for elephant movement and use it to reproduce movement responses to heterogeneity and current conditions we used published information derived from the extensive literature see tables 2 and 3 for model assumptions relevant parameters and supporting references rather than directly calibrating the model with empirical data our abm then allowed movement characteristics including commonly calculated home range sizes diel displacements total distance traveled daily and net daily displacements distance between last location and first location of each day to emerge from conditions experienced by the individual elephant or family unit termed agent in the abm such as the sensitivity of the agent to ambient temperatures grimm and railsback 2012 suggest the use of multiple patterns to test applicability of an abm that is to assess the abm by its ability to fit multiple observed patterns in data reasonably well rather than focusing on fitting one observed pattern very well in the case of modeling animal movement if expected patterns arise under multiple conditions or scenarios there is a greater possibility that the structure of the model accurately represents the processes that shape the spatiotemporal movements of individuals through complex environments grimm and railsback 2012 to test the model s robustness to different landscape conditions we implemented a cell based or raster approach representing two geographical areas with different spatiotemporal characteristics and patterns of food abundance water availability and distribution tree cover and temperature we incorporated published external and internal drivers of elephant movement and linked these drivers to the external environment through hierarchical behavior based movement rules in this way we extended our modeling framework to test the generality of an abm for elephant movement over a range of environmental conditions 2 methods 2 1 study sites model landscapes chobe national park cnp and surrounding protected areas in botswana and kruger national park knp in south africa are home to large populations of elephants these two areas were used as our model landscapes and movement data from elephants living there were used for model validation simulations were run separately for each study site we excluded the northern portion of the area comprising cnp see fig 1 and all movement data there as towns and human activity in the area altered elephant movement tempe et al 2017 for both parks the dry season extends from june to october while the wet season extends from november to march april and may signal the end of the wet season and beginning of the dry season respectively cnp and the surrounding reserves used in the model span about 17 000 km2 in northern botswana and are characterized by woodland savanna and grassland ecosystems cnp is unfenced and elephants moved between the park and several bordering areas knp spans an area of about 19 000 km2 and is partially fenced arid bushveld and lowveld bushveld are present in the north and south respectively codron et al 2006 venter et al 2003 vegetation is dominated by mopane colophospermum mopane woodlands in the north and combretum and acacia species in the south 2 2 model overview movement was simulated by incorporating the assumed main drivers of elephant movement into a hierarchal decision making process where the higher priorities were to respond behaviorally to ambient temperature and the need to drink water and foraging became an option once those needs were met each behavioral response was accomplished by directed movement a complete and detailed model description following the overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 grimm et al 2020 is contained in the supplementary information the entities within the model were the agents landscape cells and environment here the agent was represented by an elephant family unit which is one of the simplest levels of social hierarchy in elephant populations wittemyer et al 2005 the agent was mobile and responded to the environment by changing its movement across the landscape the agent was characterized by the following state variables and attributes 1 its state which represented the sensitivity of the agent to ambient temperatures 2 its position on the landscape x and y coordinates at any given time step 3 the time since it last visited a water source 4 the behavior that it was employing i e wetting shade use drinking or foraging and 5 the ambient temperature that it was experiencing at a given time step perceived temperature model entities and state variables are described in table 1 attributes of landscape cells were 1 greenness updated every time step to reflect vegetation change 2 percent tree cover and 3 a binary value indicating whether or not water sources were present in the cell state variables included 1 environmental temperature hourly temperature was downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national center for environmental information and missing values were estimated using spline interpolation samanta et al 2012 and 2 the number of cells within the landscape that increased in greenness the model landscapes comprised separate rasters representing the aforementioned attributes of our study areas during the wet and dry season fig 1 the spatial extent for the two areas differed and was approximately 360 km by 120 km for knp and 160 km by 128 km for cnp and surrounding protected areas each of the cells comprising the model landscape had a spatial resolution of 30 m by 30 m for greenness we utilized landsat s remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index a spectral vegetation index calculated as the ratio of reflected energy in the near infrared and visible portions of the light spectrum hereafter evi evi is a useful proxy for resource availability and the quality of vegetation he et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 pettorelli et al 2011 ryan et al 2012 the date associated with the evi data used for each simulation corresponded to the time of movement tracking for elephants in each park and each season simulations were run for 336 time steps representing a temporal resolution of one hour and a temporal extent of two weeks we used 336 time steps as the duration of our simulations to strike a balance between having a trajectory that was ecologically meaningful in representing spatial use and to minimize computational intensity additionally a simulation duration of 2 weeks closely matched the time differences in consecutive satellite images 16 days used to determine changes in vegetation greenness through out the simulation each simulation was paired with one empirical trajectory that started at the same location the main processes within the model which were repeated every time step constituted the agent s decision making as it moved through a landscape the agent first decided whether it sought shade or water to maintain homeothermy this decision was influenced by the current perceived temperature the agent s state and the temperature threshold above which behavioral thermoregulation was likely to occur agents moved within a specified search radius which represented the maximum distance that elephants were likely to move in one hour and differed depending on the behavior employed there was a higher probability of forming a smaller search radius than a larger search radius 0 9 km and 1 8 km respectively when employing thermoregulatory behavior we assumed that elephants preferred to employ wetting behavior if a water source was within the search radius due to the benefits of evaporative cooling if no water source was present in the search radius the agent employed shade use within the smaller search radius the agent s state was a binary variable meant to represent the differences in sensitivity to environmental temperatures between family groups with calves and those without calves mole et al 2016 and differences in mobility between family groups with and without calves ngene et al 2010 if the agent did not have to employ thermoregulation it then decided whether to drink this decision was determined based on the time since the agent last visited a water source including instances of wetting and the perceived environmental temperature as the time since the agent last visited a water source increased and as the environmental temperature increased there was an increased probability of it drinking we incorporated spatial memory relating to water sources in our model by allowing our elephant agents to sense the location of water sources across the landscape and to move in the direction of the closest water source several studies reported that elephants make directed movements towards close water sources and have knowledge on the spatial distribution of water sources in the landscape polansky et al 2015 wato et al 2018 agents could move within a search radius of 1 8 km if the agent did not employ thermoregulatory behavior or drinking the model assumed it would forage we incorporated memory relating to the vegetation quality of areas that the agent has recently visited by allowing the agent to remember the quality of recently visited areas and adjust its movement tortuosity to remain in relatively higher quality areas the agent was assumed to be aware of the evi values for areas within its search radius that were visited recently within the last three time steps and used a running average of these values to decide which cell was likely to be the best to next visit to forage movement resembling area restricted search was performed if evi values were greater than or equal to the running average in its memory and more directed movement was performed if evi values were less than the running average the agent moved anywhere within a smaller or larger search radius depending on its state agents representing family groups with calves moved up to 0 9 km when foraging while those without calves moved up to 1 8 km this difference represented the limitations that calves may impose on family groups when moving table 2 describes model parameters for each behavior and supporting references and table 3 describes cell selection strategies the agent uses for each behavior and supporting references a simplified flowchart of the agent s decision making process is depicted in fig 2 we ran ten simulations for each empirical trajectory with each simulated trajectory starting at the same location as its corresponding empirical trajectory we aimed to generate enough simulated trajectories per empirical trajectory such that the resulting average value of each movement characteristic calculated from the ten simulated trajectories would be an accurate representation of model performance examples of an empirical trajectory and corresponding simulated trajectories are depicted in fig 3 examples of a simulated trajectory segmented by time of day is depicted in fig 4 3 model validation 3 1 movement data for elephants in cnp and knp between 2012 and 2014 satellite collars africa wildlife tracking pretoria south africa were placed on elephant cows from areas within and surrounding cnp and knp the satellite collars recorded locations at about hourly intervals only movement data from elephants with trajectories confined to the raster areas shown in fig 1 were include in our analysis as such movement data from four elephants in cnp and nine elephants in knp were considered in the analysis all elephants whose movement data were used were from different family units movement paths were segmented into two week 14 day trajectories and the first two week trajectory of every month was used for each elephant we used dynamic brownian bridge movement models to calculate home range size for each trajectory as it has been suggested to better estimate the utilization distribution of animals wilson et al 2020 and has been used to identify utilization distributions for african and sumatran elephant populations in other recent studies evans et al 2020 wilson et al 2020 wilson et al 2021 methods for determining 1 home range size 2 diel and 3 net daily displacement as well as 4 maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source are described in the appendix section 2 3 1 1 activity budgets of real elephants to validate the activity budgets calculated from the abm we used parameters derived from the relevant literature see table 2 for patterns present in the literature chamaillé jammes et al 2013 mole et al 2016 purdon van aarde 2017 shannon et al 2008 3 2 analyzing movement patterns of elephants we used linear mixed models lmms to identify differences in the mean of the four movement characteristics between parks and seasons for the empirical data the full model for each response variable included season dry vs wet park knp vs cnp and their interaction as fixed effects with a random effect of year nested within individual elephant id to account for both repeated observations of individuals and individual variation in movement patterns among years p values for each model effect were determined using likelihood ratio tests comparing simpler nested models lacking the effect with the more complex model including the effect using the anova function in r for a qualitative comparison between simulated and empirical data rather than identifying whether significant differences existed between the simulated and empirical data we used lmms to determine whether the model was able to reproduce the patterns in movement characteristics that were present in the empirical data the full lmm included the same variables as the one described above for a quantitative comparison we also used lmms to identify differences in the movement characteristics between the simulated and empirical data a final term to indicate whether the data was simulated or empirical was included within these lmms as well as interactions between this term and the fixed effects data were transformed to meet assumptions of parametric statistics we then standardized the data to express all parameter estimates in terms of effect sizes a more detailed description of the full models for each response variable is included in the appendix section 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis a one factor at a time local sensitivity analysis of the model determined the sensitivity of the model outputs to parameter uncertainties we varied each input parameter from the original reference values table a3 by 10 and observed the magnitude of the corresponding change in model outputs as effect sizes this was again accomplished using linear mixed models lmms in which we compared the original model outputs with the outputs obtained when a given parameter was altered 4 results 4 1 empirical elephant movement patterns elephants generally moved greater distances in cnp than in knp this is reflected in cnp having larger home range sizes p 0 007 greater ddds p 0 001 greater ndds p 0 004 and longer maximum distances traveled to and from water p 0 002 elephants additionally tended to move greater distances in the wet season than in the dry season this is again reflected in the wet season having larger home range sizes p 0 001 greater net daily displacement distances p 0 001 and longer maximum distance traveled from water p 0 001 for diel displacement distance there was a significant interaction between park and season p 0 002 this reflects a significantly greater diel displacement distance in the wet season than in the dry season at knp p 0 001 but no difference between seasons in cnp p 0 974 for more detailed analysis of the empirical movement data see the appendix section 3 4 2 validation results 4 2 1 qualitative comparison to empirical data to qualitatively explore model performance we assessed whether our model was able to reproduce the nine movement patterns present in the empirical data see table 4 four movement patterns including those associated with diel displacement distance and maximum distances moved from a permanent water source were reproduced fig 5 the other movement patterns were at least partially reproduced table 4 4 2 2 quantitative comparisons to empirical data four of the 16 statistical comparisons between empirical and simulated movement patterns were categorized as discrepancies of large effect size three as discrepancies of medium effect size while the remainder were categorized as of small to very small differences cohen 1988 table 5 discrepancies of large effect sizes associated with home range size diel displacement distance and net displacement distance were mainly driven by the simulations underestimating movement characteristics in cnp while overestimating those in knp 4 2 3 activity budgets table 6 shows patterns associated with activity budgets for simulated agents and those found in relevant literature including the time spent employing thermoregulatory and foraging behavior and the links between these behaviors and environmental temperature 4 3 sensitivity analysis movement characteristics were most sensitive to 1 increases in the probability of employing drinking behavior at any given time since the agent last visited a water source 2 increases and decreases in the parameters determining the turning angles when the agent foraged and 3 decreases in the temperature threshold for employing behavioral thermoregulation tables a 5 a 8 changes in the paramaters associated with turning angles resulted in the greatest effect sizes ranging from 0 133 to 0 359 indicating that simulated movement is particularly sensitive to changes in this parameter of the four movement characteristics home range size and net displacement were most sensitive to changes in the parameters associated with turning angles a more detailed description of the sensitivity analysis is provided in the appendix section 4 5 discussion simulated and empirical home range sizes differed statistically between parks and between seasons however the direction of the seasonal and park effect generally matched between simulated and empirical home range sizes our abm was also successful at reproducing some differences in ddd and ndd between seasons particularly for knp the increased rainfall associated with the transition from dry to wet season increased the availability of forage and water relaxing movement constraints to permanent water and triggering an expansion of movement and of the home range birkett et al 2012 buchholtz et al 2019 loarie et al 2009 stokke and du toit 2002 the seasonal differences in water availability were likely the major reason why our abm was able to simulate the increased movement increased fine scale heterogeneity associated with wet season conditions may have prompted increased movement as the potential gain from food resources outweighed the cost of moving see polansky et al 2013 simulated elephants moving through areas with consistently homogenous forage quality when the average evi of the search radius was greater than or equal to the running average evi of recently visited locations tended to display more tortuous and shorter movements increasing the likelihood of remaining in high evi areas however if our evi raster layer captured the increased fine scale heterogeneity associated with the wet season simulated elephants should have increased daily displacements relative to the dry season because the quality of cells that are farther away from the agent may inevitably outweigh the cost of moving to those cells our simulated elephants also traveled farther from permanent water in cnp compared to knp and during the wet season compared to the dry season a general pattern found in real elephant populations bastille rousseau et al 2020 jackson et al 2008 loarie et al 2009 stokke and du toit 2002 in cnp and the surrounding protected areas the chobe river constitutes the major source of permanent water fox and alexander 2015 and elephants often disperse many kilometers inland to seasonal water sources alwij et al 2010 this is in contrast to the abundance and wide distribution of both seasonal and permanent water in knp where it is physically not possible for elephants to move too far from permanent water purdon and van aarde 2017b redfern 2003 the temporal patterns of movement of our elephant agents are similar to those observed in real elephants model agents spent a total number of hours foraging that were comparable to real elephants and spent more time avoiding heat in the afternoon when temperatures were higher guy 1976 mole et al 2016 shannon et al 2008 5 1 discrepancies between the model outputs and empirical data discrepancies of medium to large effect size in three of the four movement characteristics between the empirical and simulated data were not unexpected as model outputs rarely fit actual data perfectly rather than try to explain why there were some quantitative differences between movement characteristics calculated for simulated and empirical data we focused on identifying potential reasons for the model s limited ability to reproduce certain patterns between study areas and between seasons 5 1 1 human interference our model was not able to reproduce the significantly greater ndd and ddd observed in cnp compared to knp based on the empirical data these discrepancies may be due in part to the exclusion of anthropogenic influences on elephants within the model throughout the time period that elephant movement was monitored knp experienced one instance of elephant poaching lunstrum 2014 in botswana however a steady increase in poaching has been documented since 2010 lindsay et al 2017 schlossberg et al 2019 2020 poaching affects the movement of elephant populations by creating a landscape of fear in which individuals move in straighter lines ihwagi et al 2019 or shift their ranges goldenberg et al 2018 away from areas where poaching activity is higher neil et al 2020 developed an abm which incorporated adaptive poacher agents rangers and elephants to predict how the interactions between these entities affect elephant poaching levels the authors suggested that incorporating avoidance of poaching hotspots in the model could alter elephant distribution and subsequent poaching levels neil et al 2020 the presence of humans not associated with poaching may also shape an elephant s landscape of fear jackson et al 2008 mpakairi 2019a roever et al 2013a songhurst et al 2020 wittemyer et al 2017 within the model areas favorable for foraging will generally elicit movement with greater tortuosity and shorter step lengths however if the corresponding area in the real world is also a risky area the movements of actual elephants may potentially be much straighter and of longer duration in order to quickly move through the area graham et al 2009 ihwagi et al 2019 vollrath 2005 small villages border knp cook et al 2015 but there are no villages within our study area in knp there are however several villages bordering the chobe forest reserve included within our study area near cnp failing to account for the increased risk perceived by elephants passing through these human impacted areas may have contributed to the model producing trajectories with lower ddds and ndds than expected in cnp including poaching hot spots and areas of human habitation as raster layers within the model may be more important for cnp compared to knp and would allow agents to employ realistic avoidance behavior other models have incorporated risky areas into habitat selection models for elephants roever et al 2013a roever et al 2013b for example by including carcass locations as representations of risky areas in a habitat selection model for elephants in northern botswana roever et al 2013a found that protected areas were not necessarily associated with decreases in mortality risk as one would expect roever et al 2013a 5 1 2 environmental predictability and spatial memory spatial memory can shape animal space utilization patterns by allowing for non random returns to locations within the landscape gautestad 2011 gautestad and mysterud 2010a tsalyuk et al 2019 found that elephant movement was influenced by long term vegetation conditions more so than current conditions it is possible to simulate long term spatial memory within abms by incorporating past conditions into the model environment and allowing the agent to make decisions based on these conditions bracis and mueller 2017 developed an abm in which zebra agents remembered long term averages of past habitat conditions represented by averaging remotely sensed vegetation indices in the past and made movement decisions based on these long term averages of habitat conditions rather than on current conditions spatial memory may be represented by two streams that make up a memory map one stream prevents an individual from returning to areas recently visited while the other draws individuals to attractive habitats also referred to as reference and working memory respectively bracis et al 2015 folse et al 1989 van moorter et al 2009 whether spatial memory influences fine scale movement decisions in areas where the quality of forage resources is not easily predictable remains to be further studied we suggest that modeling spatial memory relating to water sources arguably the strongest driver of elephant movement during the dry season was sufficient to produce a relatively good fit between the model and the empirical data in the dry season the need to return to water sources may regularly override the desire to re visit traditionally favorable foraging sites during the wet season the increased abundance and quality of food may decrease the need to remember specific areas and increase exploratory movements tsalyuk et al 2019 spatial memory may thus play a less important role in accessing food resources for elephants than it does in accessing water sources to augment our foraging submodel to capture spatial memory processes related to food resources we would need a better understanding of the extent to which spatial memory related to vegetation characteristics plays a role in dictating movement decisions during the wet season 5 1 3 foraging preferences and the issue of scale to improve our foraging sub model we would need a greater understanding of the spatial scale at which elephants make foraging decisions at hourly time steps whether our vegetation greenness evi raster s resolution of 30 m represents too fine of a spatial scale for elephants to base their foraging decisions on remains to be tested de knegt et al 2011 contended that fine scale foraging decisions may be made after elephants select larger scale areas of high forage availability within the spatial constraints of water we know that elephants prefer greener than average vegetation at the scale of 250 and 500 m loarie et al 2009 and can select favorable patches even at scales of 100 m2s pretorius et al 2011 thus it is possible that elephants may make hourly foraging decisions at finer spatial scales to exploit preferential feeding sites our model does not include any spatial information that would allow our agents to base their movement decisions on preferences for specific feeding sites in the wet season when vegetation is more variable elephants may make exploratory movements to seek out areas with high quality forage loarie et al 2009 tsalyuk et al 2019 young et al 2009 if real elephants are exploring the landscape for preferred feeding sites in the wet season rather than simply selecting for greenness within their vicinity they may travel greater distances than our elephant agents and display less tortuous movement the inability of our simulated elephants to make exploratory movements may be one of the reasons for our model underestimating wet season home range sizes daily displacement distances and net daily displacement distances for cnp 5 1 4 social interactions previous studies have revealed the impact of socioecological factors including social rank status on movement characteristics such as daily travel distance polansky et al 2013 wittemyer et al 2008 and use of preferred habitats wittemyer et al 2007 via resource competition within the model the rules dictating the agent s behavior reflect potential decision making processes in which it selects for the highest quality resources available on the landscape if socioecological factors are altering elephants decision rules such that they can no longer select for the preferred high quality resources we will see discrepancies between our model outputs and empirical data 6 conclusions we have shown that a resource driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data by analyzing the differences in the model s ability to reproduce realistic movement for elephants in cnp and knp we were able to identify potential causes for the discrepancies between model outputs and empirical data the addition of location specific information on risky areas may be the most immediately feasible way to extend the applicability of our movement model particularly for cnp coarser scale movement models such as boult et al 2018 which predicts the presence or absence of elephants in the study area are suitable for predicting how dispersal movements may be influenced by landscape features in contrast simulating hourly movement as our model does may be more useful in predicting how finer scale patterns of space use such as those created by foraging movements are influenced by finer spatio temporal changes in the environment these include changes in daily temperatures and in the distribution of water and shade that in the future may change in response to climate change for example our model was able to predict how elephants travel further from permanent water in the wet season compared to the dry season by tracking hourly differences in the movement of simulated elephants we can deduce that simulated elephants were able to take advantage of the increase in surface water availability by using the seasonal water sources in addition to the permanent water sources using our model with artificial landscapes in which we decrease the availability of surface water to simulate the conditions predicted for southern africa under scenarios of climate change kusangaya et al 2014 we can explore potential hypotheses regarding changes in spatial use for example whether a decrease in water availability will further constrain movement and limit access to forage resources ultimately movement is a fundamental process that connects individuals with the resources needed to survive thus impacting population dynamics nathan et al 2008 a spatially explicit movement model such as the one we have described here can be combined with a bioenergetics model that tracks energy acquisition and expenditure of multiple elephant agents through time scales longer than two weeks we would then be able to explore the effects that changing availabilities and distributions of critical resources may
