16620,the epidemic of covid 19 has aroused people s particular attention to biosafety a growing number of disinfection products have been consumed during this period however the flaw of disinfection has not received enough attention especially in water treatment processes while cutting down the quantity of microorganisms disinfection processes exert a considerable selection effect on bacteria and thus reshape the microbial community structure to a great extent causing the problem of disinfection residual bacteria drb these systematic and profound changes could lead to the shift in regrowth potential bio fouling potential as well as antibiotic resistance level and might cause a series of potential risks in this review we collected and summarized the data from the literature in recent 10 years about the microbial community structure shifting of natural water or wastewater in full scale treatment plants caused by disinfection based on these data typical drb with the most reporting frequency after disinfection by chlorine containing disinfectants ozone disinfection and ultraviolet disinfection were identified and summarized which were the bacteria with a relative abundance of over 5 in the residual bacteria community and the bacteria with an increasing rate of relative abundance over 100 after disinfection furthermore the phylogenic relationship and potential risks of these typical drb were also analyzed twelve out of fifteen typical drb genera contain pathogenic strains and many were reported of great secretion ability pseudomonas and acinetobacter possess multiple disinfection resistance and could be considered as model bacteria in future studies of disinfection we also discussed the growth secretion and antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb as well as possible control strategies the drb phenomenon is not limited to water treatment but also exists in the air and solid disinfection processes which need more attention and more profound research especially in the period of covid 19 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection residual bacteria drb microbial community microbial risk disinfection resistance 1 introduction biosafety is of vital importance in water treatment storage distribution and usage ruiz et al 2000 sedlak and von gunten 2011 therefore disinfection units are essential in all kinds of water treatment facilities rutala and weber 2016 shannon et al 2008 due to the wide applicability and technological economy chlorine containing disinfectants mainly including free chlorine chloramine and chlorine dioxide ultraviolet uv disinfection and ozone disinfection became the three most commonly used disinfection technologies sedlak and von gunten 2011 the covid epidemic beginning in 2019 has increased people s concern for microbial risks as a consequence more demand of disinfectants was generated bogler et al 2020 and some authorities began to apply higher dosages of disinfectants in wastewater treatment processes lu and guo 2021 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2020a nevertheless scarcely any of the disinfection methods could inactivate all microorganisms in water in full scale applications proctor and hammes 2015 disinfection possesses a significant selection effect on different kinds of bacteria in water l√≥pez et al 2019 luo et al 2021 and the residual part usually contains undesirable bacteria which could cause various hazards under diverse scenarios garner et al 2018 yu et al 2018 hence the residual part of microorganisms remaining the capacity of growth or virulence after disinfection which could be defined as the disinfection residual bacteria drb deserves special attention in water disinfection processes it is not only the total amount of drb that needs to be considered but also the composition and characteristics of them most of commonly used microbial assessment methods in water treatment are based on plate culture these methods can only reveal the level of bacterial quantity rather than microbial community structure which is vital for comprehensive evaluation of microbial risk of the water szewzyk et al 2000 in addition only a small fraction of microorganisms in the water are culturable van nevel et al 2017 ward et al 1990 therefore it is hard to acquire a comprehensive understanding of microbial risk levels via heterotrophic plate counts hpc up to now there have been many studies on the resistance of pure strains towards disinfection luo et al 2021 however research aimed at relative resistance of bacteria in water from full scale treatment plants is more meaningful for microbial risk control since the beginning of the 21st century high throughput sequencing or next generation sequencing ngs has been continuously developed and applied to the analysis of water samples hirai et al 2017 tan et al 2015 a number of studies have found that the disinfection processes such as chlorine and chloramine disinfection belila et al 2016 chiao et al 2014 jia et al 2015 uv disinfection li et al 2020 liu et al 2019b pullerits et al 2020 and ozone disinfection alexander et al 2016 chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 have a significant effect on the microbial community structure however there has not been a systematic and logical evaluation of drb the present study aimed at establishing a systematical analysis of drb and proposing criteria for identification of drb from the perspective of microbial community structure herein we recognized typical drb at phyla and genera levels and analyzed the growth secretion and antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb several promising approaches for drb control were also discussed in general this study provided a novel perspective towards aquatic microbial risk analysis and control 2 risks of drb drb refers to the residual part of microorganisms which remain their growing ability or virulence after disinfection drb could bring about a series of potential risks which could not be evaluated by the amount of bacteria in water and in some cases are even greater than that of undisinfected microbiome flemming 2020 wang et al 2019b the risks of drb could be divided into three categories which are health ecological and process risks fig 1 2 1 health risks one of the primary aims of disinfection is to reduce pathogens and opportunistic pathogens nevertheless it has been reported that pathogens and opportunistic pathogens could regrow and their relative abundance might be higher among drb in drinking water and treated wastewater posing threats to human and animal health cui et al 2020 pang et al 2016 furthermore it is possible for drb in water to be spread to other phases and trigger additional hazards during water distribution and usage drb colonized in water distribution systems could form a biofilm which is a shelter providing durable high level tolerance against disinfectants for pathogens and other unfavorable bacteria flemming 2020 garner et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 drb within irrigation water could migrate onto the surface of crops posing a threat to food safety gu et al 2020 truchado et al 2018 2 2 process risks process risk means harm to facilities caused by drb in water treatment distribution storage and usage in many scenarios though the disinfection units reduce the amount of microorganism and improve the quality of the effluent drb also sometimes bring more risks to water treatment facilities especially when the growth and metabolic characteristics of drb rather than their quantity play a more important role in particular most process risks are associated with biofilm formation and growth one of the significant process risks of drb is the fouling of the separation membranes in water purification processes membrane fouling is usually caused by polysaccharides and proteins in extracellular polymeric substances eps of bacteria rather than bacteria themselves khan et al 2015 wang et al 2019b commonly used separation membranes in water treatment include microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis ro ro is an essential process in seawater desalination and high quality reclaimed water production bai et al 2001 unlike micro and ultra filtration membranes the current market dominating polyamide thin film composite ro membrane has poor tolerance of oxidant yao et al 2020 therefore it is hard to apply disinfectants on the membrane surface directly increasing the difficulty of controlling the growth and eps secretion of drb membrane fouling is a serious expense for water treatment plants especially high quality water reclamation plants it was estimated that the costs of membrane fouling accounted for 30 of the operating costs at water factory 21 which is one of the most famous water reclamation projects flemming 2011 pipe corrosion in water distribution systems is another typical and costly risk of drb iron and steel pipes are the most frequently used materials in water distribution systems mohebbi and li 2011 though most of the water was disinfected before distribution corrosion of the pipe network was still unavoidable pipe corrosion is more related to the microbial community structure and function of the microbiome than the number of organisms zhang et al 2018a the abundances of four kinds of bacteria related to sulfur and iron biotransformation play the main roles which are iron oxidizing bacteria iron reducing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur oxidizing bacteria wang et al 2012 the corrosion of pipes results in tremendous costs for instance in china the cost of pipe corrosion was estimated to be 10 billion rmb in 2014 hou et al 2017 except for membrane fouling and pipe corrosion biofouling also cause significant hazards and cost in many other industries tough thousands of tons of disinfectants are applied every day in power plants around the world cost of biofouling still accounts for about 20 of overall fouling costs in heat exchangers cloete 2003 murthy and venkatesan 2009 azis et al 2001 estimated that cost caused by biofouling in seawater desalination systems was about 15 billion dollars per year over world 2 3 ecological risks the ecological risks of drb consist of two aspects dominant species shifting and abundance variation of functional genes since disinfection exerts a selection effect on the microbiome dominant species of drb are frequently different from that before disinfection leading to a prominent shift of metabolism adaptability and resistance of microbiome cui et al 2020 pang et al 2016 similar problems also took place in terms of the abundance of functional genes higher antibiotic resistance level of drb is a crucial ecological risk causing by disinfection processes chen et al 2020c there has been plenty of evidence of abundance increasing of antibiotic resistance genes after disinfection alexander et al 2016 guo et al 2013 meckes 1982 furthermore ubiquitous horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes might aggravate this risk khan et al 2016 3 research methods and recognition criteria of typical drb the risks of drb are mainly derived from the characteristics shift of microbiome causing by the selection effect of disinfection these changes mainly include microbial community shifting growth characteristics shifting secretion characteristics shifting and antibiotic resistance characteristics shifting fig 2 the shift of microbial community structure is the most critical aspect as all of other changes have inextricable relation with the microbial community structure changes wang et al 2019c chen et al 2020b therefore a deep insight into microbial community shift is foremost typical drb at phyla classes and genera levels were recognized from the literature in this review 3 1 research methods of microbial community shifting up to now ngs is the most effective method for comprehensive analysis of microbial communities tan et al 2015 the processing methods and sequencing platforms applied by previous researchers are listed in table s1 illumina and roche 454 are the two most widely used platforms 454 pyrosequencing is better for investigating microbial communities while illumina high throughput sequencing is more suitable for metagenomic analysis hirai et al 2017 huang et al 2014 as the concentration of bacteria in water samples especially drb is relatively low bacteria must be effectively enriched prior to dna extraction and sequencing membrane filtration enrichment has been widely adopted by researchers due to its feasibility and little effect on microbial community structure typically 1 10 l water sample was filtered through 0 2 0 22 Œºm membrane filters then the filters were preserved at 80 c until dna extraction and amplification the volume of the water sample could be roughly determined according to hpc wang et al 2013 we recommend to process the liquid samples as fast as possible once sampling is done in order to maintain the original microbial community structure and the filters should be frozen immediately after the filtration process regrettably only a few researchers indicated the time consume from sampling to processing in their research articles data quality control is of great significance in the testing and analysis of environmental samples ju and zhang 2015 a larger sample number brings about larger statistical significance and stronger persuasion to ensure the reliability of the data at least three biological replicates are essential furthermore we suggest that the number of replicates in the experimental group and the control group remain similar to make a better comparison 3 2 recognition criteria of drb drb does not refer to several specific strains it is a summary of a series of phenomena nevertheless it is of great significance to summarize the regularity of these phenomena and identify typical drb for future research we recognized typical drb from two perspectives the bacteria becoming dominant in the microbial community after disinfection and the bacteria with a drastically increasing of relative abundance after disinfection the results of high throughput sequencing are mainly presented at the phyla level and genera level the thresholds of dominant phylum in previous studies are quite different from 0 01 to more than 10 liu et al 2021 qiao et al 2021 shahi et al 2016 yan et al 2021 zha et al 2021 among these thresholds 5 is a typical one for microbial community structure of water and wastewater wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 proteobacteria was usually separated into Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ¥ and other proteobacteria as it is a rather rich phylum becerra castro et al 2016 ling et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2014 considering that there are about 20 30 phyla or classes belonging to proteobacteria commonly found in water li et al 2017a the average relative abundance of each phylum is about 3 5 thus a low threshold is not applicable for distinguishing dominant phyla on the other hand if the threshold is too high only a few of most dominant phylum classes such as firmicutes Œ≤ and Œ≥ proteobacteria could be recognized bal krishna et al 2020 chen et al 2020a therefore we used the threshold of 5 of relative abundance to identify dominant phyla as for genera level the threshold of dominant genera was set at 1 alexander et al 2016 campbell et al 2011 numberger et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b zhao et al 2020 the bacteria whose relative abundance significantly increased after disinfection were also considered as drb though the microbial community structure of influents and seasonal fluctuations have effects on the microbial community structure of the effluents disinfection processes stronger impact on it ma et al 2020 potgieter et al 2018 in addition the microbial communities of influents of different water plants vary greatly while the disinfection processes are relatively similar hence it is necessary to conduct an investigation on the relative abundance changes of bacteria during disinfection to find out several typical drb in our study the threshold for typical drb was set as relative abundance increases over 100 after disinfection and reported by more than two research articles for most commonly used chlorine containing disinfectants the threshold of the number of reports is increased to three as research articles about disinfection using chlorine containing disinfectants are much more than that on uv and ozone disinfection 4 microbial community characteristics of drb 4 1 drb at phyla level according to the aforementioned identification criteria dominant phyla before and after disinfection reported previously are listed in table s2 and the occurrence frequency of dominant phyla in drb were summarized in fig 3 a Œ± Œ≤ and Œ≥ proteobacteria frequently presented as dominant classes in drb under all three commonly used disinfection processes chlorine containing disinfectants uv and ozone disinfection this might be attributed to wide metabolic versatility and adaption of the adverse environment of proteobacteria becerra castro et al 2016 Œ± proteobacteria having a wide range of general stress responses francez charlot et al 2015 occurred most frequently in drb of disinfection by chlorine containing disinfectants the changes of relative abundance of the top 10 most common phyla are shown in fig 3b d firmicutes was not the most frequent dominant phylum but performed a clear regularity of higher relative abundance in drb spore production is an ineluctable reason for firmicutes to survive from disinfection the proportion of Œ≥ proteobacteria increased in all three kinds of disinfection processes especially in ozonation a comparative study showed that no matter how the water quality fluctuated the relative abundance of Œ≥ proteobacteria was consistently higher in drb becerra castro et al 2016 a number of well known fecal oral pathogens are from Œ≥ proteobacteria including legionella acinetobacter salmonella and so on blaschke et al 2021 santos 2014 yunana et al 2021 combined with the results of analysis of the dominant phyla Œ≥ proteobacteria deserves distinctive attention in terms of the harmful microorganisms after disinfection verrucomicrobia displayed a long box in fig 3c which is similar for chloroflexi in ozone that means these phyla showed an extensive variability in microbial community structure of drb implying that bacteria in these phyla from different water samples might possess greatly difference of resistance toward disinfection hence analysis at lower level such as genera level is necessary types of water samples were listed in table s2 we divided all data into three categories drinking water wastewater including secondary effluent and reclaimed water and other including seawater cooling water irrigation water and domestic hot water to perform a sub analysis of water source effect the results of sub analysis basically met those regardless of water sources in wastewater Œ± Œ≤ and Œ≥ proteobacteria were more likely to become dominant phylum among drb the relative abundance increasement of Œ≥ proteobacteria and firmicutes were more obvious in drinking water than other types of water source 4 2 drb at genera level dominant genera 1 before disinfection and in drb were listed in table s3 dominant genera of effluents were largely affected by that of influents having a great deal of uncertainty hence we mainly concentrated on relative abundance changes of genera a total of 15 genera were recognized as typical drb genera according to the criteria mentioned above fig 4 ten of them were drb of disinfection using chlorine containing disinfectants including mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas which have been reported as chlorine resistant bacteria le dantec et al 2002 luo et al 2021 there were three and five typical drb genera under uv and ozone disinfection respectively resistance of bacteria is the major reason for relative abundance changes of drb cell resistance might be derived from protective secretions special resistant structures and a series of stress responses certain proteobacteria such as pseudomonas were known for strong secretion ability of eps which could act as a shelter against disinfectants freitas et al 2011 furthermore persister formation is a universal reaction against adversity existing in almost all bacteria maisonneuve and gerdes 2014 this process is motivated by a ubiquitous bacterial stress alarmone guanosine penta and tetra phosphate p ppgpp offering a considerable high resistance level for persisters we used type strains of each genus to figure the phylogenetic relationship of typical drb genera fig 5 typical drb were distributed in three phyla which are proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes these three phyla are also the main home of chlorine resistant bacteria luo et al 2021 though ozone has a more similar disinfection mechanism with chlorine containing disinfectants we found that typical drb of uv and ozone disinfection were more phylogenetic closely it implied that similar resistance mechanisms against uv and ozone might exist and different bacteria might possess various resistance mechanisms to chlorine containing disinfectants disinfection processes might also have a selection effect on gram positive negative bacteria most species in typical drb of uv and ozone disinfection were gram negative fig 5 experiments of drinking water have also found that the proportion of gram negative bacteria increased in drb of uv disinfection chen et al 2020a though the gram positive bacteria have thicker cell walls gram negative bacterial could be protected by cell walls consisting of two layers lipopolysaccharides are the main component of the outer layer while a thin layer of peptidoglycan resides in the inner plasma membrane yusof et al 2019 multiple barriers allow gram negative bacteria to withstand more adverse conditions types of water samples were listed in table s3 a sub analysis of water source effects conducted with the same methods as section 4 1 showed basically the same result pathogens and opportunistic pathogens belonging to typical drb genera was listed in table s4 12 of 15 typical drb genera contain pathogenic species and some of them are known to possess multi drug resistance such as acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa blaschke et al 2021 tarazi et al 2021 in addition to pathogenicity biofouling is also an essential risk of drb among typical drb genera pseudomonas and sphingomonas are known to secrete sticky polysaccharides which enhance the adhesion between cell and surface and facilitate the formation of biofilm freitas et al 2011 4 3 multiple disinfection resistance in drb we applied the venn diagram to depict the multiple disinfection resistance characteristics of typical drb in fig 6 it was found that acinetobacter has resistance against uv and ozone disinfection and pseudomonas possesses resistance against all three commonly used disinfection methods both of them belong to the order pseudomonadales in class Œ≥ proteobacteria except for the perspective of relative abundance similar results were found in the study of pure strains under mono and synergistic disinfection jung and park 2015 liu et al 2019b wei et al 2020 therefore pseudomonas and acinetobacter could be considered as model genera in subsequent studies of drb especially researches in multiple disinfection resistance and evaluations of novel disinfection technologies 4 4 microbial diversity of drb microbial diversity plays a dual role in microbial risk control higher microbial diversity generally means a more stable microbiome as well as its functional characteristics on the other hand the high diversity of unfavorable bacteria in drb such as pathogenic bacteria means microbial risks are more difficult to cope with huang et al 2014 variations of the five most commonly used alpha diversity indexes of drb were listed in table s5 among them otus ace and chao1 index reflect the richness of the microbial community and shannon index and simpson index comprehensively consider the evenness as well as the richness of species in the water samples a higher shannon index or lower simpson index indicates higher microbial evenness it is easily accepted that drb has lower total bacteria numbers as well as lower microbial diversity however microbial diversity did not always decline after disinfection fig 7 there have been some cases of higher microbial diversity of drb li et al 2017a liu et al 2019b ma et al 2020 therefore there has not been a consensus on whether drb possess lower microbial diversity than microorganisms before disinfection the changes of microbial diversity and corresponding functions and risks of the microbiome need to be profoundly investigated 5 growth secretion and antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb 5 1 growth characteristics regrowth of drb is a pervasive problem existing in all of disinfection processes nocker et al 2020 uv and ozone have little continuous disinfection effect wang et al 2021 free chlorine is much better than them but still facing the problem of decay wang et al 2019a chloramine and chlorine dioxide have a relatively low rate of decay chen et al 2020b for all that few disinfection methods can prevent bacterial regrowth problems furthermore disinfection processes could alter the growth characteristics of the bacteria complicating the regrowth process miettinen et al 1998 cases of growth characteristics of drb and potential risks were listed in table 1 the shift of microbial community structure may lead to the change of growth characteristic as different strains possess various growth rates the regrowth process could collaborate with the selection effect of disinfection to further promote the dominance of certain harmful bacteria some pathogens and opportunistic pathogens such as salmonella and pseudomonas have been reported of higher levels of regrowth after disinfection than indicator bacteria li et al 2013 ribas et al 2000 as a consequence the relative abundance of these undesirable bacteria would increase and hide corresponding risks behind the ostensible decrease in numbers of total bacteria or indicator bacteria ling et al 2018 drb might also have a different growth cycle from bacteria before disinfection the growth process of bacteria could be divided into lag phase exponential phase plateau phase and dead phase disinfection processes could expand the lag phase and faster the growth rate of bacteria during the exponential phase which means a higher regrowth potential of drb chen et al 2020b disinfection processes also impact quorum sensing signals secretion which may cause more serious biofouling wang et al 2021 in addition drb could be induced into the viable but non culturable vbnc state by disinfection processes chen et al 2018a lin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 vnbc state is a way for bacteria to resist the stress of the adverse environment under vbnc state bacteria retain their metabolic activity and pathogenicity but not culturability liu et al 2010 accordingly it is hard for water plant operators to tell the true microbial risk level of water by hpc and other plating methods which are commonly used in full scale water treatment facilities disinfectants interact not only with microorganisms but also with organic substances in the water which act as nutrients for bacterial growth assimilable organic carbon aoc which means the assimilable part of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon is a widely used indicator to evaluate the biological stability of water during storage and distribution nescerecka et al 2018 prest et al 2016 zhao et al 2014a oxidative disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone could convert biological recalcitrant natural organic matter to aoc providing more nutrients for the bacteria and creating a higher potential of drb regrowth chen et al 2018b huang et al 2020 kim et al 2010 zhao et al 2014a therefore the evaluation of a disinfection method should not only be limited to the effect of microbial inactivation but also include the influence on aoc level 5 2 secretion characteristics the secretion characteristics of drb might be drastically different from that before disinfection the shift of secretion characteristics contains two aspects one is linked to the changes of microbial community structure and the other is accounted for the responses of bacteria towards disinfectants chen et al 2021 soluble microbial products smp and eps are the microbial products worthy of special attention in water treatment more et al 2014 ni et al 2011 smp comprise the majority of soluble organic material in biological treatment effluents and might bring about additional toxicity compared to original organic compounds which show ecological risk towards native microorganism barker and stuckey 1999 eps plays a crucial role in biofilm formation which is the key factor of biofouling and disinfectant tolerance in a wide variety of scenarios flemming 2020 meng et al 2009 xue et al 2012 yu et al 2018 yu et al 2021 cases of secretion characteristics of drb and corresponding risks were summarized in table 2 secretion characteristics of different strains are significantly different yu et al 2018 therefore the reshaping of microbial community structure by disinfection contributes to the difference of secretion characteristics of drb disinfection processes usually select bacteria with higher eps secretion ability as one of the major functions of eps is protecting bacteria from disinfectants sheng et al 2010 wang et al found that long term usage of free chlorine selected four genera of bacteria with high eps secretion ability which are methylobacterium pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter wang et al 2019b after chlorine disinfection the drb dominated by these bacteria secreted more eps with a higher proportion of high molecular weight matter a similar phenomenon also appeared in drb of uv there has been evidence that the eps amount of drb increased with uv dose wu et al 2021 as a consequence long term applications of a single disinfection pre treatment might aggravate biofouling rather than alleviate it the acute responses to oxidative stress also attribute to the shift of secretion characteristics of the microbiome disinfectants could accelerate intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production of bacteria and dramatically alter bacteria metabolism and secretion ability han et al 2017 in addition some disinfectants react with secreta directly xue et al 2014 sacrificial reactions of eps matrix with disinfectants are not only an effective protection mechanism for bacteria xue et al 2012 but might also lead to more release of organic matters and ambiguous biofouling potential alteration wang et al 2019c yu et al 2017 5 3 antibiotic resistance characteristics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args have received particular attention in public health in recent years hoffman et al 2015 takeuchi and tanaka 2020 it is possible for args to be either destroyed or selected during disinfection xu et al 2020 and the ultimate antibiotic resistance level of drb results from these two aspects competitively cases of growth characteristics of drb and potential risks were summarized in table 3 similar to growth and secretion characteristics the variation of antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb could also be induced by microbial community shift there has been evidence that the microbial community shift made a significant contribution to the shift of antibiotic resistance characteristics in drinking water rather than mobile genetic elements reproduction or transfer jia et al 2015 arb have a greater ability to cope with the selection pressures of disinfectants munir et al 2011 hence the inactivation rate of some arb was significantly lower than the total level of bacteria in water leading to an increase in the relative abundance of arb and a selection effect of args in the disinfection process czekalski et al 2016 guo et al 2013 drug efflux pump is one of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance of cells oxidative stress generated by oxidative disinfectants induces the overexpression of the efflux pump genes leading to a higher antibiotic resistance level of drb hou et al 2019 furthermore low doses of disinfectants could aggravate this process as the expression of the efflux pump is stronger while the inactivation effect of args and arb is dissatisfactory unfortunately the doses of ozone added into water is usually low czekalski et al 2016 when ammonia nitrogen content is high in water part of free chlorine transfer to chloramine which possesses a worse removal efficiency of arg yoon et al 2017 disinfection processes also have an impact on the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in drb the horizontal transfer includes conjugation transduction and transformation in which bacteria acquire arg from donor bacterial phage and foreign dna respectively chen et al 2020c qiu et al 2012 horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes facilitates the recombination of various risks for instance certain pathogens may turn to arb via this process salyers and shoemaker 2006 guo et al 2015 found that chlorine disinfection significantly amplified the cell permeability and led to a high frequency of conjugative transfer cheng et al 2021 reported that chlorine could reduce the relative abundance of args but simultaneously broaden the host range 6 challenges and prospects 6 1 possible control strategies against drb a number of novel disinfection strategies have been developed and might be applicable for eliminating drb including synergic disinfection secondary disinfection and novel disinfection technologies synergistic disinfection could effectively cope with bacterial resistance to a single disinfectant ding et al reported that ozone achieved an inactivation rate of 99 9 for chlorine resistant bacillus cereus spore ding et al 2019 similar results were found in the synergistic disinfection of uv and chlorine cho et al 2018 however some other studies showed that synergistic disinfection was unsatisfactory cui et al found that pseudomonas one of typical drb genus became dominant genera after ozone disinfection and its relative abundance did not decrease after subsequent uv disinfection cui et al 2020 another study of drinking water manifested that the relative abundance of mycobacterium was higher in the effluent of synergistic disinfection of ozone and chlorine li et al 2017a therefore whether synergistic disinfection could solve the problem of drb is not sure the result might vary with water samples secondary disinfection is an effective strategy for long distance delivery of water wang et al 2014 secondary disinfection includes two steps of chlorine or chloramine dosing preventing high initial chlorine concentration the original intention of secondary disinfection was to control disinfection by products dbps seidel et al 2005 recent studies indicated that secondary disinfection could achieve higher disinfection efficiency and causing severer damages to the cells preventing bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation in water distribution systems li et al 2017b zhao et al 2020 lots of novel disinfection methods have been developed in the recent decade novel disinfection methods differ from traditional ones in terms of mechanisms and were developed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional disinfection methods ferrate is a novel disinfectant with a two step disinfection mechanism the combination of strong oxidizing ability of ferrate and coagulation initiated by its reduction product makes ferrate an effective disinfectant for a wide range of bacteria and virus sharma et al 2015 ferret could inactivate total coliform and chlorine resistant spore forming bacteria with an efficiency of more than 3 log at a dosage about 2 3 mg l sharma et al 2005 studies have also shown that ferrate was effective for damaging harmful genes and preventing bacteria regrowth wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 electric disinfection is an environmentally benign disinfection technology either electroporation induced by the enhanced electric field huo et al 2016 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b or direct oxidation of the anode liu et al 2019a ni et al 2020a ni et al 2020b could achieve a high inactivation rate up to 6 log without regrowth nanomaterials are also alternatives for drb control elbourne et al 2019 huo et al 2020 nanomaterials can be made from a variety of materials involving diverse inactivation mechanisms such as ros generation and mechanical cell damage alvarez et al 2018 qu et al 2013 the main advantages of nanomaterials are the avoidance of regrowth and low dbps formation huo et al 2020 nanomaterials could achieve complete disinfection no culturable bacteria detected within one minute especially in the flow through reactor nevertheless any novel method of disinfection might also have its own drb which has not been deeply studied drb could also be controlled together with other hazards in the water advanced oxidation processes aops are effective methods to remove lots of refractory contaminants in water hydroxyl radical oh generated by aops has great disinfection ability due to its strong oxidizing property fan and song 2020 for instance photo fenton reached a considerable inactivation efficiency of arg in real hospital wastewater serna galvis et al 2019 in addition to the choice of disinfection technologies the determination of the dosage of disinfectants should also be meticulously considered high mid and low dose of disinfectants might have completely different effects on bacterial regrowth potentials of drb and aoc level chen et al 2020a kim et al 2010 over dosage of disinfectants seemingly reduce the total amount of drb in short term however it might cause more severe problems of drb wang et al 2019d as well as increase the generation of dbps therefore the appropriate dosage is beneficial for the balance between microbial control and the costs moreover it is necessary to exploit a series of monitoring methods that can effectively reflect the microbial community structure characteristics in water on time culture based methods could not provide sufficient information on time ward et al 1990 while the applications of microfluidics provide the possibility for the rapid detection of some key microorganisms bridle et al 2014 6 2 extended concept of drb in other treatment processes disinfection is not the only unit in water treatment that changes the composition of microorganisms other units such as filtration also reshape the microbial community structure and might also have residual bacteria problems kristian stevik et al 2004 for instance the increase in aoc levels after coagulation led to a higher microbial growth potential of reclaimed water than secondary effluent chen et al 2018b zhao et al 2014b for microbial risk control through the whole flow path of a water plant attention of engineers and researchers should not be limited to disinfection units but also on other processes having effect on the microbial community structure greay et al 2019 the concept of drb indicates that the quantity control of microorganisms in water treatment has been developed to the consideration of the microbial community structure meanwhile drb problems might also exist in disinfection possesses in the air and solid phase harmful microorganisms existing in bioaerosols and on food surfaces pose a threat to human health through breathing and eating masotti et al 2019 in commonly used disinfection processes for air and solid surface disinfectants cannot remain in the air or on solid surfaces for too long which might also cause drb problem similar to water treatment 7 conclusions disinfection residual bacteria drb is a ubiquitous problem and a great challenge in water treatment and reuse which could bring about various risks in the aspects of health process and ecology on the phyla classes level Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the top four most common dominant phyla classes after disinfection and firmicutes showed a clear regularity of relative abundance rising up after disinfection on the genera level pseudomonas mycobacterium legionella sphingomonas and bacillus were the top five most common genera of great increase in relative abundance after disinfection using chlorine containing disinfectants pseudomonas acinetobacter and limnobacter were the top three typical drb genera after uv disinfection and those for ozone disinfection were pseudomonas acinetobacter and rheinheimera pseudomonas and acinetobacter could be considered as model bacteria in further disinfection research as they possess multiple disinfection resistance and various hazards except for disinfection other water treatment processes might also face the problems of residual bacteria which have not received enough attention and need to be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16620,the epidemic of covid 19 has aroused people s particular attention to biosafety a growing number of disinfection products have been consumed during this period however the flaw of disinfection has not received enough attention especially in water treatment processes while cutting down the quantity of microorganisms disinfection processes exert a considerable selection effect on bacteria and thus reshape the microbial community structure to a great extent causing the problem of disinfection residual bacteria drb these systematic and profound changes could lead to the shift in regrowth potential bio fouling potential as well as antibiotic resistance level and might cause a series of potential risks in this review we collected and summarized the data from the literature in recent 10 years about the microbial community structure shifting of natural water or wastewater in full scale treatment plants caused by disinfection based on these data typical drb with the most reporting frequency after disinfection by chlorine containing disinfectants ozone disinfection and ultraviolet disinfection were identified and summarized which were the bacteria with a relative abundance of over 5 in the residual bacteria community and the bacteria with an increasing rate of relative abundance over 100 after disinfection furthermore the phylogenic relationship and potential risks of these typical drb were also analyzed twelve out of fifteen typical drb genera contain pathogenic strains and many were reported of great secretion ability pseudomonas and acinetobacter possess multiple disinfection resistance and could be considered as model bacteria in future studies of disinfection we also discussed the growth secretion and antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb as well as possible control strategies the drb phenomenon is not limited to water treatment but also exists in the air and solid disinfection processes which need more attention and more profound research especially in the period of covid 19 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection residual bacteria drb microbial community microbial risk disinfection resistance 1 introduction biosafety is of vital importance in water treatment storage distribution and usage ruiz et al 2000 sedlak and von gunten 2011 therefore disinfection units are essential in all kinds of water treatment facilities rutala and weber 2016 shannon et al 2008 due to the wide applicability and technological economy chlorine containing disinfectants mainly including free chlorine chloramine and chlorine dioxide ultraviolet uv disinfection and ozone disinfection became the three most commonly used disinfection technologies sedlak and von gunten 2011 the covid epidemic beginning in 2019 has increased people s concern for microbial risks as a consequence more demand of disinfectants was generated bogler et al 2020 and some authorities began to apply higher dosages of disinfectants in wastewater treatment processes lu and guo 2021 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2020a nevertheless scarcely any of the disinfection methods could inactivate all microorganisms in water in full scale applications proctor and hammes 2015 disinfection possesses a significant selection effect on different kinds of bacteria in water l√≥pez et al 2019 luo et al 2021 and the residual part usually contains undesirable bacteria which could cause various hazards under diverse scenarios garner et al 2018 yu et al 2018 hence the residual part of microorganisms remaining the capacity of growth or virulence after disinfection which could be defined as the disinfection residual bacteria drb deserves special attention in water disinfection processes it is not only the total amount of drb that needs to be considered but also the composition and characteristics of them most of commonly used microbial assessment methods in water treatment are based on plate culture these methods can only reveal the level of bacterial quantity rather than microbial community structure which is vital for comprehensive evaluation of microbial risk of the water szewzyk et al 2000 in addition only a small fraction of microorganisms in the water are culturable van nevel et al 2017 ward et al 1990 therefore it is hard to acquire a comprehensive understanding of microbial risk levels via heterotrophic plate counts hpc up to now there have been many studies on the resistance of pure strains towards disinfection luo et al 2021 however research aimed at relative resistance of bacteria in water from full scale treatment plants is more meaningful for microbial risk control since the beginning of the 21st century high throughput sequencing or next generation sequencing ngs has been continuously developed and applied to the analysis of water samples hirai et al 2017 tan et al 2015 a number of studies have found that the disinfection processes such as chlorine and chloramine disinfection belila et al 2016 chiao et al 2014 jia et al 2015 uv disinfection li et al 2020 liu et al 2019b pullerits et al 2020 and ozone disinfection alexander et al 2016 chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 have a significant effect on the microbial community structure however there has not been a systematic and logical evaluation of drb the present study aimed at establishing a systematical analysis of drb and proposing criteria for identification of drb from the perspective of microbial community structure herein we recognized typical drb at phyla and genera levels and analyzed the growth secretion and antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb several promising approaches for drb control were also discussed in general this study provided a novel perspective towards aquatic microbial risk analysis and control 2 risks of drb drb refers to the residual part of microorganisms which remain their growing ability or virulence after disinfection drb could bring about a series of potential risks which could not be evaluated by the amount of bacteria in water and in some cases are even greater than that of undisinfected microbiome flemming 2020 wang et al 2019b the risks of drb could be divided into three categories which are health ecological and process risks fig 1 2 1 health risks one of the primary aims of disinfection is to reduce pathogens and opportunistic pathogens nevertheless it has been reported that pathogens and opportunistic pathogens could regrow and their relative abundance might be higher among drb in drinking water and treated wastewater posing threats to human and animal health cui et al 2020 pang et al 2016 furthermore it is possible for drb in water to be spread to other phases and trigger additional hazards during water distribution and usage drb colonized in water distribution systems could form a biofilm which is a shelter providing durable high level tolerance against disinfectants for pathogens and other unfavorable bacteria flemming 2020 garner et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 drb within irrigation water could migrate onto the surface of crops posing a threat to food safety gu et al 2020 truchado et al 2018 2 2 process risks process risk means harm to facilities caused by drb in water treatment distribution storage and usage in many scenarios though the disinfection units reduce the amount of microorganism and improve the quality of the effluent drb also sometimes bring more risks to water treatment facilities especially when the growth and metabolic characteristics of drb rather than their quantity play a more important role in particular most process risks are associated with biofilm formation and growth one of the significant process risks of drb is the fouling of the separation membranes in water purification processes membrane fouling is usually caused by polysaccharides and proteins in extracellular polymeric substances eps of bacteria rather than bacteria themselves khan et al 2015 wang et al 2019b commonly used separation membranes in water treatment include microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis ro ro is an essential process in seawater desalination and high quality reclaimed water production bai et al 2001 unlike micro and ultra filtration membranes the current market dominating polyamide thin film composite ro membrane has poor tolerance of oxidant yao et al 2020 therefore it is hard to apply disinfectants on the membrane surface directly increasing the difficulty of controlling the growth and eps secretion of drb membrane fouling is a serious expense for water treatment plants especially high quality water reclamation plants it was estimated that the costs of membrane fouling accounted for 30 of the operating costs at water factory 21 which is one of the most famous water reclamation projects flemming 2011 pipe corrosion in water distribution systems is another typical and costly risk of drb iron and steel pipes are the most frequently used materials in water distribution systems mohebbi and li 2011 though most of the water was disinfected before distribution corrosion of the pipe network was still unavoidable pipe corrosion is more related to the microbial community structure and function of the microbiome than the number of organisms zhang et al 2018a the abundances of four kinds of bacteria related to sulfur and iron biotransformation play the main roles which are iron oxidizing bacteria iron reducing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur oxidizing bacteria wang et al 2012 the corrosion of pipes results in tremendous costs for instance in china the cost of pipe corrosion was estimated to be 10 billion rmb in 2014 hou et al 2017 except for membrane fouling and pipe corrosion biofouling also cause significant hazards and cost in many other industries tough thousands of tons of disinfectants are applied every day in power plants around the world cost of biofouling still accounts for about 20 of overall fouling costs in heat exchangers cloete 2003 murthy and venkatesan 2009 azis et al 2001 estimated that cost caused by biofouling in seawater desalination systems was about 15 billion dollars per year over world 2 3 ecological risks the ecological risks of drb consist of two aspects dominant species shifting and abundance variation of functional genes since disinfection exerts a selection effect on the microbiome dominant species of drb are frequently different from that before disinfection leading to a prominent shift of metabolism adaptability and resistance of microbiome cui et al 2020 pang et al 2016 similar problems also took place in terms of the abundance of functional genes higher antibiotic resistance level of drb is a crucial ecological risk causing by disinfection processes chen et al 2020c there has been plenty of evidence of abundance increasing of antibiotic resistance genes after disinfection alexander et al 2016 guo et al 2013 meckes 1982 furthermore ubiquitous horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes might aggravate this risk khan et al 2016 3 research methods and recognition criteria of typical drb the risks of drb are mainly derived from the characteristics shift of microbiome causing by the selection effect of disinfection these changes mainly include microbial community shifting growth characteristics shifting secretion characteristics shifting and antibiotic resistance characteristics shifting fig 2 the shift of microbial community structure is the most critical aspect as all of other changes have inextricable relation with the microbial community structure changes wang et al 2019c chen et al 2020b therefore a deep insight into microbial community shift is foremost typical drb at phyla classes and genera levels were recognized from the literature in this review 3 1 research methods of microbial community shifting up to now ngs is the most effective method for comprehensive analysis of microbial communities tan et al 2015 the processing methods and sequencing platforms applied by previous researchers are listed in table s1 illumina and roche 454 are the two most widely used platforms 454 pyrosequencing is better for investigating microbial communities while illumina high throughput sequencing is more suitable for metagenomic analysis hirai et al 2017 huang et al 2014 as the concentration of bacteria in water samples especially drb is relatively low bacteria must be effectively enriched prior to dna extraction and sequencing membrane filtration enrichment has been widely adopted by researchers due to its feasibility and little effect on microbial community structure typically 1 10 l water sample was filtered through 0 2 0 22 Œºm membrane filters then the filters were preserved at 80 c until dna extraction and amplification the volume of the water sample could be roughly determined according to hpc wang et al 2013 we recommend to process the liquid samples as fast as possible once sampling is done in order to maintain the original microbial community structure and the filters should be frozen immediately after the filtration process regrettably only a few researchers indicated the time consume from sampling to processing in their research articles data quality control is of great significance in the testing and analysis of environmental samples ju and zhang 2015 a larger sample number brings about larger statistical significance and stronger persuasion to ensure the reliability of the data at least three biological replicates are essential furthermore we suggest that the number of replicates in the experimental group and the control group remain similar to make a better comparison 3 2 recognition criteria of drb drb does not refer to several specific strains it is a summary of a series of phenomena nevertheless it is of great significance to summarize the regularity of these phenomena and identify typical drb for future research we recognized typical drb from two perspectives the bacteria becoming dominant in the microbial community after disinfection and the bacteria with a drastically increasing of relative abundance after disinfection the results of high throughput sequencing are mainly presented at the phyla level and genera level the thresholds of dominant phylum in previous studies are quite different from 0 01 to more than 10 liu et al 2021 qiao et al 2021 shahi et al 2016 yan et al 2021 zha et al 2021 among these thresholds 5 is a typical one for microbial community structure of water and wastewater wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 proteobacteria was usually separated into Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ¥ and other proteobacteria as it is a rather rich phylum becerra castro et al 2016 ling et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2014 considering that there are about 20 30 phyla or classes belonging to proteobacteria commonly found in water li et al 2017a the average relative abundance of each phylum is about 3 5 thus a low threshold is not applicable for distinguishing dominant phyla on the other hand if the threshold is too high only a few of most dominant phylum classes such as firmicutes Œ≤ and Œ≥ proteobacteria could be recognized bal krishna et al 2020 chen et al 2020a therefore we used the threshold of 5 of relative abundance to identify dominant phyla as for genera level the threshold of dominant genera was set at 1 alexander et al 2016 campbell et al 2011 numberger et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b zhao et al 2020 the bacteria whose relative abundance significantly increased after disinfection were also considered as drb though the microbial community structure of influents and seasonal fluctuations have effects on the microbial community structure of the effluents disinfection processes stronger impact on it ma et al 2020 potgieter et al 2018 in addition the microbial communities of influents of different water plants vary greatly while the disinfection processes are relatively similar hence it is necessary to conduct an investigation on the relative abundance changes of bacteria during disinfection to find out several typical drb in our study the threshold for typical drb was set as relative abundance increases over 100 after disinfection and reported by more than two research articles for most commonly used chlorine containing disinfectants the threshold of the number of reports is increased to three as research articles about disinfection using chlorine containing disinfectants are much more than that on uv and ozone disinfection 4 microbial community characteristics of drb 4 1 drb at phyla level according to the aforementioned identification criteria dominant phyla before and after disinfection reported previously are listed in table s2 and the occurrence frequency of dominant phyla in drb were summarized in fig 3 a Œ± Œ≤ and Œ≥ proteobacteria frequently presented as dominant classes in drb under all three commonly used disinfection processes chlorine containing disinfectants uv and ozone disinfection this might be attributed to wide metabolic versatility and adaption of the adverse environment of proteobacteria becerra castro et al 2016 Œ± proteobacteria having a wide range of general stress responses francez charlot et al 2015 occurred most frequently in drb of disinfection by chlorine containing disinfectants the changes of relative abundance of the top 10 most common phyla are shown in fig 3b d firmicutes was not the most frequent dominant phylum but performed a clear regularity of higher relative abundance in drb spore production is an ineluctable reason for firmicutes to survive from disinfection the proportion of Œ≥ proteobacteria increased in all three kinds of disinfection processes especially in ozonation a comparative study showed that no matter how the water quality fluctuated the relative abundance of Œ≥ proteobacteria was consistently higher in drb becerra castro et al 2016 a number of well known fecal oral pathogens are from Œ≥ proteobacteria including legionella acinetobacter salmonella and so on blaschke et al 2021 santos 2014 yunana et al 2021 combined with the results of analysis of the dominant phyla Œ≥ proteobacteria deserves distinctive attention in terms of the harmful microorganisms after disinfection verrucomicrobia displayed a long box in fig 3c which is similar for chloroflexi in ozone that means these phyla showed an extensive variability in microbial community structure of drb implying that bacteria in these phyla from different water samples might possess greatly difference of resistance toward disinfection hence analysis at lower level such as genera level is necessary types of water samples were listed in table s2 we divided all data into three categories drinking water wastewater including secondary effluent and reclaimed water and other including seawater cooling water irrigation water and domestic hot water to perform a sub analysis of water source effect the results of sub analysis basically met those regardless of water sources in wastewater Œ± Œ≤ and Œ≥ proteobacteria were more likely to become dominant phylum among drb the relative abundance increasement of Œ≥ proteobacteria and firmicutes were more obvious in drinking water than other types of water source 4 2 drb at genera level dominant genera 1 before disinfection and in drb were listed in table s3 dominant genera of effluents were largely affected by that of influents having a great deal of uncertainty hence we mainly concentrated on relative abundance changes of genera a total of 15 genera were recognized as typical drb genera according to the criteria mentioned above fig 4 ten of them were drb of disinfection using chlorine containing disinfectants including mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas which have been reported as chlorine resistant bacteria le dantec et al 2002 luo et al 2021 there were three and five typical drb genera under uv and ozone disinfection respectively resistance of bacteria is the major reason for relative abundance changes of drb cell resistance might be derived from protective secretions special resistant structures and a series of stress responses certain proteobacteria such as pseudomonas were known for strong secretion ability of eps which could act as a shelter against disinfectants freitas et al 2011 furthermore persister formation is a universal reaction against adversity existing in almost all bacteria maisonneuve and gerdes 2014 this process is motivated by a ubiquitous bacterial stress alarmone guanosine penta and tetra phosphate p ppgpp offering a considerable high resistance level for persisters we used type strains of each genus to figure the phylogenetic relationship of typical drb genera fig 5 typical drb were distributed in three phyla which are proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes these three phyla are also the main home of chlorine resistant bacteria luo et al 2021 though ozone has a more similar disinfection mechanism with chlorine containing disinfectants we found that typical drb of uv and ozone disinfection were more phylogenetic closely it implied that similar resistance mechanisms against uv and ozone might exist and different bacteria might possess various resistance mechanisms to chlorine containing disinfectants disinfection processes might also have a selection effect on gram positive negative bacteria most species in typical drb of uv and ozone disinfection were gram negative fig 5 experiments of drinking water have also found that the proportion of gram negative bacteria increased in drb of uv disinfection chen et al 2020a though the gram positive bacteria have thicker cell walls gram negative bacterial could be protected by cell walls consisting of two layers lipopolysaccharides are the main component of the outer layer while a thin layer of peptidoglycan resides in the inner plasma membrane yusof et al 2019 multiple barriers allow gram negative bacteria to withstand more adverse conditions types of water samples were listed in table s3 a sub analysis of water source effects conducted with the same methods as section 4 1 showed basically the same result pathogens and opportunistic pathogens belonging to typical drb genera was listed in table s4 12 of 15 typical drb genera contain pathogenic species and some of them are known to possess multi drug resistance such as acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa blaschke et al 2021 tarazi et al 2021 in addition to pathogenicity biofouling is also an essential risk of drb among typical drb genera pseudomonas and sphingomonas are known to secrete sticky polysaccharides which enhance the adhesion between cell and surface and facilitate the formation of biofilm freitas et al 2011 4 3 multiple disinfection resistance in drb we applied the venn diagram to depict the multiple disinfection resistance characteristics of typical drb in fig 6 it was found that acinetobacter has resistance against uv and ozone disinfection and pseudomonas possesses resistance against all three commonly used disinfection methods both of them belong to the order pseudomonadales in class Œ≥ proteobacteria except for the perspective of relative abundance similar results were found in the study of pure strains under mono and synergistic disinfection jung and park 2015 liu et al 2019b wei et al 2020 therefore pseudomonas and acinetobacter could be considered as model genera in subsequent studies of drb especially researches in multiple disinfection resistance and evaluations of novel disinfection technologies 4 4 microbial diversity of drb microbial diversity plays a dual role in microbial risk control higher microbial diversity generally means a more stable microbiome as well as its functional characteristics on the other hand the high diversity of unfavorable bacteria in drb such as pathogenic bacteria means microbial risks are more difficult to cope with huang et al 2014 variations of the five most commonly used alpha diversity indexes of drb were listed in table s5 among them otus ace and chao1 index reflect the richness of the microbial community and shannon index and simpson index comprehensively consider the evenness as well as the richness of species in the water samples a higher shannon index or lower simpson index indicates higher microbial evenness it is easily accepted that drb has lower total bacteria numbers as well as lower microbial diversity however microbial diversity did not always decline after disinfection fig 7 there have been some cases of higher microbial diversity of drb li et al 2017a liu et al 2019b ma et al 2020 therefore there has not been a consensus on whether drb possess lower microbial diversity than microorganisms before disinfection the changes of microbial diversity and corresponding functions and risks of the microbiome need to be profoundly investigated 5 growth secretion and antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb 5 1 growth characteristics regrowth of drb is a pervasive problem existing in all of disinfection processes nocker et al 2020 uv and ozone have little continuous disinfection effect wang et al 2021 free chlorine is much better than them but still facing the problem of decay wang et al 2019a chloramine and chlorine dioxide have a relatively low rate of decay chen et al 2020b for all that few disinfection methods can prevent bacterial regrowth problems furthermore disinfection processes could alter the growth characteristics of the bacteria complicating the regrowth process miettinen et al 1998 cases of growth characteristics of drb and potential risks were listed in table 1 the shift of microbial community structure may lead to the change of growth characteristic as different strains possess various growth rates the regrowth process could collaborate with the selection effect of disinfection to further promote the dominance of certain harmful bacteria some pathogens and opportunistic pathogens such as salmonella and pseudomonas have been reported of higher levels of regrowth after disinfection than indicator bacteria li et al 2013 ribas et al 2000 as a consequence the relative abundance of these undesirable bacteria would increase and hide corresponding risks behind the ostensible decrease in numbers of total bacteria or indicator bacteria ling et al 2018 drb might also have a different growth cycle from bacteria before disinfection the growth process of bacteria could be divided into lag phase exponential phase plateau phase and dead phase disinfection processes could expand the lag phase and faster the growth rate of bacteria during the exponential phase which means a higher regrowth potential of drb chen et al 2020b disinfection processes also impact quorum sensing signals secretion which may cause more serious biofouling wang et al 2021 in addition drb could be induced into the viable but non culturable vbnc state by disinfection processes chen et al 2018a lin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 vnbc state is a way for bacteria to resist the stress of the adverse environment under vbnc state bacteria retain their metabolic activity and pathogenicity but not culturability liu et al 2010 accordingly it is hard for water plant operators to tell the true microbial risk level of water by hpc and other plating methods which are commonly used in full scale water treatment facilities disinfectants interact not only with microorganisms but also with organic substances in the water which act as nutrients for bacterial growth assimilable organic carbon aoc which means the assimilable part of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon is a widely used indicator to evaluate the biological stability of water during storage and distribution nescerecka et al 2018 prest et al 2016 zhao et al 2014a oxidative disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone could convert biological recalcitrant natural organic matter to aoc providing more nutrients for the bacteria and creating a higher potential of drb regrowth chen et al 2018b huang et al 2020 kim et al 2010 zhao et al 2014a therefore the evaluation of a disinfection method should not only be limited to the effect of microbial inactivation but also include the influence on aoc level 5 2 secretion characteristics the secretion characteristics of drb might be drastically different from that before disinfection the shift of secretion characteristics contains two aspects one is linked to the changes of microbial community structure and the other is accounted for the responses of bacteria towards disinfectants chen et al 2021 soluble microbial products smp and eps are the microbial products worthy of special attention in water treatment more et al 2014 ni et al 2011 smp comprise the majority of soluble organic material in biological treatment effluents and might bring about additional toxicity compared to original organic compounds which show ecological risk towards native microorganism barker and stuckey 1999 eps plays a crucial role in biofilm formation which is the key factor of biofouling and disinfectant tolerance in a wide variety of scenarios flemming 2020 meng et al 2009 xue et al 2012 yu et al 2018 yu et al 2021 cases of secretion characteristics of drb and corresponding risks were summarized in table 2 secretion characteristics of different strains are significantly different yu et al 2018 therefore the reshaping of microbial community structure by disinfection contributes to the difference of secretion characteristics of drb disinfection processes usually select bacteria with higher eps secretion ability as one of the major functions of eps is protecting bacteria from disinfectants sheng et al 2010 wang et al found that long term usage of free chlorine selected four genera of bacteria with high eps secretion ability which are methylobacterium pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter wang et al 2019b after chlorine disinfection the drb dominated by these bacteria secreted more eps with a higher proportion of high molecular weight matter a similar phenomenon also appeared in drb of uv there has been evidence that the eps amount of drb increased with uv dose wu et al 2021 as a consequence long term applications of a single disinfection pre treatment might aggravate biofouling rather than alleviate it the acute responses to oxidative stress also attribute to the shift of secretion characteristics of the microbiome disinfectants could accelerate intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production of bacteria and dramatically alter bacteria metabolism and secretion ability han et al 2017 in addition some disinfectants react with secreta directly xue et al 2014 sacrificial reactions of eps matrix with disinfectants are not only an effective protection mechanism for bacteria xue et al 2012 but might also lead to more release of organic matters and ambiguous biofouling potential alteration wang et al 2019c yu et al 2017 5 3 antibiotic resistance characteristics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args have received particular attention in public health in recent years hoffman et al 2015 takeuchi and tanaka 2020 it is possible for args to be either destroyed or selected during disinfection xu et al 2020 and the ultimate antibiotic resistance level of drb results from these two aspects competitively cases of growth characteristics of drb and potential risks were summarized in table 3 similar to growth and secretion characteristics the variation of antibiotic resistance characteristics of drb could also be induced by microbial community shift there has been evidence that the microbial community shift made a significant contribution to the shift of antibiotic resistance characteristics in drinking water rather than mobile genetic elements reproduction or transfer jia et al 2015 arb have a greater ability to cope with the selection pressures of disinfectants munir et al 2011 hence the inactivation rate of some arb was significantly lower than the total level of bacteria in water leading to an increase in the relative abundance of arb and a selection effect of args in the disinfection process czekalski et al 2016 guo et al 2013 drug efflux pump is one of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance of cells oxidative stress generated by oxidative disinfectants induces the overexpression of the efflux pump genes leading to a higher antibiotic resistance level of drb hou et al 2019 furthermore low doses of disinfectants could aggravate this process as the expression of the efflux pump is stronger while the inactivation effect of args and arb is dissatisfactory unfortunately the doses of ozone added into water is usually low czekalski et al 2016 when ammonia nitrogen content is high in water part of free chlorine transfer to chloramine which possesses a worse removal efficiency of arg yoon et al 2017 disinfection processes also have an impact on the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in drb the horizontal transfer includes conjugation transduction and transformation in which bacteria acquire arg from donor bacterial phage and foreign dna respectively chen et al 2020c qiu et al 2012 horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes facilitates the recombination of various risks for instance certain pathogens may turn to arb via this process salyers and shoemaker 2006 guo et al 2015 found that chlorine disinfection significantly amplified the cell permeability and led to a high frequency of conjugative transfer cheng et al 2021 reported that chlorine could reduce the relative abundance of args but simultaneously broaden the host range 6 challenges and prospects 6 1 possible control strategies against drb a number of novel disinfection strategies have been developed and might be applicable for eliminating drb including synergic disinfection secondary disinfection and novel disinfection technologies synergistic disinfection could effectively cope with bacterial resistance to a single disinfectant ding et al reported that ozone achieved an inactivation rate of 99 9 for chlorine resistant bacillus cereus spore ding et al 2019 similar results were found in the synergistic disinfection of uv and chlorine cho et al 2018 however some other studies showed that synergistic disinfection was unsatisfactory cui et al found that pseudomonas one of typical drb genus became dominant genera after ozone disinfection and its relative abundance did not decrease after subsequent uv disinfection cui et al 2020 another study of drinking water manifested that the relative abundance of mycobacterium was higher in the effluent of synergistic disinfection of ozone and chlorine li et al 2017a therefore whether synergistic disinfection could solve the problem of drb is not sure the result might vary with water samples secondary disinfection is an effective strategy for long distance delivery of water wang et al 2014 secondary disinfection includes two steps of chlorine or chloramine dosing preventing high initial chlorine concentration the original intention of secondary disinfection was to control disinfection by products dbps seidel et al 2005 recent studies indicated that secondary disinfection could achieve higher disinfection efficiency and causing severer damages to the cells preventing bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation in water distribution systems li et al 2017b zhao et al 2020 lots of novel disinfection methods have been developed in the recent decade novel disinfection methods differ from traditional ones in terms of mechanisms and were developed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional disinfection methods ferrate is a novel disinfectant with a two step disinfection mechanism the combination of strong oxidizing ability of ferrate and coagulation initiated by its reduction product makes ferrate an effective disinfectant for a wide range of bacteria and virus sharma et al 2015 ferret could inactivate total coliform and chlorine resistant spore forming bacteria with an efficiency of more than 3 log at a dosage about 2 3 mg l sharma et al 2005 studies have also shown that ferrate was effective for damaging harmful genes and preventing bacteria regrowth wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 electric disinfection is an environmentally benign disinfection technology either electroporation induced by the enhanced electric field huo et al 2016 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b or direct oxidation of the anode liu et al 2019a ni et al 2020a ni et al 2020b could achieve a high inactivation rate up to 6 log without regrowth nanomaterials are also alternatives for drb control elbourne et al 2019 huo et al 2020 nanomaterials can be made from a variety of materials involving diverse inactivation mechanisms such as ros generation and mechanical cell damage alvarez et al 2018 qu et al 2013 the main advantages of nanomaterials are the avoidance of regrowth and low dbps formation huo et al 2020 nanomaterials could achieve complete disinfection no culturable bacteria detected within one minute especially in the flow through reactor nevertheless any novel method of disinfection might also have its own drb which has not been deeply studied drb could also be controlled together with other hazards in the water advanced oxidation processes aops are effective methods to remove lots of refractory contaminants in water hydroxyl radical oh generated by aops has great disinfection ability due to its strong oxidizing property fan and song 2020 for instance photo fenton reached a considerable inactivation efficiency of arg in real hospital wastewater serna galvis et al 2019 in addition to the choice of disinfection technologies the determination of the dosage of disinfectants should also be meticulously considered high mid and low dose of disinfectants might have completely different effects on bacterial regrowth potentials of drb and aoc level chen et al 2020a kim et al 2010 over dosage of disinfectants seemingly reduce the total amount of drb in short term however it might cause more severe problems of drb wang et al 2019d as well as increase the generation of dbps therefore the appropriate dosage is beneficial for the balance between microbial control and the costs moreover it is necessary to exploit a series of monitoring methods that can effectively reflect the microbial community structure characteristics in water on time culture based methods could not provide sufficient information on time ward et al 1990 while the applications of microfluidics provide the possibility for the rapid detection of some key microorganisms bridle et al 2014 6 2 extended concept of drb in other treatment processes disinfection is not the only unit in water treatment that changes the composition of microorganisms other units such as filtration also reshape the microbial community structure and might also have residual bacteria problems kristian stevik et al 2004 for instance the increase in aoc levels after coagulation led to a higher microbial growth potential of reclaimed water than secondary effluent chen et al 2018b zhao et al 2014b for microbial risk control through the whole flow path of a water plant attention of engineers and researchers should not be limited to disinfection units but also on other processes having effect on the microbial community structure greay et al 2019 the concept of drb indicates that the quantity control of microorganisms in water treatment has been developed to the consideration of the microbial community structure meanwhile drb problems might also exist in disinfection possesses in the air and solid phase harmful microorganisms existing in bioaerosols and on food surfaces pose a threat to human health through breathing and eating masotti et al 2019 in commonly used disinfection processes for air and solid surface disinfectants cannot remain in the air or on solid surfaces for too long which might also cause drb problem similar to water treatment 7 conclusions disinfection residual bacteria drb is a ubiquitous problem and a great challenge in water treatment and reuse which could bring about various risks in the aspects of health process and ecology on the phyla classes level Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the top four most common dominant phyla classes after disinfection and firmicutes showed a clear regularity of relative abundance rising up after disinfection on the genera level pseudomonas mycobacterium legionella sphingomonas and bacillus were the top five most common genera of great increase in relative abundance after disinfection using chlorine containing disinfectants pseudomonas acinetobacter and limnobacter were the top three typical drb genera after uv disinfection and those for ozone disinfection were pseudomonas acinetobacter and rheinheimera pseudomonas and acinetobacter could be considered as model bacteria in further disinfection research as they possess multiple disinfection resistance and various hazards except for disinfection other water treatment processes might also face the problems of residual bacteria which have not received enough attention and need to be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16621,plastic and microplastic pollution is an environmental and societal concern the interaction of plastic with organic chemicals in the environment has attracted scientific interest new evidences have highlighted an unexpectedly high affinity of environmental plastics also for metal ions the degree and typology of plastic ageing including from mechanical uv and biological degradations appear as a pivotal factor determining such an interaction these earlier evidences recently opened a new research avenue in the plastic pollution area this review is the first to organize and critically discuss knowledge developed so far results from field and laboratory studies of metal accumulation on plastic are presented and the environmental factors most likely to control such an interaction are discussed on the light of this knowledge a generalist conceptual model useful for building hypotheses on the mechanisms at stake and directing future studies was elaborated and presented here furthermore all available data on the thermodynamics of the plastic metal interaction obtained from laboratory experiments are inventoried and discussed here highlighting methodological and technical challenges that can potentially affect cross comparability of data and their relevance for environmental settings finally insights and recommendations on experimental approaches and analytical techniques that can help overtaking current limitations and knowledge gaps are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mp metal water pollution adsorption environmental modeling 1 introduction plastic litter and microplastic mp pollution is an environmental issue of concern a conspicuous fraction of produced plastic waste is mismanaged and results in pollution with freshwater and estuarine environments being mostly impacted bellasi et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 nizzetto et al 2016 schell et al 2021 while reports of plastic contamination in water sediment and soil are increasingly abundant in literature binda et al 2021 crossman et al 2020 its consequences for the ecosystem and human health are still mostly unknown plastic polymers sorb organic compounds including pesticides and antibiotics through hydrophobic interactions as broadly documented in scientific literature koelmans et al 2016 in contrast plastic polymers are generally considered inert toward aqueous metal ions this paradigm however has been questioned by the results of recent laboratory studies demonstrating a substantial interaction between metal ions and mps metal ions are crucial micronutrients but if overconcentrated they are among the most aggressive environmental toxicants johnson et al 2017 the nature and mechanisms of this interaction are still unclear but sorption capacities observed for metals in laboratory settings more than 40 of some dissolved metals are adsorbed in current experiments holmes et al 2012 lang et al 2020 and reports of coexisting metals adsorbed on plastic particles in environmental settings kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 warn about the likely ecological implications of mp metal interaction fig 1 a such as enhanced metal bioavailability for the biota through vector effects bradney et al 2019 naqash et al 2020 and alteration of the cycling of elements seeley et al 2020 the number of studies focused on this environmental issues grew exponentially in the last 2 years kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 s liu et al 2021 and a few review papers were recently published on the interaction between plastic particles and chemical contaminants liu et al 2020 torres et al 2021 vieira et al 2021 but mainly dealing with the ecotoxicological implications bradney et al 2019 cao et al 2021 naqash et al 2020 verla et al 2019 the diversity of experimental approaches and materials used to analyze mp metals interaction and lacking of conceptual models for hypothesis creation have hindered progresses in the ability of understanding and predicting the mp trace element interaction process in this critical review we face this challenge with the goal of providing information on the state of the art of research on the topic highlighting knowledge gaps and delivering insights useful to guide future theoretical and experimental assessments of the interaction between metal ions and plastic this review work is structured in three parts in the first part described in section 2 of the paper we will present and discuss the current knowledge on the role of plastic side and water side determinants controlling adsorption desorption equilibria dynamics and thermodynamics of the plastic metal ion interaction such a review includes an account of currently available evidences on the role of plastic ageingand of water physicochemical properties in section 3 of the paper different conceptual models of the metal ion plastic interaction will be proposed considering variability of characteristics of weathered plastics stemming from both the influence of thermo oxidative degradation processes and formation of biological films finally section 4 of the paper will be dedicated to the review and critical discussion of current experimental approaches to study this interaction in both laboratory simulated conditions bottom up and in environmental samples top down 2 processes and conditions at the interface between plastics and metals analyzing plastic metal ion interaction from a mechanistic point of view requires handling a complex array of synergistic and competitive processes occurring both in the solution and at the interface between the polymer and the water phase both these are expectedly modulated by water chemistry on the one side mainly salinity ph temperature redox conditions and other dissolved ions and the characteristics of the plastic matrix on the other side with a major role played by the degradation rate and biofouling of polymers which influence surface charge wettability and reactive surface area fig 1b in the following sections the environmental processes which can influence the modality of plastic and metals interaction will be reviewed focusing on the challenges concerned with their experimental assessment and on the possible approaches to overtake them 2 1 the plastic side polymer degradation and its possible effects on the interaction with metal ions the level of plastic ageing is reportedly an important factor for metal sorption two main processes are responsible for altering plastic properties at the interface with the environment physicochemical deterioration and biological colonization pristine plastics are composed by an amorphous or semicrystalline matrix of entangled polymer chains the most used include polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyamides pa with the intramolecular space typically filled with chemical additives used to improve physicochemical and mechanical properties additives includes for example plasticizers antioxidants light quenching compounds flame retardants and dyes the topic of polymer ageing on metal sorption is widely studied bellasi et al 2020 p liu et al 2021 lv et al 2015 w wang et al 2019 the sketch in fig 1b represents the two main processes affecting ageing of plastic particles dispersed in the environment plastic surface can be altered by physicochemical modification in water bodies affecting the surface charge and oxidation moreover pristine or aged plastic can be colonized by different microorganisms which completely alter the surface of polymers possibly enhancing an interaction with trace elements through increasing wettability and exposing charged groups carried by extracellular polymeric substances typical of biofilm forming microorganisms the potential influence of plastic ageing in enhancing the interaction with metal ions in water has been recognized and investigated in recent studies table s1 in supplementary material adsorption desorption tests with metals have been conducted on plastics with different level of ageing lang et al 2020 thomas et al 2020 q wang et al 2020 chemical oxidation processes especially uv based have received more attention while the role of biological colonization in affecting sorption of metal ions have been partly overlooked while decomposing a system complexity in its constituents is often a good approach to research it must be reinforced that in environmental settings chemical and biological ageing co occur and can affect each other hence minimalistic experimental approaches may not be sufficient to fully elucidate the system behavior hence multi tiered experiments at increasing level of system complexity can represent the way forward for example there is a clear demand for developing a better knowledge on the synergic role of biological colonization and chemical ageing of plastics as determinants of the capacity and dynamics of metal ion sorption on the plastic substrate lucas et al 2008 it was reported that the mechanical ageing of polymers can further enhance the biofilm colonization rate carson et al 2013 hence studies that focus on such an interaction can produce data with a higher environmental relevance in the following sections we will present the state of the art on the mechanisms and processes determining physicochemical and biological alteration of plastics and provide insights on their potential role in enhancing sorption of metal ions 2 1 1 physicochemical degradation physicochemical processes mainly responsible for the ageing of plastics are mechanical deterioration and chemical photo oxidative processes mechanical deterioration is mostly responsible for the formation of micro cracking which promotes the fragmentation of polymers in smaller particles ren et al 2020 this process that can be caused by several environmental phenomena including abrasion with the substrate e g driven by bioturbation waves or currents thermic stress uv radiation and deterioration by currents and waves min et al 2020 moreover these phenomena can drive the leaching of additives like plasticizers causing loss in mechanical resistance and elasticity of plastic materials further enhancing degradation processes paluselli et al 2019 mechanical deterioration results in micro and macro fractures of the polymer matrix that determine increased surface rugosity increased specific surface area which in turn results in higher adsorption rate of metals dong et al 2020 luo et al 2020 and can develop into fragmentation of plastic debris in increasingly smaller mps physical deterioration of plastic can also be promoted by oxidative reactions that at molecular level take place by breaking cross links between polymer chains or cause polymer chain interruption with time these alterations at molecular scale can propagate and impair plastic integrity at a macroscale altering its physical technical properties and making it prone to further physical deterioration and fragmentation in the environment such a degradation is typically due to photo thermo oxidative processes uv radiation is the most common driver of polymer oxidation bracco et al 2018 p liu et al 2021 this process initiates with photonic or homolytic cleavage of cc or ch bonds or more frequently of the o oh links of hydroperoxides present in the amorphous zone of polymers from the manufacturing process these events produce alkyl r or alkoxy ro macroradicals respectively in the case of r the reaction terminates with the formation of vinylene double bonds while ro lead to formation of ketones esters and carboxylic acids brandon et al 2016 in environmental condition the formation of hydroperoxide radicals in presence of molecular oxygen can play a key role in the propagation reaction bolland cycle bolland and ten have 1947 to form peroxide radicals roo branching the kinetic chain towards production of ketones alcohols esters and acids because of the role of molecular oxygen the formation of oxidized terminations is likely to proceed from the surface of plastic at the interface with oxic water environments extending in amorphous regions these chain reactions can affect the sorption properties of mps because the generated oxygen containing groups increase polarity hydrophilicity and the surface charge liu et al 2020 oxidized functional groups can ultimately act as binding sites for inorganic ions p liu et al 2021 song et al 2017 2 1 2 biofouling and biological colonization polymers widespread in aquatic environments represent a suitable substrate for the growth of organic and biological films leiser et al 2020 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 deposition of priming organic films on the surface of plastics in water is rapid i e few days harrison et al 2014 pinto et al 2019 this is a passive and spontaneous uptake process driven by the brownian diffusion of organic compounds dissolved in water e g colloids humic substances in the water side thin boundary layer and the sorption onto the plastic surface by weak molecular interactions from the molecular point of view these interactions can have a variable nature given the diversity of functional groups on aged plastic and the complex mixture of organic compounds in natural waters the chemical properties of natural priming films are determinant for the following process of macrofouling colonization by microorganisms lorite et al 2011 many bacteria strains display the ability of anchoring to diverse substrates and form biofilms as an evolutionary adaptation in order to do this they can regulate cell walls and the hydrophobicity of the membranes extracellular polysaccharides composition and develop dedicated structures such as pili curli fimbriae and flagella to exploit adhesive properties of primed surfaces rummel et al 2017 composition of bacterial communities on plastics can vary dramatically pinto et al 2019 the colonization of microorganisms on surface is an example of ecological succession where the assembling of the biofouling community progress with time and it is determined both by neutral e g random and niche e g driven by ecological interactions with the environment and other organisms in the community processes this process is generally slower than priming considering that i microorganisms that can adhere on the plastic substrates are most likely less abundant than dissolved organic matter dom in the water solution and ii there is the need of successful anchorage of a certain number of organisms for an effective biological colonization the initial phase of the biofilm formation is likely a random process whereby the first organisms that can successfully anchor and grow on the substrate will determine the progress of the succession and the resulting biological and chemical characteristics of the film biofilms affect the interaction of plastic particles with trace elements as they enhance plastic surface wettability dussud et al 2018 actively accumulate metal ions through transmembrane transport geng et al 2019 and present extracellular polymeric structure that can form chemical complexes with metals y wang et al 2020 see also section 3 2 differences in the biofilm composition can also be determined by niche processes and therefore reflect different environmental conditions and water chemistry leiser et al 2020 nava and leoni 2021 pinto et al 2019 this in turn can likely influence affinity for metal ions obtaining a representative and reproducible experimental model of a biofilm to carry out controlled experiments of plastic metal interactions is therefore a critical challenge previous works have shown that procaryotes can initiate formation of biofilms with a secondary colonization by eukaryotes including protozoa and microalgae misic and covazzi harriague 2019 these organisms have very different membranes and cell walls characteristics as well as contrastingly different physiology therefore they most likely show different types of interaction with metal ions differently it has been reported that polymer type scarcely affect biofilm species composition zhang et al 2021 2 2 the water side influence of temperature and water chemistry in this section the available knowledge on the influence of water physicochemical properties on the interaction between trace elements and plastics is presented with a specific focus on environmentally relevant conditions the scope of this part of the review is to identify knowledge gaps and limitations of current experimental approaches and to list the water side variables playing an important role in the interaction 2 2 1 ph the effect of water ph on the plastic element interaction has been the focus of some experimental assessment ph is in fact known to affect metal ion speciation and the surface properties of polymers the surface of most common polymers in the environment e g pe and pp among others have low ph values of point of zero change meaning that at the ph of common water environments the surface is electrically negative with an increasing negative charge at increasing ph also at environmentally relevant conditions lin et al 2021 moreover surface properties of polymers carrying ionizable functional groups and in particular of oxidized plastics will change in dependence of ph ionizable functional groups exposed to the solution will become deprotonated at increasing ph values increasing also the number of reactive domains available for the binding of metal ions tang et al 2020 while these polymer side influences of water ph on plastic reactivity has been experimentally confirmed for a range of polymers both pristine and aged including pe pp and nylon ahechti et al 2020 tang et al 2020 water ph is most likely to affect the plastic metal ion interaction through controlling metal speciation in the solution with important consequences on their affinity for binding sites on the plastic surface in fact ph influences the degree of ionization and distribution of the metal species in solution f wang et al 2019 experimental results showed that the effect of water ph in determining the sorption of metal onto polymers varies depending on the cationic or anionic nature of dissolved species the adsorption of bivalent metal cations e g cu cd and pb onto different polymers increases as ph raises as shown in several experimental studies ahechti et al 2020 guan et al 2020 tang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 such a trend may be explained as follows when ph is low h competes with the metals electrostatic repulsion for the adsorption sites negatively affecting the metal adsorption rate anionic species show the opposite behavior the adsorption decreases with increasing ph of the medium at low ph the oh concentration is low and it does not compete with anion for adsorption in positively charged domains of the polymer holmes et al 2012 and zhang et al 2020 showed in fact that whereas the adsorption of cd co ni and pb increases with increasing ph cr adsorption decreases since it exists in solution in the oxyanionic form hcro4 and cro4 2 likewise the study of dong et al 2020 seems to confirm these effects for as iii adsorption on ps mps observing that as ph of the solution increases the form of as iii changes from h3aso3 to aso2 it should be noted that these observations were made in controlled artificial systems that excluded the presence of other chemical species or ligand in solution which are instead important constituents of natural water environments these observations were conducted therefore through oversimplified approaches where only metals and ph adjusters and buffers typically hno3 naoh and nano3 were present it must be noted that especially in the case of alkaline environments sulfates and chlorides used to adjust ph can easily form insoluble salts with the dissolved element making it not available for adsorption by plastic hence potentially affecting the metal ion activity in the solution and the experimental assessment of distribution coefficients moreover while experimental works has broadly focused on sorption kinetics the effect of ph on the desorption mechanism has so far been scarcely considered see section 3 1 it can be expected that desorption of metals from plastics as from different other solid media could be favored in acidic ph which facilitate formation of free ions kalƒç√≠kov√° et al 2020 this is indeed an important process relevant for the bioavailability of metal following ingestion of contaminated plastics fragments by organisms the acidic gastrointestinal tract of most aquatic organisms may indeed promote speciation of plastic bound metals into more available and toxic forms directly inside the organisms embodying the trojan horse effect smith and turner 2020 2 2 2 salinity the salinity of the medium can alter the adsorption of metal ions onto oxidized or biofouled plastic surfaces increased ionic strength of the solution can enhance competition of metals with other dissolved ions for binding sites and can influence accessibility of these binding sites according to most studies the adsorption of positively charged ions is inversely related to salinity as salinity increases metal species and na ions compete for the adsorption onto plastics this has been observed for pb cd zn and cu fu et al 2020 holmes et al 2012 tang et al 2020 turner and holmes 2015 f wang et al 2019 the presence of cl may also promote formation of cl transition metals homoleptic complexes and hydrates possibly leading to a lower activity of free metal ions in the solution and lower adsorption this effect was observed so far for cd f wang et al 2019 while the influence of salinity on the metal ion plastic interaction has been recognized there is a need to elucidate these processes in the context of more environmental realistic settings whereby a number of inorganic ionic species are engaging in the competition for example major ions such as ca2 mg2 k no3 and so4 2 can compete with specific cationic or anionic species of trace elements or form salts with them inhibiting their binding with plastics fu et al 2020 it has been argued zhou et al 2020 that the competition between similar bivalent metals negatively affects the adsorption beyond the water side effects on metal ion speciation salinity can also influence plastic side properties by effecting the electric double layer expected to form over the surface of weathered and partially charged surfaces this process is postulated by the derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek theory the electrical double layer is a structure on the surface of an object exposed to a fluid constituted by two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object the first layer the surface charge either positive or negative consists of ions adsorbed onto the object due to chemical interactions in the case of aged plastics this can be the carboxylic ketones groups of oxidized polymer chains or of the exopolysaccharides of microorganisms in coating biofilms and the different ions non covalently bond to them the second layer also called diffuse layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the coulomb force electrically screening the first layer the diffuse layer is loosely associated with the object and it is made of freely dissolved ions moving under the combined influence of electric attraction and thermal brownian motion at varying solution salinity the thickness of the double layer can vary likely influencing the rate of diffusion and sorption of dissolved ions onto the binding domain on the particle surface furthermore the thickness of the double layer has also implications for the tendence and the rate of homo and hetero aggregation of small particles including for example nanoplastics present in solution at increased ionic strength of the solution the electrical double layer of these particles can be compressed reducing repulsive forces leading to aggregation with other similar particles or with naturally occurring colloids singh et al 2019 wu et al 2019 aggregation alters the physical properties of the particles for example making them to precipitate and the amount of surface available for interaction with dissolved species per unit of particle volume this in turn can result in reduced adsorption capacity for metal ions by the unit of mass of plastic suspended in a solution 2 2 3 temperature the influence of temperature has been so far considered for the investigation of thermodynamic equilibria of the metal ion plastic interaction all the experimental studies found such an interaction to underpin a negative variation of gibbs free energy g 0 and be therefore spontaneous in most cases this process was also found to be endothermic with a positive entropy change h 0 these findings are based on a series of observations conducted with cu and zn to polyethylene terephthalate pet q wang et al 2020 with cu on polyurethane pu xue et al 2021 and with pb on nylon polyvinyl chloride pvc ps and pe lin et al 2021 tang et al 2020 differently studies with as iii adsorption to ps mps highlighted an exothermic h 0 reaction dong et al 2020 these experiments were conceived to study the thermodynamics of the metal ion plastic interaction in ideal conditions and shed light on fundamental mechanisms underpinning the chemical physical interaction see also section 3 2 applicability of the measured activation energies and enthalpies in real environmental settings is uncertain main confounding factors link to the complex nature and great variability of the characteristics of chemically or biologically weathered plastics in the environment and on the role of competing interactions i e binding with other dissolved ligands likely dom or major ions taking place in the water side in natural conditions smith and martell 1987 moreover also the effects of the environmental range of temperature e g 5 25 c should be tested not only for adsorption but also desorption processes similarly to ph section 2 2 1 being this a process overlooked in experiments conducted so far 2 2 4 dissolved organic matter dom to evaluate the interaction of plastic with metal ions in a realistic environmental context experiments with variable levels of dissolved organic matter have been performed dissolved organic matter can bind dissolved metals caprara et al 2016 martell et al 1988 pl√∂ger et al 2005 and can therefore synergistically or antagonistically modulate metal adsorption onto plastics organic matter in water can form complexes with metals and therefore lowering the metal dissolved ions activity liu et al 2020 however dom can also be adsorbed on plastic both through hydrophobic interactions or through weak interaction with charged or partially charged functional groups the formation of priming organic films onto plastic in water environments is an example of such a process possibly enhancing the accumulation of metals on the plastic surface through the deposition of metal organic matter complexes or by increasing the density of negative charges on the primed plastic and consequently affinity for metal ions li et al 2019 moreover once metal ion dom complexes are formed in the solution phase their reactivity changes compared to dissolved metal ions possibly enhancing hydrophobicity and consequently the likelihood of adsorption on neutral plastic surface such as among others the surface of pristine pp and pe tang et al 2021 because of such a complexity earlier studies yielded sometimes contradictory results for example tang et al 2020 proved that fulvic acid in the solution negatively affected the adsorption of pb onto aged nylon mps possibly due to complexation between fulvic acid and pb through interactions with carbonyl hydroxyl and carboxyl groups a similar behavior was observed with humic acid competing with different microplastic polymers for cd adsorption zhou et al 2020 in contrast with these results fu et al 2020 and godoy et al 2019 observed an increase adsorption pb cr and cu on different polymers in tap water and wastewater compared to distilled water proposing the interaction was enhanced by dom present in these matrices these controversial results are possibly linked to the challenge of conducting factorial experiments in ternary systems i e in presence of plastic metal ions and dom with the factors not being fully independent and prone to interfering with each other in a number of possible ways to disentangle such a complexity focus should be placed in analysis of the behavior of the interaction terms resulting from the factorial experiment result on varying experimental conditions while this may help to shed lights on the mechanisms of the three way interaction such an analysis was not fully addressed in earlier studies moreover existing studies on the role of dom on trace element plastic interaction used different time lags for equilibration without focusing on possible different kinetics in adsorption caused by complexing agents in the systems suggestions for future studies include the speciation analysis of elements in solution considering equilibration and different kinetics of adsorption desorption of complexes related to free metal ions see also section 4 2 2 2 2 5 organic pollutants in some very recent studies the effect of dissolved metal ions and some organic pollutants e g surfactants zhang et al 2020 phenanthrene zhou et al 2020 antibiotics y wang et al 2020 co occurring in water environments were investigated the main rationale for these studies was to reveal potential competition among these species for binding sites on the plastic in realistic environmental settings the outcomes of such competition will be primarily determined by the concentrations of the different species which can vary across orders of magnitude rather than their affinity for a given binding domain studies conducted so far considered instead exposure scenarios with extremely high concentrations of organic and inorganic contaminants in the order of mg l often in absence of other dissolved ligands or major ions and in solutions with controlled ionic strength and buffered ph hence current understanding of the interaction of metal ions and organic contaminants for the sorption on plastic is insufficient to draw expectation of their relevance for the environment it is suggested that assessing plastic water phase distribution of major organic and inorganic contaminants in environmental settings e g from monitoring studies could provide useful insights to elucidate the importance of possible competing effects for binding sites and rank plastic affinity for pollutants to support ecological risk assessment 2 2 6 other potentially interesting water side variables redox potential of the water medium can affect the speciation of trace elements in water and their equilibria between solid and liquid phases binda et al 2018 borch et al 2010 it can affect the surface charge of polymers liu and bard 2009 determining the oxidation of functional groups at the surface of plastics wu et al 2017 it can also influence growth and biological composition of film covering plastic surfaces niu et al 2021 rogers et al 2020 these features have possible direct or indirect effects on the capacity of plastic for metal ion adsorption redox potential typically varies along the water column and at the interface with sediments in light and oxygen depleted conditions the environment tend to become reductive niu et al 2021 hence plastics in the anoxic waters or sediments of meromictic environments will expectedly have different interaction with metal ions compared to those in the oxic zone despite its potential importance the redox potential of the medium has been so far overlooked in experimental assessment of the metal plastic interaction the amount and typology of suspended solids in water is also a potentially important determinant of metal accumulation on plastic suspended solids play an important role on speciation and mobility of dissolved metals a recent study by guan et al 2020 assessed adsorption of metals and compared natural suspended sediments from different lakes with those of plastics ps particles both virgin and naturally aged in lake water showing the higher efficiency of the earlier another recent work by li et al 2019 found similar results using sewage sludge as a competitor of plastic for metal ion adsorption future studies should include ternary systems with varying concentration of plastic particles and other solid matter to understand how the competitive effects of other natural adsorbents reduce plastic adsorption capacity 3 models of plastic metal interaction and their applicability for environmental settings in this chapter proposed mechanisms of plastic metal interaction are reviewed on the bases of available experimental evidences and measurements of rates and reaction energies to the best of our knowledge only few studies performed preliminary model fitting to explain the interaction between plastic and metals guo and wang 2021 town et al 2018 while this issue was better elucidated and reviewed for organic compounds koelmans et al 2016 mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 while reviewing the proposed models possible limitations for their applicability in the environmental context will be listed finally conceptual frameworks will be presented drawing from the synthesis of currently available studies that can be useful for describing the interaction in more general and at least semiquantitative terms 3 1 experimentally derived models of interaction the interaction of mps and metal compounds in water environments is typically modeled by statistically fitting results of kinetics and equilibrium isotherm experiments e g desta 2013 langmuir 1916 the evaluation of the kinetics and equilibria of reaction enable the elaboration of mechanistic frames to describe the processes controlling physical transport of the metals at the interface between plastics and water and an estimation of the energy of reactions this in turn provides useful information for generating hypotheses on the molecular bases of the process these models enable listing the most plausible physical physisorption or chemical e g complexation mechanisms interaction between dissolved metals and mps in water solutions thermodynamic parameters are usually extracted from experiments in which plastics are exposed to metal ions in a buffered water solution at constant physicochemical conditions salinity ph temperature in closed systems the experiment proceeds for an amount of time sufficient for the system to reach equilibrium with constant and stable concentration of ions in the water and plastic experiments can be repeated at varying initial metal ion concentration in the dissolved phase in order to evaluate non linearity of the sorption curve or at varying temperature to study shift of equilibrium and evaluate in turn the energies of reaction kinetic models are instead fitted contacting one batch of mps suspended in solution with a given concentration of the studied element s and analyzing the element s in solution at regular time intervals experimental details in section 4 2 they aim to analyze the limiting step in adsorption process guan et al 2020 mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 on an ultramolecular level plastics are relatively inhomogeneous materials with crystalline regions where polymer chains are regularly lined up and amorphous regions where polymer chains are not lined up amorphous regions of the polymer are in fact disordered and more permeable than crystalline ones bradney et al 2019 velez et al 2018 given that sorption experiments are typically conducted with plastic specimens in the at least micrometer or mm range the matrix can typically include both amorphous and crystalline portions introducing an inherent confounding factor the langmuir or freundlich models are the most common frameworks used to fit adsorption isotherms the langmuir model has been applied to fit adsorption of metals in the crystalline regions the freundlich model was instead applied to model interaction in the amorphous region as it overcomes the assumption that all binding sites are homogeneously distributed on the surface and are energetically equivalent while these models provided good fitting results in describing equilibria in simplified experimental conditions fu et al 2020 godoy et al 2019 holmes et al 2012 they appeared to be too simplistic for a potential environmental application in fact when compared with more complex equilibrium models such as the temkin xuan guo et al 2020 sips xue et al 2021 and the liquid solid extended bet isotherm model lin et al 2021 langmuir and freundlich models showed a lower performance these experiences however converged in showing that equilibrium isotherm curves are not linear suggesting that at least in the simplified experimental scenarios surface interaction and adsorption are the driving mechanisms while diffusion in the polymer matrix is a negligible process mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 similarly to equilibrium models more simplistic kinetics models such as pseudo first order and pseudo second order fern√°ndez et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 often do not well describe the experimentally observed adsorption kinetics indicating that the adsorption is a complex and multistep process different models are recently considered such as the shrinking core model tested for cu ni and zn on nylon tang et al 2021 or the external and internal mass transfer found as good descriptors for sr on ps pa and pp xuan guo et al 2020 for cu on virgin pe y wang et al 2020 and for pb on pvc ps and pe lin et al 2021 the analysis of isotherm adsorption at different temperatures enables estimating enthalpies of adsorption table 1 which give critical insights in the mechanism reconstruction generally results of enthalpies confirmed that physical adsorption is the main mechanism responsible of interaction at least with plastics with no biofilm coating most of the estimated Œ¥h values were in fact smaller than 40 kj mol lin et al 2021 tang et al 2021 there is however an important exception the study of as adsorption on ps showed a slightly negative estimated Œ¥h value indicating an exothermic process for binding in this case in fact a chemical binding through hydrogen bonds was hypothesized dong et al 2020 an inherent limitation of these models is their uncertain relevance to describe plastic metal interaction in environmental settings models are in fact determined through fitting data from minimalistic experiments with anomalously high concentration of trace elements and unrealistic boundary conditions e g lack of ligands or other competing ions in the solution phase absence of biofouling these critical issues will be more specifically described in section 4 2 the combination of kinetics and equilibrium modeling however helped to gain mechanistic insights on the processes responsible for adsorption of ions which under the studied experimental settings appear to be embodied by one or more types of weak electrostatic interactions dong et al 2020 fu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 few studies focused on assessing which functional group on the plastic surface is mainly responsible of the electrostatic interaction with metal ions using computational chemistry simulations dong et al 2020 xuan guo et al 2020 y wang et al 2020 it has been observed that the density of oxygen containing chemical groups e g hydroxyl carboxyl on the surface of plastic affect sorption equilibria other secondary physical processes proposed to investigate the adsorption phenomena are œÄ œÄ interactions xuetao guo et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and physical diffusion town et al 2018 y wang et al 2020 in contrast to physical interaction chemical bonds are rarely observed and these principally include the complexation of metals on plastic surface and hydrogen bonding guan et al 2020 y wang et al 2020 however it is worth considering that chemical bonding in an environmental context results a more stable process especially considering a natural competition with other ions ho and mckay 1998 considering the environmental applicability of the abovementioned models a gap in the research conducted so far on metal sorption on plastic is the lack of experimental focus on the determination of desorption rates in natural settings especially in water compartments equilibrium is a rare event due to temporal variability in ion concentration water chemistry temperature hydrology etc mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 considering their weak nature metal ions plastic interactions take place to a dynamic exchange where ions are continuously exchanging across the interface between the solid phase and water f gao et al 2019 the studies that addressed the reversibility of metal ion sorption on plastic focused on extractability of adsorbed elements in simulated animal and human gastro intestinal fluids e g holmes et al 2020 liao and yang 2020 turner 2018 while desorption in milder environmental conditions was only very recently considered in two studies fern√°ndez et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the recent work by zhou et al 2020 in particular to the best of our knowledge is the only which explored mathematically the adsorption desorption equilibria these studies confirmed the weak bond forming between plastic and metals with desorption occurring at a high rates and mild conditions these findings can have important ecological implications considering the possible interaction of mps which are known to move through the water column and interact with the biota finally it is important to note that none of the sorption experiments listed in table 1 has been conducted with biologically coated plastic which might be prevalent in the environment in this case the type of interaction is expectedly very different as microorganisms can uptake and use metals as nutrients through active transmembrane transport s liu et al 2021 also extracellular structure on bacterial surface may hold domains capable of forming more stable complexes with metal ions 3 2 a conceptual framework for future investigations considering the highlighted limitations and little environmental realism of the interaction models developed so far it is useful to introduce a more holistic conceptual frame to guide future experimental studies in the following paragraph such a framework is described in a tiered approach with three levels of increasing complexity pristine polymers chemically weathered polymers and biofouled polymers the random coil model provides a useful frame to describe polymeric materials on a supermolecular level based on this model polymer chains have a random and strongly entangled arrangement through non permanent physical crosslinks see fig 2 a common polymers of environmental relevance are either completely amorphous or semicrystalline in semicrystalline regions chains are aligned in glassy amorphous regions instead polymer segments can move locally and such a process can assist diffusion of small molecules in connection with diffusion amorphous polymers are characterized by a large free volume exceeding 10 of the bulk volume chemical species of available metals on the other hand can be modeled depending on ph pe conditions different speciation models are currently available in literature for their modeling e g guan et al 2020 in case of pristine plastic items the characteristics of the plastic surface is expected to reflect the hydrophobic nature of the polymer aliphatic chains e g in case of pe and pp at neutral acidic ph and in absence of complexing or charged domains on the plastic surface the deposition of dissolved metal ions is disfavored by solvation energy in case of some polymers e g ps the weak œÄ œÄ interaction between metal ion and aromatic ring expected Œ¥h between 5 and 20 kj mol as well as complexation with phenyl groups expected Œ¥h between 20 and 50 kj mol are in principle possible although unlikely to happen in an environmental context zhou et al 1998 chemical additives present in pristine plastics can in principle affect kinetics and thermodynamics of interaction and their role should be analyzed in future studies the surface of oxidized plastic instead can present i alkyl groups capable of forming coordination complex with metals and ii oxidized groups that can act as permanent dipoles and form noncovalent interactions with metal ions in environmental conditions fig 2b in these conditions the higher adsorption rate observed experimentally will vary in correlation with the quantity of surface oxygen containing groups expected equilibrium constant of these interactions will be Œ¥h ranging 10 20 kj mol for pe or pp and between 5 and 20 kj mol for ps and 20 50 kj mol for nylon mass transfer models will be better descriptors of interaction kinetics because of presence of different binding groups on the plastic surface that can become saturated in different stages and rates the accumulation of metals on plastic surfaces coated with biofilms is finally expected to be underpinned by very different processes and energies fig 2c the development of biofilm on plastic has been observed to vary from 5 5 after 15 days to 54 after 90 days of incubation ahamed et al 2020 owing to their long residence time in the environment most plastics found in water environments are likely to be coated by a biological film and their surface properties and reactivity must be strongly mediated by the characteristic and biological activity of the biofilm itself while the effect of biofilms was only recently considered for plastic particles ahamed et al 2020 guan et al 2020 y wang et al 2020 several studies have shown that biofilms efficiently accumulate metals with enrichment factors ranging 500 1 6000 1 the underlying mechanisms of such an active uptake process are well studied ancion et al 2010 these involve both cell wall sorption and active transmembrane transport followed by intracellular accumulation geng et al 2019 s liu et al 2021 anionic polysaccharides typical of the bacterial capsule have a strong affinity for metal counterions even at low concentration fig 2c possibly originated from evolutionary adaptations specifically for optimizing acquisition of these essential micronutrients microbial cell walls contain numerous anionic functional groups cooh and p o3 2 and the extracellular polymeric substances a major component of biofilms are composed of several natural polymers e g lipids polysaccharides proteins with negatively charged functional groups like hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 2 that can enhance complexation of metal species ahamed et al 2020 microbiota composing the biofilm can also entrap metal ions from water solution through a variety of biochemical processes including enzyme catalyzed complexation into biological molecules redox reactions and micro precipitation chakravarty and banerjee 2012 fathollahi et al 2021 accepting the complex frame of fig 2c leads to postulating multi compartment type uptake kinetics for metals where the following process take place sequentially interaction with polypeptides passive process possible facilitation of cation permeation by bacteria membrane proteins active process and storage in the cytoplasm at the net of elimination processes zhang et al 2021 the significance of this mechanisms for metal ions uptake by biofilms was never studied in the context of accumulation of metal on plastics and represent an important area of developments in the incoming years 4 experimental and analytical challenges in the study of plastic element interaction the interaction of trace elements with mps has been experimentally investigated employing two different approaches that can be described as top down and bottom up the top down approach encompasses studies that determined the element concentrations and multiphase distribution in mps sampled from the environment through chemical extractions or direct surface analysis whereas the bottom up approach is embodied by studies aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of plastic metal ion interaction in controlled laboratory or semi controlled in situ conditions evaluating the thermodynamics and kinetics processes driving the adsorption of metals 4 1 top down approaches on plastic water phase distribution assessment of metals the top down approaches enable to investigate the likelihood of metal adsorption through the collection and analysis of environmental plastics the main steps include the collection of samples and the potential pre treatments which can be followed by extraction dissolution and analysis of solutions or direct instrumental analysis to investigate the load of adsorbed elements each of these steps introduces technical challenges that can confound the measurement of metal distribution these are described in the following sections with a special focus for studies with mps 4 1 1 collection and sample processing of environmental mps sampling collection and pre treatment processes play a major role for quality and reliability of measurements accordingly several reviews have been devoted to this topic covering marine waters prata et al 2019 freshwaters campanale et al 2020 sediments adomat and grischek 2021 bellasi et al 2021 fish and aquatic invertebrates lusher et al 2017 sampling from water environments is usually in about 70 of the studies performed by deploying nets of different mesh sizes and collecting mps from large volumes of water alternatively discrete or continuous sampling of water with in line filtration is applied cutroneo et al 2020 the large number of procedures and equipment applied to mp sampling and separation is a known concern for data comparability density separation is typically performed to isolate plastics from other solids in the samples this is for example a fundamental step for extracting mps from sediments density separation methods utilize concentrated nacl nai or zncl2 solution he et al 2020 which can alter the natural element distribution stock et al 2019 wang and wang 2018 this main issue affecting all mp related fields inevitably also affects the recent analysis of their interaction with inorganic components in elemental analysis sample dissolution generally consists of dissolving adsorbed species by treating mps with acids and presenting them to an analyzer typically inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes or atomic absorption spectroscopy aas strong concentrated acid mixtures e g aqua regia are commonly used for this purpose brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 li et al 2020 mar≈°iƒá luƒçiƒá et al 2018 vedolin et al 2018 often under high temperature and pressure conditions e g microwave assisted acid digestion hildebrandt et al 2020 wang et al 2017 zon et al 2018 such an aggressive process may lead to the partial or complete dissolution of the polymeric matrix thus leading to the extraction of the surface adsorbed trace elements together with bulk species which are most likely present as additives in the virgin polymer for example metal salts are used in polymer industries as heat stabilizers metallic stearates have been used as slip agents while cd and pb compounds are used as antioxidants hahladakis et al 2018 weakly bonded metals are of higher environmental interest for their environmental implications turner et al 2020 thus mp dissolution and the release of bulk species should be differentiated to accurately investigate adsorbed elements that are exchanged with the environment extraction leaching protocols under milder conditions e g diluted and less aggressive reagents table 2 are accordingly emerging as a promising alternative to selectively dissolve adsorbed elements while preserving the integrity of mps and the metal content present in origin in the polymer matrix f gao et al 2019 hodson et al 2017 smith and turner 2020 f wang et al 2019 these studies show that the degree of desorption may strongly vary depending on the nature of the elements and polymer bioavailability of contaminants adsorbed on mps was evaluated in more detail by performing standardized physiologically based extraction tests pbets using tailored simulants for human liao and yang 2020 smith and turner 2020 and avian gastric conditions holmes et al 2020 smith and turner 2020 turner 2018 focusing on the former the migration of metals and metalloids under the conditions reported in the european toy safety directive hcl 0 07 m for 2 h at 37 c spanu et al 2021b was recently proposed as a standard reference limit for mammal ingestion smith and turner 2020 thus differently from acid digestion protocols selective leaching may provide effective qualitative indications on the strength and type of mp element interactions while significant developments are on going in this area there is a clear need for fully validated and generally accepted approaches to metal extraction from environmental plastics for the future elemental fractionation protocols i e sequential extraction of differently bonded metals hass and fine 2010 are expected to play a major role in trace elements mp analysis they can concurrently provide a deep characterization of sampled mps a comprehension of bonding mechanisms e g physisorbed strongly bound etc and a risk assessment for bioavailability studies a good starting point for defining mp specific procedures may be found in fractionation protocols proposed for soil and sediment matrices hass and fine 2010 hlavay et al 2004 such procedures are at present employed only for detecting changes in elemental fractions in soils after interactions with mps li et al 2021 yu et al 2021 2020 but were not applied directly to mp particles drawing from those experiences a five step sequential extraction protocol is proposed here for application to mps fig 3 including the following phases 1 exchangeable species usually including physisorbed elements 2 associated to carbonates 3 associated to oxy hydroxides of manganese and iron 4 associated to organic matter 5 residual the presence of some of the above mentioned phases is sparsely reported on plastic particles mn and fe oxy hydroxides and carbonates were described in incubation and laboratory conditions only see e g kniggendorf et al 2020 leiser et al 2020 whereas organic phases mainly biofilm are the subject of a large number of studies nielsen and jahn 1999 oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 rummel et al 2017 however the main challenge in the application of such a fractionation protocol is the low concentration of adsorbed elements in the different phases making their analysis difficult to overcome this issue the utilization of a simplified clean sequential extraction procedure requiring limited amount of extracted sample is recommended binda et al 2018 ciceri et al 2008 followed by detection through a high sensitive analyzer such as icp ms in this way the most abundant trace elements few to tens of ppm e g fe mn and zn may be detected in individual fractions whereas other metals below 0 1 ppm e g cd and pb could be analyzed as a bulk after aggregating the individual fractions at levels expectedly close to the detection limits of icp ms holmes et al 2012 mar≈°iƒá luƒçiƒá et al 2018 quantitative data of metal extracted from mps should be then compared at least with the concentration of trace elements present in the sampled aquatic matrix in order to calculate distribution coefficients furthermore the analysis of metals in other solid constituents of water or sediments could elucidate the role of plastic in metal speciation throughout different environmental compartments e g yu et al 2020 unfortunately despite its importance analysis of water phase is far from being a widely adopted practice when studying metal concentration on plastics collected from the environment but carbery et al 2020 li et al 2020 4 1 2 instrumental analysis options and limitations besides traditional analysis by icp ms on metals extracted from samples mp element interactions can also be investigated by direct analysis of metal on the plastic surface traditional methods used for analyzing elements on surfaces are employed for this purpose these are x ray photoelectron spectroscopy dong et al 2020 tang et al 2021 scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx prunier et al 2019 and laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry la icp ms el hadri et al 2020 the main advantage of these techniques is that no specific pretreatment is required largely reducing the risk of altering the natural mps surface during sample preparation and extraction quantitative semiquantitative information may be gathered by these non invasive techniques which unlike extraction dissolution methods analyze specifically element content on the surface of plastics with a probe depth ranging from 5 nm using xps to 1 2 ¬µm using sem edx this approach fits the purpose of examining specifically the interactions at the mp environment interface solving the problem of the possible undesired extraction of metals possibly present in the polymer matrix at source together with the metals acquired from the environment furthermore xps can be useful for preliminary qualitative mp characterization providing fundamental information on the chemical composition and state of the mp surface e g the presence of o and n containing surface functional groups which can play a key role in the adsorption process as a drawback the low sensitivity of xps and sem edx makes them suitable for the determination of minor and major elements but not of trace elements detection limits down to 0 1 and 0 01 atomic percent are reported for sem edx and xps respectively nasrazadani and hassani 2016 shard 2014 reliable trace element quantification can instead be achieved by la icp ms thanks to the much higher sensitivity monticelli et al 2018 even in polymeric materials spanu et al 2021a la icp ms can discriminate between bulk and surface species by determining concentration depth profiles surface to bulk as demonstrated by el hadri et al 2020 xps may be an effective tool to perform speciation analysis for a more detailed assessment of plastic elements interaction it should be applied not only for the identification of mp surface functional groups as normally done but also for the speciation of adsorbed species which would provide new insights for formulating and assessing mechanistic hypothesis regarding the adsorption process at present such approach was applied only for as species adsorbed onto ps dong et al 2020 hence there is a highway for future exploitation of this techniques in this research area furthermore xps can be employed to perform depth profiling analysis with a nanometric depth resolution this approach may disclose new opportunities to gather insights on the diffusion of inorganic contaminants through the very first atomic layers of plastics finally xps analysis can be used specifically to assess metal contents in the biofilm covering the mps this appears to be an excellent opportunity to gather experimental evidences of the possible pivotal role of biofilms in determining uptake of metal by plastics in the environment secondary ion mass spectrometry sims is another surface analytical technique that shows very high sensitivity suitable for trace element quantification mapping and depth profiling to date sims has been used limitedly for the evaluation of the degradation of plastic debris by looking at changes in the mass spectral pattern of the polymer as well as to identify and visualize imaging microplastic particles in complex matrices biesinger et al 2011 du et al 2020 jungnickel et al 2016 only very recently a sims based technique time of flight sims tof sims has been applied for the first time to study the interactions between plastics and metals to study the diffusion of cu2 and ni2 ions into pp fig 4 kern et al 2021 4 2 bottom up approaches here we describe and critically review approaches adopted for characterizing trace element mp interactions under controlled laboratory or field conditions these studies generally aim at determining the thermodynamics or the kinetics of trace element adsorption onto mp surfaces see section 3 1 thermodynamic investigations godoy et al 2019 guan et al 2020 zou et al 2020 kinetic studies aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2020 brennecke et al 2016 fern√°ndez et al 2020 lin et al 2021 tang et al 2021 or both davranche et al 2019 dong et al 2020 xuan guo et al 2020 holmes et al 2014 2012 lang et al 2020 oz et al 2019 tang et al 2020 turner and holmes 2015 f wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 zon et al 2018 were performed on mps sampled from the environment holmes et al 2012 tang et al 2021 pristine polymers godoy et al 2019 zou et al 2020 and artificially aged polymers aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2020 lang et al 2020 4 2 1 critical issues in currently applied methods as already stated in section 3 1 the controllable conditions of simulation methods make isotherms and kinetics experiments the ideal candidates for modelling studies on mp element interactions however the absence of harmonized standardized procedures for boundary conditions i e the actual environmental conditions during adsorption experiments and the aging process of mps often hinders comparability among existing data see table s1 in supplementary material several critical aspects should be addressed for ensuring experiments yield reliable and environmentally relevant data first times play a role when adsorption isotherms are measured enough time should be allowed for the system to reach equilibrium hence studies that focus on equilibrium should be complemented with kinetic experiments aimed at evaluating a valid experimental timeframe available studies have used timeframe ranging from 4 h davranche et al 2019 to two weeks godoy et al 2019 with typical values of 24 48 h it should be also considered that the equilibration time can vary for the different active sites of plastic particle different mechanisms are at work for plastic element interactions y wang et al 2020 and may require different times to reach equilibrium the latter point is also clearly environmentally relevant as the residence time of mps and trace elements varies widely in the environment limiting or extending the kinetically accessible processes as an example only fast processes may be active in a highly dynamic environment like an estuary whereas months may be allowed for interactions to occur in soils another critical issue is the scarce representativeness of natural conditions given by the solution phase used during equilibrium and kinetic experiments generally the adsorption of single or few trace elements onto artificially aged mps is performed under extremely simplified conditions e g distilled water or salty solutions at controlled ph this minimalistic set up is not representative of natural water matrices while synthesis and simplification is pivotal when designing experiments studies with more realistic conditions e g use of environmentally relevant ph conditions and ion concentrations co presence of ligands and dissolved organic matter in the solution should be considered too in order to enable a sound extrapolation of findings from minimalistic experiments to real environmental conditions to this regard it is noted that all laboratory studies used very high concentrations of trace element usually in the milligram per liter range with few study using concentrations down to tens of microgram per liter davranche et al 2019 guan et al 2020 holmes et al 2014 2012 these concentrations even the lowest ones occur in the environment only in extreme conditions like mine waters or anoxic water in peculiar geological settings e g binda et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 and are never met in seawater or freshwater bodies similar problems are observable for ph acidic ph values are often used in combination with high element concentrations to hinder element precipitation as oxo hydroxides oz et al 2019 tang et al 2020 providing unrealistic conditions to describe typical environmental settings only a limited number of studies considered the competition by dissolved organic matter tang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 or suspended particles guan et al 2020 this lack of focus on the role of organic ligands in strident conflict to the well known behavior of trace elements that are typically almost completely complexed to these compounds in both freshwater monticelli and caprara 2015 and seawater y gao et al 2019 the exploration of mp metal ion interactions at such high metal concentrations in acidic conditions may lead to an unrealistic picture of the interaction mechanisms and dynamics occurring in environmental settings in particular molecular sites with different binding affinity and concentration are likely to be present on mp surfaces xuan guo et al 2020 meaning that unrealistically high exposure levels may blur or completely hide the potentially important role of binding sites with high affinity but low density in the plastic surface the heterogeneity of binding sites is well described for complexing species in natural waters in filella and town 2003 considering the trace or even ultra trace element levels in natural waters these undetected sites may well be the only sites involved in trace element mp interaction under environmental conditions during laboratory experiments other factors may influence dissolved concentrations of metals and hence possibly affect the experiment outcomes for example adsorption onto container walls and precipitation can easily happen resulting in a removal of the elements from the solution phase that is uncorrelated to the sorption onto plastics these phenomena may be easily assessed by including adequate experimental blanks while this may seem obvious blanks have been mentioned only in one of available studies yet without reporting blank results in the paper moreover conditioning of the container used for the experiments should be performed to avoid wall effects see e g sanvito and monticelli 2021 such a procedure is usually adopted in available studies but the glassware is conditioned only with the solution before adding the elements solutions containing at varying concentrations should be instead added in the containers and left for enough time to reach equilibrium and then containers should be rinsed with distilled water this procedure should be performed at least twice before proceeding with the adsorption experiments finally the mp molecular micro macroscopic characteristics and aging level should be carefully evaluated and described to enable comparison of results across different studies for example concerning ageing different types of environmental stresses are described to simulate weathering of mps however work focuses so far mainly on the effect of a single or a limited number of factors which mainly include surface oxidation chemically or uv induced in this way only the effect of single features of aged mps e g specific surface area surface functional groups biofilm formation on the interaction with metals may be currently gained as already stated in section 2 the effective reproduction of natural ageing process is needed for a realistic simulation of mp element interaction which should in particular account also for biological processes 4 2 2 recommendations for future experimental works following the options and limitations described in this chapter it is recommended that adsorption isotherms and kinetic experiments should 1 use environmentally relevant conditions in terms of trace element concentrations no more than 10 times the environmental ones ph values and major element composition 2 evaluate time for equilibrium prior to experiment 3 include the necessary blanks to assess possible experimental interferences and or artifact e g evaluate the set up without addition of mps to assess glassware effects or any reactivity in the solution phase or without the addition of metal ions to evaluate any possible leaching of metal already present in the plastic specimens 4 use high sensitivity high resolution analytical techniques typically icp ms to enable the detection of trace and ultra trace levels of elements 5 evaluate adsorption kinetics in accordance with the residence times of mps and trace elements in the environmental compartments 6 use of combined and harmonized aging methods attempting to faithfully reproduce environmentally aged mps after following these basic recommendations future experiments could be designed in a variety of different ways to move forward knowledge of mp element interactions for example a detailed mass budget approach is strongly envisaged whereby trace element masses are analyzed in both the solution the mps and the glassware surface at the end of the experiments and compared with the total mass added in the system at the beginning of the experiment this would enable controlling for possible confounding effects driven for example by leaching of metals native in the plastic specimens moreover and importantly element speciation should be included in the experiments pesavento et al 2009 species differing in redox state cr iii and cr vi complexation elements bound to or adsorbed onto natural organic matter organic and inorganic ligands inorganic and organic mercury species like methylmercury are expected to interact differently with mps surfaces up to now the behavior of cr vi only has been selectively investigated turner and holmes 2015 as a final remark the combination of these bottom up approaches with the abovementioned top down approaches based on field observations section 4 1 represent a suitable way to complete the understanding on the mechanisms mp elements interactions experimental procedures such as sequential extraction procedures are likely to provide information on the kind of interactions that are at work in the environment in this way a more detailed knowledge on the occurring adsorption in real environmental conditions can help in modulating at best the water and plastic related parameters for experiments in controlled batches 5 conclusions and perspectives this review highlights the recent and increasing research interest on the interaction of plastic with metals as an emerging research avenue in the plastic pollution area considering the still early stage of development several limitations and gaps need to be addressed before a satisfactory comprehension of the mechanisms underlying plastic metal ion interaction can be achieved while early experimental works have shown that trace elements interact with plastics essentially through weak surface interactions the molecular domains on plastic surfaces responsible for the interaction are still poorly understood similarly the role of water side composition e g the presence of ligands ions and other compounds competing for binding sites co occurring and interacting with metals in the solution phase and properties e g ph redox potential is unclear while studies have so far privileged a reductionistic approach focusing on simplified experimental setups the adoption of a more holistic yet detailed conceptual frame such as the one described in fig 2 describing the system through its progressive levels of complexity fundamentally determined by the level and typology of plastic ageing can help directing future and more detailed research in particular the role of biofilms should be carefully considered in future studies background knowledge suggests in fact that microbiota forming biofilms possess dedicated structures and physiological processes enabling them to actively uptake metal ions as micronutrients hence biofilms may have a pivotal contribution to the core capacity of plastics for accumulating metals that has so far been overlooked furthermore there is a demand to design sorption desorption experiment with a more realistic and well defined selection of conditions e g using realistic trace concentrations of metals water physicochemical conditions varying in the environmental range plastic specimens fully characterized for their chemical and or biological ageing this will ensure more representative and intercomparable results along with laboratory based research the analysis of environmental samples and the study of fractionation of elements adsorbed onto mp particles will contribute to shed light on the adsorption mechanisms relevant for the environmental context finally future studies should focus with more detail on the water side assessing the effective adsorption desorption also of major elements dissolved in water e g n p ca k these can in fact potentially interact with environmental plastics similarly to trace elements especially if the adsorption mechanisms are non selective translating knowledge gained on plastic metal ion interaction to the interaction with other ions serving as macronutrients can be key for understanding the broader indirect impacts of plastic pollutions on water ecosystems e g alteration of cycling of elements seeley et al 2020 declaration of competing

16621,plastic and microplastic pollution is an environmental and societal concern the interaction of plastic with organic chemicals in the environment has attracted scientific interest new evidences have highlighted an unexpectedly high affinity of environmental plastics also for metal ions the degree and typology of plastic ageing including from mechanical uv and biological degradations appear as a pivotal factor determining such an interaction these earlier evidences recently opened a new research avenue in the plastic pollution area this review is the first to organize and critically discuss knowledge developed so far results from field and laboratory studies of metal accumulation on plastic are presented and the environmental factors most likely to control such an interaction are discussed on the light of this knowledge a generalist conceptual model useful for building hypotheses on the mechanisms at stake and directing future studies was elaborated and presented here furthermore all available data on the thermodynamics of the plastic metal interaction obtained from laboratory experiments are inventoried and discussed here highlighting methodological and technical challenges that can potentially affect cross comparability of data and their relevance for environmental settings finally insights and recommendations on experimental approaches and analytical techniques that can help overtaking current limitations and knowledge gaps are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mp metal water pollution adsorption environmental modeling 1 introduction plastic litter and microplastic mp pollution is an environmental issue of concern a conspicuous fraction of produced plastic waste is mismanaged and results in pollution with freshwater and estuarine environments being mostly impacted bellasi et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 nizzetto et al 2016 schell et al 2021 while reports of plastic contamination in water sediment and soil are increasingly abundant in literature binda et al 2021 crossman et al 2020 its consequences for the ecosystem and human health are still mostly unknown plastic polymers sorb organic compounds including pesticides and antibiotics through hydrophobic interactions as broadly documented in scientific literature koelmans et al 2016 in contrast plastic polymers are generally considered inert toward aqueous metal ions this paradigm however has been questioned by the results of recent laboratory studies demonstrating a substantial interaction between metal ions and mps metal ions are crucial micronutrients but if overconcentrated they are among the most aggressive environmental toxicants johnson et al 2017 the nature and mechanisms of this interaction are still unclear but sorption capacities observed for metals in laboratory settings more than 40 of some dissolved metals are adsorbed in current experiments holmes et al 2012 lang et al 2020 and reports of coexisting metals adsorbed on plastic particles in environmental settings kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 warn about the likely ecological implications of mp metal interaction fig 1 a such as enhanced metal bioavailability for the biota through vector effects bradney et al 2019 naqash et al 2020 and alteration of the cycling of elements seeley et al 2020 the number of studies focused on this environmental issues grew exponentially in the last 2 years kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 s liu et al 2021 and a few review papers were recently published on the interaction between plastic particles and chemical contaminants liu et al 2020 torres et al 2021 vieira et al 2021 but mainly dealing with the ecotoxicological implications bradney et al 2019 cao et al 2021 naqash et al 2020 verla et al 2019 the diversity of experimental approaches and materials used to analyze mp metals interaction and lacking of conceptual models for hypothesis creation have hindered progresses in the ability of understanding and predicting the mp trace element interaction process in this critical review we face this challenge with the goal of providing information on the state of the art of research on the topic highlighting knowledge gaps and delivering insights useful to guide future theoretical and experimental assessments of the interaction between metal ions and plastic this review work is structured in three parts in the first part described in section 2 of the paper we will present and discuss the current knowledge on the role of plastic side and water side determinants controlling adsorption desorption equilibria dynamics and thermodynamics of the plastic metal ion interaction such a review includes an account of currently available evidences on the role of plastic ageingand of water physicochemical properties in section 3 of the paper different conceptual models of the metal ion plastic interaction will be proposed considering variability of characteristics of weathered plastics stemming from both the influence of thermo oxidative degradation processes and formation of biological films finally section 4 of the paper will be dedicated to the review and critical discussion of current experimental approaches to study this interaction in both laboratory simulated conditions bottom up and in environmental samples top down 2 processes and conditions at the interface between plastics and metals analyzing plastic metal ion interaction from a mechanistic point of view requires handling a complex array of synergistic and competitive processes occurring both in the solution and at the interface between the polymer and the water phase both these are expectedly modulated by water chemistry on the one side mainly salinity ph temperature redox conditions and other dissolved ions and the characteristics of the plastic matrix on the other side with a major role played by the degradation rate and biofouling of polymers which influence surface charge wettability and reactive surface area fig 1b in the following sections the environmental processes which can influence the modality of plastic and metals interaction will be reviewed focusing on the challenges concerned with their experimental assessment and on the possible approaches to overtake them 2 1 the plastic side polymer degradation and its possible effects on the interaction with metal ions the level of plastic ageing is reportedly an important factor for metal sorption two main processes are responsible for altering plastic properties at the interface with the environment physicochemical deterioration and biological colonization pristine plastics are composed by an amorphous or semicrystalline matrix of entangled polymer chains the most used include polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyamides pa with the intramolecular space typically filled with chemical additives used to improve physicochemical and mechanical properties additives includes for example plasticizers antioxidants light quenching compounds flame retardants and dyes the topic of polymer ageing on metal sorption is widely studied bellasi et al 2020 p liu et al 2021 lv et al 2015 w wang et al 2019 the sketch in fig 1b represents the two main processes affecting ageing of plastic particles dispersed in the environment plastic surface can be altered by physicochemical modification in water bodies affecting the surface charge and oxidation moreover pristine or aged plastic can be colonized by different microorganisms which completely alter the surface of polymers possibly enhancing an interaction with trace elements through increasing wettability and exposing charged groups carried by extracellular polymeric substances typical of biofilm forming microorganisms the potential influence of plastic ageing in enhancing the interaction with metal ions in water has been recognized and investigated in recent studies table s1 in supplementary material adsorption desorption tests with metals have been conducted on plastics with different level of ageing lang et al 2020 thomas et al 2020 q wang et al 2020 chemical oxidation processes especially uv based have received more attention while the role of biological colonization in affecting sorption of metal ions have been partly overlooked while decomposing a system complexity in its constituents is often a good approach to research it must be reinforced that in environmental settings chemical and biological ageing co occur and can affect each other hence minimalistic experimental approaches may not be sufficient to fully elucidate the system behavior hence multi tiered experiments at increasing level of system complexity can represent the way forward for example there is a clear demand for developing a better knowledge on the synergic role of biological colonization and chemical ageing of plastics as determinants of the capacity and dynamics of metal ion sorption on the plastic substrate lucas et al 2008 it was reported that the mechanical ageing of polymers can further enhance the biofilm colonization rate carson et al 2013 hence studies that focus on such an interaction can produce data with a higher environmental relevance in the following sections we will present the state of the art on the mechanisms and processes determining physicochemical and biological alteration of plastics and provide insights on their potential role in enhancing sorption of metal ions 2 1 1 physicochemical degradation physicochemical processes mainly responsible for the ageing of plastics are mechanical deterioration and chemical photo oxidative processes mechanical deterioration is mostly responsible for the formation of micro cracking which promotes the fragmentation of polymers in smaller particles ren et al 2020 this process that can be caused by several environmental phenomena including abrasion with the substrate e g driven by bioturbation waves or currents thermic stress uv radiation and deterioration by currents and waves min et al 2020 moreover these phenomena can drive the leaching of additives like plasticizers causing loss in mechanical resistance and elasticity of plastic materials further enhancing degradation processes paluselli et al 2019 mechanical deterioration results in micro and macro fractures of the polymer matrix that determine increased surface rugosity increased specific surface area which in turn results in higher adsorption rate of metals dong et al 2020 luo et al 2020 and can develop into fragmentation of plastic debris in increasingly smaller mps physical deterioration of plastic can also be promoted by oxidative reactions that at molecular level take place by breaking cross links between polymer chains or cause polymer chain interruption with time these alterations at molecular scale can propagate and impair plastic integrity at a macroscale altering its physical technical properties and making it prone to further physical deterioration and fragmentation in the environment such a degradation is typically due to photo thermo oxidative processes uv radiation is the most common driver of polymer oxidation bracco et al 2018 p liu et al 2021 this process initiates with photonic or homolytic cleavage of cc or ch bonds or more frequently of the o oh links of hydroperoxides present in the amorphous zone of polymers from the manufacturing process these events produce alkyl r or alkoxy ro macroradicals respectively in the case of r the reaction terminates with the formation of vinylene double bonds while ro lead to formation of ketones esters and carboxylic acids brandon et al 2016 in environmental condition the formation of hydroperoxide radicals in presence of molecular oxygen can play a key role in the propagation reaction bolland cycle bolland and ten have 1947 to form peroxide radicals roo branching the kinetic chain towards production of ketones alcohols esters and acids because of the role of molecular oxygen the formation of oxidized terminations is likely to proceed from the surface of plastic at the interface with oxic water environments extending in amorphous regions these chain reactions can affect the sorption properties of mps because the generated oxygen containing groups increase polarity hydrophilicity and the surface charge liu et al 2020 oxidized functional groups can ultimately act as binding sites for inorganic ions p liu et al 2021 song et al 2017 2 1 2 biofouling and biological colonization polymers widespread in aquatic environments represent a suitable substrate for the growth of organic and biological films leiser et al 2020 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 deposition of priming organic films on the surface of plastics in water is rapid i e few days harrison et al 2014 pinto et al 2019 this is a passive and spontaneous uptake process driven by the brownian diffusion of organic compounds dissolved in water e g colloids humic substances in the water side thin boundary layer and the sorption onto the plastic surface by weak molecular interactions from the molecular point of view these interactions can have a variable nature given the diversity of functional groups on aged plastic and the complex mixture of organic compounds in natural waters the chemical properties of natural priming films are determinant for the following process of macrofouling colonization by microorganisms lorite et al 2011 many bacteria strains display the ability of anchoring to diverse substrates and form biofilms as an evolutionary adaptation in order to do this they can regulate cell walls and the hydrophobicity of the membranes extracellular polysaccharides composition and develop dedicated structures such as pili curli fimbriae and flagella to exploit adhesive properties of primed surfaces rummel et al 2017 composition of bacterial communities on plastics can vary dramatically pinto et al 2019 the colonization of microorganisms on surface is an example of ecological succession where the assembling of the biofouling community progress with time and it is determined both by neutral e g random and niche e g driven by ecological interactions with the environment and other organisms in the community processes this process is generally slower than priming considering that i microorganisms that can adhere on the plastic substrates are most likely less abundant than dissolved organic matter dom in the water solution and ii there is the need of successful anchorage of a certain number of organisms for an effective biological colonization the initial phase of the biofilm formation is likely a random process whereby the first organisms that can successfully anchor and grow on the substrate will determine the progress of the succession and the resulting biological and chemical characteristics of the film biofilms affect the interaction of plastic particles with trace elements as they enhance plastic surface wettability dussud et al 2018 actively accumulate metal ions through transmembrane transport geng et al 2019 and present extracellular polymeric structure that can form chemical complexes with metals y wang et al 2020 see also section 3 2 differences in the biofilm composition can also be determined by niche processes and therefore reflect different environmental conditions and water chemistry leiser et al 2020 nava and leoni 2021 pinto et al 2019 this in turn can likely influence affinity for metal ions obtaining a representative and reproducible experimental model of a biofilm to carry out controlled experiments of plastic metal interactions is therefore a critical challenge previous works have shown that procaryotes can initiate formation of biofilms with a secondary colonization by eukaryotes including protozoa and microalgae misic and covazzi harriague 2019 these organisms have very different membranes and cell walls characteristics as well as contrastingly different physiology therefore they most likely show different types of interaction with metal ions differently it has been reported that polymer type scarcely affect biofilm species composition zhang et al 2021 2 2 the water side influence of temperature and water chemistry in this section the available knowledge on the influence of water physicochemical properties on the interaction between trace elements and plastics is presented with a specific focus on environmentally relevant conditions the scope of this part of the review is to identify knowledge gaps and limitations of current experimental approaches and to list the water side variables playing an important role in the interaction 2 2 1 ph the effect of water ph on the plastic element interaction has been the focus of some experimental assessment ph is in fact known to affect metal ion speciation and the surface properties of polymers the surface of most common polymers in the environment e g pe and pp among others have low ph values of point of zero change meaning that at the ph of common water environments the surface is electrically negative with an increasing negative charge at increasing ph also at environmentally relevant conditions lin et al 2021 moreover surface properties of polymers carrying ionizable functional groups and in particular of oxidized plastics will change in dependence of ph ionizable functional groups exposed to the solution will become deprotonated at increasing ph values increasing also the number of reactive domains available for the binding of metal ions tang et al 2020 while these polymer side influences of water ph on plastic reactivity has been experimentally confirmed for a range of polymers both pristine and aged including pe pp and nylon ahechti et al 2020 tang et al 2020 water ph is most likely to affect the plastic metal ion interaction through controlling metal speciation in the solution with important consequences on their affinity for binding sites on the plastic surface in fact ph influences the degree of ionization and distribution of the metal species in solution f wang et al 2019 experimental results showed that the effect of water ph in determining the sorption of metal onto polymers varies depending on the cationic or anionic nature of dissolved species the adsorption of bivalent metal cations e g cu cd and pb onto different polymers increases as ph raises as shown in several experimental studies ahechti et al 2020 guan et al 2020 tang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 such a trend may be explained as follows when ph is low h competes with the metals electrostatic repulsion for the adsorption sites negatively affecting the metal adsorption rate anionic species show the opposite behavior the adsorption decreases with increasing ph of the medium at low ph the oh concentration is low and it does not compete with anion for adsorption in positively charged domains of the polymer holmes et al 2012 and zhang et al 2020 showed in fact that whereas the adsorption of cd co ni and pb increases with increasing ph cr adsorption decreases since it exists in solution in the oxyanionic form hcro4 and cro4 2 likewise the study of dong et al 2020 seems to confirm these effects for as iii adsorption on ps mps observing that as ph of the solution increases the form of as iii changes from h3aso3 to aso2 it should be noted that these observations were made in controlled artificial systems that excluded the presence of other chemical species or ligand in solution which are instead important constituents of natural water environments these observations were conducted therefore through oversimplified approaches where only metals and ph adjusters and buffers typically hno3 naoh and nano3 were present it must be noted that especially in the case of alkaline environments sulfates and chlorides used to adjust ph can easily form insoluble salts with the dissolved element making it not available for adsorption by plastic hence potentially affecting the metal ion activity in the solution and the experimental assessment of distribution coefficients moreover while experimental works has broadly focused on sorption kinetics the effect of ph on the desorption mechanism has so far been scarcely considered see section 3 1 it can be expected that desorption of metals from plastics as from different other solid media could be favored in acidic ph which facilitate formation of free ions kalƒç√≠kov√° et al 2020 this is indeed an important process relevant for the bioavailability of metal following ingestion of contaminated plastics fragments by organisms the acidic gastrointestinal tract of most aquatic organisms may indeed promote speciation of plastic bound metals into more available and toxic forms directly inside the organisms embodying the trojan horse effect smith and turner 2020 2 2 2 salinity the salinity of the medium can alter the adsorption of metal ions onto oxidized or biofouled plastic surfaces increased ionic strength of the solution can enhance competition of metals with other dissolved ions for binding sites and can influence accessibility of these binding sites according to most studies the adsorption of positively charged ions is inversely related to salinity as salinity increases metal species and na ions compete for the adsorption onto plastics this has been observed for pb cd zn and cu fu et al 2020 holmes et al 2012 tang et al 2020 turner and holmes 2015 f wang et al 2019 the presence of cl may also promote formation of cl transition metals homoleptic complexes and hydrates possibly leading to a lower activity of free metal ions in the solution and lower adsorption this effect was observed so far for cd f wang et al 2019 while the influence of salinity on the metal ion plastic interaction has been recognized there is a need to elucidate these processes in the context of more environmental realistic settings whereby a number of inorganic ionic species are engaging in the competition for example major ions such as ca2 mg2 k no3 and so4 2 can compete with specific cationic or anionic species of trace elements or form salts with them inhibiting their binding with plastics fu et al 2020 it has been argued zhou et al 2020 that the competition between similar bivalent metals negatively affects the adsorption beyond the water side effects on metal ion speciation salinity can also influence plastic side properties by effecting the electric double layer expected to form over the surface of weathered and partially charged surfaces this process is postulated by the derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek theory the electrical double layer is a structure on the surface of an object exposed to a fluid constituted by two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object the first layer the surface charge either positive or negative consists of ions adsorbed onto the object due to chemical interactions in the case of aged plastics this can be the carboxylic ketones groups of oxidized polymer chains or of the exopolysaccharides of microorganisms in coating biofilms and the different ions non covalently bond to them the second layer also called diffuse layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the coulomb force electrically screening the first layer the diffuse layer is loosely associated with the object and it is made of freely dissolved ions moving under the combined influence of electric attraction and thermal brownian motion at varying solution salinity the thickness of the double layer can vary likely influencing the rate of diffusion and sorption of dissolved ions onto the binding domain on the particle surface furthermore the thickness of the double layer has also implications for the tendence and the rate of homo and hetero aggregation of small particles including for example nanoplastics present in solution at increased ionic strength of the solution the electrical double layer of these particles can be compressed reducing repulsive forces leading to aggregation with other similar particles or with naturally occurring colloids singh et al 2019 wu et al 2019 aggregation alters the physical properties of the particles for example making them to precipitate and the amount of surface available for interaction with dissolved species per unit of particle volume this in turn can result in reduced adsorption capacity for metal ions by the unit of mass of plastic suspended in a solution 2 2 3 temperature the influence of temperature has been so far considered for the investigation of thermodynamic equilibria of the metal ion plastic interaction all the experimental studies found such an interaction to underpin a negative variation of gibbs free energy g 0 and be therefore spontaneous in most cases this process was also found to be endothermic with a positive entropy change h 0 these findings are based on a series of observations conducted with cu and zn to polyethylene terephthalate pet q wang et al 2020 with cu on polyurethane pu xue et al 2021 and with pb on nylon polyvinyl chloride pvc ps and pe lin et al 2021 tang et al 2020 differently studies with as iii adsorption to ps mps highlighted an exothermic h 0 reaction dong et al 2020 these experiments were conceived to study the thermodynamics of the metal ion plastic interaction in ideal conditions and shed light on fundamental mechanisms underpinning the chemical physical interaction see also section 3 2 applicability of the measured activation energies and enthalpies in real environmental settings is uncertain main confounding factors link to the complex nature and great variability of the characteristics of chemically or biologically weathered plastics in the environment and on the role of competing interactions i e binding with other dissolved ligands likely dom or major ions taking place in the water side in natural conditions smith and martell 1987 moreover also the effects of the environmental range of temperature e g 5 25 c should be tested not only for adsorption but also desorption processes similarly to ph section 2 2 1 being this a process overlooked in experiments conducted so far 2 2 4 dissolved organic matter dom to evaluate the interaction of plastic with metal ions in a realistic environmental context experiments with variable levels of dissolved organic matter have been performed dissolved organic matter can bind dissolved metals caprara et al 2016 martell et al 1988 pl√∂ger et al 2005 and can therefore synergistically or antagonistically modulate metal adsorption onto plastics organic matter in water can form complexes with metals and therefore lowering the metal dissolved ions activity liu et al 2020 however dom can also be adsorbed on plastic both through hydrophobic interactions or through weak interaction with charged or partially charged functional groups the formation of priming organic films onto plastic in water environments is an example of such a process possibly enhancing the accumulation of metals on the plastic surface through the deposition of metal organic matter complexes or by increasing the density of negative charges on the primed plastic and consequently affinity for metal ions li et al 2019 moreover once metal ion dom complexes are formed in the solution phase their reactivity changes compared to dissolved metal ions possibly enhancing hydrophobicity and consequently the likelihood of adsorption on neutral plastic surface such as among others the surface of pristine pp and pe tang et al 2021 because of such a complexity earlier studies yielded sometimes contradictory results for example tang et al 2020 proved that fulvic acid in the solution negatively affected the adsorption of pb onto aged nylon mps possibly due to complexation between fulvic acid and pb through interactions with carbonyl hydroxyl and carboxyl groups a similar behavior was observed with humic acid competing with different microplastic polymers for cd adsorption zhou et al 2020 in contrast with these results fu et al 2020 and godoy et al 2019 observed an increase adsorption pb cr and cu on different polymers in tap water and wastewater compared to distilled water proposing the interaction was enhanced by dom present in these matrices these controversial results are possibly linked to the challenge of conducting factorial experiments in ternary systems i e in presence of plastic metal ions and dom with the factors not being fully independent and prone to interfering with each other in a number of possible ways to disentangle such a complexity focus should be placed in analysis of the behavior of the interaction terms resulting from the factorial experiment result on varying experimental conditions while this may help to shed lights on the mechanisms of the three way interaction such an analysis was not fully addressed in earlier studies moreover existing studies on the role of dom on trace element plastic interaction used different time lags for equilibration without focusing on possible different kinetics in adsorption caused by complexing agents in the systems suggestions for future studies include the speciation analysis of elements in solution considering equilibration and different kinetics of adsorption desorption of complexes related to free metal ions see also section 4 2 2 2 2 5 organic pollutants in some very recent studies the effect of dissolved metal ions and some organic pollutants e g surfactants zhang et al 2020 phenanthrene zhou et al 2020 antibiotics y wang et al 2020 co occurring in water environments were investigated the main rationale for these studies was to reveal potential competition among these species for binding sites on the plastic in realistic environmental settings the outcomes of such competition will be primarily determined by the concentrations of the different species which can vary across orders of magnitude rather than their affinity for a given binding domain studies conducted so far considered instead exposure scenarios with extremely high concentrations of organic and inorganic contaminants in the order of mg l often in absence of other dissolved ligands or major ions and in solutions with controlled ionic strength and buffered ph hence current understanding of the interaction of metal ions and organic contaminants for the sorption on plastic is insufficient to draw expectation of their relevance for the environment it is suggested that assessing plastic water phase distribution of major organic and inorganic contaminants in environmental settings e g from monitoring studies could provide useful insights to elucidate the importance of possible competing effects for binding sites and rank plastic affinity for pollutants to support ecological risk assessment 2 2 6 other potentially interesting water side variables redox potential of the water medium can affect the speciation of trace elements in water and their equilibria between solid and liquid phases binda et al 2018 borch et al 2010 it can affect the surface charge of polymers liu and bard 2009 determining the oxidation of functional groups at the surface of plastics wu et al 2017 it can also influence growth and biological composition of film covering plastic surfaces niu et al 2021 rogers et al 2020 these features have possible direct or indirect effects on the capacity of plastic for metal ion adsorption redox potential typically varies along the water column and at the interface with sediments in light and oxygen depleted conditions the environment tend to become reductive niu et al 2021 hence plastics in the anoxic waters or sediments of meromictic environments will expectedly have different interaction with metal ions compared to those in the oxic zone despite its potential importance the redox potential of the medium has been so far overlooked in experimental assessment of the metal plastic interaction the amount and typology of suspended solids in water is also a potentially important determinant of metal accumulation on plastic suspended solids play an important role on speciation and mobility of dissolved metals a recent study by guan et al 2020 assessed adsorption of metals and compared natural suspended sediments from different lakes with those of plastics ps particles both virgin and naturally aged in lake water showing the higher efficiency of the earlier another recent work by li et al 2019 found similar results using sewage sludge as a competitor of plastic for metal ion adsorption future studies should include ternary systems with varying concentration of plastic particles and other solid matter to understand how the competitive effects of other natural adsorbents reduce plastic adsorption capacity 3 models of plastic metal interaction and their applicability for environmental settings in this chapter proposed mechanisms of plastic metal interaction are reviewed on the bases of available experimental evidences and measurements of rates and reaction energies to the best of our knowledge only few studies performed preliminary model fitting to explain the interaction between plastic and metals guo and wang 2021 town et al 2018 while this issue was better elucidated and reviewed for organic compounds koelmans et al 2016 mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 while reviewing the proposed models possible limitations for their applicability in the environmental context will be listed finally conceptual frameworks will be presented drawing from the synthesis of currently available studies that can be useful for describing the interaction in more general and at least semiquantitative terms 3 1 experimentally derived models of interaction the interaction of mps and metal compounds in water environments is typically modeled by statistically fitting results of kinetics and equilibrium isotherm experiments e g desta 2013 langmuir 1916 the evaluation of the kinetics and equilibria of reaction enable the elaboration of mechanistic frames to describe the processes controlling physical transport of the metals at the interface between plastics and water and an estimation of the energy of reactions this in turn provides useful information for generating hypotheses on the molecular bases of the process these models enable listing the most plausible physical physisorption or chemical e g complexation mechanisms interaction between dissolved metals and mps in water solutions thermodynamic parameters are usually extracted from experiments in which plastics are exposed to metal ions in a buffered water solution at constant physicochemical conditions salinity ph temperature in closed systems the experiment proceeds for an amount of time sufficient for the system to reach equilibrium with constant and stable concentration of ions in the water and plastic experiments can be repeated at varying initial metal ion concentration in the dissolved phase in order to evaluate non linearity of the sorption curve or at varying temperature to study shift of equilibrium and evaluate in turn the energies of reaction kinetic models are instead fitted contacting one batch of mps suspended in solution with a given concentration of the studied element s and analyzing the element s in solution at regular time intervals experimental details in section 4 2 they aim to analyze the limiting step in adsorption process guan et al 2020 mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 on an ultramolecular level plastics are relatively inhomogeneous materials with crystalline regions where polymer chains are regularly lined up and amorphous regions where polymer chains are not lined up amorphous regions of the polymer are in fact disordered and more permeable than crystalline ones bradney et al 2019 velez et al 2018 given that sorption experiments are typically conducted with plastic specimens in the at least micrometer or mm range the matrix can typically include both amorphous and crystalline portions introducing an inherent confounding factor the langmuir or freundlich models are the most common frameworks used to fit adsorption isotherms the langmuir model has been applied to fit adsorption of metals in the crystalline regions the freundlich model was instead applied to model interaction in the amorphous region as it overcomes the assumption that all binding sites are homogeneously distributed on the surface and are energetically equivalent while these models provided good fitting results in describing equilibria in simplified experimental conditions fu et al 2020 godoy et al 2019 holmes et al 2012 they appeared to be too simplistic for a potential environmental application in fact when compared with more complex equilibrium models such as the temkin xuan guo et al 2020 sips xue et al 2021 and the liquid solid extended bet isotherm model lin et al 2021 langmuir and freundlich models showed a lower performance these experiences however converged in showing that equilibrium isotherm curves are not linear suggesting that at least in the simplified experimental scenarios surface interaction and adsorption are the driving mechanisms while diffusion in the polymer matrix is a negligible process mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 similarly to equilibrium models more simplistic kinetics models such as pseudo first order and pseudo second order fern√°ndez et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 often do not well describe the experimentally observed adsorption kinetics indicating that the adsorption is a complex and multistep process different models are recently considered such as the shrinking core model tested for cu ni and zn on nylon tang et al 2021 or the external and internal mass transfer found as good descriptors for sr on ps pa and pp xuan guo et al 2020 for cu on virgin pe y wang et al 2020 and for pb on pvc ps and pe lin et al 2021 the analysis of isotherm adsorption at different temperatures enables estimating enthalpies of adsorption table 1 which give critical insights in the mechanism reconstruction generally results of enthalpies confirmed that physical adsorption is the main mechanism responsible of interaction at least with plastics with no biofilm coating most of the estimated Œ¥h values were in fact smaller than 40 kj mol lin et al 2021 tang et al 2021 there is however an important exception the study of as adsorption on ps showed a slightly negative estimated Œ¥h value indicating an exothermic process for binding in this case in fact a chemical binding through hydrogen bonds was hypothesized dong et al 2020 an inherent limitation of these models is their uncertain relevance to describe plastic metal interaction in environmental settings models are in fact determined through fitting data from minimalistic experiments with anomalously high concentration of trace elements and unrealistic boundary conditions e g lack of ligands or other competing ions in the solution phase absence of biofouling these critical issues will be more specifically described in section 4 2 the combination of kinetics and equilibrium modeling however helped to gain mechanistic insights on the processes responsible for adsorption of ions which under the studied experimental settings appear to be embodied by one or more types of weak electrostatic interactions dong et al 2020 fu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 few studies focused on assessing which functional group on the plastic surface is mainly responsible of the electrostatic interaction with metal ions using computational chemistry simulations dong et al 2020 xuan guo et al 2020 y wang et al 2020 it has been observed that the density of oxygen containing chemical groups e g hydroxyl carboxyl on the surface of plastic affect sorption equilibria other secondary physical processes proposed to investigate the adsorption phenomena are œÄ œÄ interactions xuetao guo et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and physical diffusion town et al 2018 y wang et al 2020 in contrast to physical interaction chemical bonds are rarely observed and these principally include the complexation of metals on plastic surface and hydrogen bonding guan et al 2020 y wang et al 2020 however it is worth considering that chemical bonding in an environmental context results a more stable process especially considering a natural competition with other ions ho and mckay 1998 considering the environmental applicability of the abovementioned models a gap in the research conducted so far on metal sorption on plastic is the lack of experimental focus on the determination of desorption rates in natural settings especially in water compartments equilibrium is a rare event due to temporal variability in ion concentration water chemistry temperature hydrology etc mosca angelucci and tomei 2020 considering their weak nature metal ions plastic interactions take place to a dynamic exchange where ions are continuously exchanging across the interface between the solid phase and water f gao et al 2019 the studies that addressed the reversibility of metal ion sorption on plastic focused on extractability of adsorbed elements in simulated animal and human gastro intestinal fluids e g holmes et al 2020 liao and yang 2020 turner 2018 while desorption in milder environmental conditions was only very recently considered in two studies fern√°ndez et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the recent work by zhou et al 2020 in particular to the best of our knowledge is the only which explored mathematically the adsorption desorption equilibria these studies confirmed the weak bond forming between plastic and metals with desorption occurring at a high rates and mild conditions these findings can have important ecological implications considering the possible interaction of mps which are known to move through the water column and interact with the biota finally it is important to note that none of the sorption experiments listed in table 1 has been conducted with biologically coated plastic which might be prevalent in the environment in this case the type of interaction is expectedly very different as microorganisms can uptake and use metals as nutrients through active transmembrane transport s liu et al 2021 also extracellular structure on bacterial surface may hold domains capable of forming more stable complexes with metal ions 3 2 a conceptual framework for future investigations considering the highlighted limitations and little environmental realism of the interaction models developed so far it is useful to introduce a more holistic conceptual frame to guide future experimental studies in the following paragraph such a framework is described in a tiered approach with three levels of increasing complexity pristine polymers chemically weathered polymers and biofouled polymers the random coil model provides a useful frame to describe polymeric materials on a supermolecular level based on this model polymer chains have a random and strongly entangled arrangement through non permanent physical crosslinks see fig 2 a common polymers of environmental relevance are either completely amorphous or semicrystalline in semicrystalline regions chains are aligned in glassy amorphous regions instead polymer segments can move locally and such a process can assist diffusion of small molecules in connection with diffusion amorphous polymers are characterized by a large free volume exceeding 10 of the bulk volume chemical species of available metals on the other hand can be modeled depending on ph pe conditions different speciation models are currently available in literature for their modeling e g guan et al 2020 in case of pristine plastic items the characteristics of the plastic surface is expected to reflect the hydrophobic nature of the polymer aliphatic chains e g in case of pe and pp at neutral acidic ph and in absence of complexing or charged domains on the plastic surface the deposition of dissolved metal ions is disfavored by solvation energy in case of some polymers e g ps the weak œÄ œÄ interaction between metal ion and aromatic ring expected Œ¥h between 5 and 20 kj mol as well as complexation with phenyl groups expected Œ¥h between 20 and 50 kj mol are in principle possible although unlikely to happen in an environmental context zhou et al 1998 chemical additives present in pristine plastics can in principle affect kinetics and thermodynamics of interaction and their role should be analyzed in future studies the surface of oxidized plastic instead can present i alkyl groups capable of forming coordination complex with metals and ii oxidized groups that can act as permanent dipoles and form noncovalent interactions with metal ions in environmental conditions fig 2b in these conditions the higher adsorption rate observed experimentally will vary in correlation with the quantity of surface oxygen containing groups expected equilibrium constant of these interactions will be Œ¥h ranging 10 20 kj mol for pe or pp and between 5 and 20 kj mol for ps and 20 50 kj mol for nylon mass transfer models will be better descriptors of interaction kinetics because of presence of different binding groups on the plastic surface that can become saturated in different stages and rates the accumulation of metals on plastic surfaces coated with biofilms is finally expected to be underpinned by very different processes and energies fig 2c the development of biofilm on plastic has been observed to vary from 5 5 after 15 days to 54 after 90 days of incubation ahamed et al 2020 owing to their long residence time in the environment most plastics found in water environments are likely to be coated by a biological film and their surface properties and reactivity must be strongly mediated by the characteristic and biological activity of the biofilm itself while the effect of biofilms was only recently considered for plastic particles ahamed et al 2020 guan et al 2020 y wang et al 2020 several studies have shown that biofilms efficiently accumulate metals with enrichment factors ranging 500 1 6000 1 the underlying mechanisms of such an active uptake process are well studied ancion et al 2010 these involve both cell wall sorption and active transmembrane transport followed by intracellular accumulation geng et al 2019 s liu et al 2021 anionic polysaccharides typical of the bacterial capsule have a strong affinity for metal counterions even at low concentration fig 2c possibly originated from evolutionary adaptations specifically for optimizing acquisition of these essential micronutrients microbial cell walls contain numerous anionic functional groups cooh and p o3 2 and the extracellular polymeric substances a major component of biofilms are composed of several natural polymers e g lipids polysaccharides proteins with negatively charged functional groups like hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 2 that can enhance complexation of metal species ahamed et al 2020 microbiota composing the biofilm can also entrap metal ions from water solution through a variety of biochemical processes including enzyme catalyzed complexation into biological molecules redox reactions and micro precipitation chakravarty and banerjee 2012 fathollahi et al 2021 accepting the complex frame of fig 2c leads to postulating multi compartment type uptake kinetics for metals where the following process take place sequentially interaction with polypeptides passive process possible facilitation of cation permeation by bacteria membrane proteins active process and storage in the cytoplasm at the net of elimination processes zhang et al 2021 the significance of this mechanisms for metal ions uptake by biofilms was never studied in the context of accumulation of metal on plastics and represent an important area of developments in the incoming years 4 experimental and analytical challenges in the study of plastic element interaction the interaction of trace elements with mps has been experimentally investigated employing two different approaches that can be described as top down and bottom up the top down approach encompasses studies that determined the element concentrations and multiphase distribution in mps sampled from the environment through chemical extractions or direct surface analysis whereas the bottom up approach is embodied by studies aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of plastic metal ion interaction in controlled laboratory or semi controlled in situ conditions evaluating the thermodynamics and kinetics processes driving the adsorption of metals 4 1 top down approaches on plastic water phase distribution assessment of metals the top down approaches enable to investigate the likelihood of metal adsorption through the collection and analysis of environmental plastics the main steps include the collection of samples and the potential pre treatments which can be followed by extraction dissolution and analysis of solutions or direct instrumental analysis to investigate the load of adsorbed elements each of these steps introduces technical challenges that can confound the measurement of metal distribution these are described in the following sections with a special focus for studies with mps 4 1 1 collection and sample processing of environmental mps sampling collection and pre treatment processes play a major role for quality and reliability of measurements accordingly several reviews have been devoted to this topic covering marine waters prata et al 2019 freshwaters campanale et al 2020 sediments adomat and grischek 2021 bellasi et al 2021 fish and aquatic invertebrates lusher et al 2017 sampling from water environments is usually in about 70 of the studies performed by deploying nets of different mesh sizes and collecting mps from large volumes of water alternatively discrete or continuous sampling of water with in line filtration is applied cutroneo et al 2020 the large number of procedures and equipment applied to mp sampling and separation is a known concern for data comparability density separation is typically performed to isolate plastics from other solids in the samples this is for example a fundamental step for extracting mps from sediments density separation methods utilize concentrated nacl nai or zncl2 solution he et al 2020 which can alter the natural element distribution stock et al 2019 wang and wang 2018 this main issue affecting all mp related fields inevitably also affects the recent analysis of their interaction with inorganic components in elemental analysis sample dissolution generally consists of dissolving adsorbed species by treating mps with acids and presenting them to an analyzer typically inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes or atomic absorption spectroscopy aas strong concentrated acid mixtures e g aqua regia are commonly used for this purpose brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 li et al 2020 mar≈°iƒá luƒçiƒá et al 2018 vedolin et al 2018 often under high temperature and pressure conditions e g microwave assisted acid digestion hildebrandt et al 2020 wang et al 2017 zon et al 2018 such an aggressive process may lead to the partial or complete dissolution of the polymeric matrix thus leading to the extraction of the surface adsorbed trace elements together with bulk species which are most likely present as additives in the virgin polymer for example metal salts are used in polymer industries as heat stabilizers metallic stearates have been used as slip agents while cd and pb compounds are used as antioxidants hahladakis et al 2018 weakly bonded metals are of higher environmental interest for their environmental implications turner et al 2020 thus mp dissolution and the release of bulk species should be differentiated to accurately investigate adsorbed elements that are exchanged with the environment extraction leaching protocols under milder conditions e g diluted and less aggressive reagents table 2 are accordingly emerging as a promising alternative to selectively dissolve adsorbed elements while preserving the integrity of mps and the metal content present in origin in the polymer matrix f gao et al 2019 hodson et al 2017 smith and turner 2020 f wang et al 2019 these studies show that the degree of desorption may strongly vary depending on the nature of the elements and polymer bioavailability of contaminants adsorbed on mps was evaluated in more detail by performing standardized physiologically based extraction tests pbets using tailored simulants for human liao and yang 2020 smith and turner 2020 and avian gastric conditions holmes et al 2020 smith and turner 2020 turner 2018 focusing on the former the migration of metals and metalloids under the conditions reported in the european toy safety directive hcl 0 07 m for 2 h at 37 c spanu et al 2021b was recently proposed as a standard reference limit for mammal ingestion smith and turner 2020 thus differently from acid digestion protocols selective leaching may provide effective qualitative indications on the strength and type of mp element interactions while significant developments are on going in this area there is a clear need for fully validated and generally accepted approaches to metal extraction from environmental plastics for the future elemental fractionation protocols i e sequential extraction of differently bonded metals hass and fine 2010 are expected to play a major role in trace elements mp analysis they can concurrently provide a deep characterization of sampled mps a comprehension of bonding mechanisms e g physisorbed strongly bound etc and a risk assessment for bioavailability studies a good starting point for defining mp specific procedures may be found in fractionation protocols proposed for soil and sediment matrices hass and fine 2010 hlavay et al 2004 such procedures are at present employed only for detecting changes in elemental fractions in soils after interactions with mps li et al 2021 yu et al 2021 2020 but were not applied directly to mp particles drawing from those experiences a five step sequential extraction protocol is proposed here for application to mps fig 3 including the following phases 1 exchangeable species usually including physisorbed elements 2 associated to carbonates 3 associated to oxy hydroxides of manganese and iron 4 associated to organic matter 5 residual the presence of some of the above mentioned phases is sparsely reported on plastic particles mn and fe oxy hydroxides and carbonates were described in incubation and laboratory conditions only see e g kniggendorf et al 2020 leiser et al 2020 whereas organic phases mainly biofilm are the subject of a large number of studies nielsen and jahn 1999 oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 rummel et al 2017 however the main challenge in the application of such a fractionation protocol is the low concentration of adsorbed elements in the different phases making their analysis difficult to overcome this issue the utilization of a simplified clean sequential extraction procedure requiring limited amount of extracted sample is recommended binda et al 2018 ciceri et al 2008 followed by detection through a high sensitive analyzer such as icp ms in this way the most abundant trace elements few to tens of ppm e g fe mn and zn may be detected in individual fractions whereas other metals below 0 1 ppm e g cd and pb could be analyzed as a bulk after aggregating the individual fractions at levels expectedly close to the detection limits of icp ms holmes et al 2012 mar≈°iƒá luƒçiƒá et al 2018 quantitative data of metal extracted from mps should be then compared at least with the concentration of trace elements present in the sampled aquatic matrix in order to calculate distribution coefficients furthermore the analysis of metals in other solid constituents of water or sediments could elucidate the role of plastic in metal speciation throughout different environmental compartments e g yu et al 2020 unfortunately despite its importance analysis of water phase is far from being a widely adopted practice when studying metal concentration on plastics collected from the environment but carbery et al 2020 li et al 2020 4 1 2 instrumental analysis options and limitations besides traditional analysis by icp ms on metals extracted from samples mp element interactions can also be investigated by direct analysis of metal on the plastic surface traditional methods used for analyzing elements on surfaces are employed for this purpose these are x ray photoelectron spectroscopy dong et al 2020 tang et al 2021 scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx prunier et al 2019 and laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry la icp ms el hadri et al 2020 the main advantage of these techniques is that no specific pretreatment is required largely reducing the risk of altering the natural mps surface during sample preparation and extraction quantitative semiquantitative information may be gathered by these non invasive techniques which unlike extraction dissolution methods analyze specifically element content on the surface of plastics with a probe depth ranging from 5 nm using xps to 1 2 ¬µm using sem edx this approach fits the purpose of examining specifically the interactions at the mp environment interface solving the problem of the possible undesired extraction of metals possibly present in the polymer matrix at source together with the metals acquired from the environment furthermore xps can be useful for preliminary qualitative mp characterization providing fundamental information on the chemical composition and state of the mp surface e g the presence of o and n containing surface functional groups which can play a key role in the adsorption process as a drawback the low sensitivity of xps and sem edx makes them suitable for the determination of minor and major elements but not of trace elements detection limits down to 0 1 and 0 01 atomic percent are reported for sem edx and xps respectively nasrazadani and hassani 2016 shard 2014 reliable trace element quantification can instead be achieved by la icp ms thanks to the much higher sensitivity monticelli et al 2018 even in polymeric materials spanu et al 2021a la icp ms can discriminate between bulk and surface species by determining concentration depth profiles surface to bulk as demonstrated by el hadri et al 2020 xps may be an effective tool to perform speciation analysis for a more detailed assessment of plastic elements interaction it should be applied not only for the identification of mp surface functional groups as normally done but also for the speciation of adsorbed species which would provide new insights for formulating and assessing mechanistic hypothesis regarding the adsorption process at present such approach was applied only for as species adsorbed onto ps dong et al 2020 hence there is a highway for future exploitation of this techniques in this research area furthermore xps can be employed to perform depth profiling analysis with a nanometric depth resolution this approach may disclose new opportunities to gather insights on the diffusion of inorganic contaminants through the very first atomic layers of plastics finally xps analysis can be used specifically to assess metal contents in the biofilm covering the mps this appears to be an excellent opportunity to gather experimental evidences of the possible pivotal role of biofilms in determining uptake of metal by plastics in the environment secondary ion mass spectrometry sims is another surface analytical technique that shows very high sensitivity suitable for trace element quantification mapping and depth profiling to date sims has been used limitedly for the evaluation of the degradation of plastic debris by looking at changes in the mass spectral pattern of the polymer as well as to identify and visualize imaging microplastic particles in complex matrices biesinger et al 2011 du et al 2020 jungnickel et al 2016 only very recently a sims based technique time of flight sims tof sims has been applied for the first time to study the interactions between plastics and metals to study the diffusion of cu2 and ni2 ions into pp fig 4 kern et al 2021 4 2 bottom up approaches here we describe and critically review approaches adopted for characterizing trace element mp interactions under controlled laboratory or field conditions these studies generally aim at determining the thermodynamics or the kinetics of trace element adsorption onto mp surfaces see section 3 1 thermodynamic investigations godoy et al 2019 guan et al 2020 zou et al 2020 kinetic studies aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2020 brennecke et al 2016 fern√°ndez et al 2020 lin et al 2021 tang et al 2021 or both davranche et al 2019 dong et al 2020 xuan guo et al 2020 holmes et al 2014 2012 lang et al 2020 oz et al 2019 tang et al 2020 turner and holmes 2015 f wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 zon et al 2018 were performed on mps sampled from the environment holmes et al 2012 tang et al 2021 pristine polymers godoy et al 2019 zou et al 2020 and artificially aged polymers aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2020 lang et al 2020 4 2 1 critical issues in currently applied methods as already stated in section 3 1 the controllable conditions of simulation methods make isotherms and kinetics experiments the ideal candidates for modelling studies on mp element interactions however the absence of harmonized standardized procedures for boundary conditions i e the actual environmental conditions during adsorption experiments and the aging process of mps often hinders comparability among existing data see table s1 in supplementary material several critical aspects should be addressed for ensuring experiments yield reliable and environmentally relevant data first times play a role when adsorption isotherms are measured enough time should be allowed for the system to reach equilibrium hence studies that focus on equilibrium should be complemented with kinetic experiments aimed at evaluating a valid experimental timeframe available studies have used timeframe ranging from 4 h davranche et al 2019 to two weeks godoy et al 2019 with typical values of 24 48 h it should be also considered that the equilibration time can vary for the different active sites of plastic particle different mechanisms are at work for plastic element interactions y wang et al 2020 and may require different times to reach equilibrium the latter point is also clearly environmentally relevant as the residence time of mps and trace elements varies widely in the environment limiting or extending the kinetically accessible processes as an example only fast processes may be active in a highly dynamic environment like an estuary whereas months may be allowed for interactions to occur in soils another critical issue is the scarce representativeness of natural conditions given by the solution phase used during equilibrium and kinetic experiments generally the adsorption of single or few trace elements onto artificially aged mps is performed under extremely simplified conditions e g distilled water or salty solutions at controlled ph this minimalistic set up is not representative of natural water matrices while synthesis and simplification is pivotal when designing experiments studies with more realistic conditions e g use of environmentally relevant ph conditions and ion concentrations co presence of ligands and dissolved organic matter in the solution should be considered too in order to enable a sound extrapolation of findings from minimalistic experiments to real environmental conditions to this regard it is noted that all laboratory studies used very high concentrations of trace element usually in the milligram per liter range with few study using concentrations down to tens of microgram per liter davranche et al 2019 guan et al 2020 holmes et al 2014 2012 these concentrations even the lowest ones occur in the environment only in extreme conditions like mine waters or anoxic water in peculiar geological settings e g binda et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 and are never met in seawater or freshwater bodies similar problems are observable for ph acidic ph values are often used in combination with high element concentrations to hinder element precipitation as oxo hydroxides oz et al 2019 tang et al 2020 providing unrealistic conditions to describe typical environmental settings only a limited number of studies considered the competition by dissolved organic matter tang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 or suspended particles guan et al 2020 this lack of focus on the role of organic ligands in strident conflict to the well known behavior of trace elements that are typically almost completely complexed to these compounds in both freshwater monticelli and caprara 2015 and seawater y gao et al 2019 the exploration of mp metal ion interactions at such high metal concentrations in acidic conditions may lead to an unrealistic picture of the interaction mechanisms and dynamics occurring in environmental settings in particular molecular sites with different binding affinity and concentration are likely to be present on mp surfaces xuan guo et al 2020 meaning that unrealistically high exposure levels may blur or completely hide the potentially important role of binding sites with high affinity but low density in the plastic surface the heterogeneity of binding sites is well described for complexing species in natural waters in filella and town 2003 considering the trace or even ultra trace element levels in natural waters these undetected sites may well be the only sites involved in trace element mp interaction under environmental conditions during laboratory experiments other factors may influence dissolved concentrations of metals and hence possibly affect the experiment outcomes for example adsorption onto container walls and precipitation can easily happen resulting in a removal of the elements from the solution phase that is uncorrelated to the sorption onto plastics these phenomena may be easily assessed by including adequate experimental blanks while this may seem obvious blanks have been mentioned only in one of available studies yet without reporting blank results in the paper moreover conditioning of the container used for the experiments should be performed to avoid wall effects see e g sanvito and monticelli 2021 such a procedure is usually adopted in available studies but the glassware is conditioned only with the solution before adding the elements solutions containing at varying concentrations should be instead added in the containers and left for enough time to reach equilibrium and then containers should be rinsed with distilled water this procedure should be performed at least twice before proceeding with the adsorption experiments finally the mp molecular micro macroscopic characteristics and aging level should be carefully evaluated and described to enable comparison of results across different studies for example concerning ageing different types of environmental stresses are described to simulate weathering of mps however work focuses so far mainly on the effect of a single or a limited number of factors which mainly include surface oxidation chemically or uv induced in this way only the effect of single features of aged mps e g specific surface area surface functional groups biofilm formation on the interaction with metals may be currently gained as already stated in section 2 the effective reproduction of natural ageing process is needed for a realistic simulation of mp element interaction which should in particular account also for biological processes 4 2 2 recommendations for future experimental works following the options and limitations described in this chapter it is recommended that adsorption isotherms and kinetic experiments should 1 use environmentally relevant conditions in terms of trace element concentrations no more than 10 times the environmental ones ph values and major element composition 2 evaluate time for equilibrium prior to experiment 3 include the necessary blanks to assess possible experimental interferences and or artifact e g evaluate the set up without addition of mps to assess glassware effects or any reactivity in the solution phase or without the addition of metal ions to evaluate any possible leaching of metal already present in the plastic specimens 4 use high sensitivity high resolution analytical techniques typically icp ms to enable the detection of trace and ultra trace levels of elements 5 evaluate adsorption kinetics in accordance with the residence times of mps and trace elements in the environmental compartments 6 use of combined and harmonized aging methods attempting to faithfully reproduce environmentally aged mps after following these basic recommendations future experiments could be designed in a variety of different ways to move forward knowledge of mp element interactions for example a detailed mass budget approach is strongly envisaged whereby trace element masses are analyzed in both the solution the mps and the glassware surface at the end of the experiments and compared with the total mass added in the system at the beginning of the experiment this would enable controlling for possible confounding effects driven for example by leaching of metals native in the plastic specimens moreover and importantly element speciation should be included in the experiments pesavento et al 2009 species differing in redox state cr iii and cr vi complexation elements bound to or adsorbed onto natural organic matter organic and inorganic ligands inorganic and organic mercury species like methylmercury are expected to interact differently with mps surfaces up to now the behavior of cr vi only has been selectively investigated turner and holmes 2015 as a final remark the combination of these bottom up approaches with the abovementioned top down approaches based on field observations section 4 1 represent a suitable way to complete the understanding on the mechanisms mp elements interactions experimental procedures such as sequential extraction procedures are likely to provide information on the kind of interactions that are at work in the environment in this way a more detailed knowledge on the occurring adsorption in real environmental conditions can help in modulating at best the water and plastic related parameters for experiments in controlled batches 5 conclusions and perspectives this review highlights the recent and increasing research interest on the interaction of plastic with metals as an emerging research avenue in the plastic pollution area considering the still early stage of development several limitations and gaps need to be addressed before a satisfactory comprehension of the mechanisms underlying plastic metal ion interaction can be achieved while early experimental works have shown that trace elements interact with plastics essentially through weak surface interactions the molecular domains on plastic surfaces responsible for the interaction are still poorly understood similarly the role of water side composition e g the presence of ligands ions and other compounds competing for binding sites co occurring and interacting with metals in the solution phase and properties e g ph redox potential is unclear while studies have so far privileged a reductionistic approach focusing on simplified experimental setups the adoption of a more holistic yet detailed conceptual frame such as the one described in fig 2 describing the system through its progressive levels of complexity fundamentally determined by the level and typology of plastic ageing can help directing future and more detailed research in particular the role of biofilms should be carefully considered in future studies background knowledge suggests in fact that microbiota forming biofilms possess dedicated structures and physiological processes enabling them to actively uptake metal ions as micronutrients hence biofilms may have a pivotal contribution to the core capacity of plastics for accumulating metals that has so far been overlooked furthermore there is a demand to design sorption desorption experiment with a more realistic and well defined selection of conditions e g using realistic trace concentrations of metals water physicochemical conditions varying in the environmental range plastic specimens fully characterized for their chemical and or biological ageing this will ensure more representative and intercomparable results along with laboratory based research the analysis of environmental samples and the study of fractionation of elements adsorbed onto mp particles will contribute to shed light on the adsorption mechanisms relevant for the environmental context finally future studies should focus with more detail on the water side assessing the effective adsorption desorption also of major elements dissolved in water e g n p ca k these can in fact potentially interact with environmental plastics similarly to trace elements especially if the adsorption mechanisms are non selective translating knowledge gained on plastic metal ion interaction to the interaction with other ions serving as macronutrients can be key for understanding the broader indirect impacts of plastic pollutions on water ecosystems e g alteration of cycling of elements seeley et al 2020 declaration of competing

16622,to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resource recovery many wastewater treatment operators are retrofitting existing plants to implement new technologies for energy nutrient and carbon recovery in literature there is a lack of studies that can unfold the potential environmental and economic impacts of the transition that wastewater utilities are undertaking to transform their treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs when existing literature studies are mostly based on simulations rather than real plant data and pilot scale results this study combines life cycle assessment and economic evaluations to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of retrofitting an existing wastewater treatment plant wwtp which already implements energy recovery into a full scale wrrf with a series of novel technologies the majority of which are already implemented full scale or tested through pilot scales we evaluate five technology alternatives against the current performance of the wwtp real time n2o control biological biogas upgrading coupled with power to hydrogen phosphorus recovery pre filtration carbon harvest and enhanced nitrogen removal our results show that real time n2o control biological biogas upgrading and pre filtration lead to a decrease in climate change and fossil resource depletion impacts the implementation of the real time measurement and control of n2o achieved the highest reduction in direct co2 eq emissions 35 with no significant impacts in other environmental categories biological biogas upgrading contributed to counterbalancing direct and indirect climate change impacts by substituting natural gas consumption and production pre filtration increased climate change reduction by 13 while it increased impacts in other categories enhanced sidestream nitrogen removal increased climate change impacts by 12 but decreased marine eutrophication impacts by 14 the reserve base resource depletion impacts however were the highest in the plant configurations implementing biological biogas upgrading coupled with power to hydrogen environmental improvements generated economic costs for all alternatives except for real time n2o control the results expose possible environmental and economic trade offs and hotspots of the journey that large wastewater treatment plants will undertake in transitioning into resource recovery facilities in the coming years graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pollution control nutrients recovery biomethane easetech added value abatement costs 1 introduction only a decade ago wastewater was considered a serious environmental and health problem while it is now increasingly valued as a resource in many parts of the world larsen 2015 mo and zhang 2013 van der hoek et al 2016 wastewater is rich in nutrients and when discharged untreated into receiving water bodies severe eutrophication problems can occur additionally efficient biological treatment processes demand energy and incomplete nitrification denitrification can lead to unwanted emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o 265 times more powerful than co2 myhre et al 2013 the role of wastewater treatment plants wwtps currently transforms from removal of nitrogen n phosphorus p and organic materials into integrated resource recovery and pollution control the majority of the removed phosphorus and part of the removed nitrogen ends up in residual wastewater sludge which is therefore important to valorise when moving towards wastewater treatment integrated with resource recovery there are many ways of valorising the sludge e g through anaerobic digestion to produce biogas and subsequent use of the degassed sludge as fertiliser on soil morero et al 2017 pfluger et al 2019 however high levels of heavy metals in sludge may limit its applicability as a fertiliser jensen and jepsen 2005 consequently four major danish wwtps incinerate degassed sludge and dispose of its ashes in landfills worldwide technologies are now being developed for energy recovery biogas electricity heat and for recovering phosphorus e g hukari et al 2016 heavy metals and sand from sludge ashes to recycle p in its mineral form and reduce the consumption of conventional feed phosphate chemicals and silica sand respectively easymining 2020 due to these benefits the circular economy is high on the agenda of wastewater utilities and it is believed to be the right strategy for reaching resource energy and co2 neutrality e g danish epa 2020 smart plant 2021 hence major danish wastewater utilities aim to retrofit their wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs such as the varga project in copenhagen biofos 2021 increasing circularity and reducing environmental impacts require investments and may decrease economic value for affected stakeholders resource recovery technologies may also produce environmental burden shifts i e decreasing ghg emissions while increasing the effects of other environmental impact categories hence holistic assessments are needed researchers currently use life cycle assessment lca and life cycle costing lcc to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of conventional wastewater treatment e g mcnamara et al 2016 niero et al 2014 and a best practice guide has been published corominas et al 2020 lorenzo toja et al 2016 used lca and lcc to provide an eco efficiency assessment iso 14045 2012 of 22 conventional spanish wwtps our review of recent existing studies on the subject table 1 illustrates that authors with few exceptions tian et al 2020 have approached the problem either from an environmental delre et al 2019 fang et al 2016 guven et al 2018 hao et al 2019 kehrein et al 2020 pradel and aissani 2019 or an economic viewpoint boiocchi et al 2017 riley et al 2020 to our knowledge the majority of economic and environmental assessments of resource recovery facilities have been based on literature studies e g hao et al 2019 or pilot and lab scale experiments guven et al 2018 pradel and aissani 2019 tian et al 2020 carried out a combined economic and environmental assessment of a full scale wrrf including thermal energy recovery from effluent the pyrolysis of sludge and combined heat and power generation the study focused on a state of the art north american wwtp and covered the full life cycle albeit without considering methane losses and laughing gas emissions from the plant the study built upon proposed design scenarios and not the actual implementation due to the numerous options for retrofitting wwtps we hypothesise that the true impacts of resource recovery facilities need to be uncovered from several real life and full scale retrofitting cases therefore as a novelty we provide a combined environmental and economic assessment of technological advancements on an existing state of the art energy efficient wwtp by 2025 the plant will be a full scale energy and resource recovery facility that valorises waste by products and reduces ghg emissions retrofitting covers five alternatives to recover nutrients and energy and reduce emissions compared to a business as usual baseline wwtp in 2025 the novelty of our study relies therefore not only on the combined environmental and economic assessment of integrated resource recovery and pollution control measures but also on the reduced uncertainty in the data input that are mostly based on real plant data and pilot scale results our results provide insights into the potential hotspots and trade offs that come as a consequence of a new benchmark for efficient wastewater management the study aims to answer four important research questions is the transition from currently operating wwtps to wrrfs environmentally and economically sustainable who are the major affected stakeholders and how do retrofitted wwtps change economic value across stakeholders where are the main hotspots and uncertainties for an environmentally and economically sustainable wrrf are there trade offs between environmental and economic impacts or between different environmental categories 2 materials and methods we combined an environmental impact assessment with an economic value evaluation using a standardised eco efficiency framework iso 14045 2012 the environmental impact assessment was performed through lca while the system value was expressed in total value added tva supplemented by estimated abatement costs of co2 eq emissions and phosphorus recovery costs 2 1 goal scope and functional unit the main goal of the

environmental impact assessment lca lca modelling followed an attributional framework since all the scenarios are multifunctional systems we performed system expansion by crediting recovered resources

were carried out for both environmental and economic evaluation a perturbation analysis was performed by increasing by 10 the parameters contributing more than 5 to environmental and economic impacts

parameters contribution to overall uncertainty was estimated according to bisinella et al 2016 and built into easetech to place our results in the context of varying external factors we provided a scenario analysis for alternate situations 1 wastewater effluent recipient changed from marine to freshwater 2 p2h electricity mix assumed to be 20 fossil power generation instead of excess wind power alone 3 wind power based electricity for all requirements 4 sand substitutes cement 5 the consumption of hcl for sludge ash dissolution for p recovery is considered lca burden free since the p recovery company can currently benefit from hcl produced as a by product at the kemira plant in sweden and 6 a scenario analysis of the tva results was performed by internalising co2 eq emissions using the current co2 european emission allowance 3 results and discussion the results present the environmental and economic impacts of the six alternative plant configurations the alternatives build sequentially upon each other adding another technology for each step from rf baseline until rf n2o ch4 p c ax 3 1 mass flow analysis throughout the alternatives the resource recovery facility treated approx 27 million m3 of wastewater with a load of 1300 ton tn year 193 ton tp year and a 16 484 ton cod year in each case around 77 of tn was converted into n2 n table 4 in the rf baseline 2 6 of the tn was converted into n2o n the majority of which was produced in biological processes during nitrification denitrification this factor 2 6 n2o n tninlet is approx two times higher than the recommended ipcc factor of 1 6 ipcc 2019 real time n2o control reduced markedly the conversion to 1 6 in the wrrf alternatives and this factor is more in line with ipcc 2019 recommended factor sidestream anammox implemented to reduce the nitrogen load from reject water might also have a severe effect on n2o emissions rf n2o ch4 p c ax i e 3 of the tn removed from reject water by anammox ended up as n2o n gas with experimental studies showing variations in the n2o n emission factor between 2 and 8 of tn removed by anammox andersen et al 2016 uri carre√±o 2016 we assumed that 3 of the tn removed from anammox was converted into n2o n in the alternative rf n2o ch4 p c ax so total n2o n emissions increased to 1 7 of tn 13 of tn sedimented in sludge and 8 ended up in the effluent in total 93 of tp ended in the sludge ashes and was either landfilled in the alternatives rf baseline rf n2o ch4 or recovered to produce high value products such as feed phosphate monocalcium phosphate mcp in the alternatives with p recovery p recovery recycled 95 of tp from the sludge ashes corresponding to approx 171 tons per year in the four alternatives namely rf baseline until rf n2o ch4 p 33 of the cod was converted in the biological activated sludge system while 34 was anaerobically digested and converted into energy i e biogas 60 ch4 40 co2 implementing primary filtration reduced cod availability in the activated sludge system but increased the cod available for anaerobic digestion by approx 8 rf n2o ch4 p c rf n2o ch4 p c ax the increase of cod in ad increased methane production compared to rf baseline 3 2 environmental impacts overall the five alternatives reduced climate change impacts compared to the baseline fig 3 the four alternatives rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p c ax also reduced their impacts compared to both rf baseline and rf n2o in the categories terrestrial eutrophication te and fossil depletion dar f impacts while freshwater eutrophication fe impacts were equally the highest for rf baseline rf n2o and rf n2o ch4 marine eutrophication me did not significantly vary across alternatives except for the last alternative implementing sidestream anammox only in the category reserve base resource depletion dar rb rf baseline showed lower impacts compared to rf n2o ch4 in 2025 the strategy to upgrade all biogas rather than having chp seemed to pay off to obtain negative fossil depletion impacts already in the baseline plant performance 0 23 mj m 3 although a higher reduction is produced by the other alternatives fig 3 3 2 1 climate change despite only 1 6 2 6 of tn table 4 emitted as n2o the climate change impacts were very large they decreased by between 35 and 59 compared to the baseline following the implementation of new technologies implementing real time n2o measurements and control as a first step decreased impacts by almost 40 compared to the baseline treatment plant performance without a significant increase of impacts in the other environmental categories 0 4 fig 3 for the uncertainty assessment we used a 30 60 reduction range based on previous full scale results chen et al 2019 we consider it a conservative estimate of long term reduction because the future optimisation of real time controls e g increasing suspended solids in the aeration tanks may decrease n2o emissions even further implementing bio methanation for biogas upgrading rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p c ax had a beneficial effect on both reducing climate change up to 0 13 kg co2 eq m 3 and avoiding fossil resource depletion up to 2 4 mj m 3 avoidance of natural gas extraction and combustion however it increased reserve base resource depletion impacts 93 increase fig 3 implementing pre filtration induced an additional 13 reduction in co2 emissions compared to the previous alternative however installing pre filters may increase the production and emission of n2o as the filters will harvest more cod that is needed for denitrification adding artificial carbon sources could counterbalance this negative effect the potential increase in n2o and the use of artificial carbon sources such as methanol has not yet been established so they are not included herein the alternatives implementing p recovery and anammox rf n2o ch4 p and rf n2o ch4 p c ax increased climate change impacts by 4 and 12 compared to the previous alternative more efficient nitrification denitrification with anammox increased n2o emissions and used additional electricity as also reported by fenu et al 2019 as studied by andersen et al 2016 and uri carre√±o 2016 in another danish wwtp up to 8 of the tn removed by anammox can be emitted as n2o herein we assumed that 3 of tn removed from anammox would end up as n2o hence the increase in climate change impacts in this last alternative 3 2 2 terrestrial eutrophication te impacts primarily stemmed from the onsite incineration of sludge ashes while a negative contribution was made by avoided nitrogen oxides nox during natural gas combustion avoided heat production and the substitution of conventional monocalcium phosphate mcp production te impacts decreased along with the increased implementation of pollution control and resource recovery technology 11 to 6 except for rf n2o with the same impacts as rf baseline p recovery rf n2o ch4 p rf n2o ch4 p c ax induced a net increase of 2 of te impacts as impacts from using chemicals and electricity exceeded impacts avoided from substituting conventional mcp production however overall te impacts were still lower than rf baseline 3 2 3 freshwater eutrophication fe impacts were primarily induced by chemicals and electricity consumption in the baseline treatment plant and increased following the implementation of novel technologies by up to 22 p recovery implementation increased fe impacts by 7 compared to rf n2o ch4 as impacts avoided from the beneficiation of phosphate rocks could not counterbalance the impacts from consumption chemicals and electricity needed for the sludge ash treatment to recover phosphorus on the positive side in alternatives with p recovery only 5 of the total p sludge ashes ended up being landfilled against 95 in alternatives without p recovery i e rf baseline rf n2o rf n2o ch4 table 4 the last two alternatives specifically rf n2o ch4 p c increased fe impacts by an additional 11 due to the additional consumption of iron chloride and polymer for pre filtration 3 2 4 marine eutrophication across alternatives more than 95 of the me impacts were caused by discharging nitrogen in the effluent no marked changes of me impacts were seen when implementing novel technologies up to 2 except for the alternative implementing anammox 16 compared to baseline the discharged concentration of nitrogen across alternatives was 51 lower than the permitted discharge limit of 8 mg l tn however the anammox plant decreased total nitrogen in the effluent by an additional 15 3 2 5 fossil resource depletion fossil resource depletion impacts decreased following the implementation of new technologies increasing the production and export of bio and neo methane avoided extracting approx 3 2 million nm3 natural gas yearly in the alternatives rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p pre filtration rf n2o ch4 p c rf n2o ch4 p c ax additionally increased biogas production and hence the amount of upgraded biogas to natural gas by 18 with total annual biogas production of approx 3 7 million of nm3 the alternative rf n2o ch4 p increased dar f impacts by 6 due to chemicals required for the dissolution of sludge ashes and the separation of p fe and al 3 2 6 resource depletion reserve base as opposed to fossil impacts dar rb impacts generated a burden to the environment in all alternatives except for rf n2o ch4 p the alternative rf n2o ch4 increased impacts by 93 compared to rf baseline and rf n2o electrolysers for hydrogen production rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p c ax consumed two times more electricity than the entire baseline plant operation table 3 p2h technology used excess wind power for electrolysis that affected the dar rb category due to the production of wind turbines requiring minerals from the ground such as indium the electricity mix is therefore of primary importance when designing a strategy for reducing co2 eq emissions in the alternative rf n2o ch4 p phosphorus is recovered in its mineral form and its dar rb impacts reduced by 118 compared to the baseline thanks to substituting conventional mcp aluminium hydroxide iron chloride and sand production that counterbalance additional impacts from additional chemical and heat consumption pre filtration rf n2o ch4 p c induced an additional 273 increase in impacts compared to the previous alternative however net impacts were still 68 lower compared to the baseline the increase was due to additional equipment and the use of iron chloride and polymers polymer for the dewatering unit and iron chloride used as a flocculant dar rb impacts did not significantly increase due to the implementation of anammox 1 increase 3 3 scenario analysis lca the environmental performance for implementing novel technologies changed in different scenarios si h for example fe impacts increased if effluent was released into a freshwater body scenario 1 in which case the discharged phosphorus had the greatest impact this means that wastewater operators should focus on reducing the effluent discharge concentration of p rather than optimising resource recovery with a change in water recipient me impacts did not decrease since the characterisation factor cf of nitrogen discharging into surface water is 1 in both the me and fe impact categories the lcia method recipe 2016 updated cf of tn in surface water from 1 to 0 2968 in the me category which reduced me impacts by up to 67 across alternatives fig h2 si h electricity mix was fundamental in determining whether novel technologies performed better than the baseline p2h for biogas upgrading running with a share of 21 fossil based electricity scenario 2 increased cc te and fossil resource depletion impacts equalising or worsening impacts compared to rf baseline fig h1 si h a 100 wind power based electricity provision for all requirements scenario 3 decreased climate change impacts across alternatives assuming that sludge ash treatment for p recovery utilised hydrochloric acid as a waste by product scenario 5 reduced dar rb impacts of the last three alternatives compared to the baseline 3 4 total economic value added with the implementation of new technologies for resource recovery and pollution control the tva decreased from 0 23 to a minimum 0 18 m 3 for the pre filtration and anammox alternatives fig 4 e rf baseline and rf n2o showed the highest tva which reflects that by product revenues did not counterbalance the increased costs of implementing resource recovery implementing real time n2o control rf n2o reduced the available surplus refunded to the water user by less than 0 2 across alternatives water user va contributed between 68 and 85 of the tva fig 4 e the state government was the second highest contributor to the tva between 12 and 15 while the p recovery company contributed only 0 8 in the last three alternatives implementing sludge ash treatment and p recovery the concept of full cost recovery defines the va of the wastewater operator to zero fig 4 b any change in operation and investment cost is reflected in the actual wastewater fee paid by the water user revenues from the sale of by products bio methane neo methane and heat and from expected wastewater fees generated a surplus available surplus in fig 4 b costs of implementing resource recovery technologies reduced the surplus by between 13 and 19 except for rf n2o which solely implemented n2o measurements and control the water user domain always showed a positive va due to the expected wastewater fee ewwf being 0 44 m 3 and 36 to 45 higher than actual wastewater fees awwfs in all alternatives including the baseline fig a the va of the state and p recovery company was only affected by a change in the last three alternatives rf n2o ch4 p rf n2o ch4 p ax due to sludge ash treatment for phosphate recovery and anammox affecting pollution taxes 3 4 1 economic performance of novel technologies 3 4 1 1 p2h and biological biogas upgrading the bio methanation plant coupled with p2h rf n2o ch4 increased the totex capex opex by 24 0 08 m 3 mainly caused by the significant cost of increased electricity consumption revenues from selling bio and neo methane and heat in the alternative rf n2o ch4 increased by 91 0 05 m 3 from the baseline but they did not counterbalance the costs of additional electricity consumption 0 06 m 3 drinking water 0 0006 m 3 and investments 0 01 m 3 in conclusion biogas upgrading increased wastewater fees and consequently reduced va for the water user 3 4 1 2 p recovery from sludge ashes by implementing p recovery from sludge ashes rf n2o ch4 p the wastewater operator avoided paying landfill taxes but did pay the p recovery company to perform the sludge ash treatment the wastewater operator s va and consequently the water user s va increased by 0 5 0 0009 m 3 while for the state it decreased by 13 0 004 m 3 in rf n2o ch4 p rf n2o ch4 p c and rf n2o ch4 p ax the p recovery company increased its profit by 0 002 m 3 overall the tva was 11 lower compared to rf baseline in this alternative primarily because the state decreased its va by 14 and this was not counterbalanced by the p recovery company s income 3 4 1 3 pre filtration for increased carbon harvesting additional pre filtration decreased the tva by 18 compared to the baseline and by an additional 6 compared to the bio methanation alternative this alternative rf n2o ch4 p c together with the last anammox alternative generated the lowest tva the additional loss of tva 0 01 m 3 was due to an increase in the totex which was not balanced by an increase in revenue from selling additional bio neo methane and heat 0 018 m 3 3 4 1 4 sidestream anaerobic ammonium oxidation plant the last and most complex alternative rf n2o ch4 p c ax required additional investments of 0 003 m 3 while operation costs reduced by 0 002 m 3 compared to previous alternatives due to anammox decreasing tn in the effluent and hence reducing pollution taxes 3 4 1 5 internalising co2 allowance prices our results suggest that increased wastewater management environmental performance beyond biogas production is not economically feasible in the current market internalising co2 eq emission costs using the current european allowance price of 25 ton co2 eq markets insider 2019 will decrease the tva by another 3 6 fig 4 e red markers but the alternative rf n2o will increase the tva by only 2 above rf baseline the limited influence on tva value suggests that the current european allowance price does not promote the reduction of co2 eq emissions 3 5 abatement cost for co2 eq emissions and p recovery costs 3 5 1 abatement cost for co2 eq emissions according to our evaluation it cost 2 ton co2 eq to reduce emissions with real time n2o control in the alternatives with enhanced biomethane production and carbon harvesting costs were 675 and 641 ton avoided co2 eq avoided table 5 including savings and revenues from resource recovery costs were reduced by 67 to 222 and 57 to 273 tons avoided co2 eq for the bio methanation plant and the pre filtration alternatives except for n2o control abatement costs with income and savings are nine to 16 times higher than the current european allowance price for co2 eq 3 5 2 p recovery costs the costs of p recovery in rf n2o ch4 p without and with savings and income were estimated at 0 56 and 0 14 kg p 1 respectively i e between two and 12 times less than the cost of p recovery in egle et al 2016 our p recovered price reported as ton mcp p2o5 was estimated at 238 ton mcp as p2o5 monocalcium phosphate and close to the 2019 market price of diammonium phosphate p fertiliser reported as 110 169 ton dap as p2o5 amis 2019 and the 2005 triple superphosphate as p2o5 price of 241 ton p2o5 wernet et al 2016 since the examined p recovery technology is under continuous development costs are expected to change over time 3 6 eco efficiency and decision support matrix our results showed that for the current case environmental improvements come with a financial cost and no alternatives are eco innovative however real time n2o control showed a similar economic performance to rf baseline and produced a visible reduction in cc impacts table 6 several technologies were placed in a trade off position in some impact categories e g rf n2o ch4 4 conclusions and final recommendations our study uncovered the environmental and economic potentials and drawbacks of retrofitting an existing energy efficient wastewater treatment plant into a full scale resource recovery facility the results revealed that not all novel technologies were able to reduce impacts in all lca categories and none of the retrofitting alternatives showed improved financial performance compared to the baseline n2o measurement and control seemed to be both environmentally sound and financially feasible by achieving a 40 reduction in n2o emissions and a 35 reduction in climate change cc impacts while decreasing economic value by only 0 2 compared to the baseline power to hydrogen and bio methanation could additionally decrease climate change and fossil impacts but only if excess wind power is used as background electricity the main strength of sludge ash treatment was in the high recovery of phosphorus 95 and improved lca performance by substituting the conventional production of monocalcium phosphate pre filtration replacing a physical primary clarification process was beneficial for decreasing climate change and fossil depletion impacts while anammox reduced marine eutrophication impacts reductions came at the cost of increased impacts in reserve base resource depletion dar rb and potentially increased n2o emissions all alternatives showed a positive added economic value 0 18 0 23 m 3 although novel technologies increased capex and opex and tva decreased compared to the baseline except for rf n2o in our case abatement costs for co2 eq reduction and p recovery were in the range 2 957 ton co2 eq avoided and 140 and 561 ton p recovered our findings provide a clear understanding of the possible hotspots and trade offs of novel technologies for wastewater treatment and resource recovery the study will help decision makers understand system performance according to environmental and economic criteria to uncover the full socio economic benefits of implementing ghg control and resource recovery other criteria including the effect of non marketed values will need attention in future studies credit authorship contribution

16622,to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resource recovery many wastewater treatment operators are retrofitting existing plants to implement new technologies for energy nutrient and carbon recovery in literature there is a lack of studies that can unfold the potential environmental and economic impacts of the transition that wastewater utilities are undertaking to transform their treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs when existing literature studies are mostly based on simulations rather than real plant data and pilot scale results this study combines life cycle assessment and economic evaluations to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of retrofitting an existing wastewater treatment plant wwtp which already implements energy recovery into a full scale wrrf with a series of novel technologies the majority of which are already implemented full scale or tested through pilot scales we evaluate five technology alternatives against the current performance of the wwtp real time n2o control biological biogas upgrading coupled with power to hydrogen phosphorus recovery pre filtration carbon harvest and enhanced nitrogen removal our results show that real time n2o control biological biogas upgrading and pre filtration lead to a decrease in climate change and fossil resource depletion impacts the implementation of the real time measurement and control of n2o achieved the highest reduction in direct co2 eq emissions 35 with no significant impacts in other environmental categories biological biogas upgrading contributed to counterbalancing direct and indirect climate change impacts by substituting natural gas consumption and production pre filtration increased climate change reduction by 13 while it increased impacts in other categories enhanced sidestream nitrogen removal increased climate change impacts by 12 but decreased marine eutrophication impacts by 14 the reserve base resource depletion impacts however were the highest in the plant configurations implementing biological biogas upgrading coupled with power to hydrogen environmental improvements generated economic costs for all alternatives except for real time n2o control the results expose possible environmental and economic trade offs and hotspots of the journey that large wastewater treatment plants will undertake in transitioning into resource recovery facilities in the coming years graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pollution control nutrients recovery biomethane easetech added value abatement costs 1 introduction only a decade ago wastewater was considered a serious environmental and health problem while it is now increasingly valued as a resource in many parts of the world larsen 2015 mo and zhang 2013 van der hoek et al 2016 wastewater is rich in nutrients and when discharged untreated into receiving water bodies severe eutrophication problems can occur additionally efficient biological treatment processes demand energy and incomplete nitrification denitrification can lead to unwanted emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o 265 times more powerful than co2 myhre et al 2013 the role of wastewater treatment plants wwtps currently transforms from removal of nitrogen n phosphorus p and organic materials into integrated resource recovery and pollution control the majority of the removed phosphorus and part of the removed nitrogen ends up in residual wastewater sludge which is therefore important to valorise when moving towards wastewater treatment integrated with resource recovery there are many ways of valorising the sludge e g through anaerobic digestion to produce biogas and subsequent use of the degassed sludge as fertiliser on soil morero et al 2017 pfluger et al 2019 however high levels of heavy metals in sludge may limit its applicability as a fertiliser jensen and jepsen 2005 consequently four major danish wwtps incinerate degassed sludge and dispose of its ashes in landfills worldwide technologies are now being developed for energy recovery biogas electricity heat and for recovering phosphorus e g hukari et al 2016 heavy metals and sand from sludge ashes to recycle p in its mineral form and reduce the consumption of conventional feed phosphate chemicals and silica sand respectively easymining 2020 due to these benefits the circular economy is high on the agenda of wastewater utilities and it is believed to be the right strategy for reaching resource energy and co2 neutrality e g danish epa 2020 smart plant 2021 hence major danish wastewater utilities aim to retrofit their wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs such as the varga project in copenhagen biofos 2021 increasing circularity and reducing environmental impacts require investments and may decrease economic value for affected stakeholders resource recovery technologies may also produce environmental burden shifts i e decreasing ghg emissions while increasing the effects of other environmental impact categories hence holistic assessments are needed researchers currently use life cycle assessment lca and life cycle costing lcc to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of conventional wastewater treatment e g mcnamara et al 2016 niero et al 2014 and a best practice guide has been published corominas et al 2020 lorenzo toja et al 2016 used lca and lcc to provide an eco efficiency assessment iso 14045 2012 of 22 conventional spanish wwtps our review of recent existing studies on the subject table 1 illustrates that authors with few exceptions tian et al 2020 have approached the problem either from an environmental delre et al 2019 fang et al 2016 guven et al 2018 hao et al 2019 kehrein et al 2020 pradel and aissani 2019 or an economic viewpoint boiocchi et al 2017 riley et al 2020 to our knowledge the majority of economic and environmental assessments of resource recovery facilities have been based on literature studies e g hao et al 2019 or pilot and lab scale experiments guven et al 2018 pradel and aissani 2019 tian et al 2020 carried out a combined economic and environmental assessment of a full scale wrrf including thermal energy recovery from effluent the pyrolysis of sludge and combined heat and power generation the study focused on a state of the art north american wwtp and covered the full life cycle albeit without considering methane losses and laughing gas emissions from the plant the study built upon proposed design scenarios and not the actual implementation due to the numerous options for retrofitting wwtps we hypothesise that the true impacts of resource recovery facilities need to be uncovered from several real life and full scale retrofitting cases therefore as a novelty we provide a combined environmental and economic assessment of technological advancements on an existing state of the art energy efficient wwtp by 2025 the plant will be a full scale energy and resource recovery facility that valorises waste by products and reduces ghg emissions retrofitting covers five alternatives to recover nutrients and energy and reduce emissions compared to a business as usual baseline wwtp in 2025 the novelty of our study relies therefore not only on the combined environmental and economic assessment of integrated resource recovery and pollution control measures but also on the reduced uncertainty in the data input that are mostly based on real plant data and pilot scale results our results provide insights into the potential hotspots and trade offs that come as a consequence of a new benchmark for efficient wastewater management the study aims to answer four important research questions is the transition from currently operating wwtps to wrrfs environmentally and economically sustainable who are the major affected stakeholders and how do retrofitted wwtps change economic value across stakeholders where are the main hotspots and uncertainties for an environmentally and economically sustainable wrrf are there trade offs between environmental and economic impacts or between different environmental categories 2 materials and methods we combined an environmental impact assessment with an economic value evaluation using a standardised eco efficiency framework iso 14045 2012 the environmental impact assessment was performed through lca while the system value was expressed in total value added tva supplemented by estimated abatement costs of co2 eq emissions and phosphorus recovery costs 2 1 goal scope and functional unit the main goal of the study was to assess the environmental and economic performances of technological advancements in wrrf compared to a wwtp baseline in 2025 the treatment of 1 m3 of wastewater up to legally defined discharge limits of tn tp cod bod for a period of 50 years constitutes the functional unit fu which is relevant for comparing treatment alternatives with the same wastewater inlet composition wastewater composition of aved√∏re wwtp is predominantly municipal industrial wastewater 10 further details about wastewater characteristics and discharge limits are reported in si a 2 2 case study

assuming that biogas production by 2025 will be upgraded for city gas distribution rf baseline includes mechanical treatment and activated sludge for nitrogen removal followed by phosphorus chemical removal the sludge is anaerobically digested to produce biogas cleaned with amine scrubbing while the dewatered sludge is incinerated and then landfilled our retrofitting alternatives table 2 make incremental improvements in resource and emission removal efficiency for the reference wwtp rf baseline rf n2o augments rf baseline with real time monitoring and control of n2o production and emissions from biological processes rf n2o ch4 includes biological upgrading bio methanation of the biogas for increased methane production in combination with a power to hydrogen p2h technology rf n2o ch4 p adds sludge ash treatment to recover phosphorus including co production of ferric chloride aluminium hydroxide and sand rf n2o ch4 p c substitutes the existing primary clarifier with new pre filtration built in dewatering technology for increased carbon cod harvesting and subsequently higher net methane production gavala et al 2003 finally rf n2o ch4 p c ax improves n removal using anammox in the sidestream reject flow of the dewatering process to alleviate activated sludge system load 2 2 2 system boundaries foreground processes included wastewater influent treatment sludge

the foreground system hauschild et al 2018 fig 1 2 3 data inventory tva lca life cycle inventory and cost data were based on results from the pilot scale full scale implementation water utility

energy agency 2018 that forecasts sources of energy production and consumption in denmark up to 2030 given the uncertainty behind the energy sector s actual development we used a scenario analysis for the energy mix to explore how a changed pathway for future power generation could affect the results further details regarding the modelled electricity and heat mixes can be found in si b 2 4 environmental impact assessment lca lca modelling followed an attributional framework since all the scenarios are multifunctional systems we performed system expansion by crediting recovered resources such as biogas and heat production and export and the substitution of conventional feed phosphate sand and chemicals production avoided impacts in conventional background processes were credited as a

scale ec jrc 2010 laurent et al 2014 most background processes were downloaded from ecoinvent database version 3 5 along with the allocation at the point of substitution system model approach wernet et al 2016 that fits our choice of modelling the alternatives with an attributional framework a complete database with the selected ecoinvent processes and inventory data for this system model is reported in the si b1 b6 modelling of the impact assessment was performed with easetech v 3 3 7 clavreul et al 2014 that is an lca software that allows for tracking water mass balances and substance flows across the different treatment steps the ilcd method provides 15 impact categories ec jrc 2010 we chose to limit the reporting to six particularly relevant categories namely climate change cc terrestrial eutrophication te freshwater eutrophication fe marine eutrophication me depletion of abiotic resources fossil dar f and reserve base dar rb a primary screening for selecting categories was carried out by estimating normalised impacts normalisation to person equivalents pe followed ilcd guidelines ec jrc 2010 and normalisation references are reported in table c 1 si c with a thorough justification of the reasons behind the inclusion and exclusion of categories from the main text table c 1 si c si e provides results of the remaining eight categories 2 5 economic assessment mapping stakeholders economically affected by the implemented alternatives revealed the system s internal cash flows fig 2 iso 14045 for eco efficiency does not suggest a specific economic assessment method but it does propose defining value creation through economic indicators similar to angelis dimakis et al 2016 we evaluated economic impacts as the total value added tva 1 tv a a n s 1 va s v a water user v a waste water operator v a p recovery company v a state 2 5 1 system value chain definition tva tva is the sum of the economic value added va for each assessed stakeholder s in alternative a eq 1 the economic value of the water user vaw ater user is defined as the expected wastewater fee ewwf minus the actual wastewater fee awwf for each of the implemented alternatives 2 v a water user ewwf awwf ewwf represents the wastewater fee expected by the consumer and was based on the average fee paid in 2016 2018 excluding fee contributions to sewers and administration si d1 ewwf can be considered a proxy of the willingness of the water user to pay angelis dimakis et al 2016 awwf represents the actual fee to be paid in an alternative strict cost recovery scheme i e awwf equals the reimbursement needed to cover the difference between the wastewater operator s income from selling by products and total capital and operation costs in each alternative 3 awwf incom e saleby products capex opex waste water operator the va of the wastewater operator is zero following the principle of full cost recovery sludge ash treatment and p recovery create value for the p recovery company 4 v a p recovery company income capex opex the wastewater operator pays pollution and landfilling taxes to the state and hence a value added is included for the state 5 v a state landfill taxes effluent poll ution taxes 2 5 2 abatement costs for co2 eq emissions and p recovery costs abatement costs for carbon dioxide emissions and recovered phosphorus were calculated by considering the total costs revenues and savings induced by the alternative relative to avoided co2 eq emissions and p recovery more details are reported in si d2 2 6 data quality framework data quality revision dqr was performed with a pedigree matrix using five data quality categories weidema and wesn√¶s 1996 an average data quality rating score adq was calculated and then reported against sensitivity ratios for selected parameters to identify the most uncertain and sensitive parameters for a monte carlo analysis si f 2 7 perturbation uncertainty and scenario analysis perturbation and uncertainty analyses were carried out for both environmental and economic evaluation a perturbation analysis was performed by increasing by 10 the parameters contributing more than 5 to environmental and economic impacts normalised sensitivity ratios were calculated as 6 n o r m a l i s e d s e n s i t i v i t y r a t i o a b s s r m a x a b s s r 7 sensitivity ratios sr delta results initial result delta parameter initial parameter an uncertainty analysis was performed on the most sensitive and uncertain parameters adq 4 by assigning an uncertainty range and probability distribution to the parameters si f g the parameters contribution to overall uncertainty was estimated according to bisinella et al 2016 and built into easetech to place our results in the context of varying external factors we provided a scenario analysis for alternate situations 1 wastewater effluent recipient changed from marine to freshwater 2 p2h electricity mix assumed to be 20 fossil power generation instead of excess wind power alone 3 wind power based electricity for all requirements 4 sand substitutes cement 5 the consumption of hcl for sludge ash dissolution for p recovery is considered lca burden free since the p recovery company can currently benefit from hcl produced as a by product at the kemira plant in sweden and 6 a scenario analysis of the tva results was performed by internalising co2 eq emissions using the current co2 european emission allowance 3 results and discussion the results present the environmental and economic impacts of the six alternative plant configurations the alternatives build sequentially upon each other adding another technology for each step from rf baseline until rf n2o ch4 p c ax 3 1 mass flow analysis throughout the alternatives the resource recovery facility treated approx 27 million m3 of wastewater with a load of 1300 ton tn year 193 ton tp year and a 16 484 ton cod year in each case around 77 of tn was converted into n2 n table 4 in the rf baseline 2 6 of the tn was converted into n2o n the majority of which was produced in biological processes during nitrification denitrification this factor 2 6 n2o n tninlet is approx two times higher than the recommended ipcc factor of 1 6 ipcc 2019 real time n2o control reduced markedly the conversion to 1 6 in the wrrf alternatives and this factor is more in line with ipcc 2019 recommended factor sidestream anammox implemented to reduce the nitrogen load from reject water might also have a severe effect on n2o emissions rf n2o ch4 p c ax i e 3 of the tn removed from reject water by anammox ended up as n2o n gas with experimental studies showing variations in the n2o n emission factor between 2 and 8 of tn removed by anammox andersen et al 2016 uri carre√±o 2016 we assumed that 3 of the tn removed from anammox was converted into n2o n in the alternative rf n2o ch4 p c ax so total n2o n emissions increased to 1 7 of tn 13 of tn sedimented in sludge and 8 ended up in the effluent in total 93 of tp ended in the sludge ashes and was either landfilled in the alternatives rf baseline rf n2o ch4 or recovered to produce high value products such as feed phosphate monocalcium phosphate mcp in the alternatives with p recovery p recovery recycled 95 of tp from the sludge ashes corresponding to approx 171 tons per year in the four alternatives namely rf baseline until rf n2o ch4 p 33 of the cod was converted in the biological activated sludge system while 34 was anaerobically digested and converted into energy i e biogas 60 ch4 40 co2 implementing primary filtration reduced cod availability in the activated sludge system but increased the cod available for anaerobic digestion by approx 8 rf n2o ch4 p c rf n2o ch4 p c ax the increase of cod in ad increased methane production compared to rf baseline 3 2 environmental impacts overall the five alternatives reduced climate change impacts compared to the baseline fig 3 the four alternatives rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p c ax also reduced their impacts compared to both rf baseline and rf n2o in the categories terrestrial eutrophication te and fossil depletion dar f impacts while freshwater eutrophication fe impacts were equally the highest for rf baseline rf n2o and rf n2o ch4 marine eutrophication me did not significantly vary across alternatives except for the last alternative implementing sidestream anammox only in the category reserve base resource depletion dar rb rf baseline showed lower impacts compared to rf n2o ch4 in 2025 the strategy to upgrade all biogas rather than having chp seemed to pay off to obtain negative fossil depletion impacts already in the baseline plant performance 0 23 mj m 3 although a higher reduction is produced by the other alternatives fig 3 3 2 1 climate change despite only 1 6 2 6 of tn table 4 emitted as n2o the climate change impacts were very large they decreased by between 35 and 59 compared to the baseline following the implementation of new technologies implementing real time n2o measurements and control as a first step decreased impacts by almost 40 compared to the baseline treatment plant performance without a significant increase of impacts in the other environmental categories 0 4 fig 3 for the uncertainty assessment we used a 30 60 reduction range based on previous full scale results chen et al 2019 we consider it a conservative estimate of long term reduction because the future optimisation of real time controls e g increasing suspended solids in the aeration tanks may decrease n2o emissions even further implementing bio methanation for biogas upgrading rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p c ax had a beneficial effect on both reducing climate change up to 0 13 kg co2 eq m 3 and avoiding fossil resource depletion up to 2 4 mj m 3 avoidance of natural gas extraction and combustion however it increased reserve base resource depletion impacts 93 increase fig 3 implementing pre filtration induced an additional 13 reduction in co2 emissions compared to the previous alternative however installing pre filters may increase the production and emission of n2o as the filters will harvest more cod that is needed for denitrification adding artificial carbon sources could counterbalance this negative effect the potential increase in n2o and the use of artificial carbon sources such as methanol has not yet been established so they are not included herein the alternatives implementing p recovery and anammox rf n2o ch4 p and rf n2o ch4 p c ax increased climate change impacts by 4 and 12 compared to the previous alternative more efficient nitrification denitrification with anammox increased n2o emissions and used additional electricity as also reported by fenu et al 2019 as studied by andersen et al 2016 and uri carre√±o 2016 in another danish wwtp up to 8 of the tn removed by anammox can be emitted as n2o herein we assumed that 3 of tn removed from anammox would end up as n2o hence the increase in climate change impacts in this last alternative 3 2 2 terrestrial eutrophication te impacts primarily stemmed from the onsite incineration of sludge ashes while a negative contribution was made by avoided nitrogen oxides nox during natural gas combustion avoided heat production and the substitution of conventional monocalcium phosphate mcp production te impacts decreased along with the increased implementation of pollution control and resource recovery technology 11 to 6 except for rf n2o with the same impacts as rf baseline p recovery rf n2o ch4 p rf n2o ch4 p c ax induced a net increase of 2 of te impacts as impacts from using chemicals and electricity exceeded impacts avoided from substituting conventional mcp production however overall te impacts were still lower than rf baseline 3 2 3 freshwater eutrophication fe impacts were primarily induced by chemicals and electricity consumption in the baseline treatment plant and increased following the implementation of novel technologies by up to 22 p recovery implementation increased fe impacts by 7 compared to rf n2o ch4 as impacts avoided from the beneficiation of phosphate rocks could not counterbalance the impacts from consumption chemicals and electricity needed for the sludge ash treatment to recover phosphorus on the positive side in alternatives with p recovery only 5 of the total p sludge ashes ended up being landfilled against 95 in alternatives without p recovery i e rf baseline rf n2o rf n2o ch4 table 4 the last two alternatives specifically rf n2o ch4 p c increased fe impacts by an additional 11 due to the additional consumption of iron chloride and polymer for pre filtration 3 2 4 marine eutrophication across alternatives more than 95 of the me impacts were caused by discharging nitrogen in the effluent no marked changes of me impacts were seen when implementing novel technologies up to 2 except for the alternative implementing anammox 16 compared to baseline the discharged concentration of nitrogen across alternatives was 51 lower than the permitted discharge limit of 8 mg l tn however the anammox plant decreased total nitrogen in the effluent by an additional 15 3 2 5 fossil resource depletion fossil resource depletion impacts decreased following the implementation of new technologies increasing the production and export of bio and neo methane avoided extracting approx 3 2 million nm3 natural gas yearly in the alternatives rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p pre filtration rf n2o ch4 p c rf n2o ch4 p c ax additionally increased biogas production and hence the amount of upgraded biogas to natural gas by 18 with total annual biogas production of approx 3 7 million of nm3 the alternative rf n2o ch4 p increased dar f impacts by 6 due to chemicals required for the dissolution of sludge ashes and the separation of p fe and al 3 2 6 resource depletion reserve base as opposed to fossil impacts dar rb impacts generated a burden to the environment in all alternatives except for rf n2o ch4 p the alternative rf n2o ch4 increased impacts by 93 compared to rf baseline and rf n2o electrolysers for hydrogen production rf n2o ch4 rf n2o ch4 p c ax consumed two times more electricity than the entire baseline plant operation table 3 p2h technology used excess wind power for electrolysis that affected the dar rb category due to the production of wind turbines requiring minerals from the ground such as indium the electricity mix is therefore of primary importance when designing a strategy for reducing co2 eq emissions in the alternative rf n2o ch4 p phosphorus is recovered in its mineral form and its dar rb impacts reduced by 118 compared to the baseline thanks to substituting conventional mcp aluminium hydroxide iron chloride and sand production that counterbalance additional impacts from additional chemical and heat consumption pre filtration rf n2o ch4 p c induced an additional 273 increase in impacts compared to the previous alternative however net impacts were still 68 lower compared to the baseline the increase was due to additional equipment and the use of iron chloride and polymers polymer for the dewatering unit and iron chloride used as a flocculant dar rb impacts did not significantly increase due to the implementation of anammox 1 increase 3 3 scenario analysis lca the environmental performance for implementing novel technologies changed in different scenarios si h for example fe impacts increased if effluent was released into a freshwater body scenario 1 in which case the discharged phosphorus had the greatest impact this means that wastewater operators should focus on reducing the effluent discharge concentration of p rather than optimising resource recovery with a change in water recipient me impacts did not decrease since the characterisation factor cf of nitrogen discharging into surface water is 1 in both the me and fe impact categories the lcia method recipe 2016 updated cf of tn in surface water from 1 to 0 2968 in the me category which reduced me impacts by up to 67 across alternatives fig h2 si h electricity mix was fundamental in determining whether novel technologies performed better than the baseline p2h for biogas upgrading running with a share of 21 fossil based electricity scenario 2 increased cc te and fossil resource depletion impacts equalising or worsening impacts compared to rf baseline fig h1 si h a 100 wind power based electricity provision for all requirements scenario 3 decreased climate change impacts across alternatives assuming that sludge ash treatment for p recovery utilised hydrochloric acid as a waste by product scenario 5 reduced dar rb impacts of the last three alternatives compared to the baseline 3 4 total economic value added with the implementation of new technologies for resource recovery and pollution control the tva decreased from 0 23 to a minimum 0 18 m 3 for the pre filtration and anammox alternatives fig 4 e rf baseline and rf n2o showed the highest tva which reflects that by product revenues did not counterbalance the increased costs of implementing resource recovery implementing real time n2o control rf n2o reduced the available surplus refunded to the water user by less than 0 2 across alternatives water user va contributed between 68 and 85 of the tva fig 4 e the state government was the second highest contributor to the tva between 12 and 15 while the p recovery company contributed only 0 8 in the last three alternatives implementing sludge ash treatment and p recovery the concept of full cost recovery defines the va of the wastewater operator to zero fig 4 b any change in operation and investment cost is reflected in the actual wastewater fee paid by the water user revenues from the sale of by products bio methane neo methane and heat and from expected wastewater fees generated a surplus available surplus in fig 4 b costs of implementing resource recovery technologies reduced the surplus by between 13 and 19 except for rf n2o which solely implemented n2o measurements and control the water user domain always showed a positive va due to the expected wastewater fee ewwf being 0 44 m 3 and 36 to 45 higher than actual wastewater fees awwfs in all alternatives including the baseline fig a the va of the state and p recovery company was only affected by a change in the last three alternatives rf n2o ch4 p rf n2o ch4 p ax due to sludge ash treatment for phosphate recovery and anammox affecting pollution taxes 3 4 1 economic performance of novel technologies 3 4 1 1 p2h and biological biogas upgrading the bio methanation plant coupled with p2h rf n2o ch4 increased the totex capex opex by 24 0 08 m 3 mainly caused by the significant cost of increased electricity consumption revenues from selling bio and neo methane and heat in the alternative rf n2o ch4 increased by 91 0 05 m 3 from the baseline but they did not counterbalance the costs of additional electricity consumption 0 06 m 3 drinking water 0 0006 m 3 and investments 0 01 m 3 in conclusion biogas upgrading increased wastewater fees and consequently reduced va for the water user 3 4 1 2 p recovery from sludge ashes by implementing p recovery from sludge ashes rf n2o ch4 p the wastewater operator avoided paying landfill taxes but did pay the p recovery company to perform the sludge ash treatment the wastewater operator s va and consequently the water user s va increased by 0 5 0 0009 m 3 while for the state it decreased by 13 0 004 m 3 in rf n2o ch4 p rf n2o ch4 p c and rf n2o ch4 p ax the p recovery company increased its profit by 0 002 m 3 overall the tva was 11 lower compared to rf baseline in this alternative primarily because the state decreased its va by 14 and this was not counterbalanced by the p recovery company s income 3 4 1 3 pre filtration for increased carbon harvesting additional pre filtration decreased the tva by 18 compared to the baseline and by an additional 6 compared to the bio methanation alternative this alternative rf n2o ch4 p c together with the last anammox alternative generated the lowest tva the additional loss of tva 0 01 m 3 was due to an increase in the totex which was not balanced by an increase in revenue from selling additional bio neo methane and heat 0 018 m 3 3 4 1 4 sidestream anaerobic ammonium oxidation plant the last and most complex alternative rf n2o ch4 p c ax required additional investments of 0 003 m 3 while operation costs reduced by 0 002 m 3 compared to previous alternatives due to anammox decreasing tn in the effluent and hence reducing pollution taxes 3 4 1 5 internalising co2 allowance prices our results suggest that increased wastewater management environmental performance beyond biogas production is not economically feasible in the current market internalising co2 eq emission costs using the current european allowance price of 25 ton co2 eq markets insider 2019 will decrease the tva by another 3 6 fig 4 e red markers but the alternative rf n2o will increase the tva by only 2 above rf baseline the limited influence on tva value suggests that the current european allowance price does not promote the reduction of co2 eq emissions 3 5 abatement cost for co2 eq emissions and p recovery costs 3 5 1 abatement cost for co2 eq emissions according to our evaluation it cost 2 ton co2 eq to reduce emissions with real time n2o control in the alternatives with enhanced biomethane production and carbon harvesting costs were 675 and 641 ton avoided co2 eq avoided table 5 including savings and revenues from resource recovery costs were reduced by 67 to 222 and 57 to 273 tons avoided co2 eq for the bio methanation plant and the pre filtration alternatives except for n2o control abatement costs with income and savings are nine to 16 times higher than the current european allowance price for co2 eq 3 5 2 p recovery costs the costs of p recovery in rf n2o ch4 p without and with savings and income were estimated at 0 56 and 0 14 kg p 1 respectively i e between two and 12 times less than the cost of p recovery in egle et al 2016 our p recovered price reported as ton mcp p2o5 was estimated at 238 ton mcp as p2o5 monocalcium phosphate and close to the 2019 market price of diammonium phosphate p fertiliser reported as 110 169 ton dap as p2o5 amis 2019 and the 2005 triple superphosphate as p2o5 price of 241 ton p2o5 wernet et al 2016 since the examined p recovery technology is under continuous development costs are expected to change over time 3 6 eco efficiency and decision support matrix our results showed that for the current case environmental improvements come with a financial cost and no alternatives are eco innovative however real time n2o control showed a similar economic performance to rf baseline and produced a visible reduction in cc impacts table 6 several technologies were placed in a trade off position in some impact categories e g rf n2o ch4 4 conclusions and final recommendations our study uncovered the environmental and economic potentials and drawbacks of retrofitting an existing energy efficient wastewater treatment plant into a full scale resource recovery facility the results revealed that not all novel technologies were able to reduce impacts in all lca categories and none of the retrofitting alternatives showed improved financial performance compared to the baseline n2o measurement and control seemed to be both environmentally sound and financially feasible by achieving a 40 reduction in n2o emissions and a 35 reduction in climate change cc impacts while decreasing economic value by only 0 2 compared to the baseline power to hydrogen and bio methanation could additionally decrease climate change and fossil impacts but only if excess wind power is used as background electricity the main strength of sludge ash treatment was in the high recovery of phosphorus 95 and improved lca performance by substituting the conventional production of monocalcium phosphate pre filtration replacing a physical primary clarification process was beneficial for decreasing climate change and fossil depletion impacts while anammox reduced marine eutrophication impacts reductions came at the cost of increased impacts in reserve base resource depletion dar rb and potentially increased n2o emissions all alternatives showed a positive added economic value 0 18 0 23 m 3 although novel technologies increased capex and opex and tva decreased compared to the baseline except for rf n2o in our case abatement costs for co2 eq reduction and p recovery were in the range 2 957 ton co2 eq avoided and 140 and 561 ton p recovered our findings provide a clear understanding of the possible hotspots and trade offs of novel technologies for wastewater treatment and resource recovery the study will help decision makers understand system performance according to environmental and economic criteria to uncover the full socio economic benefits of implementing ghg control and resource recovery other criteria including the effect of non marketed values will need attention in future studies credit authorship contribution

16623,hydrodynamic cavitation is a popular advanced oxidation technique and it has received wide range of applications from waste water treatment to the nanoparticles synthesis in recent years the enhancement of the intensity of the hydrodynamic cavitation is always been an emerging field of research within this framework we have proposed and investigated three distinct strategies to enhance

al 2009 for instance waste water treatment chemical synthesis process intensification food sectors nanoparticles synthesis capocelli et al 2020 carpenter et al 2017 gogate 2011 gƒÖgol et al 2018 manickam and ashokkumar 2014 ozonek 2012 ranade et al 2021 zhou et al 2009 the hydrodynamic cavitation offers good scalability and energy efficiency for large scale production more recently hydrodynamic cavitation was also used to generate nano scale bubbles oliveira et al 2018 broadly hydrodynamic cavitation describes the generation of tiny cavities upon reduction of the pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid one of the distinguishing features of hydrodynamic cavitation is the growth and collapse of the cavities leading to the formation of free radicals these free radicals are responsible for the chemical reactions during hydrodynamic cavitation this approach is widely used in advanced oxidation processes fedorov et al 2020 sun et al 2021 hydrodynamic cavitation not only offers oxidation of organic compounds ambulgekar et al 2005 saharan et al 2012 but also enhances the production of bio diesel chuah et al 2015 kelkar et al 2008 maddikeri et al 2014 hydrodynamic cavitation with addition of external oxidants like hydrogen peroxide is also reported to be an effective sterilization technique jyoti and pandit 2003 numerous cavitating devices have been used for the hydrodynamic cavitation the widely used geometries are venturi type devices single and multiple hole orifices vortex based cavitation devices etc venturi type cavitating devices are more simple and extensively used as flow measuring devices among others owing to the fast pressure recovery in an orifice the cavitation phenomena is often periodic and transient while in a venturi the cavitation is observed to be stable because of its diverging wall configuration however the orifice based geometries has a unique advantage as the multiple orifices can be designed on a single plate therefore the intensity of hydrodynamic cavitation can be tuned by manipulating the number of orifices on a plate the cavitating zone in an orifice occurs only at the edge of the throat section whereas in a venturi the cavitating zone expands toward the diverging section the rapid pressure recovery in a orifice device leads to generate relatively less number of cavities on the other hand sluggish pressure recovery in a venturi based device is expected to generate more cavities simpson and ranade 2019a venturi type devices are widely studied both numerically and experimentally due to their simple construction the early experimental work was based on the high speed imaging of the flow field for instance sato et al 2003 reported the dependence of dissolved gas and tensile strength of water on incipient characteristics of the cavitation similarly a high speed photography technique was used to investigate the effect of cavitation number on the flow pattern by sayyaadi 2010 they reported a periodic separation shedding and collapse of the cavities at low cavitation numbers at the same time simple sinusoidal fluctuations were observed at high cavitation numbers stutz and reboud 1997 reported void fraction and velocity distribution experimentally particle image velocimetry piv and high speed photography were used by gopalan and katz 2000 to examine the structure of sheet cavitation and reported detailed results on velocity and void fraction distribution the wall pressure fluctuation characteristics were experimentally investigated by chen et al 2015 the cavitating flows exhibit several types of cavitation behavior for instance cavitation inception sheet cloud cavitation etc besides the intensity of the pressure fluctuation enhances at the low value of the cavitation number on the other hand it decreases significantly at a higher cavitation number this observation is found to be consistent with that of sayyaadi 2010 furthermore a linear relationship between cavity length and pressure ratio or cavitation number was reported by long et al 2017 more recently liu et al 2020 reported the cavity behavior and wall static pressure characteristics in a rectangular venturi according to liu et al 2020 the cavity shedding was classified into three types namely 1 front shedding 2 central shedding and 3 tail shedding the average cavity length have a linear dependence on the cavitation number on the other hand the average cavity length increases by lowering the divergent angle these findings were seen to be inline with long et al 2017 in comparison with experimental studies scant numerical studies have been reported for instance shi et al 2019 utilized a two phase mixture model and reported detailed results on vapor fraction pressure loss coefficient and critical reynolds number as a function of geometric parameters the effect of a scale up ratio is also investigated and reported that the maximum turbulent viscosity ratio shows a proportional relation with the scale ratio shi et al 2020 also performed a 2d axisymmetric rans and 3d les turbulent simulations in a cavitating venturi rans solutions predicted a low rate of vapor production in comparison to les simulations dastane et al 2019 solved the flow field by mixture model and further integrated using discrete phase model dpm to predict the cavities trajectories furthermore a keller miksis equation for cavity dynamics was solved based on pressure and turbulence data from dpm simulations the cavity dynamics were described using the bubble radius collapse pressure and collapse temperature more recently simpson and ranade 2019b reported a detailed numerical investigation based on a two phase mixer model with dpm tracking of the cavities smaller divergent angles promote cavitation even at lower pressure ratios while higher divergent angles significantly reduce the cavitation inception furthermore the throat length l d variation doesn t affect the cavitation inception however relatively larger throat length delays the pressure recovery and perhaps such delay might have a role to play in controlling bubble growth and the collapse a detailed study on hydrodynamic cavitation in modified venturi was carried out by bashir et al 2011 five designs of the venturi namely circular slit annular ring annular slit and double annular slit were investigated cavity dynamics were studied by solving the rayleigh plesset equation using turbulent pressure fluctuation amplitude turbulence frequency and bulk pressure from the dpm tracking of the cavities a double annular slit venturi was observed to have the slowest recovery of the pressure therefore the cavitation zone and the intensity of collapse of cavities were significantly high in a double slit venturi similarly kuldeep and saharan 2016 reported the 3 d simulations on venturi and orifice devices with standard k œµ model from application viewpoint braeutigam et al 2012 investigated the degradation of pharmacetical compound carbamezapine by hydro acoustic cavitation method which is essentially a combination of hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation relatively fast degradation kinetics was observed owing to the synergy between hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation hydrodynamic cavitation generates micro and nanobubbles that can be collapsed by acoustic cavitation to enhance free radical generation similarly li et al 2014 reported removal of cyanobacteria like microcystis aeruginosa using hydrodynamic cavitation the algal cells were reported to be destroyed by orifice based cavitating device by up to 88 hydrodynamic cavitation is reported to be a sustainable technology for removal of algal blooms as it does not lead to a secondary pollution more recently the removal of viruses in the water is reported by kosel et al 2017 the plausible mechanism of inactivation of viruses due to the damage of host recognition receptors by oh radicals in addition high temperature and shear force during cavitation can also damage the cells from the discussion above it is reasonably clear that a voluminous body of knowledge is available dealing with cavitation in the venturi type device understanding the flow regimes vapor fraction cavity length as a function of convergent and divergent angle throat length and pressure ratio were reported on the other hand the possible strategy for enhancing cavitation through surface and geometrical modifications has not yet been studied this work focus on the following three strategies to enhance the intensity of hydrodynamic cavitation 1 by introducing the surface roughness on the wall 2 single or multiple circular hurdles in the diverging section 3 by modifying the diverging section from planer to the trumpet shape the surface roughness is introduced by modifying the log law at the wall by incorporating an additional constant as a function of roughness height k s and roughness constant c s the circular hurdles are introduced in the geometry of the venturi single or multiple hurdles have been drawn in the diverging section to investigate the cavitational activities in addition the shape of the diverging section is modified by using trumpet diverging wall the unique advantage of the trumpet diverging wall is the non linear variation of the area in the diverging section rather than the linear increase as in case of plane wall such non linear diverging wall is useful to maintain a low pressure region over the length of venturi for a plane venturi the effect of half convergent angle 15 20 half divergent angle 6 2 8 10 throat length 1 2 3 and pressure ratio 2 6 is varied several folds with and without the presence of surface roughness a detailed investigation on the flow field structure vapor volume fraction pressure loss coefficient and cavitation number is reported herein 2 problem formulation and governing equations consider a circular venturi see fig 1 a having diameter d and throat diameter d convergent angle Œ± divergent angle Œ≤ and throat length l as shown in fig 1 b the flow field is assumed to be axisymmetric and therefore the computational domain is a plane at Œ∏ 0 as shown in fig 1 c single or multiple hurdles are introduced in the diverging section characterized by width l t and distance from axis h a the distance between hurdles is given by l o for multiple circular hurdles as shown in fig 1 d furthermore in fig 1 e the diverging section is modified by changing the cross section area non linearly along the length using a trumpet shape geometry characterized by rate of change of the slope y 1 228 x 2 0 0161 x 0 0018 y 2 456 in all cases the diameter ratio d d is fixed to be 5 55 the upstream length l u d and downstream length l d d are 22 and 61 respectively a systematic domain independence studies were carried out for the choice of the upstream and downstream length the half convergent angle is chosen to be 6 5 15 20 half divergent angle is varied as 6 2 8 10 and the throat length l d is selected as 1 2 3 as noted earlier cavitation results from flow constrictions where the pressure falls below the liquid s vapor pressure in the downstream section of the venturi a dimensionless number so called cavitation number is often used to describe the cavitation phenomena and it is defined as follows saharan et al 2012 1 œÉ p p v t 1 2 œÅ v t h 2 where œÉ p p v t œÅ and v t h are the cavitation number fully recovered down stream pressure saturation pressure of the liquid density and throat velocity respectively cavitating flow occurs when œÉ 1 under ideal condition however the cavitating flow regime can also exist even at a cavitation number greater than one in practical situations where dissolved oxygen and other contamination present in the fluid the cavitation inception is often termed as a transition from a single phase flow to a two phase bubbly flow where the first cavity appears to form the corresponding cavitation number is called the inception cavitation number beyond the inception cavitation number flow fields are highly turbulent forms vapor cavities and eventually vapor cavity collapse numerical modeling of such complex flow fields is indeed challenging the most suitable approach to resolve the events at such multiple time and length scales is a direct numerical simulation dns however this approach is computationally costly the present work focuses on the effect of surface and geometrical modifications over a wide range of conditions and therefore reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach is used here k œâ s s t turbulence model is used because it has unique advantages in predicting flow separation and behavior in adverse pressure gradients therefore it is the most common turbulence model for the industrial flow with a large aspect ratio menter 1992 a mixture multi phase model that treats the fluid as a single fluid mixture of individual phases is utilized with an appropriate cavitation model the continuity and momentum equations for the mixture model are written as follow fluent 2013 2 1 flow and turbulence model continuity equation 2 œÅ m t œÅ m v i m x i 0

popular cavitation models namely singhal et al model singhal et al 2002 schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 and zwart et al model zwart et al 2004 singhal et al model singhal et al 2002 is often termed as a full cavitation model as this model accounts for the generation and transport of vapor bubbles pressure and velocity fluctuation and the effect of non condensible dissolved gases the rates of evaporation and condensation are are originated from the rayleigh plesset equation both singhal et al model singhal et al 2002 and schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 extensively used in the literature for instance dastane et al 2019 and simpson and ranade 2019b have used singhal et al 2002 whilst shi et al 2019 2020 and bi√ßer and sou 2016 utilized the schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 in this work the schnerr sauer cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 is used throughout the paper in schnerr sauer model the vapour volume fraction is computed from a transport equation for the vapor fraction as follows 9 Œ± v œÅ v t Œ± v œÅ v v i m x i r e r c Œ± v is the volume fraction of the vapor phase and œÅ v is the density of the vapor phase on the other hand r e and r c accounts for the mass source and sink due to evaporation and condensation during cavitation respectively the expression for r c and r e are written as follows 10 when p v p r e œÅ v œÅ l œÅ m Œ± v 1 Œ± v 3 r b 2 3 œÅ v œÅ l œÅ l 11 when p v p r c œÅ v œÅ l œÅ m Œ± v 1 Œ± v 3 r b 2 3 œÅ l œÅ v œÅ l where p is the fully recovered downstream pressure the bubble radius can be written as follows 12 r b 3 Œ± v 1 Œ± v 4 œÄ n b 1 3 the volume fraction of the vapor is given by 13 Œ± v v v v m n b 4 œÄ 3 r b 3 1 n b 4 œÄ 3 r b 3 where n b is the bubble number density and n b 10 13 is used in this work the saturation pressure p v is estimated by antoine equation written as follows 14 log p v a b t c where a b and c are the material specific constants in this work the vapor pressure p v 2338 pa is used over the range of conditions spanned here 2 3 boundary conditions the pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are used at inlet and outlet of the venturi respectively the total pressure at inlet is varied from 3 10 5 to 5 10 5 p a whereas the outlet static pressure is fixed to be 1 10 5 p a a no slip condition is imposed on the wall turbulent intensity and turbulent viscosity are prescribed to be 10 and 5 respectively the surface roughness parameters k s and c s are introduced as the boundary conditions on the wall the details of the wall roughness are described in the next section 2 4 wall surface roughness the effect of surface roughness is often incorporated by the modified law of the wall as follows blocken et al 2007 jim√©nez 2004 15 œÅ v p v œÑ w 1 Œ∫ ln e œÅ v y p Œº l Œ¥ b where v p is the component of velocity at y p the distance to the wall e 9 793 is the empirical constant v c Œº 1 4 k is the dynamic velocity for fully rough surface the additional constant Œ¥ b can be evaluated as follows 16 Œ¥ b 1 Œ∫ ln 1 c s k s where 17 k s œÅ k s v Œº l where c s is termed as roughness constant for spherical sand grains the value of c s is 0 5 on the other hand k s is the height of the roughness on the wall k s is the dimensionless roughness constant in this work c s and k s are varied as 0 5 0 1 and 0 1 mm respectively ansys fluent software is used to incorporate the governing equations boundary conditions and roughness conditions 3 numerical solution methodology the governing differential equations and boundary conditions are solved numerically using commercial solver ansys fluent version 16 0 to map the flow domain in terms of the velocity and volume fraction fields the geometry is created in the design modeler and triangular elements with non uniform spacing are generated using icem cfd a built in tool of ansys workbench a relatively finer mesh is generated near the wall to resolve the stiff velocity gradients pressure velocity coupling is carried out by a simple algorithm and pressure is discretized using the presto discretization scheme the spatial discretization of the volume fraction is chosen to be quadratic upwind interpolation for convection kinematics quick scheme the second order upwind scheme is used to discretize the momentum equation the first order implicit scheme is used in the rans model to discretize the time the total flow time of 0 05 seconds was completed for each simulation a relatively short time step Œ¥ t 1 10 5 is used to avoid the numerical oscillation in the solution all the numerical simulations are time dependent in nature and therefore the time history of variables like average vapor volume fraction throat velocity stream function are monitored and compared with the steady state simulations the results are seen to be fairly consistent in both steady and unsteady simulations the convergence criteria for the continuity and momentum equations are 10 7 used here a detailed grid and domain tests have been carried out to avoid numerical artifacts furthermore a detailed comparison with numerical and experimental data has been performed to ensure reliability and accuracy of present work 3 1 selection of numerical parameters accuracy and reliability of every numerical solution depend on the numerical parameters namely meshing and computational domain therefore in this case a systematic approach has been followed to reach their optimum values the velocity gradients are expected to be steep at a high value of pressure ratio therefore a grid independence study has been carried out at a pressure ratio p r 6 for both rough and smooth surfaces for this purpose three grids namely g1 elements 39666 g2 elements 83491 and g3 elements 132028 were prepared with minimum and maximum size of 6 71 10 2 mm and 0 2 mm respectively the mesh statistics are shown in table 1 the velocity profile and turbulent kinetic energy along the radial position at the throat section are compared for all grids see supplementary information fig sm 1 the resulting deviation between grid g2 and g3 is less than 1 therefore grid g2 is chosen for further computations over the range of conditions spanned here furthermore the domain independence test was carried out at a lower pressure ratio as the boundary layers expected to be long and thick the optimum value of the upstream length l u d 22 and downstream length l d d 61 were obtained after systematic studies on the radial velocity profile at the throat the range of geometrical parameters used in this work are reported in table 2 3 2 validation of results before presenting new results obtained here a benchmark comparison has been carried out with the numerical and experimental results from the literature for instance the effect of the pressure ratio on the volumetric flow rate is shown in fig 2 a a good agreement was observed with both numerical and experimental results report by shi et al 2019 similarly we also compared the numerical and experimental results on volumetric flow rate versus pressure ratio with that of simpson and ranade 2019b as shown in fig 2 b the numerical prediction and experimental results are found to be in close correspondence for a given set of range of conditions furthermore the mass flow rate versus the inverse of pressure ratio is compared with that of abdulaziz 2014 as shown in fig 2 c the percentage errors between experimental and numerical results are in the range of 5 13 in this case as evident from fig 2 c suffice to add here that present results were seen to be in good correspondence with shi et al 2019 and simpson and ranade 2019b while slightly higher deviation shows with that of abdulaziz 2014 such deviations between experimental and numerical results are not uncommon simpson and ranade 2019b also reported a similar deviation of numerical prediction with the experimental results of abdulaziz 2014 the plausible reason for such deviations could be the presence of dissolved non condensable gases and suspended solids in the fluid in a nutshell the present results agree with the numerical results and experimental results reported in the literature such validation with experimental and numerical results inspire confidence in present numerical calculations over the range of conditions encompassed here 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of surface roughness 4 1 1 flow characteristics the general features of the flow field are explained by investigating the velocity magnitude pressure contour stream functions especially in the close vicinity of the throat section these are useful not only for the visualization of the flow patterns but also for the formation of the cavitation zone in the diverging section of the flow domain fig 3 shows a representative velocity magnitude contours for different values of the divergent angles Œ≤ 6 2 8 10 for both smooth and rough wall surface at fixed value of the pressure ratio p r 5 since the conservation equation for the vapor volume fraction is solved using the velocity field therefore the prediction about the vapor volume fraction can be made by examining the flow characteristics at a low divergent angle the velocity decays slowly in the axial direction Œ≤ 6 2 see fig 3 for smooth surface while it decays a relatively faster at a high divergent angle this faster decay of the velocity is simply because the flow area increases with the divergent angle furthermore the effect of the rough and smooth surface on the velocity magnitude contour is also shown in fig 3 evidently for a rough surface the spatial decay of the velocity is sluggish compared to the smooth surface this effect can be seen more clearly by examining the velocity magnitude along the axial direction as shown in fig 4 from mechanical energy balance higher kinetic energy results in low pressure energy zone for a given amount of total energy therefore higher velocity magnitude zone also signifies the low pressure zone as evident from fig sm2 clearly the low pressure zone occurs at the throat and diverging section of the venturi and the area of the low pressure region increases with the pressure ratio furthermore the rough surfaces offer expanded zone of low pressure region with reference to the smooth surface this effect is in line with the fact that pressure energy losses in the rough surfaces are relatively higher than the smooth surface in other words the friction factor f 8 œÑ w œÅ v t h 2 for rough surfaces is significantly higher in comparison with the smooth surfaces as shown in table 3 therefore it is justified to have the slow decay of the velocity field and expanded low pressure region in the rough surface than the smooth surface as the pressure energy loss is higher in the rough surfaces the cavity expands isothermally at such a low pressure region later it collapses adiabatically to produce a cavitational event on the other hand the cavitation nuclei are expected to stay longer in a low pressure region due to the slow pressure recovery on the rough surfaces bashir et al 2011 however it is expected to grow more extensive than that in the smooth surfaces therefore the cavitational intensity is expected to be more in the rough surfaces than the smooth surfaces at a low pressure ratio i e low reynolds number inertia in the fluid is relatively small therefore fluid element can follow the changes in flow path without having any significant energy losses at a high pressure ratio i e high reynolds number the inertial force increases the fluid starts detaching from the surface of the venturi and this in turn forms the negative wake at the divergent sections of the flow domain see fig sm3 in supplementary material the recirculating zone thickens with an increasing pressure ratio the eye of the recirculating zone shifted downstream by increasing the pressure ratio for rough surfaces on the other hand the size of the recirculating zone observed lower for the rough surfaces furthermore the length of the recirculating zone decreases significantly with increasing divergent angle as noted earlier this effect is because the flow area increases with the diverging angle on the other hand the convergent angle does not affect the recirculating length significantly needless to say here that increasing throat length shifts the recirculating region downstream of the venturi the effect of surface roughness on the stream function contours is shown in fig sm4 the presence of surface roughness suppresses the propensity of flow separation the recirculating length was seen to be lower in rough surface than that of the smooth surfaces furthermore at a low diverging angle a series of satellite vortices forms and observed to vanish at a higher diverging angle the recirculating zone not only thickens with the diverging angle but also increases in length in summary surface roughness strengthens the flow field and forms a recirculating zone in the diverging section however the recirculating region was seen to decrease with increasing divergent angle the effect of surface roughness on pressure contour is investigated here the negative pressure region was seen to be larger in the rough surface than that in the smooth see fig sm5 in supplementary material this trend also indicates that pressure energy loss in the rough surfaces is more in comparison with smooth surfaces this effect is found to be in line with experimental results reported on hydrodynamic cavitation around hydrofoil hao et al 2018 the experimental results suggest that surface roughness significantly influences cloud cavitation three events namely cavity development the formation of the re entrant jet and growth shedding of cavities were reported in the presence of surface roughness during cavitation on a rough surface the cavity length was significantly higher than that on the smooth surface the present numerical results also predict the extended length of the negative pressure region downstream of the venturi which indirectly denotes a larger cavity length in rough surfaces 4 1 2 vapor volume fraction the vapor volume fraction indicates the cavitating region in the flow domain for both rough and smooth surfaces the vapor fraction decreases with a divergent angle as shown in fig 5 this effect is consistent with previous studies dastane et al 2019 simpson and ranade 2019b for the smooth surfaces on the other hand surface roughness significantly increases the vapor fraction irrespective of the divergent angle however these effects are more pronounced at a low divergent angle for instance Œ≤ 6 2 such a pronounced effect is because a rough surface offers more resistance to flow than a smooth surface and therefore the energy pressure losses are more in the rough surfaces therefore the cavitational yields in the rough surfaces are expected to be higher with respect to smooth surface for a fixed value of half convergent Œ± 6 2 and half divergent angle Œ≤ 6 2 the vapor volume fraction increases with throat length however the effect is not very significant see fig sm6 in supplementary material the plausible reason may be as the throat length only shifts the pressure recovery it neither delays nor fosters the pressure recovery this is seen to be inline with simpson and ranade 2019b the vapor volume fraction has a positive correlation with roughness height k s on the other hand it exhibits an inverse trend with a roughness constant c s the quantitative measure of vapor fraction is presented here in terms of average volume fraction defined as follows 18 œï v 1 v s Œ± v r z d v the vapor volume fraction increases with roughness height see fig sm7 in supplementary material however the effects are less pronounced at a low pressure ratio all in all roughness height enhances the vapor fraction maximum of three folds in comparison with the smooth surface however it is observed to have an inverse trend with the roughness constant this trend is justified as the surface roughness tends to non uniform with increasing roughness constant such enhancement in the vapor volume fraction in the presence of surface roughness is also inline with experimental results reported in hydrofoil hao et al 2018 the cavity area was reported to be enhanced by two folds in comparison with the smooth hydrofoil surfaces this trend is in agreement with the vapor volume fraction qualitatively reported in this work the sluggish pressure recovery in the rough surfaces leads to the enhancement in the cavitating zone compared to the smooth surfaces however the overall cavitational yield is gauged by the fraction of active cavities and energy vapor density bashir et al 2011 rough surfaces offer excellent vapor energy density and vapor volume but the lower active cavities for a fixed energy input the amount of vapor produced is more on rough surfaces which may lead to a slow collapse of the cavities the frictional losses in the rough surfaces are more indicated by the friction factor f 8 œÑ w œÅ v t h 2 shown in table 3 therefore slow pressure recovery is justified in the rough surfaces 4 1 3 pressure loss coefficient frictional losses from the surfaces is often represented in terms of pressure loss coefficient and it is defined as follows 19 k l 2 Œ¥ p œÅ v i n 2 where Œ¥ p is the pressure drop across the venturi and v i n is the average velocity at the inlet from the integral form of continuity equation v i n can be calculated as follows 20 v i n d 2 d 2 v t h where d and d are the inlet and throat diameter of the venturi respectively furthermore inlet reynolds number can be defined as follow 21 r e i n œÅ d v i n Œº l fig 6 represents the effect of pressure ratio p r roughness parameters c s k s throat length l d cavitation number œÉ and inlet reynolds number r e i n on pressure coefficient k l the average vapor fraction shows a positive correlation with the pressure ratio in other words the cavitating zone increases with the pressure ratio the energy loss due to cavitation can be seen in terms of the pressure loss coefficient as shown in fig 6 a pressure loss coefficient not only increases monotonically with pressure ratio but also with roughness height however the pressure loss coefficient decreases with an increase in the roughness constant see fig 6 b this trend suggests that the energy loss in the non uniform rough surface c s 0 5 is less compared to a uniformly distributed roughness c s 0 5 this effect can also be seen in the vapor volume fraction as it decreases with an increase in the roughness constant the pressure loss coefficient decreases monotonically with the divergent angle as shown in fig 6 c as noted earlier this is because the flow area increases in the diverging section with increasing angle and therefore results in lower frictional losses on the other hand the pressure loss coefficient follows an inverse trend with the convergent angle as shown in fig 6 d this effect is not surprising as the direction of the angle is opposite in this case furthermore increasing the value of the throat length offers less pressure loss as the effective length of the flow domain increases with throat length see fig 6 e and therefore the pressure drop per unit length decreases and thus the pressure loss coefficient lastly the pressure loss coefficient shows a linear inverse dependence with the cavitation number see fig 6 f and thereby leading to the conclusion that the cavitation zone directly proportional to the energy loss due to the friction and phase change for a fixed value of cavitation number the pressure loss in the rough surface is observed to be more than that in the smooth surfaces in a nutshell the vapor volume fraction shows a positive correlation with the pressure loss coefficient the increase in the roughness height leads to a higher pressure loss coefficient while the higher roughness constant offers relatively a low pressure loss these effects directly reflects in the vapor volume fraction contours shown in fig 5 4 1 4 discharge coefficient and cavitation number while the detailed streamline volume fraction contours and pressure loss coefficient provide useful information about the structure of the cavitating flow the discharge coefficient values are frequently needed to design the equipment in process engineering the discharge coefficient c d is defined as follows ebrahimi et al 2017 22 c d m a c t u a l m i d e a l where m a c t u a l is the mass flow rate of the cavitating flow and m i d e a l is the mass flow rate in the absence of frictional losses m i d e a l is defined as follows 23 m i d e a l a t h 2 œÅ Œ¥ p the actual mass flow rate is evaluated by following expression 24 m a c t u a l 2 œÄ 0 r œÅ v r d r fig sm8 shows the effect of cavitation number on the discharge coefficient the value of c d decreases with the cavitation number this trend is in line with the typical discharge coefficient trend with reynolds number hollingshead et al 2011 as the cavitation number exhibits the inverse dependence on reynolds number see fig sm 8 in supplementary material furthermore high surface roughness for instance k s 1 mm yields a lower discharge coefficient in comparison with smooth surface this effect is justified as rough surface produces more vapor volume and therefore the value of m a c t u a l for rough surface is expected to be lower than that of smooth surface therefore the discharge coefficient is expected to decrease from eq 22 besides the energy losses are higher on rough surfaces and therefore the discharge coefficient is expected to be lower on the rough surfaces as evident from fig sm8 4 2 effect of circular hurdles the conventional geometry is modified by introducing a single or multiple circular hurdles as shown in fig 1 d a detailed investigation is carried out and the salient features of the velocity and pressure fields and volume fraction contour are reported in fig 7 for various designs see table 4 clearly the vapor volume fraction increase by 86 from design 1 to design 2 furthermore while keeping the width and inter spacing distance constant the increase in the distance from axis does not enhance the vapor volume fraction significantly comparison between design 2 and design 3 this can be seen clearly in fig 7 a on the other hand increase in width while keeping the distance from the axis constant leads to decrease in the vapor volume fraction this is simply due to the fact that the increase in the width decreases the inter spacing distance the effect of number of hurdles is also investigated and it is found that the vapor volume fraction increases significantly only up to the second hurdles see supplementary material fig sm 9 such significant enhancement in the vapor volume fraction in presence of circular hurdles is possibly due to the formation of low pressure zone after each hurdles this effect can be seen in the pressure versus axial length plot in fig 7 b the pressure recovery is shown to be delayed significantly in presence of circular hurdles the pressure contour also corroborates this finding see supplementary material fig sm 10 the velocity magnitude along axial length increases significantly in presence of the circular hurdles as shown in fig 7 c clearly the available flow area decreases in presence of circular hurdles and thus it increases the velocity magnitude in summary the circular hurdles create a low pressure zone at the rear of the hurdles and this in turn responsible for enhanced vapor fraction with respect to the convectional venturi design 1 in addition circular hurdles are also responsible for higher velocity magnitude in the diverging section 4 3 effect of trumpet diverging wall in addition to surface roughness and circular hurdles the shape of the diverging section is also modified from the plane wall to the trumpet diverging wall the selection of the trumpet diverging section is due to the nonlinear change in the cross section along the length with respect to the plane wall in other words the flow area changes relatively slower along the diverging section in case of the trumpet wall with reference to a linear plane wall the important results on volume fraction pressure and velocity magnitude are shown in fig 8 clearly the vapor volume fraction increases by 150 at p r 3 and 27 at p r 5 such enhancement in the vapor volume fraction is due to the slow pressure recovery in the diverging section as evident from fig 8 b furthermore the slow pressure recovery translates into higher velocity magnitude in the diverging section as shown in fig 8 c the intensity of cavitation is often enhanced by decrease in the diverging angle Œ≤ see fig 5 the major challenging problem with decrease in the diverging angle Œ≤ is that it increases the length of the diverging section and thus the total length of the venturi this problem can be eliminated by using the trumpet diverging wall one can achieve the same intensity of cavitation at higher diverging angle as well by adjusting the rate of change of slope of the trumpet wall in summary the vapor volume fraction increases with the trumpet diverging wall with reference to the plane wall this effect is attributed due to the slower pressure recovery in the trumpet diverging wall 4 4 optimization of various designs the synergistic effects of surface roughness on various designs have presented by comparing the vapor volume fraction as shown in fig 9 design 1 represents a plane venturi design 2 3 and 4 represents the presence of circular hurdles and design 5 is the trumpet diverging section all else being equal the vapor volume fraction for single or multiple circular hurdles is higher than the plane and trumpet diverging wall venturi when the surface roughness is not present on the other hand the presence of surface roughness offers the maximum vapor volume fraction in design 5 among other designs where surface roughness contributes approximately 50 to the total vapor volume fraction similarly the contribution of surface roughness on design 1 is approximately 40 the synergistic effects of surface roughness are not pronounced in the circular hurdles design 2 to design 4 perhaps the circulating region between two circular hurdles dissipates the energy and forms dead zones in the corners from practical viewpoint presence of surface roughness also enhances the possibility of cavitation erosion rao et al 1970 and therefore it reduces the lifetime of the venturi similarly circular hurdles have its inherent limitation of the formation of dead zones where the particles in suspension can aggregate and therefore the performance of the venturi with circular hurdles may severely affected however this can be avoided by designing a thick fillet around the corners on the other hand such geometrical limitations are not present in the design 5 the vapor volume fraction in design 5 enhanced by six times in comparison with plane venturi with roughness and three times without roughness although surface roughness may prone to cavitation erosion but the cavitational intensity in design 5 can be improved significantly even without surface roughness therefore design 5 seems to be the optimum for the practical purpose in summary the synergy between surface roughness and trumpet diverging wall leads to the optimum vapor volume fraction in a given circular venturi 5 conclusions the cavitating flow in a circular venturi has been studied for the following ranges of the pertinent parameters half convergent angle 15 20 half divergent angle 6 2 8 10 throat length 1 2 3 and pressure ratio 2 6 depending upon the value of the diverging angle and convergent angle a single or multiple vortices are observed in the diverging section the surface roughness was seen to strengthen the flow field at the one hand but it also tends to suppress the recirculating region in the diverging section of the venturi on the other end the recirculating region was seen to decrease with increasing diverging angle a minimal variation on the vapor volume fraction with throat length was observed this effect could be because the throat length only shifts the pressure recovery downstream of the domain the vapor volume fraction has been seen to have a positive dependence with roughness height k s on the other hand the vapor volume fraction shows an inverse trend with a roughness constant c s however the effect is less pronounced compared with roughness height k s the pressure loss coefficient decreases monotonically with the divergent angle on the other hand it follows the inverse trend with the convergent angle and cavitation number the discharge coefficient was found to decrease with both cavitation number and surface roughness followings are the key concluding remarks of this work 1 due to the higher frictional losses surface roughness offers enhanced cavitation however the effects are more pronounced at uniformly distributed roughness elements this information can be utilized to design venturi for process applications the fabrication of uniform roughness on the wall can be performed by 3 d printing technique as it provides precise control over the geometry 2 circular hurdles in the diverging section are shown to foster the hydrodynamic cavitation the possible reason is the formation of low pressure zone at the rear part of the hurdles however the number of hurdles plays a vital role in current context no such significant enhancement observed beyond second hurdles from fabrication viewpoint 3 d printing or cnc machine could be the possible options 3 the third strategy on the enhancement of hydrodynamic cavitation is modifying the the shape of the diverging wall trumpet diverging wall is found to enhance the cavitation significantly this effect is due to the non linear change in the cross section area in the diverging section which leads to produce extended length of low pressure zone this strategy offers higher cavitational yield by small modification in the geometry and this is one of the novel part of this work 4 the synergistic effects of surface roughness on the trumpet diverging wall is shown to be more pronounced than that in circular hurdles although the circular hurdles also enhance the volume fraction significantly but it also leads to formation of dead zones that may deteriorate the performance of venturi surface roughness may also foster the cavitation erosion in the venturi and thus reduce the lifetime but at the same time trumpet diverging wall offers six times higher volume fraction in comparison with plane venturi with roughness and three times without the roughness therefore trumpet diverging wall design seems to be useful for the practical applications declaration of competing interest authors declare that there

16623,hydrodynamic cavitation is a popular advanced oxidation technique and it has received wide range of applications from waste water treatment to the nanoparticles synthesis in recent years the enhancement of the intensity of the hydrodynamic cavitation is always been an emerging field of research within this framework we have proposed and investigated three distinct strategies to enhance

al 2009 for instance waste water treatment chemical synthesis process intensification food sectors nanoparticles synthesis capocelli et al 2020 carpenter et al 2017 gogate 2011 gƒÖgol et al 2018 manickam and ashokkumar 2014 ozonek 2012 ranade et al 2021 zhou et al 2009 the hydrodynamic cavitation offers good scalability and energy efficiency for large scale production more recently hydrodynamic cavitation was also used to generate nano scale bubbles oliveira et al 2018 broadly hydrodynamic cavitation describes the generation of tiny cavities upon reduction of the pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid one of the distinguishing features of hydrodynamic cavitation is the growth and collapse of the cavities leading to the formation of free radicals these free radicals are responsible for the chemical reactions during hydrodynamic cavitation this approach is widely used in advanced oxidation processes fedorov et al 2020 sun et al 2021 hydrodynamic cavitation not only offers oxidation of organic compounds ambulgekar et al 2005 saharan et al 2012 but also enhances the production of bio diesel chuah et al 2015 kelkar et al 2008 maddikeri et al 2014 hydrodynamic cavitation with addition of external oxidants like hydrogen peroxide is also reported to be an effective sterilization technique jyoti and pandit 2003 numerous cavitating devices have been used for the hydrodynamic cavitation the widely used geometries are venturi type devices single and multiple hole orifices vortex based cavitation devices etc venturi type cavitating devices are more simple and extensively used as flow measuring devices among others owing to the fast pressure recovery in an orifice the cavitation phenomena is often periodic and transient while in a venturi the cavitation is observed to be stable because of its diverging wall configuration however the orifice based geometries has a unique advantage as the multiple orifices can be designed on a single plate therefore the intensity of hydrodynamic cavitation can be tuned by manipulating the number of orifices on a plate the cavitating zone in an orifice occurs only at the edge of the throat section whereas in a venturi the cavitating zone expands toward the diverging section the rapid pressure recovery in a orifice device leads to generate relatively less number of cavities on the other hand sluggish pressure recovery in a venturi based device is expected to generate more cavities simpson and ranade 2019a venturi type devices are widely studied both numerically and experimentally due to their simple construction the early experimental work was based on the high speed imaging of the flow field for instance sato et al 2003 reported the dependence of dissolved gas and tensile strength of water on incipient characteristics of the cavitation similarly a high speed photography technique was used to investigate the effect of cavitation number on the flow pattern by sayyaadi 2010 they reported a periodic separation shedding and collapse of the cavities at low cavitation numbers at the same time simple sinusoidal fluctuations were observed at high cavitation numbers stutz and reboud 1997 reported void fraction and velocity distribution experimentally particle image velocimetry piv and high speed photography were used by gopalan and katz 2000 to examine the structure of sheet cavitation and reported detailed results on velocity and void fraction distribution the wall pressure fluctuation characteristics were experimentally investigated by chen et al 2015 the cavitating flows exhibit several types of cavitation behavior for instance cavitation inception sheet cloud cavitation etc besides the intensity of the pressure fluctuation enhances at the low value of the cavitation number on the other hand it decreases significantly at a higher cavitation number this observation is found to be consistent with that of sayyaadi 2010 furthermore a linear relationship between cavity length and pressure ratio or cavitation number was reported by long et al 2017 more recently liu et al 2020 reported the cavity behavior and wall static pressure characteristics in a rectangular venturi according to liu et al 2020 the cavity shedding was classified into three types namely 1 front shedding 2 central shedding and 3 tail shedding the average cavity length have a linear dependence on the cavitation number on the other hand the average cavity length increases by lowering the divergent angle these findings were seen to be inline with long et al 2017 in comparison with experimental studies scant numerical studies have been reported for instance shi et al 2019 utilized a two phase mixture model and reported detailed results on vapor fraction pressure loss coefficient and critical reynolds number as a function of geometric parameters the effect of a scale up ratio is also investigated and reported that the maximum turbulent viscosity ratio shows a proportional relation with the scale ratio shi et al 2020 also performed a 2d axisymmetric rans and 3d les turbulent simulations in a cavitating venturi rans solutions predicted a low rate of vapor production in comparison to les simulations dastane et al 2019 solved the flow field by mixture model and further integrated using discrete phase model dpm to predict the cavities trajectories furthermore a keller miksis equation for cavity dynamics was solved based on pressure and turbulence data from dpm simulations the cavity dynamics were described using the bubble radius collapse pressure and collapse temperature more recently simpson and ranade 2019b reported a detailed numerical investigation based on a two phase mixer model with dpm tracking of the cavities smaller divergent angles promote cavitation even at lower pressure ratios while higher divergent angles significantly reduce the cavitation inception furthermore the throat length l d variation doesn t affect the cavitation inception however relatively larger throat length delays the pressure recovery and perhaps such delay might have a role to play in controlling bubble growth and the collapse a detailed study on hydrodynamic cavitation in modified venturi was carried out by bashir et al 2011 five designs of the venturi namely circular slit annular ring annular slit and double annular slit were investigated cavity dynamics were studied by solving the rayleigh plesset equation using turbulent pressure fluctuation amplitude turbulence frequency and bulk pressure from the dpm tracking of the cavities a double annular slit venturi was observed to have the slowest recovery of the pressure therefore the cavitation zone and the intensity of collapse of cavities were significantly high in a double slit venturi similarly kuldeep and saharan 2016 reported the 3 d simulations on venturi and orifice devices with standard k œµ model from application viewpoint braeutigam et al 2012 investigated the degradation of pharmacetical compound carbamezapine by hydro acoustic cavitation method which is essentially a combination of hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation relatively fast degradation kinetics was observed owing to the synergy between hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation hydrodynamic cavitation generates micro and nanobubbles that can be collapsed by acoustic cavitation to enhance free radical generation similarly li et al 2014 reported removal of cyanobacteria like microcystis aeruginosa using hydrodynamic cavitation the algal cells were reported to be destroyed by orifice based cavitating device by up to 88 hydrodynamic cavitation is reported to be a sustainable technology for removal of algal blooms as it does not lead to a secondary pollution more recently the removal of viruses in the water is reported by kosel et al 2017 the plausible mechanism of inactivation of viruses due to the damage of host recognition receptors by oh radicals in addition high temperature and shear force during cavitation can also damage the cells from the discussion above it is reasonably clear that a voluminous body of knowledge is available dealing with cavitation in the venturi type device understanding the flow regimes vapor fraction cavity length as a function of convergent and divergent angle throat length and pressure ratio were reported on the other hand the possible strategy for enhancing cavitation through surface and geometrical modifications has not yet been studied this work focus on the following three strategies to enhance the intensity of hydrodynamic cavitation 1 by introducing the surface roughness on the wall 2 single or multiple circular hurdles in the diverging section 3 by modifying the diverging section from planer to the trumpet shape the surface roughness is introduced by modifying the log law at the wall by incorporating an additional constant as a function of roughness height k s and roughness constant c s the circular hurdles are introduced in the geometry of the venturi single or multiple hurdles have been drawn in the diverging section to investigate the cavitational activities in addition the shape of the diverging section is modified by using trumpet diverging wall the unique advantage of the trumpet diverging wall is the non linear variation of the area in the diverging section rather than the linear increase as in case of plane wall such non linear diverging wall is useful to maintain a low pressure region over the length of venturi for a plane venturi the effect of half convergent angle 15 20 half divergent angle 6 2 8 10 throat length 1 2 3 and pressure ratio 2 6 is varied several folds with and without the presence of surface roughness a detailed investigation on the flow field structure vapor volume fraction pressure loss coefficient and cavitation number is reported herein 2 problem formulation and governing equations consider a circular venturi see fig 1 a having diameter d and throat diameter d convergent angle Œ± divergent angle Œ≤ and throat length l as shown in fig 1 b the flow field is assumed to be axisymmetric and therefore the computational domain is a plane at Œ∏ 0 as shown in fig 1 c single or multiple hurdles are introduced in the diverging section characterized by width l t and distance from axis h a the distance between hurdles is given by l o for multiple circular hurdles as shown in fig 1 d furthermore in fig 1 e the diverging section is modified by changing the cross section area non linearly along the length using a trumpet shape geometry characterized by rate of change of the slope y 1 228 x 2 0 0161 x 0 0018 y 2 456 in all cases the diameter ratio d d is fixed to be 5 55 the upstream length l u d and downstream length l d d are 22 and 61 respectively a systematic domain independence studies were carried out for the choice of the upstream and downstream length the half convergent angle is chosen to be 6 5 15 20 half divergent angle is varied as 6 2 8 10 and the throat length l d is selected as 1 2 3 as noted earlier cavitation results from flow constrictions where the pressure falls below the liquid s vapor pressure in the downstream section of the venturi a dimensionless number so called cavitation number is often used to describe the cavitation phenomena and it is defined as follows saharan et al 2012 1 œÉ p p v t 1 2 œÅ v t h 2 where œÉ p p v t œÅ and v t h are the cavitation number fully recovered down stream pressure saturation pressure of the liquid density and throat velocity respectively cavitating flow occurs when œÉ 1 under ideal condition however the cavitating flow regime can also exist even at a cavitation number greater than one in practical situations where dissolved oxygen and other contamination present in the fluid the cavitation inception is often termed as a transition from a single phase flow to a two phase bubbly flow where the first cavity appears to form the corresponding cavitation number is called the inception cavitation number beyond the inception cavitation number flow fields are highly turbulent forms vapor cavities and eventually vapor cavity collapse numerical modeling of such complex flow fields is indeed challenging the most suitable approach to resolve the events at such multiple time and length scales is a direct numerical simulation dns however this approach is computationally costly the present work focuses on the effect of surface and geometrical modifications over a wide range of conditions and therefore reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach is used here k œâ s s t turbulence model is used because it has unique advantages in predicting flow separation and behavior in adverse pressure gradients therefore it is the most common turbulence model for the industrial flow with a large aspect ratio menter 1992 a mixture multi phase model that treats the fluid as a single fluid mixture of individual phases is utilized with an appropriate cavitation model the continuity and momentum equations for the mixture model are written as follow fluent 2013 2 1 flow and turbulence model continuity equation 2 œÅ m t œÅ m v i m x i 0 where 3 v m q 1 n Œ± q œÅ q v q œÅ m momentum equation 4 œÅ m v i m t œÅ m v i m v j m x j p x j Œ¥ i j x j Œº m Œº t v i m x j v j m x i where v i m and v q are the velocity of the mixture phase and individual phase respectively œÅ m is the density of the mixture phase Œº t and Œº m are the turbulent viscosity and the mixture phase viscosity respectively the turbulent viscosity in k œâ s s t rans model is written as follows fluent 2013 5 Œº t Œ± œÅ m k œâ where Œ± is a input parameter depends on the reynolds number k and œâ are the turbulent kinetic energy and the specific dissipation rate and

popular cavitation models namely singhal et al model singhal et al 2002 schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 and zwart et al model zwart et al 2004 singhal et al model singhal et al 2002 is often termed as a full cavitation model as this model accounts for the generation and transport of vapor bubbles pressure and velocity fluctuation and the effect of non condensible dissolved gases the rates of evaporation and condensation are are originated from the rayleigh plesset equation both singhal et al model singhal et al 2002 and schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 extensively used in the literature for instance dastane et al 2019 and simpson and ranade 2019b have used singhal et al 2002 whilst shi et al 2019 2020 and bi√ßer and sou 2016 utilized the schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 in this work the schnerr sauer cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 is used throughout the paper in schnerr sauer model the vapour volume fraction is computed from a transport equation for the vapor fraction as follows 9 Œ± v œÅ v t Œ± v œÅ v v i m x i r e r c Œ± v is the volume fraction of the vapor phase and œÅ v is the density of the vapor phase on the other hand r e and r c accounts for the mass source and sink due to evaporation and condensation during cavitation respectively the expression for r c and r e are written as follows 10 when p v p r e œÅ v œÅ l œÅ m Œ± v 1 Œ± v 3 r b 2 3 œÅ v œÅ l œÅ l 11 when p v p r c œÅ v œÅ l œÅ m Œ± v 1 Œ± v 3 r b 2 3 œÅ l œÅ v œÅ l where p is the fully recovered downstream pressure the bubble radius can be written as follows 12 r b 3 Œ± v 1 Œ± v 4 œÄ n b 1 3 the volume fraction of the vapor is given by 13 Œ± v v v v m n b 4 œÄ 3 r b 3 1 n b 4 œÄ 3 r b 3 where n b is the bubble number density and n b 10 13 is used in this work the saturation pressure p v is estimated by antoine equation written as follows 14 log p v a b t c where a b and c are the material specific constants in this work the vapor pressure p v 2338 pa is used over the range of conditions spanned here 2 3 boundary conditions the pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are used at inlet and outlet of the venturi respectively the total pressure at inlet is varied from 3 10 5 to 5 10 5 p a whereas the outlet static pressure is fixed to be 1 10 5 p a a no slip condition is imposed on the wall turbulent intensity and turbulent viscosity are prescribed to be 10 and 5 respectively the surface roughness parameters k s and c s are introduced as the boundary conditions on the wall the details of the wall roughness are described in the next section 2 4 wall surface roughness the effect of surface roughness is often incorporated by the modified law of the wall as follows blocken et al 2007 jim√©nez 2004 15 œÅ v p v œÑ w 1 Œ∫ ln e œÅ v y p Œº l Œ¥ b where v p is the component of velocity at y p the distance to the wall e 9 793 is the empirical constant v c Œº 1 4 k is the dynamic velocity for fully rough surface the additional constant Œ¥ b can be evaluated as follows 16 Œ¥ b 1 Œ∫ ln 1 c s k s where 17 k s œÅ k s v Œº l where c s is termed as roughness constant for spherical sand grains the value of c s is 0 5 on the other hand k s is the height of the roughness on the wall k s is the dimensionless roughness constant in this work c s and k s are varied as 0 5 0 1 and 0 1 mm respectively ansys fluent software is used to incorporate the governing equations boundary conditions and roughness conditions 3 numerical solution methodology the governing differential equations and boundary conditions are solved numerically using commercial solver ansys fluent version 16 0 to map the flow domain in terms of the velocity and volume fraction fields the geometry is created in the design modeler and triangular elements with non uniform spacing are generated using icem cfd a built in tool of ansys workbench a relatively finer mesh is generated near the wall to resolve the stiff velocity gradients pressure velocity coupling is carried out by a simple algorithm and pressure is discretized using the presto discretization scheme the spatial discretization of the volume fraction is chosen to be quadratic upwind interpolation for convection kinematics quick scheme the second order upwind scheme is used to discretize the momentum equation the first order implicit scheme is used in the rans model to discretize the time the total flow time of 0 05 seconds was completed for each simulation a relatively short time step Œ¥ t 1 10 5 is used to avoid the numerical oscillation in the solution all the numerical simulations are time dependent in nature and therefore the time history of variables like average vapor volume fraction throat velocity stream function are monitored and compared with the steady state simulations the results are seen to be fairly consistent in both steady and unsteady simulations the convergence criteria for the continuity and momentum equations are 10 7 used here a detailed grid and domain tests have been carried out to avoid numerical artifacts furthermore a detailed comparison with numerical and experimental data has been performed to ensure reliability and accuracy of present work 3 1 selection of numerical parameters accuracy and reliability of every numerical solution depend on the numerical parameters namely meshing and computational domain therefore in this case a systematic approach has been followed to reach their optimum values the velocity gradients are expected to be steep at a high value of pressure ratio therefore a grid independence study has been carried out at a pressure ratio p r 6 for both rough and smooth surfaces for this purpose three grids namely g1 elements 39666 g2 elements 83491 and g3 elements 132028 were prepared with minimum and maximum size of 6 71 10 2 mm and 0 2 mm respectively the mesh statistics are shown in table 1 the velocity profile and turbulent kinetic energy along the radial position at the throat section are compared for all grids see supplementary information fig sm 1 the resulting deviation between grid g2 and g3 is less than 1 therefore grid g2 is chosen for further computations over the range of conditions spanned here furthermore the domain independence test was carried out at a lower pressure ratio as the boundary layers expected to be long and thick the optimum value of the upstream length l u d 22 and downstream length l d d 61 were obtained after systematic studies on the radial velocity profile at the throat the range of geometrical parameters used in this work are reported in table 2 3 2 validation of results before presenting new results obtained here a benchmark comparison has been carried out with the numerical and experimental results from the literature for instance the effect of the pressure ratio on the volumetric flow rate is shown in fig 2 a a good agreement was observed with both numerical and experimental results report by shi et al 2019 similarly we also compared the numerical and experimental results on volumetric flow rate versus pressure ratio with that of simpson and ranade 2019b as shown in fig 2 b the numerical prediction and experimental results are found to be in close correspondence for a given set of range of conditions furthermore the mass flow rate versus the inverse of pressure ratio is compared with that of abdulaziz 2014 as shown in fig 2 c the percentage errors between experimental and numerical results are in the range of 5 13 in this case as evident from fig 2 c suffice to add here that present results were seen to be in good correspondence with shi et al 2019 and simpson and ranade 2019b while slightly higher deviation shows with that of abdulaziz 2014 such deviations between experimental and numerical results are not uncommon simpson and ranade 2019b also reported a similar deviation of numerical prediction with the experimental results of abdulaziz 2014 the plausible reason for such deviations could be the presence of dissolved non condensable gases and suspended solids in the fluid in a nutshell the present results agree with the numerical results and experimental results reported in the literature such validation with experimental and numerical results inspire confidence in present numerical calculations over the range of conditions encompassed here 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of surface roughness 4 1 1 flow characteristics the general features of the flow field are explained by investigating the velocity magnitude pressure contour stream functions especially in the close vicinity of the throat section these are useful not only for the visualization of the flow patterns but also for the formation of the cavitation zone in the diverging section of the flow domain fig 3 shows a representative velocity magnitude contours for different values of the divergent angles Œ≤ 6 2 8 10 for both smooth and rough wall surface at fixed value of the pressure ratio p r 5 since the conservation equation for the vapor volume fraction is solved using the velocity field therefore the prediction about the vapor volume fraction can be made by examining the flow characteristics at a low divergent angle the velocity decays slowly in the axial direction Œ≤ 6 2 see fig 3 for smooth surface while it decays a relatively faster at a high divergent angle this faster decay of the velocity is simply because the flow area increases with the divergent angle furthermore the effect of the rough and smooth surface on the velocity magnitude contour is also shown in fig 3 evidently for a rough surface the spatial decay of the velocity is sluggish compared to the smooth surface this effect can be seen more clearly by examining the velocity magnitude along the axial direction as shown in fig 4 from mechanical energy balance higher kinetic energy results in low pressure energy zone for a given amount of total energy therefore higher velocity magnitude zone also signifies the low pressure zone as evident from fig sm2 clearly the low pressure zone occurs at the throat and diverging section of the venturi and the area of the low pressure region increases with the pressure ratio furthermore the rough surfaces offer expanded zone of low pressure region with reference to the smooth surface this effect is in line with the fact that pressure energy losses in the rough surfaces are relatively higher than the smooth surface in other words the friction factor f 8 œÑ w œÅ v t h 2 for rough surfaces is significantly higher in comparison with the smooth surfaces as shown in table 3 therefore it is justified to have the slow decay of the velocity field and expanded low pressure region in the rough surface than the smooth surface as the pressure energy loss is higher in the rough surfaces the cavity expands isothermally at such a low pressure region later it collapses adiabatically to produce a cavitational event on the other hand the cavitation nuclei are expected to stay longer in a low pressure region due to the slow pressure recovery on the rough surfaces bashir et al 2011 however it is expected to grow more extensive than that in the smooth surfaces therefore the cavitational intensity is expected to be more in the rough surfaces than the smooth surfaces at a low pressure ratio i e low reynolds number inertia in the fluid is relatively small therefore fluid element can follow the changes in flow path without having any significant energy losses at a high pressure ratio i e high reynolds number the inertial force increases the fluid starts detaching from the surface of the venturi and this in turn forms the negative wake at the divergent sections of the flow domain see fig sm3 in supplementary material the recirculating zone thickens with an increasing pressure ratio the eye of the recirculating zone shifted downstream by increasing the pressure ratio for rough surfaces on the other hand the size of the recirculating zone observed lower for the rough surfaces furthermore the length of the recirculating zone decreases significantly with increasing divergent angle as noted earlier this effect is because the flow area increases with the diverging angle on the other hand the convergent angle does not affect the recirculating length significantly needless to say here that increasing throat length shifts the recirculating region downstream of the venturi the effect of surface roughness on the stream function contours is shown in fig sm4 the presence of surface roughness suppresses the propensity of flow separation the recirculating length was seen to be lower in rough surface than that of the smooth surfaces furthermore at a low diverging angle a series of satellite vortices forms and observed to vanish at a higher diverging angle the recirculating zone not only thickens with the diverging angle but also increases in length in summary surface roughness strengthens the flow field and forms a recirculating zone in the diverging section however the recirculating region was seen to decrease with increasing divergent angle the effect of surface roughness on pressure contour is investigated here the negative pressure region was seen to be larger in the rough surface than that in the smooth see fig sm5 in supplementary material this trend also indicates that pressure energy loss in the rough surfaces is more in comparison with smooth surfaces this effect is found to be in line with experimental results reported on hydrodynamic cavitation around hydrofoil hao et al 2018 the experimental results suggest that surface roughness significantly influences cloud cavitation three events namely cavity development the formation of the re entrant jet and growth shedding of cavities were reported in the presence of surface roughness during cavitation on a rough surface the cavity length was significantly higher than that on the smooth surface the present numerical results also predict the extended length of the negative pressure region downstream of the venturi which indirectly denotes a larger cavity length in rough surfaces 4 1 2 vapor volume fraction the vapor volume fraction indicates the cavitating region in the flow domain for both rough and smooth surfaces the vapor fraction decreases with a divergent angle as shown in fig 5 this effect is consistent with previous studies dastane et al 2019 simpson and ranade 2019b for the smooth surfaces on the other hand surface roughness significantly increases the vapor fraction irrespective of the divergent angle however these effects are more pronounced at a low divergent angle for instance Œ≤ 6 2 such a pronounced effect is because a rough surface offers more resistance to flow than a smooth surface and therefore the energy pressure losses are more in the rough surfaces therefore the cavitational yields in the rough surfaces are expected to be higher with respect to smooth surface for a fixed value of half convergent Œ± 6 2 and half divergent angle Œ≤ 6 2 the vapor volume fraction increases with throat length however the effect is not very significant see fig sm6 in supplementary material the plausible reason may be as the throat length only shifts the pressure recovery it neither delays nor fosters the pressure recovery this is seen to be inline with simpson and ranade 2019b the vapor volume fraction has a positive correlation with roughness height k s on the other hand it exhibits an inverse trend with a roughness constant c s the quantitative measure of vapor fraction is presented here in terms of average volume fraction defined as follows 18 œï v 1 v s Œ± v r z d v the vapor volume fraction increases with roughness height see fig sm7 in supplementary material however the effects are less pronounced at a low pressure ratio all in all roughness height enhances the vapor fraction maximum of three folds in comparison with the smooth surface however it is observed to have an inverse trend with the roughness constant this trend is justified as the surface roughness tends to non uniform with increasing roughness constant such enhancement in the vapor volume fraction in the presence of surface roughness is also inline with experimental results reported in hydrofoil hao et al 2018 the cavity area was reported to be enhanced by two folds in comparison with the smooth hydrofoil surfaces this trend is in agreement with the vapor volume fraction qualitatively reported in this work the sluggish pressure recovery in the rough surfaces leads to the enhancement in the cavitating zone compared to the smooth surfaces however the overall cavitational yield is gauged by the fraction of active cavities and energy vapor density bashir et al 2011 rough surfaces offer excellent vapor energy density and vapor volume but the lower active cavities for a fixed energy input the amount of vapor produced is more on rough surfaces which may lead to a slow collapse of the cavities the frictional losses in the rough surfaces are more indicated by the friction factor f 8 œÑ w œÅ v t h 2 shown in table 3 therefore slow pressure recovery is justified in the rough surfaces 4 1 3 pressure loss coefficient frictional losses from the surfaces is often represented in terms of pressure loss coefficient and it is defined as follows 19 k l 2 Œ¥ p œÅ v i n 2 where Œ¥ p is the pressure drop across the venturi and v i n is the average velocity at the inlet from the integral form of continuity equation v i n can be calculated as follows 20 v i n d 2 d 2 v t h where d and d are the inlet and throat diameter of the venturi respectively furthermore inlet reynolds number can be defined as follow 21 r e i n œÅ d v i n Œº l fig 6 represents the effect of pressure ratio p r roughness parameters c s k s throat length l d cavitation number œÉ and inlet reynolds number r e i n on pressure coefficient k l the average vapor fraction shows a positive correlation with the pressure ratio in other words the cavitating zone increases with the pressure ratio the energy loss due to cavitation can be seen in terms of the pressure loss coefficient as shown in fig 6 a pressure loss coefficient not only increases monotonically with pressure ratio but also with roughness height however the pressure loss coefficient decreases with an increase in the roughness constant see fig 6 b this trend suggests that the energy loss in the non uniform rough surface c s 0 5 is less compared to a uniformly distributed roughness c s 0 5 this effect can also be seen in the vapor volume fraction as it decreases with an increase in the roughness constant the pressure loss coefficient decreases monotonically with the divergent angle as shown in fig 6 c as noted earlier this is because the flow area increases in the diverging section with increasing angle and therefore results in lower frictional losses on the other hand the pressure loss coefficient follows an inverse trend with the convergent angle as shown in fig 6 d this effect is not surprising as the direction of the angle is opposite in this case furthermore increasing the value of the throat length offers less pressure loss as the effective length of the flow domain increases with throat length see fig 6 e and therefore the pressure drop per unit length decreases and thus the pressure loss coefficient lastly the pressure loss coefficient shows a linear inverse dependence with the cavitation number see fig 6 f and thereby leading to the conclusion that the cavitation zone directly proportional to the energy loss due to the friction and phase change for a fixed value of cavitation number the pressure loss in the rough surface is observed to be more than that in the smooth surfaces in a nutshell the vapor volume fraction shows a positive correlation with the pressure loss coefficient the increase in the roughness height leads to a higher pressure loss coefficient while the higher roughness constant offers relatively a low pressure loss these effects directly reflects in the vapor volume fraction contours shown in fig 5 4 1 4 discharge coefficient and cavitation number while the detailed streamline volume fraction contours and pressure loss coefficient provide useful information about the structure of the cavitating flow the discharge coefficient values are frequently needed to design the equipment in process engineering the discharge coefficient c d is defined as follows ebrahimi et al 2017 22 c d m a c t u a l m i d e a l where m a c t u a l is the mass flow rate of the cavitating flow and m i d e a l is the mass flow rate in the absence of frictional losses m i d e a l is defined as follows 23 m i d e a l a t h 2 œÅ Œ¥ p the actual mass flow rate is evaluated by following expression 24 m a c t u a l 2 œÄ 0 r œÅ v r d r fig sm8 shows the effect of cavitation number on the discharge coefficient the value of c d decreases with the cavitation number this trend is in line with the typical discharge coefficient trend with reynolds number hollingshead et al 2011 as the cavitation number exhibits the inverse dependence on reynolds number see fig sm 8 in supplementary material furthermore high surface roughness for instance k s 1 mm yields a lower discharge coefficient in comparison with smooth surface this effect is justified as rough surface produces more vapor volume and therefore the value of m a c t u a l for rough surface is expected to be lower than that of smooth surface therefore the discharge coefficient is expected to decrease from eq 22 besides the energy losses are higher on rough surfaces and therefore the discharge coefficient is expected to be lower on the rough surfaces as evident from fig sm8 4 2 effect of circular hurdles the conventional geometry is modified by introducing a single or multiple circular hurdles as shown in fig 1 d a detailed investigation is carried out and the salient features of the velocity and pressure fields and volume fraction contour are reported in fig 7 for various designs see table 4 clearly the vapor volume fraction increase by 86 from design 1 to design 2 furthermore while keeping the width and inter spacing distance constant the increase in the distance from axis does not enhance the vapor volume fraction significantly comparison between design 2 and design 3 this can be seen clearly in fig 7 a on the other hand increase in width while keeping the distance from the axis constant leads to decrease in the vapor volume fraction this is simply due to the fact that the increase in the width decreases the inter spacing distance the effect of number of hurdles is also investigated and it is found that the vapor volume fraction increases significantly only up to the second hurdles see supplementary material fig sm 9 such significant enhancement in the vapor volume fraction in presence of circular hurdles is possibly due to the formation of low pressure zone after each hurdles this effect can be seen in the pressure versus axial length plot in fig 7 b the pressure recovery is shown to be delayed significantly in presence of circular hurdles the pressure contour also corroborates this finding see supplementary material fig sm 10 the velocity magnitude along axial length increases significantly in presence of the circular hurdles as shown in fig 7 c clearly the available flow area decreases in presence of circular hurdles and thus it increases the velocity magnitude in summary the circular hurdles create a low pressure zone at the rear of the hurdles and this in turn responsible for enhanced vapor fraction with respect to the convectional venturi design 1 in addition circular hurdles are also responsible for higher velocity magnitude in the diverging section 4 3 effect of trumpet diverging wall in addition to surface roughness and circular hurdles the shape of the diverging section is also modified from the plane wall to the trumpet diverging wall the selection of the trumpet diverging section is due to the nonlinear change in the cross section along the length with respect to the plane wall in other words the flow area changes relatively slower along the diverging section in case of the trumpet wall with reference to a linear plane wall the important results on volume fraction pressure and velocity magnitude are shown in fig 8 clearly the vapor volume fraction increases by 150 at p r 3 and 27 at p r 5 such enhancement in the vapor volume fraction is due to the slow pressure recovery in the diverging section as evident from fig 8 b furthermore the slow pressure recovery translates into higher velocity magnitude in the diverging section as shown in fig 8 c the intensity of cavitation is often enhanced by decrease in the diverging angle Œ≤ see fig 5 the major challenging problem with decrease in the diverging angle Œ≤ is that it increases the length of the diverging section and thus the total length of the venturi this problem can be eliminated by using the trumpet diverging wall one can achieve the same intensity of cavitation at higher diverging angle as well by adjusting the rate of change of slope of the trumpet wall in summary the vapor volume fraction increases with the trumpet diverging wall with reference to the plane wall this effect is attributed due to the slower pressure recovery in the trumpet diverging wall 4 4 optimization of various designs the synergistic effects of surface roughness on various designs have presented by comparing the vapor volume fraction as shown in fig 9 design 1 represents a plane venturi design 2 3 and 4 represents the presence of circular hurdles and design 5 is the trumpet diverging section all else being equal the vapor volume fraction for single or multiple circular hurdles is higher than the plane and trumpet diverging wall venturi when the surface roughness is not present on the other hand the presence of surface roughness offers the maximum vapor volume fraction in design 5 among other designs where surface roughness contributes approximately 50 to the total vapor volume fraction similarly the contribution of surface roughness on design 1 is approximately 40 the synergistic effects of surface roughness are not pronounced in the circular hurdles design 2 to design 4 perhaps the circulating region between two circular hurdles dissipates the energy and forms dead zones in the corners from practical viewpoint presence of surface roughness also enhances the possibility of cavitation erosion rao et al 1970 and therefore it reduces the lifetime of the venturi similarly circular hurdles have its inherent limitation of the formation of dead zones where the particles in suspension can aggregate and therefore the performance of the venturi with circular hurdles may severely affected however this can be avoided by designing a thick fillet around the corners on the other hand such geometrical limitations are not present in the design 5 the vapor volume fraction in design 5 enhanced by six times in comparison with plane venturi with roughness and three times without roughness although surface roughness may prone to cavitation erosion but the cavitational intensity in design 5 can be improved significantly even without surface roughness therefore design 5 seems to be the optimum for the practical purpose in summary the synergy between surface roughness and trumpet diverging wall leads to the optimum vapor volume fraction in a given circular venturi 5 conclusions the cavitating flow in a circular venturi has been studied for the following ranges of the pertinent parameters half convergent angle 15 20 half divergent angle 6 2 8 10 throat length 1 2 3 and pressure ratio 2 6 depending upon the value of the diverging angle and convergent angle a single or multiple vortices are observed in the diverging section the surface roughness was seen to strengthen the flow field at the one hand but it also tends to suppress the recirculating region in the diverging section of the venturi on the other end the recirculating region was seen to decrease with increasing diverging angle a minimal variation on the vapor volume fraction with throat length was observed this effect could be because the throat length only shifts the pressure recovery downstream of the domain the vapor volume fraction has been seen to have a positive dependence with roughness height k s on the other hand the vapor volume fraction shows an inverse trend with a roughness constant c s however the effect is less pronounced compared with roughness height k s the pressure loss coefficient decreases monotonically with the divergent angle on the other hand it follows the inverse trend with the convergent angle and cavitation number the discharge coefficient was found to decrease with both cavitation number and surface roughness followings are the key concluding remarks of this work 1 due to the higher frictional losses surface roughness offers enhanced cavitation however the effects are more pronounced at uniformly distributed roughness elements this information can be utilized to design venturi for process applications the fabrication of uniform roughness on the wall can be performed by 3 d printing technique as it provides precise control over the geometry 2 circular hurdles in the diverging section are shown to foster the hydrodynamic cavitation the possible reason is the formation of low pressure zone at the rear part of the hurdles however the number of hurdles plays a vital role in current context no such significant enhancement observed beyond second hurdles from fabrication viewpoint 3 d printing or cnc machine could be the possible options 3 the third strategy on the enhancement of hydrodynamic cavitation is modifying the the shape of the diverging wall trumpet diverging wall is found to enhance the cavitation significantly this effect is due to the non linear change in the cross section area in the diverging section which leads to produce extended length of low pressure zone this strategy offers higher cavitational yield by small modification in the geometry and this is one of the novel part of this work 4 the synergistic effects of surface roughness on the trumpet diverging wall is shown to be more pronounced than that in circular hurdles although the circular hurdles also enhance the volume fraction significantly but it also leads to formation of dead zones that may deteriorate the performance of venturi surface roughness may also foster the cavitation erosion in the venturi and thus reduce the lifetime but at the same time trumpet diverging wall offers six times higher volume fraction in comparison with plane venturi with roughness and three times without the roughness therefore trumpet diverging wall design seems to be useful for the practical applications declaration of competing interest authors declare that there

16624,stocking of filter feeding fish is a common tool used in sub tropical chinese reservoirs to control phytoplankton however field investigations have showed that such stocking would enhance instead of controlling phytoplankton in these reservoirs reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catchments which may constitute an important carbon source to filter feeding fish whether direct consumption of detritus increases the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphorus p to phytoplankton and thereby provides resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass is debated we conducted an enclosure experiment in a sub tropical chinese reservoir liuxihe reservoir to assess how a gradient of filter feeding fish silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix biomass affected p dynamics and fish grazing and predation when subsidized by allochthonous detritus fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of p tp concentration in the water column increased over time in all enclosures but the presence of fish slowed its increase thus tp decreased with increasing fish biomass fish were a net sink of p to the water column because they gained mass during the experiment moreover p sequestered by fish could largely account for the lower tp concentrations observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures fish presence at high biomass strongly reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and p excretion by zooplankton however the negative effect of fish predation on zooplankton was negligible when fish was present at low biomass increasing fish biomass increased the relative role of fish in p cycling but decreased the overall p excretion by fish and zooplankton compared to enclosures with high fish biomass both zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy and the overall p excretion were much higher whereas fish grazing effect on phytoplankton fish phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy chlorophyll a and the yield of chlorophyll a per tp were much lower in enclosures with low fish biomass this suggested that phytoplankton limitation might shift from one of zooplankton control to one of limitation by p availability with increasing fish biomass relative to fish mediated p recycling and fish grazing zooplankton grazing appeared to be more important as a driver of trophic cascades in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus silver carp stocked at high biomass would strongly reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase the yield of phytoplankton per tp graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords mesocosm filter feeding fish phytoplankton trophic cascade phosphorus recycling 1 introduction silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis collectively referred to as bigheaded carp are large omnivorous filter feeders that occupy the upper and middle layers of the pelagic zone due to their ability to filter phytoplankton they have been widely stocked to improve the ecological quality of water bodies see review by kolar et al 2005 lin et al 2020 however controversies remain about the effect of bigheaded carp on phytoplankton some studies found that silver carp were efficient in suppressing cyanobacteria blooms e g radke and kahl 2002 guo et al 2015 however others demonstrated that they can adversely affect the water quality and native planktivorous fish populations e g sampson et al 2009 lin et al 2014 collins and wahl 2017 tumolo and flinn 2017 solomon et al 2016 found that the establishment of bigheaded carp in the illinois river not only decreased the densities of native planktivorous fish but also altered other non planktivorous fish community members lin et al 2020 argued that bigheaded carp acted as p source for phytoplankton and enhanced the yield of chlorophyll a per tp in sub tropical chinese reservoirs an enclosure experiment by domaizon and devaux 1999a suggested that the success of phytoplankton control by silver carp was probably largely dependent on fish biomass and plankton community structure fish influence phytoplankton biomass through both bottom up and top down processes attayde and hansson 2001a 2001b lemmens et al 2018 planktivorous fish recycle p in the water column and mediate p availability to phytoplankton by p excretion by themselves and or by zooplankton some studies have suggested nutrient recycling to be an important source of nutrients to phytoplankton and the relative importance of p excretion by fish and zooplankton should depend on fish biomass the composition of their diet and zooplankton community structure and biomass e g schindler et al 1993 persson 1997a zooplanktivorous fish tend to increase zooplankton p excretion rate by shifting zooplankton community towards small bodied species that have a higher mass specific excretion rate vanni and findlay 1990 enclosure experiments using nested designs caging either the fish or the phytoplankton away from the zooplankton in eutrophic lakes showed that enhanced nutrient availability stimulated by zooplanktivorous fish significantly increased phytoplankton biomass and most of the fish mediated nutrient recycling effects were due to increased nutrient recycling by zooplankton rather than direct nutrient excretion by fish persson 1997b attayde and hansson 2001a b unlike zooplanktivorous fish detritivorous fish can supply new p to the water column by consuming sedimented detritus and releasing detritus associated p into water column kelly et al 2018 argued that recycling detritus bound p by detritivorous fish would be an important source of p for phytoplankton and thus provide resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass in acton lake bigheaded carp consume phytoplankton zooplankton and suspended detritus and may thus reach a higher carrying capacity than obligate zooplanktvores see review by jeppesen et al 2005 they may not only mediate p recycling in a way similar to obligate zooplanktivorous fish but also recycle detritus bound p by direct consumption of suspended detritus it is likely that bigheaded carp have a potential to increase phytoplankton productivity by enhancing p recycling fish mediated grazing pressure is another mechanism regulating phytoplankton biomass and community composition bigheaded carp consume phytoplankton and their filtering efficiency partly depends on the mesh size of their gill rakers and on the size and shape of phytoplankton in contrast to herbivorous zooplankton silver carp are more effective at filtering net phytoplankton from the water v√∂r√∂s et al 1997 they can suppress net phytoplankton through direct grazing and enhance small phytoplankton through reducing zooplankton grazing pressure zhao et al 2013 some studies showed that silver carp grazing was more important than their predation for phytoplankton dynamics and reduced phytoplankton when large phytoplankton accounted for a greater proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass e g starling 1993 guo et al 2015 in contrast other studies demonstrated that fish predation would be more important when phytoplankton were dominated by small species and fish presence reduced zooplankton grazing and thereby increased total phytoplankton biomass e g zhao et al 2013 domaizon devaux 1999a and b suggested that the effect of silver carp on herbivorous zooplankton should be fish biomass dependent and the negative effect of fish on zooplankton would be minimized when stocking at low biomass in planktivore dominated systems fish predation can reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase p recycling which act in concert to enhance phytoplankton resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass per unit p than in piscivore dominated systems vanni and findlay 1990 schindler et al 1993 moreover the relative importance of planktivorous fish predation and excretion for phytoplankton dynamics should change along the trophic gradient nutrient excretion by planktivorous fish tends to be more important than their predation for phytoplankton dynamics in lakes with low p inputs and a relative high fish biomass which may arise when fish consume considerable amounts of littoral benthic resources attayde and hansson 2001b in sub tropical chinese reservoirs stocked with bigheaded carp lin et al 2014 2020 found that the effect of fish on p recycling was beyond their herbivorous effect on phytoplankton and the yield of phytoplankton per tp increased with increasing fish biomass tropical and subtropical chinese reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catchments hou et al 2013 ning et al 2013 lin et al 2018 which may constitute an important carbon source to bigheaded carp lin et al 2020 argued that bigheaded carp by direct consumption of terrestrial detritus would reduce the sedimentation of terrestrial detritus derived p and thereby increase the availability of dissolved inorganic p to the phytoplankton via excretion in this study we conducted a 2 month enclosure experiment in a sub tropical chinese reservoir liuxihe reservoir to examine how bigheaded carp biomass influence fish grazing and predation and p dynamics in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus we used silver carp as a model organism because it is widely stocked to control phytoplankton in sub tropical chinese reservoirs we hypothesized that 1 silver carp would reduce p sedimentation and act as p source to the water column that 2 overall p excretion by fish and zooplankton would increase with fish biomass and that 3 relative to zooplankton or fish grazing fish mediated p recycling would be more important as a driver of trophic cascades enhancing the yield of phytoplankton biomass per tp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design we conducted enclosure experiment during 10 april 4 june 2015 at liuxihe reservoir 23 45 10 n 113 46 55 e south china enclosures were made of light blue high density polyethylene film 4 4 m2 6 m deep and sealed at the bottom the top of each enclosure was open to the atmosphere and ca 50 cm above the water surface to prevent fish jumping into or out of the enclosure therefore the water column in the enclosures was ca 5 5 m deep yielding a volume of about 88 m3 details of the enclosures and the reservoir are described in zhao et al 2013 and lin et al 2018 we established three treatments fishless low fish 0 5 g m 3 and high fish 4 8 g m 3 each treatment consisted of three replicate enclosures fish biomass used in the high fish treatment was similar to silver carp stocking level in liuxihe reservoir lin et al 2020 and previous experiment conducted by zhao et al 2013 in the same experiment enclosures all enclosures were filled simultaneously with reservoir water at installation by allowing water to enter through a 2 mm mesh nylon net in an attempt to avoid unwanted fish the plankton communities in the enclosures were left to equilibrate for two weeks before the treatments were applied silver carp 10 0 5 cm total length and 9 0 2 g wet mass that were obtained from a fish hatchery were acclimatized reservoir plankton and water conditions in enclosures during two weeks prior to the experiment two fish groups low fish and high fish were stocked with 5 and 45 silver carp per enclosure respectively all added fish were captured at the end of the experiment and no fish were lost allochthonous detritus was added as 40 ¬µm rice bran 12 5 mg p g 1 44 2 mg n g 1 each enclosure received addition of 34 g rice bran every three days from 10 april to 4 jun and each addition was enough to increase enclosure tp and tn by 5 ¬µg p l 1 and 17 7 ¬µg n l 1 respectively total phosphorus addition was similar to p load in flood season in liuxihe reservoir lin et al 2018 2 2 sampling methods we quantified the concentrations of n and p in the water column including total dissolved inorganic and 200 ¬µm particulate fractions and constructed a p budget for the enclosures to do so we quantified the amounts of p sequestered in periphyton growing on the inside walls of enclosures p lost from the water column through sedimentation and net accumulation of p through fish mass gain we attempted to construct such a budget to shed light on how fish affect the fate of p and whether fish mediate the loss of p from the water column we quantified zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition to assess whether shifts in fish biomass corresponded with shifts in zooplankton and phytoplankton communities as predicted by trophic cascade theory we also estimated p excretion rates by fish and zooplankton to assess whether fish increased p availability to phytoplankton prior to the start of experiment the enclosures were sampled on 9 april to assess pretreatment conditions after the treatments were begun on 10 april the enclosures were sampled weekly water temperature and transparency measured as secchi depth were also measured weekly a 60 l water sample was taken with a 5 l uwitec water sampler integrated over the whole water column in each enclosure a 10 l portion of water was collected for analysis of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip 200 ¬µm particulate phosphorus pp total phosphorus tp total dissolved inorganic nitrogen din total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chla subsamples were fractionated within 1 h of collection with polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 ¬µm and preached nitex screens with mesh size of 200 ¬µm filtrate through 0 2 ¬µm was analyzed for dip with the molybdenum blue method and din with the uv method after potassium persulfate digestion murphy and riley 1962 tp and 200 ¬µm pp were determined as molybdate reactive phosphorus following persulfate digestion and tn as nitrate by the uv method after potassium persulfate digestion menzel and corwin 1965 gross et al 1999 chla was determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in acetone a 300 ml portion of the sampled water was preserved with 1 lugol s for phytoplankton enumeration phytoplankton was identified and counted using an uterm√∂hl chamber and inverted microscope and volumes estimated from geometrical shapes uterm√∂hl 1958 zooplankton was collected by filtering the remaining portion of the integrated water sample through a plankton net with a mesh size of 30 ¬µm and preserved in 4 buffered formalin zooplankton were identified counted and measured under a microscope with an ocular micrometer biomass of cladocerans and copepods was estimated from length weight relationships based on length measurements of 30 individuals of each species zhang and huang 1991 for biomass of rotifers we calculated the individual body volume using geometric shapes and assumed a specific gravity of 1 p excretion by each zooplankton individual was estimated from a regression model of p excretion with temperature and body biomass as independent variables zhang et al 2017 excretion by the entire zooplankton assemblage was obtained by summing the excretion by all individuals and dividing it by the sampling water volume to quantify loss of phosphorus into periphyton growth we placed strips of the same material as the enclosure wall 6 m long and 2 5 cm wide along the insides of the enclosures four strips were clung to the wall on four sides of each enclosures and hung from the top lip of the enclosures and extended all the way to the bottom strips were weighted with a light weight for stability removed at the end of the experiment by gently raising them to the surface strips were scrubbed with a toothbrush to remove periphyton detached periphyton were then filtered through polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 ¬µm and measured as pp following the method described above phosphorus loss by sedimentation from the water column was estimated by placing sediment traps near the bottom of enclosures each trap consisted of three glass pipes 20 cm diameter and 15 cm deep and were suspended from a rope hung from a cross rope at the top of enclosures just before the treatment was applied at the end of the experiment the sediment traps were pulled up very slowly and the water in the traps was decanted carefully sediment trap contents were filtered through polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 ¬µm and measured as pp following the method described above p excretion rate by fish was measured at the end of the experiment fish were recovered from each enclosure and placed for 30 min in an acid washed container holding prefiltered 0 2 ¬µm pore size filter reservoir water kept at enclosure temperature an incubation time of 30 min was used to allow time for accumulating enough p to accurately measure excretion rates dissolved nutrient samples were taken before immediately after and 30 min after the fish were placed in the container samples were also collected in a similar manner from control containers to which no fish had been added to ensure the sample containers did not influence our measurements all water samples were filtered within half an hour through 0 2 ¬µm pore size glass fiber filter to remove particulate matter and analyzed for dip following the method described above excretion rates were determined as the difference between initial and final nutrient concentrations correcting for the volume of water in the container after then fish was weighted wet mass sacrificed dried overnight at 60 c and reweighted to obtain dry mass fish was then ground to powder and subsamples of pulverized fish were analyzed for p concentration using the molybdenum blue method following hcl digestion stainton et al 1977 fish biomass increase rate r was calculated as r ln final biomass ln initial biomass t where t is the number of days of experiment we used linear mixed effects models to statistically analyze the effect of fish on the following variables averaged over the whole experiment period nutrients chla the chla to tp ratio zooplankton biomass zooplankton community structure the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio and p release rate by zooplankton mixed effects analyses were performed with the lme4 package in r individual enclosures were specified as random variable firstly both the fixed and random model components included fish time and their interaction then non significant variables were removed from the models via the backward elimination procedure of the step function in the lmertest package in all final selected models the remaining fixed and random model components included fish and time respectively post hoc comparisons between the three fish treatments of the fixed model part were performed with the ls means function of the lmertest package variables were log transformed prior to analysis 3 results 3 1 temperature and nutrients during the experiment water temperature in the enclosures increased gradually from 22 7 to 29 2 c at the surface and showed no significant treatment differences fig 1 a and b the difference in temperature between the surface and bottom was within 0 5 c throughout the experiment water transparency showed significant treatment differences it was considerably lower in the high fish treatment than in the no fish treatment and higher in the low fish treatment than in the no fish treatment fig 1d in the no fish and high fish treatments transparency steadily declined during the experiment fig 1c concentrations of tn and din steadily declined in all treatments over the course of the experiment and were considerably lower in the high fish treatment than in the low fish and no fish treatments fig 2 rice bran pulse addition resulted in tp concentration increasing steadily in all treatments over the course of the experiment fig 3 a moreover tp concentration was significantly higher in the fishless enclosures than in those containing fish fig 3b dip was significantly elevated in fishless enclosures at the end of the experiment but remained low in those containing fish fig 3c and d in the low fish treatment the proportion of 200 ¬µm pp fraction mainly meso zooplankton first gradually increased from 9 to 42 of tp and then steadily decreased to 12 fig 3e in contrast it remained 10 of tp over the course of the experiment in the high fish treatment the low fish treatment significantly elevated the 200 ¬µm fraction of tp whereas the high fish treatment significantly reduced it compared to the no fish treatment fig 3f 3 2 plankton and fish relative to the initial concentrations chla increased considerably at the end of the experiment in all treatments fig 4 a however the fish effect on chla was biomass dependent chla was significantly lower in the low fish treatment than in the no fish treatment but showed no significant difference between the high fish and no fish treatments fig 4b meanwhile phytoplankton biomass in the high fish treatments mean 3 44 mg l 1 95 confidence interval ci 2 77 4 27 mg l 1 was either higher than the low fish treatment mean 1 67 mg l 1 ci 1 35 2 07 mg l 1 or not significantly different from the no fish treatment mean 2 93 mg l 1 ci 2 37 3 63 mg l 1 the phytoplankton community were initially dominated by ochrophyta primarily dinobryon divergens with greatest axial linear dimension gald 30 ¬µm in all the treatments fig 5 in the low fish and no fish treatments d divergens dominated in the first two weeks and then was replaced by chlorophyta primarily schroederia setigera with gald 30 ¬µm which contributed more than 50 of phytoplankton biomass throughout the rest of the experiment in contrast it was first replaced by bacillariophyta primarily cyclotella and achnanthes with gald of 10 20 ¬µm and then by cyanobacteria primarily rhabdogloea smithii with gald 10 ¬µm in the high fish treatment zooplankton biomass fluctuated greatly over the course of the experiment and the fish effect was biomass dependent fig 6 a and b zooplankton biomass was considerably lower in the high fish treatment mean 1 05 mg l 1 ci 0 83 1 33 mg l 1 than in the no fish treatment mean 1 51 mg l 1 ci 1 19 1 91 mg l 1 but higher in the low fish treatment mean 2 56 mg l 1 ci 2 02 3 24 mg l 1 than in the no fish treatment cladocerans and copepods dominated the zooplankton community in the low fish and no fish treatments whereas in the high fish treatment copepods predominated throughout the experiment fig 7 the relative biomass of rotifer was less than 1 throughout the experiment irrespective of fish biomass the cladoceran community was dominated by large herbivorous species daphnia galeata in the no fish and low fish treatments but by small species such as bosmina fatalis and diaphanosoma orghidani in the high fish treatment at the end of the experiment fish biomass was 5 9 0 2 and 12 5 1 3 g m 3 in the low and high fish treatments respectively fish biomass increase rate was much higher in the low fish than in the high fish treatment fig 8 a 3 3 p excretion rate and p budget zooplankton p excretion rate fluctuated in a similar manner to total zooplankton biomass fig 6e compared to the no fish treatment p excretion rate by zooplankton was either lower in the high fish treatment or higher in the low fish treatment fig 6f in contrast p excretion rate by fish was higher in the high fish treatment than in the low fish treatment fig 8b the overall p excretion by zooplankton and fish in the high fish treatment was either comparable to the no fish treatment or much lower than in the low fish treatment the predicted change in tp in the water column should equal input of p rice bran addition to the water column minus the loss of p through sedimentation and growth of fish and periphyton the observed water column tp was significantly lower in the presence of fish than in their absence fish gained mass in both treatments with fish and this was accompanied by a net sequestration of p in fish table 1 p content of dry weight for silver carp was 1 04 0 04 initially and increased to 1 31 0 11 in the low fish treatment and 1 23 0 03 in the high fish treatment at the end of the experiment the difference in tp between the no fish and low fish treatments at the end of the experiment was 23 3 ¬µg p l 1 while the net amount of p sequestered in fish was 14 ¬µg p l 1 thus p sequestration in fish accounts for 60 of the observed difference in the water column tp between these two treatments similarly the amount of p sequestered in fish can account for 60 of the final difference in the water column between the no fish and high fish treatments accumulation 21 9 ¬µg p l 1 difference between treatments 36 6 ¬µg p l 1 measured loss of p from the water column through periphyton growth was significantly higher in the high fish treatment than in the no fish or low fish treatments table 1 however p loss through sedimentation showed no difference among treatments the discrepancies between predicted and observed increase in water column tp concentration were within 33 ¬µg p l 1 and showed no significant difference among treatments 3 4 trophic structure the ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass zoo phyto and chlorophyll a to tp chla tp fluctuated in a way similar to total zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll a respectively fig 4c and 6c compared to the no fish treatment the zoo phyto ratio was either lower in the high fish treatment or higher in the low fish treatment fig 6d in contrast the chla tp ratio was higher in the high fish treatment than in the no fish treatment and lower in the low fish treatment than in the no fish treatment fig 4d unlike the zoo phyto ratio both the fish to zooplankton biomass fish zoo ratio and fish to phytoplankton biomass fish phyto ratio increased with fish biomass fig 8c and d 4 discussion 4 1 effect of fish on p dynamics phosphorus dynamics in enclosures reflected the balance of p external loading and p leaving the water column through sedimentation and growth of fish and periphyton on enclosure wall table 1 every three days addition of rice bran was more effective in increasing water column tp in fishless enclosures than in enclosures with fish decreased water column tp with increasing fish biomass is not consistent with our hypothesis obligate zooplanktivorous fish can increase water column tp by favoring the dominance of smaller plankton which contribute less to sedimentation mazumder et al 1989 1990 we found that high silver carp biomass changed particulate p size distribution in a way similar to obligate zooplanktivorous fish at the end of the experiment 200 ¬µm particulate p comprised 14 1 11 6 and 8 5 of total p in the no low and high fish treatments respectively though silver carp have a potential to reduce p sedimentation further by direct consumption of detritus lin et al 2020 we found no significant difference in p sedimentation among treatments microscopic observation showed that sedimented material was primarily composed of rice bran and zooplankton remains in the no fish treatment while in the treatments with fish fish feces also accounted for considerable amount of the sedimented material it is likely that the sedimentation of fish fecal might balance the reduced p sedimentation through direct consumption of detritus and changing particulate p size distribution in the presence of fish fish gained mass in enclosures into which they were placed and p sequestration by fish increased with increasing fish biomass thus p loss to fish explained 60 of the difference in tp between enclosures with and without fish meanwhile p loss to periphyton growth also increased with increasing fish biomass and this response is consistent with the results of vanni et al 1997 therefore p loss to fish and periphyton growth accounted for the lower tp concentrations in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures the results obtained in this study disagree with the hypothesis that silver carp might reduce p sedimentation and act as p source to the water column in contrast silver carp can act as p sink to the water column when their biomass is expanding and thus sequestering p our results are consistent with lin et al s 2020 observations in sub tropical chinese reservoirs which reported that selectively harvested biomass of adult bigheaded carp exceeded the biomass of stocked yoy bigheaded carp making them a p sink however they argued that bigheaded carp may be a minor contributor to the p sink because only 0 7 1 8 of the annual p input was sequestered into fish biomass and left these reservoirs through harvesting 4 2 effect of fish on p excretion animals are important in p cycling in freshwater ecosystems and p excretion by them can support a substantial proportion of p demand by phytoplankton see review by vanni 2002 fish mediate p availability to phytoplankton by p excretion by themselves and by zooplankton zooplanktivorous fishes affect p excretion rate by zooplankton through changing zooplankton composition and biomass size selective predation reduces average zooplankton size and increases p excretion per unit biomass bartell 1981 however decreased zooplankton biomass associated with high predation intensity could balance the size dependent increase in p excretion rate bartell 1981 argued that selective planktivory can increase decrease or exert little effect on the overall p flux from zooplankton to the dissolved inorganic pool which may be predation intensity dependent in our study both zooplankton biomass and p excretion rate were much lower at high fish biomass than in the absence of fish or at low fish biomass moreover zooplankton was dominated by d galeata in the absence of fish or at low fish biomass but by copepods at high fish biomass thus silver carp mediated zooplankton p excretion in a manner similar to zooplanktivorous fish it is likely that silver carp stocking at high biomass might decrease zooplankton p excretion by suppressing zooplankton populations it has been commonly assumed that food web configuration determines the relative roles of fish and zooplankton in p cycling persson 1997b schindler et al 1993 found that fish and zooplankton accounted for 16 and 42 respectively of total p recycling in a temperate lake dominated by piscivorous fish and with few zooplanktivorous fish in contrast in another temperate lake dominated by zooplanktivorous fish they found that p excretion by fish accounted for the majority of recycled p 94 vanni et al 2006 argued that p cycling by fish would support relatively more primary production with increasing lake productivity similar to zooplanktivorous fish silver carp tended to increase their p excretion but reduce zooplankton p excretion with increasing fish biomass and thereby increased the relative role of fish in p cycling when silver carp were stocked at low biomass zooplankton biomass was high resulting in higher p excretion by zooplankton than by silver carp however p excretion by silver carp was comparable to that by zooplankton when fish biomass was high because silver carp suppressed zooplankton reducing their excretion moreover the overall p excretion by silver carp and zooplankton was lower at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass the results obtained in this study disagreed with the hypothesis that the overall p excretion would increase with fish biomass our results suggest that increasing silver carp biomass may increase the relative role of fish in p cycling but decrease the overall p excretion by fish and zooplankton 4 3 effect of grazing versus p excretion on phytoplankton silver carp mediate grazing pressure on phytoplankton directly through their consumption of phytoplankton and indirectly by predation on zooplankton in this study both silver carp s grazing pressure on phytoplankton and predation pressure on zooplankton tended to increase with fish biomass as indicated by much higher fish phyto and fish zoo ratios at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass therefore zooplankton biomass was much lower at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass or in absence of fish moreover the zooplankton community shifted from dominance of cladocerans particularly d galeata at low fish biomass or in absence of fish to copepods at high fish biomass our results and earlier studies by lin et al 2020 and zhao et al 2013 clearly highlighted the impact of silver carp biomass on zooplankton biomass and community structure in sub tropical chinese reservoirs our data also supported domaizon devaux s 1999a observations in a temperate eutrophic reservoir that silver carp could have a profound effect on the biomass and composition of the zooplankton as a function of fish biomass they found that the negative effect of silver carp on zooplankton would be minimized when the density of silver carp was below 8 g m 3 however zooplankton was significantly reduced at much lower silver carp biomass 4 8 g m 3 in our experiment the dramatic reduction of zooplankton by silver carp in high fish biomass treatment resulted in a decrease in the zoo phyto ratio and consistently a lower zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton in contrast the fish grazing pressure on phytoplankton was much higher at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass indicated by much higher fish phyto ratio at high fish biomass however relative to low fish biomass much higher chla and chla tp ratio coupled with a lower zooplankton grazing pressure at high fish biomass suggested that zooplankton grazing may be more important than fish grazing in phytoplankton biomass control and fish grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton therefore the overall grazing intensity tended to decrease with increasing fish biomass our results are consistent with lin et al s 2020 observations in sub tropical chinese reservoirs which reported that bigheaded carp introduction induced an increase in chla and the chla tp ratio irrespective of fish grazing pressure our experiment confirmed that silver carp may mediate zooplankton grazing in a manner similar to zooplanktivorous fish moreover studies by lin et al 2014 2020 showed that both zooplankton biomass and the zoo phyto ratio were lower in sub tropical chinese reservoirs stocked with bigheaded carp than those in temperate zooplanktivore dominated lakes with a similar tp range filter feeding fish not only feed on plankton but also consume detritus jeppesen et al 2005 argued that filter feeding fish may have a higher predation pressure on zooplankton than obligate zooplanktivores when subsidized by allochthonous detritus in our experiment p was added as detritus that can be consumed directly by silver carp and zooplankton to analyze the effect of detritus subsidy on trophic structure we compared our data with a dissolved inorganic p enrichment experiment conducted by zhao et al 2013 in the same experimental enclosures at liuxihe reservoir and in the same period 24 april 7 june in 2008 data provided by zhao in their treatment with silver carp stocking and p enrichment at low concentration fln the initial fish biomass 4 3 g m 3 was similar to our high fish treatment but p was added as dissolved inorganic form despite the p addition was only two thirds of zhao et al s fln treatment silver carp reached a much higher biomass in our high fish treatment 12 5 g m 3 than in zhao et al s fln treatment 7 8 g m 3 at the end of the experiments indicating that silver carp was subsidized by detritus in our high fish treatment consequently both the fish zoo and fish phyto ratios was much higher in our high fish treatment 15 6 and 2 9 respectively than in zhao et al s fln treatment 4 3 and 0 4 respectively at the end of the experiments however much higher fish predation pressure did not lead to a lower zoo phyto ratio in our high fish treatment 0 38 than in zhao et al s fln treatment 0 1 at the end of the experiments suggesting that zooplankton was also subsidized by detritus in our high fish treatment therefore it is likely that detritus subsidy may enhance fish and zooplankton grazing control on phytoplankton to some extent leading to a somewhat lower chla tp ratio in our high fish treatment 0 42 than in zhao et al s fln treatment 0 52 however these increases in zooplankton and fish grazing could not compensate for the loss of zooplankton grazing due to fish predation as indicated by much higher chla tp ratio coupled with a lower zoo phyto ratio in our high fish treatment than in zhao et al s treatment with no fish stocking and p enrichment at low concentration 0 32 and 4 8 respectively at the end of the experiments based on a multiple lake fish manipulation experiment sarnelle knapp 2005 suggested that zooplankton grazing may be more important as a driver of trophic cascades than p recycling by zooplanktivorous fish in this study silver carp mediated zooplankton biomass and composition and p excretion in a manner similar to zooplanktivorous fish p recycling in the water column provided essentially the entire p requirement for phytoplankton growth compared to enclosures with high silver carp biomass phytoplankton were subject to heavier zooplankton grazing pressure but more p availability in enclosures with no fish or low fish biomass as indicated by much higher zoo phyto ratio and p excretion rate under these conditions phytoplankton may be limited by grazers rather than by p availability leading to lower phytoplankton biomass and yield of chla per tp in contrast in enclosures with high fish biomass both zooplankton biomass and zoo phyto ratio were lower than in enclosures with no fish or low fish biomass while the overall p excretion rate was either comparable to fishless enclosures or much lower than in enclosures with low fish biomass this suggests that enhanced phytoplankton biomass accompanying the presence of high fish biomass was primarily due to reduced herbivory by zooplankton low zooplankton grazing pressure also allowed phytoplankton to be more efficient at converting p into biomass leading to higher yield of chla per tp this increase in phytoplankton biomass however can not exceed the supply of p similarly a mesocosm experiment using nested design in a eutrophic shallow lake by shen et al 2021 showed that silver carp grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton and high fish stocking biomass would stimulate phytoplankton growth by reducing zooplankton grazing rather than through nutrient recycling our results also confirm lin et al s 2020 findings that bigheaded carp interact synergistically with trophic state so that the limnological effects of bigheaded carp become more intense with increased eutrophication the difference in zooplankton grazing pressure between high and low fish biomass treatments explained the changes in phytoplankton biomass and yield of chla per tp meanwhile the phytoplankton communities also developed differently as a function of fish biomass dinobryon divergens dominated phytoplankton initially and then was replaced by s setigera in enclosures with no fish or low fish biomass however both species had a gald 30 ¬µm and were likely inedible to zooplankton generally grazing by zooplankton favors the development of a phytoplankton community dominated by grazing resistant species such as large species sterner 2003 much higher zoo phyto ratio coupled with the dominance of large phytoplankton indicated that zooplankton grazing was strong enough to suppress small phytoplankton and p enrichment would change species composition rather than size composition in contrast the dominant phytoplankton species in enclosures with high fish biomass changed first from d divergens to cyclotella and achnanthes with gald of 10 20 ¬µm and then to rhabdogloea smithii with gald 10 ¬µm silver carp are ineffective at filtering particles 10 ¬µm smith 1989 v√∂r√∂s et al 1997 relatively higher fish phyto ratio coupled with a lower zoo phyto ratio suggested that large phytoplankton might be inhibited by fish grazing while small phytoplankton flourish due to release from zooplankton grazing our results also supported domaizon devaux s 1999b observations in a temperate eutrophic reservoir that high silver carp biomass would enhance the development of nanophytoplankton and decrease water transparency conclusions our experimental study highlights the effect of silver carp biomass on p dynamics and zooplankton grazing when subsidized by allochthonous detritus silver carp can act as p sink to the water column when their population biomass is expanding meanwhile zooplankton biomass and structure would be modified as a function of silver carp biomass silver carp stocked at high biomass level decrease zooplankton p excretion by suppressing zooplankton populations and increasing stocking density tend to increase the relative role of fish in p cycling but decrease the overall p excretion by zooplankton and fish zooplankton grazing is a major factor relative to fish mediated p recycling and fish grazing influencing phytoplankton biomass and the yield of phytoplankton per tp drastic reduction in cladocerans biomass by fish predation may result in a reduced zooplankton grazing pressure and an increase in yield of phytoplankton per tp limitation of phytoplankton tends to shift from one of zooplankton grazing control when silver carp biomass is low to one of limitation by p availability when fish biomass is high for eutrophic sub tropical chinese reservoirs management the use of silver carp must be considered carefully stocking silver carp at high biomass cannot be recommended for phytoplankton control if the goal is to reduce the entire phytoplankton biomass furthermore a reduction of the external p loading should have highest priority

16624,stocking of filter feeding fish is a common tool used in sub tropical chinese reservoirs to control phytoplankton however field investigations have showed that such stocking would enhance instead of controlling phytoplankton in these reservoirs reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catchments which may constitute an important carbon source to filter feeding fish whether direct consumption of detritus increases the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphorus p to phytoplankton and thereby provides resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass is debated we conducted an enclosure experiment in a sub tropical chinese reservoir liuxihe reservoir to assess how a gradient of filter feeding fish silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix biomass affected p dynamics and fish grazing and predation when subsidized by allochthonous detritus fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of p tp concentration in the water column increased over time in all enclosures but the presence of fish slowed its increase thus tp decreased with increasing fish biomass fish were a net sink of p to the water column because they gained mass during the experiment moreover p sequestered by fish could largely account for the lower tp concentrations observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures fish presence at high biomass strongly reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and p excretion by zooplankton however the negative effect of fish predation on zooplankton was negligible when fish was present at low biomass increasing fish biomass increased the relative role of fish in p cycling but decreased the overall p excretion by fish and zooplankton compared to enclosures with high fish biomass both zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy and the overall p excretion were much higher whereas fish grazing effect on phytoplankton fish phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy chlorophyll a and the yield of chlorophyll a per tp were much lower in enclosures with low fish biomass this suggested that phytoplankton limitation might shift from one of zooplankton control to one of limitation by p availability with increasing fish biomass relative to fish mediated p recycling and fish grazing zooplankton grazing appeared to be more important as a driver of trophic cascades in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus silver carp stocked at high biomass would strongly reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase the yield of phytoplankton per tp graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords mesocosm filter feeding fish phytoplankton trophic cascade phosphorus recycling 1 introduction silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis collectively referred to as bigheaded carp are large omnivorous filter feeders that occupy the upper and middle layers of the pelagic zone due to their ability to filter phytoplankton they have been widely stocked to improve the ecological quality of water bodies see review by kolar et al 2005 lin et al 2020 however controversies remain about the effect of bigheaded carp on phytoplankton some studies found that silver carp were efficient in suppressing cyanobacteria blooms e g radke and kahl 2002 guo et al 2015 however others demonstrated that they can adversely affect the water quality and native planktivorous fish populations e g sampson et al 2009 lin et al 2014 collins and wahl 2017 tumolo and flinn 2017 solomon et al 2016 found that the establishment of bigheaded carp in the illinois river not only decreased the densities of native planktivorous fish but also altered other non planktivorous fish community members lin et al 2020 argued that bigheaded carp acted as p source for phytoplankton and enhanced the yield of chlorophyll a per tp in sub tropical chinese reservoirs an enclosure experiment by domaizon and devaux 1999a suggested that the success of phytoplankton control by silver carp was probably largely dependent on fish biomass and plankton community structure fish influence phytoplankton biomass through both bottom up and top down processes attayde and hansson 2001a 2001b lemmens et al 2018 planktivorous fish recycle p in the water column and mediate p availability to phytoplankton by p excretion by themselves and or by zooplankton some studies have suggested nutrient recycling to be an important source of nutrients to phytoplankton and the relative importance of p excretion by fish and zooplankton should depend on fish biomass the composition of their diet and zooplankton community structure and biomass e g schindler et al 1993 persson 1997a zooplanktivorous fish tend to increase zooplankton p excretion rate by shifting zooplankton community towards small bodied species that have a higher mass specific excretion rate vanni and findlay 1990 enclosure experiments using nested designs caging either the fish or the phytoplankton away from the zooplankton in eutrophic lakes showed that enhanced nutrient availability stimulated by zooplanktivorous fish significantly increased phytoplankton biomass and most of the fish mediated nutrient recycling effects were due to increased nutrient recycling by zooplankton rather than direct nutrient excretion by fish persson 1997b attayde and hansson 2001a b unlike zooplanktivorous fish detritivorous fish can supply new p to the water column by consuming sedimented detritus and releasing detritus associated p into water column kelly et al 2018 argued that recycling detritus bound p by detritivorous fish would be an important source of p for phytoplankton and thus provide resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass in acton lake bigheaded carp consume phytoplankton zooplankton and suspended detritus and may thus reach a higher carrying capacity than obligate zooplanktvores see review by jeppesen et al 2005 they may not only mediate p recycling in a way similar to obligate zooplanktivorous fish but also recycle detritus bound p by direct consumption of suspended detritus it is likely that bigheaded carp have a potential to increase phytoplankton productivity by enhancing p recycling fish mediated grazing pressure is another mechanism regulating phytoplankton biomass and community composition bigheaded carp consume phytoplankton and their filtering efficiency partly depends on the mesh size of their gill rakers and on the size and shape of phytoplankton in contrast to herbivorous zooplankton silver carp are more effective at filtering net phytoplankton from the water v√∂r√∂s et al 1997 they can suppress net phytoplankton through direct grazing and enhance small phytoplankton through reducing zooplankton grazing pressure zhao et al 2013 some studies showed that silver carp grazing was more important than their predation for phytoplankton dynamics and reduced phytoplankton when large phytoplankton accounted for a greater proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass e g starling 1993 guo et al 2015 in contrast other studies demonstrated that fish predation would be more important when phytoplankton were dominated by small species and fish presence reduced zooplankton grazing and thereby increased total phytoplankton biomass e g zhao et al 2013 domaizon devaux 1999a and b suggested that the effect of silver carp on herbivorous zooplankton should be fish biomass dependent and the negative effect of fish on zooplankton would be minimized when stocking at low biomass in planktivore dominated systems fish predation can reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase p recycling which act in concert to enhance phytoplankton resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass per unit p than in piscivore dominated systems vanni and findlay 1990 schindler et al 1993 moreover the relative importance of planktivorous fish predation and excretion for phytoplankton dynamics should change along the trophic gradient nutrient excretion by planktivorous fish tends to be more important than their predation for phytoplankton dynamics in lakes with low p inputs and a relative high fish biomass which may arise when fish consume considerable amounts of littoral benthic resources attayde and hansson 2001b in sub tropical chinese reservoirs stocked with bigheaded carp lin et al 2014 2020 found that the effect of fish on p recycling was beyond their herbivorous effect on phytoplankton and the yield of phytoplankton per tp increased with increasing fish biomass tropical and subtropical chinese reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catchments hou et al 2013 ning et al 2013 lin et al 2018 which may constitute an important carbon source to bigheaded carp lin et al 2020 argued that bigheaded carp by direct consumption of terrestrial detritus would reduce the sedimentation of terrestrial detritus derived p and thereby increase the availability of dissolved inorganic p to the phytoplankton via excretion in this study we conducted a 2 month enclosure experiment in a sub tropical chinese reservoir liuxihe reservoir to examine how bigheaded carp biomass influence fish grazing and predation and p dynamics in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus we used silver carp as a model organism because it is widely stocked to control phytoplankton in sub tropical chinese reservoirs we hypothesized that 1 silver carp would reduce p sedimentation and act as p source to the water column that 2 overall p excretion by fish and zooplankton would increase with fish biomass and that 3 relative to zooplankton or fish grazing fish mediated p recycling would be more important as a driver of trophic cascades enhancing the yield of phytoplankton biomass per tp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design we conducted enclosure experiment during 10 april 4 june 2015 at liuxihe reservoir 23 45 10 n 113 46 55 e south china enclosures were made of light blue high density polyethylene film 4 4 m2 6 m deep and sealed at the bottom the top of each enclosure was open to the atmosphere and ca 50 cm above the water surface to prevent fish jumping into or out of the enclosure therefore the water column in the enclosures was ca 5 5 m deep yielding a volume of about 88 m3 details of the enclosures and the reservoir are described in zhao et al 2013 and lin et al 2018 we established three treatments fishless low fish 0 5 g m 3 and high fish 4 8 g m 3 each treatment consisted of three replicate enclosures fish biomass used in the high fish treatment was similar to silver carp stocking level in liuxihe reservoir lin et al 2020 and previous experiment conducted by zhao et al 2013 in the same experiment enclosures all enclosures were filled simultaneously with reservoir water at installation by allowing water to enter through a 2 mm mesh nylon net in an attempt to avoid unwanted fish the plankton communities in the enclosures were left to equilibrate for two weeks before the treatments were applied silver carp 10 0 5 cm total length and 9 0 2 g wet mass that were obtained from a fish hatchery were acclimatized reservoir plankton and water conditions in enclosures during two weeks prior to the experiment two fish groups low fish and high fish were stocked with 5 and 45 silver carp per enclosure respectively all added fish were captured at the end of the experiment and no fish were lost allochthonous detritus was added as 40 ¬µm rice bran 12 5 mg p g 1 44 2 mg n g 1 each enclosure received addition of 34 g rice bran every three days from 10 april to 4 jun and each addition was enough to increase enclosure tp and tn by 5 ¬µg p l 1 and 17 7 ¬µg n l 1 respectively total phosphorus addition was similar to p load in flood season in liuxihe reservoir lin et al 2018 2 2 sampling methods we quantified the concentrations of n and p in the water column including total dissolved inorganic and 200 ¬µm particulate fractions and constructed a p budget for the enclosures to do so we quantified the amounts of p sequestered in periphyton growing on the inside walls of enclosures p lost from the water column through sedimentation and net accumulation of p through fish mass gain we attempted to construct such a budget to shed light on how fish affect the fate of p and whether fish mediate the loss of p from the water column we quantified zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition to assess whether shifts in fish biomass corresponded with shifts in zooplankton and phytoplankton communities as predicted by trophic cascade theory we also estimated p excretion rates by fish and zooplankton to assess whether fish increased p availability to phytoplankton prior to the start of experiment the enclosures were sampled on 9 april to assess pretreatment conditions after the treatments were begun on 10 april the enclosures were sampled weekly water temperature and transparency measured as secchi depth were also measured weekly a 60 l water sample was taken with a 5 l uwitec water sampler integrated over the whole water column in each enclosure a 10 l portion of water was collected for analysis of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip 200 ¬µm particulate phosphorus pp total phosphorus tp total dissolved inorganic nitrogen din total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chla subsamples were fractionated within 1 h of collection with polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 ¬µm and preached nitex screens with mesh size of 200 ¬µm filtrate through 0 2 ¬µm was analyzed for dip with the molybdenum blue method and din with the uv method after potassium persulfate digestion murphy and riley 1962 tp and 200 ¬µm pp were determined as molybdate reactive phosphorus following persulfate digestion and tn as nitrate by the uv method after potassium persulfate digestion menzel and corwin 1965 gross et al 1999 chla was determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in acetone a 300 ml portion of the sampled water was preserved with 1 lugol s for phytoplankton enumeration phytoplankton was identified and counted using an uterm√∂hl chamber and inverted microscope and volumes estimated from geometrical shapes uterm√∂hl 1958 zooplankton was collected by filtering the remaining portion of the integrated water sample through a plankton net with a mesh size of 30 ¬µm and preserved in 4 buffered formalin zooplankton were identified counted and measured under a microscope with an ocular micrometer biomass of cladocerans and copepods was estimated from length weight relationships based on length measurements of 30 individuals of each species zhang and huang 1991 for biomass of rotifers we calculated the individual body volume using geometric shapes and assumed a specific gravity of 1 p excretion by each zooplankton individual was estimated from a regression model of p excretion with temperature and body biomass as independent variables zhang et al 2017 excretion by the entire zooplankton assemblage was obtained by summing the excretion by all individuals and dividing it by the sampling water volume to quantify loss of phosphorus into periphyton growth we placed strips of the same material as the enclosure wall 6 m long and 2 5 cm wide along the insides of the enclosures four strips were clung to the wall on four sides of each enclosures and hung from the top lip of the enclosures and extended all the way to the bottom strips were weighted with a light weight for stability removed at the end of the experiment by gently raising them to the surface strips were scrubbed with a toothbrush to remove periphyton detached periphyton were then filtered through polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 ¬µm and measured as pp following the method described above phosphorus loss by sedimentation from the water column was estimated by placing sediment traps near the bottom of enclosures each trap consisted of three glass pipes 20 cm diameter and 15 cm deep and were suspended from a rope hung from a cross rope at the top of enclosures just before the treatment was applied at the end of the experiment the sediment traps were pulled up very slowly and the water in the traps was decanted carefully sediment trap contents were filtered through polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 ¬µm and measured as pp following the method described above p excretion rate by fish was measured at the end of the experiment fish were recovered from each enclosure and placed for 30 min in an acid washed container holding prefiltered 0 2 ¬µm pore size filter reservoir water kept at enclosure temperature an incubation time of 30 min was used to allow time for accumulating enough p to accurately measure excretion rates dissolved nutrient samples were taken before immediately after and 30 min after the fish were placed in the container samples were also collected in a similar manner from control containers to which no fish had been added to ensure the sample containers did not influence our measurements all water samples were filtered within half an hour through 0 2 ¬µm pore size glass fiber filter to remove particulate matter and analyzed for dip following the method described above excretion rates were determined as the difference between initial and final nutrient concentrations correcting for the volume of water in the container after then fish was weighted wet mass sacrificed dried overnight at 60 c and reweighted to obtain dry mass fish was then ground to powder and subsamples of pulverized fish were analyzed for p concentration using the molybdenum blue method following hcl digestion stainton et al 1977 fish biomass increase rate r was calculated as r ln final biomass ln initial biomass t where t is the number of days of experiment we used linear mixed effects models to statistically analyze the effect of fish on the following variables averaged over the whole experiment period nutrients chla the chla to tp ratio zooplankton biomass zooplankton community structure the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio and p release rate by zooplankton mixed effects analyses were performed with the lme4 package in r individual enclosures were specified as random variable firstly both the fixed and random model components included fish time and their interaction then non significant variables were removed from the models via the backward elimination procedure of the step function in the lmertest package in all final selected models the remaining fixed and random model components included fish and time respectively post hoc comparisons between the three fish treatments of the fixed model part were performed with the ls means function of the lmertest package variables were log transformed prior to analysis 3 results 3 1 temperature and nutrients during the experiment water temperature in the enclosures increased gradually from 22 7 to 29 2 c at the surface and showed no significant treatment differences fig 1 a and b the difference in temperature between the surface and bottom was within 0 5 c throughout the experiment water transparency showed significant treatment differences it was considerably lower in the high fish treatment than in the no fish treatment and higher in the low fish treatment than in the no fish treatment fig 1d in the no fish and high fish treatments transparency steadily declined during the experiment fig 1c concentrations of tn and din steadily declined in all treatments over the course of the experiment and were considerably lower in the high fish treatment than in the low fish and no fish treatments fig 2 rice bran pulse addition resulted in tp concentration increasing steadily in all treatments over the course of the experiment fig 3 a moreover tp concentration was significantly higher in the fishless enclosures than in those containing fish fig 3b dip was significantly elevated in fishless enclosures at the end of the experiment but remained low in those containing fish fig 3c and d in the low fish treatment the proportion of 200 ¬µm pp fraction mainly meso zooplankton first gradually increased from 9 to 42 of tp and then steadily decreased to 12 fig 3e in contrast it remained 10 of tp over the course of the experiment in the high fish treatment the low fish treatment significantly elevated the 200 ¬µm fraction of tp whereas the high fish treatment significantly reduced it compared to the no fish treatment fig 3f 3 2 plankton and fish relative to the initial concentrations chla increased considerably at the end of the experiment in all treatments fig 4 a however the fish effect on chla was biomass dependent chla was significantly lower in the low fish treatment than in the no fish treatment but showed no significant difference between the high fish and no fish treatments fig 4b meanwhile phytoplankton biomass in the high fish treatments mean 3 44 mg l 1 95 confidence interval ci 2 77 4 27 mg l 1 was either higher than the low fish treatment mean 1 67 mg l 1 ci 1 35 2 07 mg l 1 or not significantly different from the no fish treatment mean 2 93 mg l 1 ci 2 37 3 63 mg l 1 the phytoplankton community were initially dominated by ochrophyta primarily dinobryon divergens with greatest axial linear dimension gald 30 ¬µm in all the treatments fig 5 in the low fish and no fish treatments d divergens dominated in the first two weeks and then was replaced by chlorophyta primarily schroederia setigera with gald 30 ¬µm which contributed more than 50 of phytoplankton biomass throughout the rest of the experiment in contrast it was first replaced by bacillariophyta primarily cyclotella and achnanthes with gald of 10 20 ¬µm and then by cyanobacteria primarily rhabdogloea smithii with gald 10 ¬µm in the high fish treatment zooplankton biomass fluctuated greatly over the course of the experiment and the fish effect was biomass dependent fig 6 a and b zooplankton biomass was considerably lower in the high fish treatment mean 1 05 mg l 1 ci 0 83 1 33 mg l 1 than in the no fish treatment mean 1 51 mg l 1 ci 1 19 1 91 mg l 1 but higher in the low fish treatment mean 2 56 mg l 1 ci 2 02 3 24 mg l 1 than in the no fish treatment cladocerans and copepods dominated the zooplankton community in the low fish and no fish treatments whereas in the high fish treatment copepods predominated throughout the experiment fig 7 the relative biomass of rotifer was less than 1 throughout the experiment irrespective of fish biomass the cladoceran community was dominated by large herbivorous species daphnia galeata in the no fish and low fish treatments but by small species such as bosmina fatalis and diaphanosoma orghidani in the high fish treatment at the end of the experiment fish biomass was 5 9 0 2 and 12 5 1 3 g m 3 in the low and high fish treatments respectively fish biomass increase rate was much higher in the low fish than in the high fish treatment fig 8 a 3 3 p excretion rate and p budget zooplankton p excretion rate fluctuated in a similar manner to total zooplankton biomass fig 6e compared to the no fish treatment p excretion rate by zooplankton was either lower in the high fish treatment or higher in the low fish treatment fig 6f in contrast p excretion rate by fish was higher in the high fish treatment than in the low fish treatment fig 8b the overall p excretion by zooplankton and fish in the high fish treatment was either comparable to the no fish treatment or much lower than in the low fish treatment the predicted change in tp in the water column should equal input of p rice bran addition to the water column minus the loss of p through sedimentation and growth of fish and periphyton the observed water column tp was significantly lower in the presence of fish than in their absence fish gained mass in both treatments with fish and this was accompanied by a net sequestration of p in fish table 1 p content of dry weight for silver carp was 1 04 0 04 initially and increased to 1 31 0 11 in the low fish treatment and 1 23 0 03 in the high fish treatment at the end of the experiment the difference in tp between the no fish and low fish treatments at the end of the experiment was 23 3 ¬µg p l 1 while the net amount of p sequestered in fish was 14 ¬µg p l 1 thus p sequestration in fish accounts for 60 of the observed difference in the water column tp between these two treatments similarly the amount of p sequestered in fish can account for 60 of the final difference in the water column between the no fish and high fish treatments accumulation 21 9 ¬µg p l 1 difference between treatments 36 6 ¬µg p l 1 measured loss of p from the water column through periphyton growth was significantly higher in the high fish treatment than in the no fish or low fish treatments table 1 however p loss through sedimentation showed no difference among treatments the discrepancies between predicted and observed increase in water column tp concentration were within 33 ¬µg p l 1 and showed no significant difference among treatments 3 4 trophic structure the ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass zoo phyto and chlorophyll a to tp chla tp fluctuated in a way similar to total zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll a respectively fig 4c and 6c compared to the no fish treatment the zoo phyto ratio was either lower in the high fish treatment or higher in the low fish treatment fig 6d in contrast the chla tp ratio was higher in the high fish treatment than in the no fish treatment and lower in the low fish treatment than in the no fish treatment fig 4d unlike the zoo phyto ratio both the fish to zooplankton biomass fish zoo ratio and fish to phytoplankton biomass fish phyto ratio increased with fish biomass fig 8c and d 4 discussion 4 1 effect of fish on p dynamics phosphorus dynamics in enclosures reflected the balance of p external loading and p leaving the water column through sedimentation and growth of fish and periphyton on enclosure wall table 1 every three days addition of rice bran was more effective in increasing water column tp in fishless enclosures than in enclosures with fish decreased water column tp with increasing fish biomass is not consistent with our hypothesis obligate zooplanktivorous fish can increase water column tp by favoring the dominance of smaller plankton which contribute less to sedimentation mazumder et al 1989 1990 we found that high silver carp biomass changed particulate p size distribution in a way similar to obligate zooplanktivorous fish at the end of the experiment 200 ¬µm particulate p comprised 14 1 11 6 and 8 5 of total p in the no low and high fish treatments respectively though silver carp have a potential to reduce p sedimentation further by direct consumption of detritus lin et al 2020 we found no significant difference in p sedimentation among treatments microscopic observation showed that sedimented material was primarily composed of rice bran and zooplankton remains in the no fish treatment while in the treatments with fish fish feces also accounted for considerable amount of the sedimented material it is likely that the sedimentation of fish fecal might balance the reduced p sedimentation through direct consumption of detritus and changing particulate p size distribution in the presence of fish fish gained mass in enclosures into which they were placed and p sequestration by fish increased with increasing fish biomass thus p loss to fish explained 60 of the difference in tp between enclosures with and without fish meanwhile p loss to periphyton growth also increased with increasing fish biomass and this response is consistent with the results of vanni et al 1997 therefore p loss to fish and periphyton growth accounted for the lower tp concentrations in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures the results obtained in this study disagree with the hypothesis that silver carp might reduce p sedimentation and act as p source to the water column in contrast silver carp can act as p sink to the water column when their biomass is expanding and thus sequestering p our results are consistent with lin et al s 2020 observations in sub tropical chinese reservoirs which reported that selectively harvested biomass of adult bigheaded carp exceeded the biomass of stocked yoy bigheaded carp making them a p sink however they argued that bigheaded carp may be a minor contributor to the p sink because only 0 7 1 8 of the annual p input was sequestered into fish biomass and left these reservoirs through harvesting 4 2 effect of fish on p excretion animals are important in p cycling in freshwater ecosystems and p excretion by them can support a substantial proportion of p demand by phytoplankton see review by vanni 2002 fish mediate p availability to phytoplankton by p excretion by themselves and by zooplankton zooplanktivorous fishes affect p excretion rate by zooplankton through changing zooplankton composition and biomass size selective predation reduces average zooplankton size and increases p excretion per unit biomass bartell 1981 however decreased zooplankton biomass associated with high predation intensity could balance the size dependent increase in p excretion rate bartell 1981 argued that selective planktivory can increase decrease or exert little effect on the overall p flux from zooplankton to the dissolved inorganic pool which may be predation intensity dependent in our study both zooplankton biomass and p excretion rate were much lower at high fish biomass than in the absence of fish or at low fish biomass moreover zooplankton was dominated by d galeata in the absence of fish or at low fish biomass but by copepods at high fish biomass thus silver carp mediated zooplankton p excretion in a manner similar to zooplanktivorous fish it is likely that silver carp stocking at high biomass might decrease zooplankton p excretion by suppressing zooplankton populations it has been commonly assumed that food web configuration determines the relative roles of fish and zooplankton in p cycling persson 1997b schindler et al 1993 found that fish and zooplankton accounted for 16 and 42 respectively of total p recycling in a temperate lake dominated by piscivorous fish and with few zooplanktivorous fish in contrast in another temperate lake dominated by zooplanktivorous fish they found that p excretion by fish accounted for the majority of recycled p 94 vanni et al 2006 argued that p cycling by fish would support relatively more primary production with increasing lake productivity similar to zooplanktivorous fish silver carp tended to increase their p excretion but reduce zooplankton p excretion with increasing fish biomass and thereby increased the relative role of fish in p cycling when silver carp were stocked at low biomass zooplankton biomass was high resulting in higher p excretion by zooplankton than by silver carp however p excretion by silver carp was comparable to that by zooplankton when fish biomass was high because silver carp suppressed zooplankton reducing their excretion moreover the overall p excretion by silver carp and zooplankton was lower at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass the results obtained in this study disagreed with the hypothesis that the overall p excretion would increase with fish biomass our results suggest that increasing silver carp biomass may increase the relative role of fish in p cycling but decrease the overall p excretion by fish and zooplankton 4 3 effect of grazing versus p excretion on phytoplankton silver carp mediate grazing pressure on phytoplankton directly through their consumption of phytoplankton and indirectly by predation on zooplankton in this study both silver carp s grazing pressure on phytoplankton and predation pressure on zooplankton tended to increase with fish biomass as indicated by much higher fish phyto and fish zoo ratios at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass therefore zooplankton biomass was much lower at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass or in absence of fish moreover the zooplankton community shifted from dominance of cladocerans particularly d galeata at low fish biomass or in absence of fish to copepods at high fish biomass our results and earlier studies by lin et al 2020 and zhao et al 2013 clearly highlighted the impact of silver carp biomass on zooplankton biomass and community structure in sub tropical chinese reservoirs our data also supported domaizon devaux s 1999a observations in a temperate eutrophic reservoir that silver carp could have a profound effect on the biomass and composition of the zooplankton as a function of fish biomass they found that the negative effect of silver carp on zooplankton would be minimized when the density of silver carp was below 8 g m 3 however zooplankton was significantly reduced at much lower silver carp biomass 4 8 g m 3 in our experiment the dramatic reduction of zooplankton by silver carp in high fish biomass treatment resulted in a decrease in the zoo phyto ratio and consistently a lower zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton in contrast the fish grazing pressure on phytoplankton was much higher at high fish biomass than at low fish biomass indicated by much higher fish phyto ratio at high fish biomass however relative to low fish biomass much higher chla and chla tp ratio coupled with a lower zooplankton grazing pressure at high fish biomass suggested that zooplankton grazing may be more important than fish grazing in phytoplankton biomass control and fish grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton therefore the overall grazing intensity tended to decrease with increasing fish biomass our results are consistent with lin et al s 2020 observations in sub tropical chinese reservoirs which reported that bigheaded carp introduction induced an increase in chla and the chla tp ratio irrespective of fish grazing pressure our experiment confirmed that silver carp may mediate zooplankton grazing in a manner similar to zooplanktivorous fish moreover studies by lin et al 2014 2020 showed that both zooplankton biomass and the zoo phyto ratio were lower in sub tropical chinese reservoirs stocked with bigheaded carp than those in temperate zooplanktivore dominated lakes with a similar tp range filter feeding fish not only feed on plankton but also consume detritus jeppesen et al 2005 argued that filter feeding fish may have a higher predation pressure on zooplankton than obligate zooplanktivores when subsidized by allochthonous detritus in our experiment p was added as detritus that can be consumed directly by silver carp and zooplankton to analyze the effect of detritus subsidy on trophic structure we compared our data with a dissolved inorganic p enrichment experiment conducted by zhao et al 2013 in the same experimental enclosures at liuxihe reservoir and in the same period 24 april 7 june in 2008 data provided by zhao in their treatment with silver carp stocking and p enrichment at low concentration fln the initial fish biomass 4 3 g m 3 was similar to our high fish treatment but p was added as dissolved inorganic form despite the p addition was only two thirds of zhao et al s fln treatment silver carp reached a much higher biomass in our high fish treatment 12 5 g m 3 than in zhao et al s fln treatment 7 8 g m 3 at the end of the experiments indicating that silver carp was subsidized by detritus in our high fish treatment consequently both the fish zoo and fish phyto ratios was much higher in our high fish treatment 15 6 and 2 9 respectively than in zhao et al s fln treatment 4 3 and 0 4 respectively at the end of the experiments however much higher fish predation pressure did not lead to a lower zoo phyto ratio in our high fish treatment 0 38 than in zhao et al s fln treatment 0 1 at the end of the experiments suggesting that zooplankton was also subsidized by detritus in our high fish treatment therefore it is likely that detritus subsidy may enhance fish and zooplankton grazing control on phytoplankton to some extent leading to a somewhat lower chla tp ratio in our high fish treatment 0 42 than in zhao et al s fln treatment 0 52 however these increases in zooplankton and fish grazing could not compensate for the loss of zooplankton grazing due to fish predation as indicated by much higher chla tp ratio coupled with a lower zoo phyto ratio in our high fish treatment than in zhao et al s treatment with no fish stocking and p enrichment at low concentration 0 32 and 4 8 respectively at the end of the experiments based on a multiple lake fish manipulation experiment sarnelle knapp 2005 suggested that zooplankton grazing may be more important as a driver of trophic cascades than p recycling by zooplanktivorous fish in this study silver carp mediated zooplankton biomass and composition and p excretion in a manner similar to zooplanktivorous fish p recycling in the water column provided essentially the entire p requirement for phytoplankton growth compared to enclosures with high silver carp biomass phytoplankton were subject to heavier zooplankton grazing pressure but more p availability in enclosures with no fish or low fish biomass as indicated by much higher zoo phyto ratio and p excretion rate under these conditions phytoplankton may be limited by grazers rather than by p availability leading to lower phytoplankton biomass and yield of chla per tp in contrast in enclosures with high fish biomass both zooplankton biomass and zoo phyto ratio were lower than in enclosures with no fish or low fish biomass while the overall p excretion rate was either comparable to fishless enclosures or much lower than in enclosures with low fish biomass this suggests that enhanced phytoplankton biomass accompanying the presence of high fish biomass was primarily due to reduced herbivory by zooplankton low zooplankton grazing pressure also allowed phytoplankton to be more efficient at converting p into biomass leading to higher yield of chla per tp this increase in phytoplankton biomass however can not exceed the supply of p similarly a mesocosm experiment using nested design in a eutrophic shallow lake by shen et al 2021 showed that silver carp grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton and high fish stocking biomass would stimulate phytoplankton growth by reducing zooplankton grazing rather than through nutrient recycling our results also confirm lin et al s 2020 findings that bigheaded carp interact synergistically with trophic state so that the limnological effects of bigheaded carp become more intense with increased eutrophication the difference in zooplankton grazing pressure between high and low fish biomass treatments explained the changes in phytoplankton biomass and yield of chla per tp meanwhile the phytoplankton communities also developed differently as a function of fish biomass dinobryon divergens dominated phytoplankton initially and then was replaced by s setigera in enclosures with no fish or low fish biomass however both species had a gald 30 ¬µm and were likely inedible to zooplankton generally grazing by zooplankton favors the development of a phytoplankton community dominated by grazing resistant species such as large species sterner 2003 much higher zoo phyto ratio coupled with the dominance of large phytoplankton indicated that zooplankton grazing was strong enough to suppress small phytoplankton and p enrichment would change species composition rather than size composition in contrast the dominant phytoplankton species in enclosures with high fish biomass changed first from d divergens to cyclotella and achnanthes with gald of 10 20 ¬µm and then to rhabdogloea smithii with gald 10 ¬µm silver carp are ineffective at filtering particles 10 ¬µm smith 1989 v√∂r√∂s et al 1997 relatively higher fish phyto ratio coupled with a lower zoo phyto ratio suggested that large phytoplankton might be inhibited by fish grazing while small phytoplankton flourish due to release from zooplankton grazing our results also supported domaizon devaux s 1999b observations in a temperate eutrophic reservoir that high silver carp biomass would enhance the development of nanophytoplankton and decrease water transparency conclusions our experimental study highlights the effect of silver carp biomass on p dynamics and zooplankton grazing when subsidized by allochthonous detritus silver carp can act as p sink to the water column when their population biomass is expanding meanwhile zooplankton biomass and structure would be modified as a function of silver carp biomass silver carp stocked at high biomass level decrease zooplankton p excretion by suppressing zooplankton populations and increasing stocking density tend to increase the relative role of fish in p cycling but decrease the overall p excretion by zooplankton and fish zooplankton grazing is a major factor relative to fish mediated p recycling and fish grazing influencing phytoplankton biomass and the yield of phytoplankton per tp drastic reduction in cladocerans biomass by fish predation may result in a reduced zooplankton grazing pressure and an increase in yield of phytoplankton per tp limitation of phytoplankton tends to shift from one of zooplankton grazing control when silver carp biomass is low to one of limitation by p availability when fish biomass is high for eutrophic sub tropical chinese reservoirs management the use of silver carp must be considered carefully stocking silver carp at high biomass cannot be recommended for phytoplankton control if the goal is to reduce the entire phytoplankton biomass furthermore a reduction of the external p loading should have highest priority
