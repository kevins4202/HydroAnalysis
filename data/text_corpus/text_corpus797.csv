3985,tidally influenced groundwater discharge in tidal flats is an important route by which land based pollutants enter the sea seasonal changes in groundwater flow fields create differences in the process and amount of groundwater discharge in sandy beaches to explore this subject we selected shilaoren beach in qingdao as our research area and used electrical resistivity tomography ert and hydrogeological measurement methods to monitor the groundwater discharge process in the same area in both may rainy season and november dry season in 2019 the study found that there are obvious upper saline plumes usps and freshwater discharge tubes fdts in the sediment layer in both seasons when sea level falls the usps sink and lateral extent decreases due to groundwater discharge and the fdts develop from deep below to the beach surface and divide the usp into multiple sections during the flood tide the pore water salinity of usps increases and lateral and vertical ranges expand rapidly the groundwater discharge process differs seasonally in the dry season the vertical extent of usp is larger around high tide and the distribution range of fdt is more unstable during the ebb tide the pore water salinity in usps and fdts changes from the moment when seawater starts receding however in the dry season it changes more slowly during the early stage of the ebb tide and more rapidly near the end the ebb tide the difference of hydraulic driving force is the main factor leading to the difference of distribution range and pore water salinity change of usp and fdt in different seasons the volume of groundwater discharge also varies with seasons and the discharge in rainy season is about 1 21 times of that in dry season in the rainy and dry seasons the groundwater discharge gradually increases from the land to the sea and the maximum discharge location is near the low tide line keywords groundwater discharge mode and volume sandy tidal flat dry and rainy season salinity change ratio electrical resistivity tomography 1 introduction tidally influenced groundwater discharge in tidal flat areas is an important part of the regional water cycle it is also an important and unseen channel for the transportation of various pollutants from land to the ocean moore 1996 nielsen 1999 porubsky et al 2014 rodellas et al 2014 uchiyama et al 2000 this method of transporting pollutants has an important impact on the coastal ecological environment groundwater discharge in tidal flats has been the subject of intense interest in coastal hydrology research in recent years hailong and xuejing 2015 li and jiao 2013 most studies have focused on the distribution and variation of mixed zones and various factors affecting their distribution the mixing of saltwater and freshwater in coastal aquifers occurs mainly at the saltwater interface and the intertidal upper saline plumes usps liu et al 2013 pool et al 2014 robinson et al 2007a b comprehensive field salinity measurements michael et al 2005 abarca et al 2013 heiss and michael 2014 and resistivity tomography profiles befus et al 2013 buquet et al 2016 found that the salt exchange rate of saltwater and freshwater in the usps is fast and intense charette and sholkovitz 2002 the slope of the beach increases smooth slope or decreases steep slope the degree of mixing of saltwater and freshwater in the usps ataie ashtiani et al 1999 li et al 2008 kuan et al 2012 the sediment heterogeneity of the beach will increase the spatial connectivity and effective permeability of the beach thereby reducing the degree of salt water mixing and the size of usps fiori and jankovic 2012 tidal action can cause water head fluctuations and pore water salinity oscillations abdollahi nasab et al 2010 heiss and michael 2014 elad et al 2017 the hydraulic gradient changes caused by these fluctuations and oscillations can lead to a rapid increase in the solute migration rate up to 20 times higher than the average migration rate of saltwater into the aquifer li et al 1999 in previous studies scientists used numerical modeling methods to analyze changes in the shape of groundwater and seawater interface groundwater dynamics theory was used to analyze the movement of water in sandy tidal flats nakada s et al 2011 and discuss the effects of tides the effect of large and small tides and groundwater level seasonal changes on the distribution of salinity in aquifers has been investigated heiss jw et al 2014 robinson c et al 2006 lanyon ja et al 1982 wu xf et al 1999 tang j 1996 and some authors have pointed out that there are specific phenomena such as usps and freshwater discharge tubes fdts in the groundwater discharge process however if there are changes in the groundwater flow field and ocean dynamics in different seasons then there should be changes in the groundwater discharge process as well with the reduction of surface and groundwater recharge that occurs in dry seasons the salinity change in the sediment layer should be different from that in rainy seasons these seasonal differences mean that observations at a specific time cannot be generalized for example michael h a et al 2005 found that the interface between the saltwater and freshwater in inland areas showed seasonal differences robinson c et al 2007 found that with an increase of tidal wave amplitude the lateral and vertical size of the usps increase and the saltwater freshwater interface moves out to the sea qu w et al 2005 found that the degree of stratification and mixing depends largely on the ratio of freshwater supply to tidal wave amplitude moore ws et al moore 1996 2003 used radium isotopes to estimate the seasonal change in submarine groundwater discharge sgd in the south atlantic their results showed that sgd is lower in winter and spring than it is in summer and autumn which is related to the seasonal change of inland freshwater supply mccoy et al 2007 conducted an sgd assessment using radon isotopes in the same area and obtained results consistent with moore electrical resistivity tomography ert is an effective method to describe groundwater exchange in coastal areas in saturated porous media the bulk resistivity depends on the pore fluid conductivity pore space morphology grains of the material and the surface area cai et al 2017 johnson et al 2015 shao et al 2021 kimak et al 2019 in the coastal saturated sediments the change of ion concentration of pore water is the main factor affecting the bulk resistivity in a short time scale e g a single or multiple tidal cycles therefore ert method can monitor real time coastal sediment salinity changes and provide two dimensional or three dimensional imaging of shallow groundwater discharge processes within a defined spatial range which has been proven effective in many studies swarzenski et al 2006 2007a 2007b 2012 taniguchi et al 2007 henderson et al 2010 to achieve a clearer description of the groundwater and salt migration we paid more attention to the changes in the resistivity mainly affected by pore fluid electrical resistivity in saturated sediments rather than to the actual resistivity values converting resistivity data at different tidal stages into resistivity change ratios can better reflect the amount of groundwater discharge and salt migration in the tidal section dimova et al 2012 misonou et al 2013 the accuracy of resistivity change ratio is mainly affected by inversion calculation however the inversion is an ill posed problem largely dependent on the regularization parameter choices and comparing with hydrogeological data would increase the confidence in the inversion results in this study we use ert and hydrological monitoring to investigate tidally influenced groundwater discharge processes at shilaoren beach a sandy beach in qingdao we use the data to analyze the effect of tides on hydrologic processes during different seasons the goals of this study are to 1 study the differences in distribution range and tidal dynamics of usps and fdts between dry and rainy of the same coastal zone 2 evaluate the groundwater discharge in different seasons and analyze the distribution characteristics of the discharge zones 2 study area 2 1 overview of the study area shilaoren beach is located in qingdao china the bay opens to the southeast and is part of the cape bay arc coast the beach is about 2 15 km long and trends ne sw with an average slope of 2 3 fig 1 the intertidal zone along the coast is about 30 40 m the area experiences regular semidiurnal tides with an average tidal range between 3 42 m for spring tides and 1 77 m for neap tides seasonal precipitation in the study area is the main source of surface recharge the vegetation coverage is typical for the area most of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the late spring and summer accounting for 69 7 of the annual precipitation the winter to early spring precipitation is small accounting for 11 1 of the annual precipitation 2 2 beach sediments in shilaoren beach the sediments are distributed in layers the thickness of each layer and the elevation of the boundary between each layer are basically the same so there is no obvious lateral variation in the lithology fig 1 the first layer is 3 5 m of medium coarse sand mixed with quartz and feldspar minerals the entire layer is gray brown has medium density medium particle sorting and roundness and contains shell fragments the second layer is 1 5 2 0 m of pebble ranging from 2 to 10 cm in diameter mixed with about 30 of coarse gravel the third layer is 0 4 1 4 m of medium fine sand with medium density and a uniform brownish yellow color it is saturated with a small amount of coarse gravel sand and gray black silty clay at the bottom the fourth layer is 0 2 1 3 m of silty fine sand mainly felsic silty fine sand mixed with 10 20 gray cohesive soil the soil is generally gray black soft plastic to fluid plastic with a thin layer of gray brown silty clay at the bottom the fifth layer is gravel sand strong weathered granite and granite the debris is sub angular 3 groundwater parameters monitoring 3 1 groundwater level monitoring the water level monitoring holes s1 s9 were established 35 m apart on three lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 parallel to the shore line fig 1 the groundwater level monitoring hole was about 1 m deep and 10 cm in diameter during the rainy and dry seasons the groundwater level was measured at different tide time using s1 s9 3 2 pore water conductivity and salinity monitoring the pore water conductivity and salinity monitoring sites w1 w3 were arranged along transect ab at 50 m 80 m and 110 m from electrode no 1 the location of the survey lines and monitoring points are shown in fig 1 the rbrmaestro multiparameter water quality meter was used to measure the conductivity and salinity of the w1 w2 and w3 mesopore fluids the probe was buried at a depth about 0 9 m and data were collected at 5 min intervals fig 1 the details of rbrmaestro are shown in fig 2 b c its probe has a protective frame which is wrapped with sand prevention meshwork throughout the tide rbrmaestro is always in a saturated zone so its probe is always in a water holding area we expect that the liquid in the water holding area is the pore water at this location and we can get the change of pore water conductivity and salinity by monitoring the conductivity and salinity of the liquid in the water holding area 3 3 pore water sampling and conductivity measurements three pore water sampling sites were established at a depth of 0 9 m p1 p2 and p3 in fig 1 at 50 m 80 m and 110 m along the transect rhizon css samplers from rhizosphere with sampling interval of 1 h were used for direct sampling of the pore water in surface sediments the conductivity of the samples was measured using a az8362 water quality meter pore water sampling stopped when the water level rose to the point where sampling was impossible 4 ert survey the transect for resistivity imaging was located perpendicular to the shoreline measuring line ab fig 1 the measurements were performed in may 2019 and november 2019 corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons in qingdao 4 1 data acquisition measurements are performed with the e60dn resistivity meter its technical specifications can be found at http www qdgeopen com in the field it had a total of 100 electrodes along a 247 5 m profile with a unit electrode spacing of 2 5 m the waterproof cable with stainless steel electrodes was connected with e60dn resistivity meter we laid cable at the low tide level of spring tide before the monitoring work in order to prevent the electrode position from shifting we dug a trench about 20 cm deep along the ert survey line ab on the surface of the tidal flat and set the cable and electrodes in it fig 2 b the purpose of laying the cableisalsoto make the electrode stay in the saturated sediments in order to ensure that the positions of the survey lines set in may and november coincide as much as possible we used gps unistrong g138bd for positioning with an error of 1 5 m to ensure that electrodes no 1 25 50 75 and 100 were set in the same position we use dipole dipole array with high resolution which has the disadvantage of low snr for deep data loke 2011 but research on issues such as the discharge of groundwater in the intertidal zone is generally carried out at a depth of 0 10 m therefore dipole dipole array is widely used in previous studies abarca et al 2013 cantarero et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 in this work each resistivity data set has collected 8 layers of data the distance of the electrodes in a dipole was 2 5 m and that for each current injection dipole 8 potential dipoles were measured from 2 5 to 20 m distance from the current injection dipole the expected depth of investigation is 8 m measurements were powered by a dc electrical source of a 12 v car battery the user defined maximum current applied for each measurement was 0 5 a and power supply time of 1 s was used each transect was monitored through two tidal cycles the duration of each ert measurement was about 13 min the tide level was measured at different tidal stages and the number of electrodes submerged by seawater was marked while collecting the resistivity data 4 2 data processing 1 data processing and inversion for quality control purposes all measurements from the apparent resistivity data sets that 1 are outliers larger than five times or smaller than 1 5 of both adjacent data or 2 have an applied current of 20 ma were removed and the number of deleted data points does not exceed 1 of the total number of data points the process was performed after data collection and there was no field filtering of the data pseudo sections of apparent resistivities were converted to sections of true resistivity values using a data inversion in this study the inversion data were calculated using res2dinv software v 4 05 30 geotomo inc via a standard least square inversion method degroot hedlin and constable 1990 the method uses a finite element scheme to solve the 2 d forward problem and a blocky inversion method to invert the ert data a mesh that was composed of model cells was applied which increased in size at greater depth and had 4 nodes per unit electrode spacing for each data set the inversion was performed using the l2 norm standard model constraint it will produce a model that has a smooth variation in the resistivity value for the model roughness filter loke et al 2003 because the pore water salinity changes gradually and there is no obvious internal boundary before resistivity data sets inversion topography data are entered then according to the in situ observation results the seawater resistivities in different seasons table 1 the sea level elevation and the domain where the electrode is submerged by seawater at different tide times are set res2dinv will define that an electrode with an elevation that is less than the elevation of the seawater surface is underwater electrode when inverting the data sets res2dinv will automatically carry out the topographic modeling calculate the thickness of the water layer set up a simulation domain and divide the finite element grid then the program will automatically adjust the surface of the finite element grid used to model the sediments so that it matches the surface of the sediment below the water layer meanwhile the resistivity of seawater is used to fix the resistivities of the cells in the simulation domain between the beach surface and the sea level the quality of the inversion result was evaluated by monitoring the abs error absolute error between the measured and predicted apparent resistivity values the final error of the inversion of the full data set is relatively high 40 consequently the data set was further trimmed post inversion based on the individual misfit of each simulated measurement versus the observed measurement points for which the data misfit exceeded 70 between the measured and calculated apparent resistivity values were removed the number of deleted data points does not exceed 3 of the total number of data points then we re do the inversion and decreased the abs error to 20 for the full data sets 2 inversion model appraisal to obtain information on how much the model is influenced by the inversion parameters and if reliable resistivity variations are mapped we used an approach proposed by paepen et al 2020 based on the two sided difference developed by oldenburg and li 1999 for estimating the depth of investigation doi index which is an image appraisal tool and often used as to indicate which portions of the inversion model can be interpreted the doi index is calculated based on two additional inversions ρ inv 1 and ρ inv 2 which are inverted resistivities using two reference models ρ app 1 and ρ app 2 which are 0 1 and 10 times the average observed apparent resistivity of the data sets an increase in damping factor to α s 0 05 thompsom et al 2017 is used to ensure closeness between the reference and iteratively updated current models 1 doi log ρ inv 1 log ρ inv 2 2 a low doi index is obtained when resistivity structures in the model are driven by the data and not by the inversion process which is influenced by the reference model paepen et al 2020 any cells with a doi index 0 2 were considered less reliable thompson et al 2017 however the doi index is directly sensitive to the absolute value of resistivity and can thus yield high values even for consistently resistive or conductive structures in addition the selection of doi index threshold is subjective caterina et al 2013 paepen et al 2020 therefore we use doi index as a reference and interpret it qualitatively with the three respective inversions paepen et al 2020 paepen et al 2020 considered that when the resistivity patterns of the three inverted models are similar the inversion model can be interpreted robustly we are more careful when evaluating the zones where the models do not agree on the resistivity or doi index exceeds 0 2 3 calculation of porewater salinity change ratio the formation factor f is a specific characteristic of the mineral composition of an aquifer its porosity and composition of the saturated fluids archie s law archie 1942 can establish the relationship between it and porosity φ for fully saturated substrate the formation factor can also be written as 2 f a φ m r f r w in this equation r f is the formation resistivity estimated by the electrical method r w is the pore water resistivity in the formation a is tortuosity factor and m is cementation factor for salinity conversion we used the equation proposed by manheim et al 2004 3 s k 1 r w 1 0233 where s is the pore water salinity and k 1 is a constant the salinity change ratio δ s can be expressed as 4 δ s s t s 0 s 0 where s t is the salinity at a measurement moment and s 0 is the salinity at the reference moment eq 5 can be obtained by combining eqs 2 to 4 5 δ s r f 1 0233 r f 0 1 0233 r f 0 1 0233 where r f is the formation resistivity at a measurement moment r f 0 is the formation resistivity at the reference moment in addition to the premise that the sediments are always saturated eq 5 is based on the hypothesis that the variation in formation resistivity is only due to the variation in the pore fluid resistivity because a single tidal process cannot change the characteristics of the sediment the variation in resistivity is only due to the variation in the pore fluid resistivity these parameters a m φ remain unchanged in the calculation process and they cancel out in eq 5 therefore eq 5 can be used to calculate the salinity change ratio of pore water in sediments during tidal processes 4 calculation of groundwater discharge we estimated the volume using 1 m as the third dimension of the groundwater discharge based on the salinity box model and mass and salt balance equation eq 6 which is suitable for calculating groundwater discharge in saturated sediment li h et al 2008 dimova et al 2012 bighash et al 2015 6 s h v sal v sal v gd s l where v sal is the constant volume of the salinity box which were identified and separated based on the high tide and low tide inverted resistivity s h and s l are the average salinities in the selected salinity box zone during high and low tide respectively and v gd is the groundwater discharge according to eqs 4 to 6 the equation for calculation of groundwater discharge can be expressed as 7 v gd δ s h l v sal 8 δ s h l r fh 1 0233 r fl 1 0233 r fl 1 0233 where δ s h l is the average salinity change ratio at the time of high and low tide in the calculation of the salinity box model r fh and r fl are average formation resistivities of the salinity box at the high tide and low tide respectively in order to simplify the process of calculating groundwater discharge using the salinity box model the average resistivity within each salinity box range is selected for resistivity of the high tide and low tide involved in the calculation 5 reliability evaluation of inverted resistivity in order to evaluate whether the inverted resistivity can accurately reflect the increase and decrease of pore water salinity caused by seawater intrusion and discharge we compared the average inverted resistivity with the expected resistivity the average inverted resistivity is the average of the four inverted resistivity data and the location of the four inverted resistivity data points is shown in fig 3 the expected resistivity is obtained by combining the pore water conductivity monitoring results of rbrmaestro multiparameter probe and az8362 water quality meter with eq 2 the average porosity of d2 and d4 at 1 5 m below the beach surface is 0 35 as a reference the porosity is set to 0 35 referring to the range of archie s coefficients a 0 6 1 5 and m 1 4 1 5 in sandy sediments jackson et al 1978 zhang et al 2004 we set a 0 6 and m 1 4 5 results 5 1 groundwater level fig 4 shows that the changing trend in groundwater level at s1 s9 were consistent with the tide level changes except the s1 s3 during the rainy season the average elevation of groundwater level during rainy season on the nearshore side is higher than that during dry season during the rainy season the groundwater levels at s1 s3 did not change much during ebb tide but during the flood tide they showed a rapid upward trend as the water level increased the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations at s4 s6 were between 10 and 20 cm and larger in the rainy than in the dry season the mean groundwater levels at s7 s9 were same in the dry and rainy season and the amplitude of the fluctuation was smaller than that of s4 s6 the groundwater levels at s8 and s9 were higher than the beach surface elevation due to the consistent changing trend between groundwater level and tide level at each location point we believe that there is a change in groundwater flow field in the sandy tidal flat over the tidal cycle and that there is an exchange process between seawater and groundwater the tide level fluctuation amplitude and tidal cycle are similar within the monitoring period in different seasons when the tide level is lower than the surface elevation at the same tide stage higher land side groundwater level will cause larger groundwater hydraulic gradient changes which will increase the intensity of the groundwater discharge in rainy season the presence of a high groundwater level close to the surface beach elevation means that a seepage surface developed and a large amount of groundwater is being discharged ma 2016 chang 2018 fig 4 c and d shows that the groundwater level at s2 is always lower than the surface elevation after the seawater recede in rainy and dry seasons and there is essentially no stable seepage surface developed in the upper part of the intertidal zone during that period which indicates that after a short period of groundwater discharge occurs when the seawater just recedes the groundwater will no longer be discharged from the beach surface in this zone the variation of groundwater level at s5 shows that the seepage surface in the middle and upper parts of the intertidal zone developed in the early stage of ebb tide which persisted longer and had greater groundwater discharge in the rainy season than in the dry season stable seepage surfaces also developed in the middle s7 s9 and lower parts of the intertidal zone in summary the degree of seawater and groundwater exchange increases gradually from land to sea and it is greater in the rainy season than in the dry season 5 2 pore water salinity and conductivity fig 5 shows the salinity monitoring results rbrmaestro the expected resistivity calculated from the conductivity monitoring results rbrmaestro and pore water sampling and the average inverted resistivity at the monitoring point fig 3 the overall consistency of the four monitoring data shows that the resistivity monitoring results are highly reliable at low tide the ert inverted resistivities and the expected resistivities calculated from pore water samples show all high resistivity values that are similar in the three transects except for transect 1 during flood tide the ert derived resistivities clearly decrease from the near shore transect 1 to the most off shore transect transect 3 which reflects a stronger impact of the sea water in transect 3 than in transect 1 a similar trend is observed in the salinity measurements however the rbrmaestro s monitoring results do not completely correspond to the change of pore water conductivity and salinity which is reflected in the variation trend of pore water salinity measured by rbrmaestro is not consistent with that of pore water resistivity measured by other methods in some periods shadows in fig 5 and the low amplitude of the calculated expected resistivity fig 5 the difference usually could be related to the difference in the investigation volume of the ert and the probes halverson et al 2017 but the consistency between the results of water samples conductivity monitoring and resistivity monitoring proves that this difference may not be related to the difference in the investigation volume of the ert and the probes we infer that the reason may be related to the measurement method of rbrmaestro that is the liquid flow and solute exchange in the water holding area were hindered which made the salinity change of the liquid in the water holding area different from that of the pore water in the adjacent sandy sediments salinity change ratio calculated by inverted resistivity δ s r can robustly reflect the salinity change ratio of pore water δ s p in sediments which is the key to analyze the groundwater discharge process and quantify the groundwater discharge reliably in order to analyze the reliability of salinity change ratio calculated by inverted resistivity the salinity change ratios calculated from inverted resistivity and pore water sampling conductivity same time and same location were compared the calculation of δ s r and δ s p was carried out based on eq 4 and the reference time was set as low tide time e e fig 6 shows that the absolute value of the difference between δ s p and δ s r at corresponding location and time is within 0 06 the scatter points have strong a correlation with y x r2 0 8015 indicating that δ s r could accurately reflect δ s p in sediments 5 3 variations in the inverted resistivity image of the vertical shoreline of sandy beaches during the rainy and dry seasons 1 quality appraisal in order to verify the inversion results of ert we use the two sided difference approach for estimating the doi index additionally computing the inversion for two different reference models we show them for tide time a e i in rainy season and a e i in dry season fig 7 but other profiles have similar results fig 7 shows that during the tidal cycle of the two seasons all three inversions of each tide time look almost perfectly similar and most of the data with a corresponding doi index of 0 1 the doi index of data in deep layer and offshore side is higher and it increases significantly at high tide the result shows that the inversion is sensitive to the bathymetry and the presence of the seawater layer however only a small part of the data with a corresponding doi index of 0 2 therefore all inversionsare sensitive enough to characterize the general salinity distribution in the studied zone 2 inversion result the resistivity results of rainy season and dry season are shown in fig 8 in rainy season and dry season there is a high resistivity area 0 40 m zone a on the nearshore side fig 8 this may be caused by breakwater affecting the resistivity results moreover thisarea has not been covered by seawater and there was no seepage surface distribution on the beach surface during the ebb tide which indicates that thisis not the main area of seawater intrusion and groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone therefore we did not analyze this area in our discussion in the inverted resistivity image the seawater intrusion with high salinity is shown as a low resistivity anomaly when the seawater just recedes from the beach surface the process of seawater directly invading the groundwater through the beach surface and exchanging with it is terminated the bulk resistivity of the sediment at this time can be used to delineate the boundary of the high salinity region after seawater intrusion for more accurately reflecting the process of seawater and groundwater exchange and the relationship between the tide level and the distribution of the high salinity seawater intrusion area the expected resistivity 1 75 ω m is defined as the boundary of the seawater intrusion zone in the inverted resistivity image which is the average value of the expected resistivities calculated from the pore water samples p1 3 1 88 ω m 1 63 ω m and 1 75 ω m collected at the time when measuring points just above the sea during the ebb tide and low resistivity zone 1 75 ω m in the inverted resistivity images are identified fig 8 in the seawater submerged area the low resistivity zone with a thickness of 2 4 m appears in the shallow sedimentary layer during the rainy season whereas the low resistivity zone in the dry season has a thickness of 2 6 m as the tide ebbs fig 8 a e the shallow low resistivity zone in the sediments decrease rapidly toward the sea side during both seasons but in the dry season it disappears more slowly than that in the rainy season the range of the middle and low resistivity zone slowly expands to the deep part in both seasons at low tide isolated low resistivity anomaly in the deep sediments occur during both seasons the distribution range of isolated low resistivity bodies during the rainy season is smaller than in the dry season and the resistivity values are larger in the rainy season than that in the dry season during the rainy and dry seasons there is a band shaped region with high resistivity 7 ω m mainly distributed in the bottom boundary of medium coarse sand layer and the pebble layer in the rainy season during the ebb tide the high resistivity zone first compresses to the pebble layer and the ocean side and gradually recovers during the flood tide the range of its distribution changes little during the tidal cycle in the dry season at the early stage of the ebb tide the high resistivity zone compresses rapidly to the pebble layer and then to the ocean side during the flood tide its vertical and lateral distribution range recover gradually therefore we speculate that the high resistivity zone is the main distribution zone of low salinity water or fresh water it is important to note that the groundwater level and sea level rise simultaneously during the flood tide process and the seawater will invade the sediment rapidly after the beach surface is submerged however the deep fresh water cannot be mixed with the intrusion high salinity water quickly and it will be covered in the deep sediment with the decrease in the intensity of seawater intrusion and the continuous discharge of the inland fresh water to the sea the distribution area of fresh water will gradually expand this makes the vertical and lateral distribution range of the high resistivity zone expand continuously however at the end of flood tide i i the high resistivity zone does not completely recover to its vertical and lateral distribution range at the beginning of ebb tide a a in the early stage of ebb tide the sea level begins to decrease but the decrease rate of inland groundwater level is less than that of sea level fig 4 therefore the discharge degree of inland fresh water to the sea will increase continuously in a short time and the vertical and lateral distribution range of fresh water covered by high salinity water will continue to expand this causes the high resistivity zone in the resistivity profile to expand further until it reaches its distribution range at the initial tide time a a based on the above analysis there are seasonal differences in the exchange of saline and freshwater in tidal flats over tidal cycles the degree of seawater intrusion andsalinization in the dry season are significantly greater thanthatin the rainy season after seawater intrudes into the sediments several isolated high salinitywater bodies are formed in it which means that it is easier for seawater to intrude into the deep aquifer and fresh water cannot be discharged more stably through the beachsurface during ebbing tide in dry seasons 6 discussion 6 1 characteristics of salinity changes of sandy beaches during groundwater discharge during dry and rainy seasons the salinity change ratio image fig 9 is calculated based on eq 5 since the resistivity data collected at tide time e were collected at low tide the data are used as a reference for the conversion of the salinity change ratio the result can reflect salinity change in shallow sediments during the process of groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion during the tidal cycle the determination of usp and fdt is based on the theory that the usp develop in the salinity increase zone in the surface sediments on the nearshore side and the fdt develop in the salinity decrease zone below the usp abarca et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 han et al 2018 fig 9 shows that during the tidal cycle in the two seasons the salinity increase zones distributed in the tidal flat sediments which are usps they are mainly distributed in the sediment from the beach surface to the depth of about 5 m at 40 160 m of the monitoring section and located above the fdts during the period from the beginning of ebb tide to the early stage of flood tide a f the vertical and lateral range of usp gradually decreases and some areas with reduced salinity divide usp forming multiple usps in the shallow intertidal sediments at the same time the distribution position of usps gradually sinks and the salinity of its internal pore water gradually decreases during the flood tide after the seawater submerges the beach surface the seawater invades the sediments rapidly at this time usps receive the supplement of high salinity water and its internal pore water salinity increases and the lateral and vertical range expands rapidly in conclusion during the tidal cycle there is a continuous and significant mixing process of seawater and fresh water in usps this phenomenon is also found in the numerical simulation of beach aquifer boufadel et al 2011 the salinity change ratio profile fig 9 shows that there are several salinity decreasing zones below the usps which are fdts these tubes are conduit for the discharge of inland freshwater to the sea fig 9 shows that in the two seasons the main fdt exists mostly near the low tide line which is consistent with the existing research results heiss j w et al 2014 boufadel m c et al 1999 robinson c et al 2007 li h et al 2008 during the ebb tide as the sea recedes fdts develop rapidly from the deep below to the beach surface where the seawater is not covered and divide the usp into multiple sections with the continuous decline of the tide level a main fdt develops near the low tide line the salinity of fresh water in fdt is lower during high tide than during low tide this is because at high tide although the sea level and the inland groundwater level are at high level fig 4 the inland hydraulic head still exists and the inland fresh water still be discharged to sea through fdt at this time the high salinity water covers the fresh water in the fdt while the mixing rate of high salinity water in usp and fresh water in fdt is slow so the salinity of water in fdt remains at a low level during the ebb tide the gradual increase of the inland hydraulic heads leads to a larger amount of groundwater discharge fig 4 the salinity of water in fdts keeps increasing and that of water in usps decreases fig 9 a d a d indicating that the high salinity water in usps and fresh water in fdts are continuously mixing this mixing process may cause a slight increase in the salinity of the pore water in the fdts and the mixed water rather than fresh water is discharged from the beach surface during this process during the flood tide as the seawater submerges the beach surface fdts are no longer connected with the beach surface and the groundwater discharge from the beach surface through the fdts gradually reduced and the salinity of pore water in fdts begins to decrease fig 9 f i f i however compared with the results of numerical simulation the distribution range of usps and fdts obtained from in situ monitoring is unstable which may be caused by many factors such as tide heterogeneity of tidal flat sediment and so on by comparing the distribution range of usps and fdts in different seasons and its changes of salinity we found that in the rainy season at the early stage of ebb tide a e b e and the late stage of flood tide h e i e the vertical extent of usp is smaller and the thickness of fdt is thicker in the dry season the distribution range of fdt is unstable and there are many isolated salinity increasing zones in the low tide but this phenomenon does not appear in the rainy season during the ebb tide in rainy season the salinity of pore water in the usps and fdts changes rapidly the pore water salinity change ratio of usps generally decreases from 0 6 to 2 4 to 0 0 3 and that of fdts increases from 0 9 0 3 to 0 3 0 fig 9 during the ebb tide in the dry season the salinity of pore water in usps and fdts have different change patterns which changes slowly at the early stage of ebb tide but rapidly near the low tide in this process the pore water salinity change ratio of usps generally decreases from 0 6 to 2 4 to 0 3 1 and that of fdts increases from 0 9 0 6 to 0 6 0 3 only in the low tide stage d e the salinity of pore water changes rapidly fig 9 combined with the monitoring results of groundwater level fig 3 it can be inferred that the difference of hydraulic driving force intensity caused by the difference of land side groundwater level in dry season and rainy season is the main factor leading to the difference of distribution range and salinity change of usps and fdts in different seasons compared with the dry season the land side groundwater level is higher and the hydraulic driving force is stronger in rainy season at the the early stage of ebb tide and the late stage of flood tide in rainy season more fresh water is discharged to the sea through fdt which makes the larger vertical extent and better continuity in the horizontal extent of fdt and shallower depth of usp during the low tide in rainy season fresh water and high salinity water in usp can be more fully mixed and discharged from the beach surface and the distribution range of usps is more stable in addition the higher hydraulic heads in rainy season makes the water between usps and fdts mixing faster after the seawater recedes which makes the salinity of pore water change continuously and rapidly during the ebb tide 6 2 calculation of groundwater discharge in sandy beaches during rainy and dry seasons the inverted resistivity data of the high tide a and low tide e in each season are substituted into eq 8 to obtain δ s h l profiles as shown in fig 10 b the seepage surface is the main place for groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone fig 1 shows that it is mainly distributed between 40 m and the low tide line in the monitoring period however according to the field observation and groundwater level monitoring results fig 4 the duration of the seepage surface at different zones is different which leads to differences in groundwater discharge at different locations in the intertidal zone in addition there will also be a large amount of groundwater discharge in the subtidal zone and offshore area peterson et al 2016 george et al 2020 therefore we use the salinity box model to quantify the groundwater discharge between 40 m and 247 5 m so as to analysis the difference of groundwater discharge volume and regional distribution of discharge zone in different seasons the areas with white or red color scale level in fig 10 b is the main zone of groundwater discharge which can be divided into several salinity boxes shown in black box a b c d a b and c based on the amount of δ s h l in the same color scale level and the depth of groundwater discharge zone at different position and the average inverted resistivity in the range of each salinity box at high tide and low tide is used to calculate the groundwater discharge combined with the formation data it can be seen that the sediment layer in this area is a medium coarse sand layer and a pebble layer with high permeability which is the main source of groundwater discharge fig 10 b shows that groundwater discharge zone is mainly distributedin the sediment layer within 5 m and the distribution range of groundwater discharge area is different in different seasons the boundary of blue and white zones in fig 10 b is defined as the boundary of each salinity box and the length and width of each salinity box can be determined table 2 the width of equalization unit is set to 1 m after determining these parameters the groundwater discharge can be calculated according to eq 8 as shown in table 2 according to estimates the groundwater discharge in the monitoring area during the rainy season is 837 3 m3 and the groundwater discharge in the dry season is 691 0 m3 groundwater discharge during the rainy season is about 1 21 times that during the dry season it can also be seen from fig 10 b that the groundwater discharge zones were distributed in the intertidal zone and the subtidal zone in both seasons in general the degree of discharge gradually increases from land to sea which is consistent with the groundwater level monitoring results and the maximum discharge location is near the low tide line this feature has been confirmed in our previous research zhang 2020 7 conclusion tidally influenced groundwater discharge in tidal flats is an important transport mechanism by which terrestrial materials can enter the sea groundwater and marine dynamic processes change between rainy and dry seasons which may cause different seasonal impacts on the coastal ecological environment this study discusses the characteristics of groundwater salinity distribution and groundwater discharge in a shilaoren sandy tidal flat during dry and rainy seasons by analyzing the inverted resistivity image of groundwater discharge at a sandy beach and comparing the results for dry and rainy seasons we found that the resistivity of the sediment layer and the water levels showed regular changes under the effect of tides due to the differences in the groundwater flow fields and groundwater dynamics during the dry and rainy seasons resistivity changes at the same location and at the same measuring point in the tidal cycle are different the degree of seawater intrusion and salinizationin the dry season are significantly greater than in the rainy season andseveralisolated high salinity water bodies are formed inside it during rainyseason the distributioncharacteristicsof low salinity water and fresh water is less affected by seawater intrusion and groundwater discharge it is difficult for seawater to intrudedeep aquifer and the groundwater can be discharged more stably through the beachsurface the salinity change ratio images of the groundwater discharge at a sandy beach in the dry and rainy seasons shows that usp is always distributed in tidal flat sediments and there is a band shaped fdt below the usp which extends upward from the deep sediment layer to near the low tide line during the period from the beginning of ebb tide to the beach surface being submerged again the vertical and lateral range of usp gradually decreases and the distribution position gradually sinks the fdts develop from deep below to beach surface and divide the usp into multiple sections during the flood tide the usps receive the supplement of high salinity water its internal pore water salinity increases and the lateral and vertical ranges expand rapidly the differences of usps and fdts in different seasons are as follows in the dry season the vertical extent of usp is larger around high tide and the distribution range of fdts is more unstable during the ebb tide the pore water salinity in usps and fdts changes from the moment when seawater starts receding however in the dry season it changes more slowly during the early stage of the ebb tide and more rapidly near the end the ebb tide the difference of hydraulic driving force is the main factor leading to the difference of distribution range and pore water salinity change of usps and fdts in different seasons according to calculations using salinity box theory the amount of groundwater discharge also varies seasonally the amount of groundwater discharge in the rainy season is about 1 21 times that during the dry season in both seasons the groundwater discharge zones are distributed in the intertidal and subtidal zones the groundwater discharge gradually increases from land to sea and the maximum discharge location is near the low tide line credit

3985,tidally influenced groundwater discharge in tidal flats is an important route by which land based pollutants enter the sea seasonal changes in groundwater flow fields create differences in the process and amount of groundwater discharge in sandy beaches to explore this subject we selected shilaoren beach in qingdao as our research area and used electrical resistivity tomography ert and hydrogeological measurement methods to monitor the groundwater discharge process in the same area in both may rainy season and november dry season in 2019 the study found that there are obvious upper saline plumes usps and freshwater discharge tubes fdts in the sediment layer in both seasons when sea level falls the usps sink and lateral extent decreases due to groundwater discharge and the fdts develop from deep below to the beach surface and divide the usp into multiple sections during the flood tide the pore water salinity of usps increases and lateral and vertical ranges expand rapidly the groundwater discharge process differs seasonally in the dry season the vertical extent of usp is larger around high tide and the distribution range of fdt is more unstable during the ebb tide the pore water salinity in usps and fdts changes from the moment when seawater starts receding however in the dry season it changes more slowly during the early stage of the ebb tide and more rapidly near the end the ebb tide the difference of hydraulic driving force is the main factor leading to the difference of distribution range and pore water salinity change of usp and fdt in different seasons the volume of groundwater discharge also varies with seasons and the discharge in rainy season is about 1 21 times of that in dry season in the rainy and dry seasons the groundwater discharge gradually increases from the land to the sea and the maximum discharge location is near the low tide line keywords groundwater discharge mode and volume sandy tidal flat dry and rainy season salinity change ratio electrical resistivity tomography 1 introduction tidally influenced groundwater discharge in tidal flat areas is an important part of the regional water cycle it is also an important and unseen channel for the transportation of various pollutants from land to the ocean moore 1996 nielsen 1999 porubsky et al 2014 rodellas et al 2014 uchiyama et al 2000 this method of transporting pollutants has an important impact on the coastal ecological environment groundwater discharge in tidal flats has been the subject of intense interest in coastal hydrology research in recent years hailong and xuejing 2015 li and jiao 2013 most studies have focused on the distribution and variation of mixed zones and various factors affecting their distribution the mixing of saltwater and freshwater in coastal aquifers occurs mainly at the saltwater interface and the intertidal upper saline plumes usps liu et al 2013 pool et al 2014 robinson et al 2007a b comprehensive field salinity measurements michael et al 2005 abarca et al 2013 heiss and michael 2014 and resistivity tomography profiles befus et al 2013 buquet et al 2016 found that the salt exchange rate of saltwater and freshwater in the usps is fast and intense charette and sholkovitz 2002 the slope of the beach increases smooth slope or decreases steep slope the degree of mixing of saltwater and freshwater in the usps ataie ashtiani et al 1999 li et al 2008 kuan et al 2012 the sediment heterogeneity of the beach will increase the spatial connectivity and effective permeability of the beach thereby reducing the degree of salt water mixing and the size of usps fiori and jankovic 2012 tidal action can cause water head fluctuations and pore water salinity oscillations abdollahi nasab et al 2010 heiss and michael 2014 elad et al 2017 the hydraulic gradient changes caused by these fluctuations and oscillations can lead to a rapid increase in the solute migration rate up to 20 times higher than the average migration rate of saltwater into the aquifer li et al 1999 in previous studies scientists used numerical modeling methods to analyze changes in the shape of groundwater and seawater interface groundwater dynamics theory was used to analyze the movement of water in sandy tidal flats nakada s et al 2011 and discuss the effects of tides the effect of large and small tides and groundwater level seasonal changes on the distribution of salinity in aquifers has been investigated heiss jw et al 2014 robinson c et al 2006 lanyon ja et al 1982 wu xf et al 1999 tang j 1996 and some authors have pointed out that there are specific phenomena such as usps and freshwater discharge tubes fdts in the groundwater discharge process however if there are changes in the groundwater flow field and ocean dynamics in different seasons then there should be changes in the groundwater discharge process as well with the reduction of surface and groundwater recharge that occurs in dry seasons the salinity change in the sediment layer should be different from that in rainy seasons these seasonal differences mean that observations at a specific time cannot be generalized for example michael h a et al 2005 found that the interface between the saltwater and freshwater in inland areas showed seasonal differences robinson c et al 2007 found that with an increase of tidal wave amplitude the lateral and vertical size of the usps increase and the saltwater freshwater interface moves out to the sea qu w et al 2005 found that the degree of stratification and mixing depends largely on the ratio of freshwater supply to tidal wave amplitude moore ws et al moore 1996 2003 used radium isotopes to estimate the seasonal change in submarine groundwater discharge sgd in the south atlantic their results showed that sgd is lower in winter and spring than it is in summer and autumn which is related to the seasonal change of inland freshwater supply mccoy et al 2007 conducted an sgd assessment using radon isotopes in the same area and obtained results consistent with moore electrical resistivity tomography ert is an effective method to describe groundwater exchange in coastal areas in saturated porous media the bulk resistivity depends on the pore fluid conductivity pore space morphology grains of the material and the surface area cai et al 2017 johnson et al 2015 shao et al 2021 kimak et al 2019 in the coastal saturated sediments the change of ion concentration of pore water is the main factor affecting the bulk resistivity in a short time scale e g a single or multiple tidal cycles therefore ert method can monitor real time coastal sediment salinity changes and provide two dimensional or three dimensional imaging of shallow groundwater discharge processes within a defined spatial range which has been proven effective in many studies swarzenski et al 2006 2007a 2007b 2012 taniguchi et al 2007 henderson et al 2010 to achieve a clearer description of the groundwater and salt migration we paid more attention to the changes in the resistivity mainly affected by pore fluid electrical resistivity in saturated sediments rather than to the actual resistivity values converting resistivity data at different tidal stages into resistivity change ratios can better reflect the amount of groundwater discharge and salt migration in the tidal section dimova et al 2012 misonou et al 2013 the accuracy of resistivity change ratio is mainly affected by inversion calculation however the inversion is an ill posed problem largely dependent on the regularization parameter choices and comparing with hydrogeological data would increase the confidence in the inversion results in this study we use ert and hydrological monitoring to investigate tidally influenced groundwater discharge processes at shilaoren beach a sandy beach in qingdao we use the data to analyze the effect of tides on hydrologic processes during different seasons the goals of this study are to 1 study the differences in distribution range and tidal dynamics of usps and fdts between dry and rainy of the same coastal zone 2 evaluate the groundwater discharge in different seasons and analyze the distribution characteristics of the discharge zones 2 study area 2 1 overview of the study area shilaoren beach is located in qingdao china the bay opens to the southeast and is part of the cape bay arc coast the beach is about 2 15 km long and trends ne sw with an average slope of 2 3 fig 1 the intertidal zone along the coast is about 30 40 m the area experiences regular semidiurnal tides with an average tidal range between 3 42 m for spring tides and 1 77 m for neap tides seasonal precipitation in the study area is the main source of surface recharge the vegetation coverage is typical for the area most of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the late spring and summer accounting for 69 7 of the annual precipitation the winter to early spring precipitation is small accounting for 11 1 of the annual precipitation 2 2 beach sediments in shilaoren beach the sediments are distributed in layers the thickness of each layer and the elevation of the boundary between each layer are basically the same so there is no obvious lateral variation in the lithology fig 1 the first layer is 3 5 m of medium coarse sand mixed with quartz and feldspar minerals the entire layer is gray brown has medium density medium particle sorting and roundness and contains shell fragments the second layer is 1 5 2 0 m of pebble ranging from 2 to 10 cm in diameter mixed with about 30 of coarse gravel the third layer is 0 4 1 4 m of medium fine sand with medium density and a uniform brownish yellow color it is saturated with a small amount of coarse gravel sand and gray black silty clay at the bottom the fourth layer is 0 2 1 3 m of silty fine sand mainly felsic silty fine sand mixed with 10 20 gray cohesive soil the soil is generally gray black soft plastic to fluid plastic with a thin layer of gray brown silty clay at the bottom the fifth layer is gravel sand strong weathered granite and granite the debris is sub angular 3 groundwater parameters monitoring 3 1 groundwater level monitoring the water level monitoring holes s1 s9 were established 35 m apart on three lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 parallel to the shore line fig 1 the groundwater level monitoring hole was about 1 m deep and 10 cm in diameter during the rainy and dry seasons the groundwater level was measured at different tide time using s1 s9 3 2 pore water conductivity and salinity monitoring the pore water conductivity and salinity monitoring sites w1 w3 were arranged along transect ab at 50 m 80 m and 110 m from electrode no 1 the location of the survey lines and monitoring points are shown in fig 1 the rbrmaestro multiparameter water quality meter was used to measure the conductivity and salinity of the w1 w2 and w3 mesopore fluids the probe was buried at a depth about 0 9 m and data were collected at 5 min intervals fig 1 the details of rbrmaestro are shown in fig 2 b c its probe has a protective frame which is wrapped with sand prevention meshwork throughout the tide rbrmaestro is always in a saturated zone so its probe is always in a water holding area we expect that the liquid in the water holding area is the pore water at this location and we can get the change of pore water conductivity and salinity by monitoring the conductivity and salinity of the liquid in the water holding area 3 3 pore water sampling and conductivity measurements three pore water sampling sites were established at a depth of 0 9 m p1 p2 and p3 in fig 1 at 50 m 80 m and 110 m along the transect rhizon css samplers from rhizosphere with sampling interval of 1 h were used for direct sampling of the pore water in surface sediments the conductivity of the samples was measured using a az8362 water quality meter pore water sampling stopped when the water level rose to the point where sampling was impossible 4 ert survey the transect for resistivity imaging was located perpendicular to the shoreline measuring line ab fig 1 the measurements were performed in may 2019 and november 2019 corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons in qingdao 4 1 data acquisition measurements are performed with the e60dn resistivity meter its technical specifications can be found at http www qdgeopen com in the field it had a total of 100 electrodes along a 247 5 m profile with a unit electrode spacing of 2 5 m the waterproof cable with stainless steel electrodes was connected with e60dn resistivity meter we laid cable at the low tide level of spring tide before the monitoring work in order to prevent the electrode position from shifting we dug a trench about 20 cm deep along the ert survey line ab on the surface of the tidal flat and set the cable and electrodes in it fig 2 b the purpose of laying the cableisalsoto make the electrode stay in the saturated sediments in order to ensure that the positions of the survey lines set in may and november coincide as much as possible we used gps unistrong g138bd for positioning with an error of 1 5 m to ensure that electrodes no 1 25 50 75 and 100 were set in the same position we use dipole dipole array with high resolution which has the disadvantage of low snr for deep data loke 2011 but research on issues such as the discharge of groundwater in the intertidal zone is generally carried out at a depth of 0 10 m therefore dipole dipole array is widely used in previous studies abarca et al 2013 cantarero et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 in this work each resistivity data set has collected 8 layers of data the distance of the electrodes in a dipole was 2 5 m and that for each current injection dipole 8 potential dipoles were measured from 2 5 to 20 m distance from the current injection dipole the expected depth of investigation is 8 m measurements were powered by a dc electrical source of a 12 v car battery the user defined maximum current applied for each measurement was 0 5 a and power supply time of 1 s was used each transect was monitored through two tidal cycles the duration of each ert measurement was about 13 min the tide level was measured at different tidal stages and the number of electrodes submerged by seawater was marked while collecting the resistivity data 4 2 data processing 1 data processing and inversion for quality control purposes all measurements from the apparent resistivity data sets that 1 are outliers larger than five times or smaller than 1 5 of both adjacent data or 2 have an applied current of 20 ma were removed and the number of deleted data points does not exceed 1 of the total number of data points the process was performed after data collection and there was no field filtering of the data pseudo sections of apparent resistivities were converted to sections of true resistivity values using a data inversion in this study the inversion data were calculated using res2dinv software v 4 05 30 geotomo inc via a standard least square inversion method degroot hedlin and constable 1990 the method uses a finite element scheme to solve the 2 d forward problem and a blocky inversion method to invert the ert data a mesh that was composed of model cells was applied which increased in size at greater depth and had 4 nodes per unit electrode spacing for each data set the inversion was performed using the l2 norm standard model constraint it will produce a model that has a smooth variation in the resistivity value for the model roughness filter loke et al 2003 because the pore water salinity changes gradually and there is no obvious internal boundary before resistivity data sets inversion topography data are entered then according to the in situ observation results the seawater resistivities in different seasons table 1 the sea level elevation and the domain where the electrode is submerged by seawater at different tide times are set res2dinv will define that an electrode with an elevation that is less than the elevation of the seawater surface is underwater electrode when inverting the data sets res2dinv will automatically carry out the topographic modeling calculate the thickness of the water layer set up a simulation domain and divide the finite element grid then the program will automatically adjust the surface of the finite element grid used to model the sediments so that it matches the surface of the sediment below the water layer meanwhile the resistivity of seawater is used to fix the resistivities of the cells in the simulation domain between the beach surface and the sea level the quality of the inversion result was evaluated by monitoring the abs error absolute error between the measured and predicted apparent resistivity values the final error of the inversion of the full data set is relatively high 40 consequently the data set was further trimmed post inversion based on the individual misfit of each simulated measurement versus the observed measurement points for which the data misfit exceeded 70 between the measured and calculated apparent resistivity values were removed the number of deleted data points does not exceed 3 of the total number of data points then we re do the inversion and decreased the abs error to 20 for the full data sets 2 inversion model appraisal to obtain information on how much the model is influenced by the inversion parameters and if reliable resistivity variations are mapped we used an approach proposed by paepen et al 2020 based on the two sided difference developed by oldenburg and li 1999 for estimating the depth of investigation doi index which is an image appraisal tool and often used as to indicate which portions of the inversion model can be interpreted the doi index is calculated based on two additional inversions ρ inv 1 and ρ inv 2 which are inverted resistivities using two reference models ρ app 1 and ρ app 2 which are 0 1 and 10 times the average observed apparent resistivity of the data sets an increase in damping factor to α s 0 05 thompsom et al 2017 is used to ensure closeness between the reference and iteratively updated current models 1 doi log ρ inv 1 log ρ inv 2 2 a low doi index is obtained when resistivity structures in the model are driven by the data and not by the inversion process which is influenced by the reference model paepen et al 2020 any cells with a doi index 0 2 were considered less reliable thompson et al 2017 however the doi index is directly sensitive to the absolute value of resistivity and can thus yield high values even for consistently resistive or conductive structures in addition the selection of doi index threshold is subjective caterina et al 2013 paepen et al 2020 therefore we use doi index as a reference and interpret it qualitatively with the three respective inversions paepen et al 2020 paepen et al 2020 considered that when the resistivity patterns of the three inverted models are similar the inversion model can be interpreted robustly we are more careful when evaluating the zones where the models do not agree on the resistivity or doi index exceeds 0 2 3 calculation of porewater salinity change ratio the formation factor f is a specific characteristic of the mineral composition of an aquifer its porosity and composition of the saturated fluids archie s law archie 1942 can establish the relationship between it and porosity φ for fully saturated substrate the formation factor can also be written as 2 f a φ m r f r w in this equation r f is the formation resistivity estimated by the electrical method r w is the pore water resistivity in the formation a is tortuosity factor and m is cementation factor for salinity conversion we used the equation proposed by manheim et al 2004 3 s k 1 r w 1 0233 where s is the pore water salinity and k 1 is a constant the salinity change ratio δ s can be expressed as 4 δ s s t s 0 s 0 where s t is the salinity at a measurement moment and s 0 is the salinity at the reference moment eq 5 can be obtained by combining eqs 2 to 4 5 δ s r f 1 0233 r f 0 1 0233 r f 0 1 0233 where r f is the formation resistivity at a measurement moment r f 0 is the formation resistivity at the reference moment in addition to the premise that the sediments are always saturated eq 5 is based on the hypothesis that the variation in formation resistivity is only due to the variation in the pore fluid resistivity because a single tidal process cannot change the characteristics of the sediment the variation in resistivity is only due to the variation in the pore fluid resistivity these parameters a m φ remain unchanged in the calculation process and they cancel out in eq 5 therefore eq 5 can be used to calculate the salinity change ratio of pore water in sediments during tidal processes 4 calculation of groundwater discharge we estimated the volume using 1 m as the third dimension of the groundwater discharge based on the salinity box model and mass and salt balance equation eq 6 which is suitable for calculating groundwater discharge in saturated sediment li h et al 2008 dimova et al 2012 bighash et al 2015 6 s h v sal v sal v gd s l where v sal is the constant volume of the salinity box which were identified and separated based on the high tide and low tide inverted resistivity s h and s l are the average salinities in the selected salinity box zone during high and low tide respectively and v gd is the groundwater discharge according to eqs 4 to 6 the equation for calculation of groundwater discharge can be expressed as 7 v gd δ s h l v sal 8 δ s h l r fh 1 0233 r fl 1 0233 r fl 1 0233 where δ s h l is the average salinity change ratio at the time of high and low tide in the calculation of the salinity box model r fh and r fl are average formation resistivities of the salinity box at the high tide and low tide respectively in order to simplify the process of calculating groundwater discharge using the salinity box model the average resistivity within each salinity box range is selected for resistivity of the high tide and low tide involved in the calculation 5 reliability evaluation of inverted resistivity in order to evaluate whether the inverted resistivity can accurately reflect the increase and decrease of pore water salinity caused by seawater intrusion and discharge we compared the average inverted resistivity with the expected resistivity the average inverted resistivity is the average of the four inverted resistivity data and the location of the four inverted resistivity data points is shown in fig 3 the expected resistivity is obtained by combining the pore water conductivity monitoring results of rbrmaestro multiparameter probe and az8362 water quality meter with eq 2 the average porosity of d2 and d4 at 1 5 m below the beach surface is 0 35 as a reference the porosity is set to 0 35 referring to the range of archie s coefficients a 0 6 1 5 and m 1 4 1 5 in sandy sediments jackson et al 1978 zhang et al 2004 we set a 0 6 and m 1 4 5 results 5 1 groundwater level fig 4 shows that the changing trend in groundwater level at s1 s9 were consistent with the tide level changes except the s1 s3 during the rainy season the average elevation of groundwater level during rainy season on the nearshore side is higher than that during dry season during the rainy season the groundwater levels at s1 s3 did not change much during ebb tide but during the flood tide they showed a rapid upward trend as the water level increased the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations at s4 s6 were between 10 and 20 cm and larger in the rainy than in the dry season the mean groundwater levels at s7 s9 were same in the dry and rainy season and the amplitude of the fluctuation was smaller than that of s4 s6 the groundwater levels at s8 and s9 were higher than the beach surface elevation due to the consistent changing trend between groundwater level and tide level at each location point we believe that there is a change in groundwater flow field in the sandy tidal flat over the tidal cycle and that there is an exchange process between seawater and groundwater the tide level fluctuation amplitude and tidal cycle are similar within the monitoring period in different seasons when the tide level is lower than the surface elevation at the same tide stage higher land side groundwater level will cause larger groundwater hydraulic gradient changes which will increase the intensity of the groundwater discharge in rainy season the presence of a high groundwater level close to the surface beach elevation means that a seepage surface developed and a large amount of groundwater is being discharged ma 2016 chang 2018 fig 4 c and d shows that the groundwater level at s2 is always lower than the surface elevation after the seawater recede in rainy and dry seasons and there is essentially no stable seepage surface developed in the upper part of the intertidal zone during that period which indicates that after a short period of groundwater discharge occurs when the seawater just recedes the groundwater will no longer be discharged from the beach surface in this zone the variation of groundwater level at s5 shows that the seepage surface in the middle and upper parts of the intertidal zone developed in the early stage of ebb tide which persisted longer and had greater groundwater discharge in the rainy season than in the dry season stable seepage surfaces also developed in the middle s7 s9 and lower parts of the intertidal zone in summary the degree of seawater and groundwater exchange increases gradually from land to sea and it is greater in the rainy season than in the dry season 5 2 pore water salinity and conductivity fig 5 shows the salinity monitoring results rbrmaestro the expected resistivity calculated from the conductivity monitoring results rbrmaestro and pore water sampling and the average inverted resistivity at the monitoring point fig 3 the overall consistency of the four monitoring data shows that the resistivity monitoring results are highly reliable at low tide the ert inverted resistivities and the expected resistivities calculated from pore water samples show all high resistivity values that are similar in the three transects except for transect 1 during flood tide the ert derived resistivities clearly decrease from the near shore transect 1 to the most off shore transect transect 3 which reflects a stronger impact of the sea water in transect 3 than in transect 1 a similar trend is observed in the salinity measurements however the rbrmaestro s monitoring results do not completely correspond to the change of pore water conductivity and salinity which is reflected in the variation trend of pore water salinity measured by rbrmaestro is not consistent with that of pore water resistivity measured by other methods in some periods shadows in fig 5 and the low amplitude of the calculated expected resistivity fig 5 the difference usually could be related to the difference in the investigation volume of the ert and the probes halverson et al 2017 but the consistency between the results of water samples conductivity monitoring and resistivity monitoring proves that this difference may not be related to the difference in the investigation volume of the ert and the probes we infer that the reason may be related to the measurement method of rbrmaestro that is the liquid flow and solute exchange in the water holding area were hindered which made the salinity change of the liquid in the water holding area different from that of the pore water in the adjacent sandy sediments salinity change ratio calculated by inverted resistivity δ s r can robustly reflect the salinity change ratio of pore water δ s p in sediments which is the key to analyze the groundwater discharge process and quantify the groundwater discharge reliably in order to analyze the reliability of salinity change ratio calculated by inverted resistivity the salinity change ratios calculated from inverted resistivity and pore water sampling conductivity same time and same location were compared the calculation of δ s r and δ s p was carried out based on eq 4 and the reference time was set as low tide time e e fig 6 shows that the absolute value of the difference between δ s p and δ s r at corresponding location and time is within 0 06 the scatter points have strong a correlation with y x r2 0 8015 indicating that δ s r could accurately reflect δ s p in sediments 5 3 variations in the inverted resistivity image of the vertical shoreline of sandy beaches during the rainy and dry seasons 1 quality appraisal in order to verify the inversion results of ert we use the two sided difference approach for estimating the doi index additionally computing the inversion for two different reference models we show them for tide time a e i in rainy season and a e i in dry season fig 7 but other profiles have similar results fig 7 shows that during the tidal cycle of the two seasons all three inversions of each tide time look almost perfectly similar and most of the data with a corresponding doi index of 0 1 the doi index of data in deep layer and offshore side is higher and it increases significantly at high tide the result shows that the inversion is sensitive to the bathymetry and the presence of the seawater layer however only a small part of the data with a corresponding doi index of 0 2 therefore all inversionsare sensitive enough to characterize the general salinity distribution in the studied zone 2 inversion result the resistivity results of rainy season and dry season are shown in fig 8 in rainy season and dry season there is a high resistivity area 0 40 m zone a on the nearshore side fig 8 this may be caused by breakwater affecting the resistivity results moreover thisarea has not been covered by seawater and there was no seepage surface distribution on the beach surface during the ebb tide which indicates that thisis not the main area of seawater intrusion and groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone therefore we did not analyze this area in our discussion in the inverted resistivity image the seawater intrusion with high salinity is shown as a low resistivity anomaly when the seawater just recedes from the beach surface the process of seawater directly invading the groundwater through the beach surface and exchanging with it is terminated the bulk resistivity of the sediment at this time can be used to delineate the boundary of the high salinity region after seawater intrusion for more accurately reflecting the process of seawater and groundwater exchange and the relationship between the tide level and the distribution of the high salinity seawater intrusion area the expected resistivity 1 75 ω m is defined as the boundary of the seawater intrusion zone in the inverted resistivity image which is the average value of the expected resistivities calculated from the pore water samples p1 3 1 88 ω m 1 63 ω m and 1 75 ω m collected at the time when measuring points just above the sea during the ebb tide and low resistivity zone 1 75 ω m in the inverted resistivity images are identified fig 8 in the seawater submerged area the low resistivity zone with a thickness of 2 4 m appears in the shallow sedimentary layer during the rainy season whereas the low resistivity zone in the dry season has a thickness of 2 6 m as the tide ebbs fig 8 a e the shallow low resistivity zone in the sediments decrease rapidly toward the sea side during both seasons but in the dry season it disappears more slowly than that in the rainy season the range of the middle and low resistivity zone slowly expands to the deep part in both seasons at low tide isolated low resistivity anomaly in the deep sediments occur during both seasons the distribution range of isolated low resistivity bodies during the rainy season is smaller than in the dry season and the resistivity values are larger in the rainy season than that in the dry season during the rainy and dry seasons there is a band shaped region with high resistivity 7 ω m mainly distributed in the bottom boundary of medium coarse sand layer and the pebble layer in the rainy season during the ebb tide the high resistivity zone first compresses to the pebble layer and the ocean side and gradually recovers during the flood tide the range of its distribution changes little during the tidal cycle in the dry season at the early stage of the ebb tide the high resistivity zone compresses rapidly to the pebble layer and then to the ocean side during the flood tide its vertical and lateral distribution range recover gradually therefore we speculate that the high resistivity zone is the main distribution zone of low salinity water or fresh water it is important to note that the groundwater level and sea level rise simultaneously during the flood tide process and the seawater will invade the sediment rapidly after the beach surface is submerged however the deep fresh water cannot be mixed with the intrusion high salinity water quickly and it will be covered in the deep sediment with the decrease in the intensity of seawater intrusion and the continuous discharge of the inland fresh water to the sea the distribution area of fresh water will gradually expand this makes the vertical and lateral distribution range of the high resistivity zone expand continuously however at the end of flood tide i i the high resistivity zone does not completely recover to its vertical and lateral distribution range at the beginning of ebb tide a a in the early stage of ebb tide the sea level begins to decrease but the decrease rate of inland groundwater level is less than that of sea level fig 4 therefore the discharge degree of inland fresh water to the sea will increase continuously in a short time and the vertical and lateral distribution range of fresh water covered by high salinity water will continue to expand this causes the high resistivity zone in the resistivity profile to expand further until it reaches its distribution range at the initial tide time a a based on the above analysis there are seasonal differences in the exchange of saline and freshwater in tidal flats over tidal cycles the degree of seawater intrusion andsalinization in the dry season are significantly greater thanthatin the rainy season after seawater intrudes into the sediments several isolated high salinitywater bodies are formed in it which means that it is easier for seawater to intrude into the deep aquifer and fresh water cannot be discharged more stably through the beachsurface during ebbing tide in dry seasons 6 discussion 6 1 characteristics of salinity changes of sandy beaches during groundwater discharge during dry and rainy seasons the salinity change ratio image fig 9 is calculated based on eq 5 since the resistivity data collected at tide time e were collected at low tide the data are used as a reference for the conversion of the salinity change ratio the result can reflect salinity change in shallow sediments during the process of groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion during the tidal cycle the determination of usp and fdt is based on the theory that the usp develop in the salinity increase zone in the surface sediments on the nearshore side and the fdt develop in the salinity decrease zone below the usp abarca et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 han et al 2018 fig 9 shows that during the tidal cycle in the two seasons the salinity increase zones distributed in the tidal flat sediments which are usps they are mainly distributed in the sediment from the beach surface to the depth of about 5 m at 40 160 m of the monitoring section and located above the fdts during the period from the beginning of ebb tide to the early stage of flood tide a f the vertical and lateral range of usp gradually decreases and some areas with reduced salinity divide usp forming multiple usps in the shallow intertidal sediments at the same time the distribution position of usps gradually sinks and the salinity of its internal pore water gradually decreases during the flood tide after the seawater submerges the beach surface the seawater invades the sediments rapidly at this time usps receive the supplement of high salinity water and its internal pore water salinity increases and the lateral and vertical range expands rapidly in conclusion during the tidal cycle there is a continuous and significant mixing process of seawater and fresh water in usps this phenomenon is also found in the numerical simulation of beach aquifer boufadel et al 2011 the salinity change ratio profile fig 9 shows that there are several salinity decreasing zones below the usps which are fdts these tubes are conduit for the discharge of inland freshwater to the sea fig 9 shows that in the two seasons the main fdt exists mostly near the low tide line which is consistent with the existing research results heiss j w et al 2014 boufadel m c et al 1999 robinson c et al 2007 li h et al 2008 during the ebb tide as the sea recedes fdts develop rapidly from the deep below to the beach surface where the seawater is not covered and divide the usp into multiple sections with the continuous decline of the tide level a main fdt develops near the low tide line the salinity of fresh water in fdt is lower during high tide than during low tide this is because at high tide although the sea level and the inland groundwater level are at high level fig 4 the inland hydraulic head still exists and the inland fresh water still be discharged to sea through fdt at this time the high salinity water covers the fresh water in the fdt while the mixing rate of high salinity water in usp and fresh water in fdt is slow so the salinity of water in fdt remains at a low level during the ebb tide the gradual increase of the inland hydraulic heads leads to a larger amount of groundwater discharge fig 4 the salinity of water in fdts keeps increasing and that of water in usps decreases fig 9 a d a d indicating that the high salinity water in usps and fresh water in fdts are continuously mixing this mixing process may cause a slight increase in the salinity of the pore water in the fdts and the mixed water rather than fresh water is discharged from the beach surface during this process during the flood tide as the seawater submerges the beach surface fdts are no longer connected with the beach surface and the groundwater discharge from the beach surface through the fdts gradually reduced and the salinity of pore water in fdts begins to decrease fig 9 f i f i however compared with the results of numerical simulation the distribution range of usps and fdts obtained from in situ monitoring is unstable which may be caused by many factors such as tide heterogeneity of tidal flat sediment and so on by comparing the distribution range of usps and fdts in different seasons and its changes of salinity we found that in the rainy season at the early stage of ebb tide a e b e and the late stage of flood tide h e i e the vertical extent of usp is smaller and the thickness of fdt is thicker in the dry season the distribution range of fdt is unstable and there are many isolated salinity increasing zones in the low tide but this phenomenon does not appear in the rainy season during the ebb tide in rainy season the salinity of pore water in the usps and fdts changes rapidly the pore water salinity change ratio of usps generally decreases from 0 6 to 2 4 to 0 0 3 and that of fdts increases from 0 9 0 3 to 0 3 0 fig 9 during the ebb tide in the dry season the salinity of pore water in usps and fdts have different change patterns which changes slowly at the early stage of ebb tide but rapidly near the low tide in this process the pore water salinity change ratio of usps generally decreases from 0 6 to 2 4 to 0 3 1 and that of fdts increases from 0 9 0 6 to 0 6 0 3 only in the low tide stage d e the salinity of pore water changes rapidly fig 9 combined with the monitoring results of groundwater level fig 3 it can be inferred that the difference of hydraulic driving force intensity caused by the difference of land side groundwater level in dry season and rainy season is the main factor leading to the difference of distribution range and salinity change of usps and fdts in different seasons compared with the dry season the land side groundwater level is higher and the hydraulic driving force is stronger in rainy season at the the early stage of ebb tide and the late stage of flood tide in rainy season more fresh water is discharged to the sea through fdt which makes the larger vertical extent and better continuity in the horizontal extent of fdt and shallower depth of usp during the low tide in rainy season fresh water and high salinity water in usp can be more fully mixed and discharged from the beach surface and the distribution range of usps is more stable in addition the higher hydraulic heads in rainy season makes the water between usps and fdts mixing faster after the seawater recedes which makes the salinity of pore water change continuously and rapidly during the ebb tide 6 2 calculation of groundwater discharge in sandy beaches during rainy and dry seasons the inverted resistivity data of the high tide a and low tide e in each season are substituted into eq 8 to obtain δ s h l profiles as shown in fig 10 b the seepage surface is the main place for groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone fig 1 shows that it is mainly distributed between 40 m and the low tide line in the monitoring period however according to the field observation and groundwater level monitoring results fig 4 the duration of the seepage surface at different zones is different which leads to differences in groundwater discharge at different locations in the intertidal zone in addition there will also be a large amount of groundwater discharge in the subtidal zone and offshore area peterson et al 2016 george et al 2020 therefore we use the salinity box model to quantify the groundwater discharge between 40 m and 247 5 m so as to analysis the difference of groundwater discharge volume and regional distribution of discharge zone in different seasons the areas with white or red color scale level in fig 10 b is the main zone of groundwater discharge which can be divided into several salinity boxes shown in black box a b c d a b and c based on the amount of δ s h l in the same color scale level and the depth of groundwater discharge zone at different position and the average inverted resistivity in the range of each salinity box at high tide and low tide is used to calculate the groundwater discharge combined with the formation data it can be seen that the sediment layer in this area is a medium coarse sand layer and a pebble layer with high permeability which is the main source of groundwater discharge fig 10 b shows that groundwater discharge zone is mainly distributedin the sediment layer within 5 m and the distribution range of groundwater discharge area is different in different seasons the boundary of blue and white zones in fig 10 b is defined as the boundary of each salinity box and the length and width of each salinity box can be determined table 2 the width of equalization unit is set to 1 m after determining these parameters the groundwater discharge can be calculated according to eq 8 as shown in table 2 according to estimates the groundwater discharge in the monitoring area during the rainy season is 837 3 m3 and the groundwater discharge in the dry season is 691 0 m3 groundwater discharge during the rainy season is about 1 21 times that during the dry season it can also be seen from fig 10 b that the groundwater discharge zones were distributed in the intertidal zone and the subtidal zone in both seasons in general the degree of discharge gradually increases from land to sea which is consistent with the groundwater level monitoring results and the maximum discharge location is near the low tide line this feature has been confirmed in our previous research zhang 2020 7 conclusion tidally influenced groundwater discharge in tidal flats is an important transport mechanism by which terrestrial materials can enter the sea groundwater and marine dynamic processes change between rainy and dry seasons which may cause different seasonal impacts on the coastal ecological environment this study discusses the characteristics of groundwater salinity distribution and groundwater discharge in a shilaoren sandy tidal flat during dry and rainy seasons by analyzing the inverted resistivity image of groundwater discharge at a sandy beach and comparing the results for dry and rainy seasons we found that the resistivity of the sediment layer and the water levels showed regular changes under the effect of tides due to the differences in the groundwater flow fields and groundwater dynamics during the dry and rainy seasons resistivity changes at the same location and at the same measuring point in the tidal cycle are different the degree of seawater intrusion and salinizationin the dry season are significantly greater than in the rainy season andseveralisolated high salinity water bodies are formed inside it during rainyseason the distributioncharacteristicsof low salinity water and fresh water is less affected by seawater intrusion and groundwater discharge it is difficult for seawater to intrudedeep aquifer and the groundwater can be discharged more stably through the beachsurface the salinity change ratio images of the groundwater discharge at a sandy beach in the dry and rainy seasons shows that usp is always distributed in tidal flat sediments and there is a band shaped fdt below the usp which extends upward from the deep sediment layer to near the low tide line during the period from the beginning of ebb tide to the beach surface being submerged again the vertical and lateral range of usp gradually decreases and the distribution position gradually sinks the fdts develop from deep below to beach surface and divide the usp into multiple sections during the flood tide the usps receive the supplement of high salinity water its internal pore water salinity increases and the lateral and vertical ranges expand rapidly the differences of usps and fdts in different seasons are as follows in the dry season the vertical extent of usp is larger around high tide and the distribution range of fdts is more unstable during the ebb tide the pore water salinity in usps and fdts changes from the moment when seawater starts receding however in the dry season it changes more slowly during the early stage of the ebb tide and more rapidly near the end the ebb tide the difference of hydraulic driving force is the main factor leading to the difference of distribution range and pore water salinity change of usps and fdts in different seasons according to calculations using salinity box theory the amount of groundwater discharge also varies seasonally the amount of groundwater discharge in the rainy season is about 1 21 times that during the dry season in both seasons the groundwater discharge zones are distributed in the intertidal and subtidal zones the groundwater discharge gradually increases from land to sea and the maximum discharge location is near the low tide line credit

3986,the elevated levels of antimony sb and arsenic as in groundwater caused by mine activities is of particular global concern understanding pollution mechanism of sb and as related to mine activities and their influence on karst groundwater geochemistry is of great significance however it is still unclear to address such questions sb and as and major ions δ34s and δ18o of dissolved sulfate as well as δd and δ18o of water were analyzed for groundwater sampled from three main karst aquifers at the xikuangshan xks antimony mine from 2013 to 2017 spatial and temporal variations of sb and as of the three main karst aquifers were characterized as that 1 sb concentrations rather than as varied with aquifers with high sb 1 50 mg l of the d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers and low sb 0 01 1 0 mg l of the d3x4 aquifer 2 as concentrations had significant seasonal effect that was higher in winter and lower in summer whereas sb concentrations did not differ seasonally here we applied a recently developed cluster analysis method as well as geochemical indicators to identify pollution types of sb and as in groundwater related to complex mine activities and further to reveal main effects on karst groundwater geochemistry the cluster analysis yielded a classification of four clusters which was confirmed by principal component analysis the groundwater of cluster 3 is of weakly alkaline hco3 ca type with low sb 0 015 mg l and low as 0 005 mg l which is typical karst groundwater controlled by limestone dissolution whereas the other three clusters with high concentrations of sb and as were identified to represent three pollution patterns dominated by oxidative dissolution of stibnite leaching of mine wastes and mixed pollution respectively moreover the effects of long term mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry are revealed including 1 hydrogeochemical compositions of groundwater changed from hco3 ca type to so4 ca type 2 sulfuric acid significantly participated in carbonate weathering 3 weathering of silicate main as silicified limestone by h2co3 and h2so4 was accelerated 4 cation exchange was enhanced to dominate groundwater geochemistry another striking finding is that sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate can effectively distinguish sulfate sources related to mine activities and to trace sb sources in karst groundwater keywords arsenic mine activities karst groundwater geochemistry cluster analysis xikuangshan mine 1 introduction antimony sb and arsenic as are metalloids of high interest that are considered to be toxic and hazardous to human health or even carcinogenic gebel 1997 guo et al 2021 wu et al 2011 and their compounds are also considered as pollutants of priority interest by the european union 1976 and the united states environmental protection agency 1979 the world health organization who recommended 10 μg l for as in 1993 and 5 μg l for sb in 2019 respectively as provisional guideline values in drinking water however whether the who limits ensures protection of human health is a considerable uncertainty ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 a lower value may be recommended like the netherlands where as level in drinking water reduces to below 1 μg l ahmad et al 2020 the elevated levels of sb and as in soils sediments surface ground water and biological systems caused by increasing mine activities during the past decades have received considerable attention worldwide ashley et al 2003 bundschuh et al 2017 cidu et al 2014 filella et al 2009a fu et al 2016 hiller et al 2012 palmer et al 2019 tapia et al 2019 mine activities contribute to the release of sb and as from host minerals and its subsequent mobility in the surrounding environment through the process of cushing milling and sulfide oxidation amos et al 2015 approximately 40 of groundwater in china have been affected by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines liang et al 2018 exploitation and processing of sb ores are believed to be one of the most important sources for environmentally significant sb and as contamination guo et al 2014a hiller et al 2012 hu et al 2017 johnston et al 2020 palmer et al 2019 telford et al 2009 for instance hillgrove sb gold mine in australia xikuangshan stibnite mine in china and abandoned sb mines in the western carpathians slovakia are all associated with an extensive release of both metalloids to the environment numerous laboratory studies on oxidative dissolution kinetics of antimony bearing ores such as stibnite sb2s3 and antimony trioxide sb2o3 biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2016 2015 2014 hu and he 2017 xiang et al 2021 yan et al 2020 and oxidation and adsorption behavior of sb ions guo et al 2014b hockmann et al 2020 kong et al 2016 2015 kong and he 2016 xi et al 2016 2014 have been conducted to understand mobilization mechanisms of sb from its host mineral phases as well as natural geochemical processes controlling its migration and transformation in groundwater furthermore a series of critical reviews filella et al 2009b 2007 2002a 2002b filella and williams 2012 he et al 2019 2012 herath et al 2017 multani et al 2016 wilson et al 2010 on the occurrence characteristic of solution chemistry geochemical behavior and mobilization mechanisms of sb have been published helping elucidate the geochemistry mobility and fate of sb in different environmental systems and making raising awareness of sb to establish a sustainable sb mitigation on a global scale karst aquifers capable of storing and transmitting large amount water are critical for the support of human societies and ecological systems in many regions worldwide chen et al 2017 their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerabiligy to retain and spread the contamination and the complexity of karst systems makes it challenging to investigate and understand hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst kalhor et al 2019 valdes et al 2007 more attention was paid on the occurence origin geochemcal mechanisms and factors that regulate the mobilization and fate of as in aquifer systems e g lima et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 sracek et al 2004 tapia et al 2019 2020 which help understand the as behavior in different settings across continents few relevant research works were conducted on sb behavior in karst aquifers primary antimony minerals are typically sulfides because of a higher affinity of antimony for sulfur than oxygen due to geologic disturbance from mining activities antimony minerals mainly stibnite sb2s3 are exposed to an oxidizing environment and react with oxygen and water to produce acid mine drainage amd and release sb as and other toxic metals to the surrounding groundwater biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2017 li et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 on one hand the amd exhausts the bicarbonate buffering capacity of carbonate aquifers and results in a series of geochemical processes such as dissolution of carbonates and silicates and hydrolysis of metal ions which complicated groundwater geochemical evolution ren et al 2021 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 on the other hand groundwater chemical components such as ph eh concentrations of dissolved oxygen elemental sulfur metal ions fe mn ca mg etc and other organic ligands can have an impact on the dissolution of natural sb2s3 and transport and fate of sb and as in groundwater arsic et al 2018 besold et al 2019 biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2015 kong and he 2016 in the special case of stibnite even under very drastic acid drainage conditions sb is not as rapidly mobilized as under relatively mild basic conditions biver and shotyk 2012 this means that naturally buffered karst groundwater is more conducive to antimony release from its host minerals therefore it is of great significance to understand the effects of mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry and sb as pollution the xikuangshan xks antimony mine in china is the largest sb mine in the world with mining and smelting history more than 120 years mining mineral processing smelting and other mine activities have generated large amounts of waste materials such as waste rock smelting slag and tailing which occurred over an extensive area and have been subjected to water runoff and aeolian erosion for many years yang et al 2015 as a result sb concentration was strikingly observed as high as 42 mg l in mining impacted karst groundwater up to date there are still few field studies on antimony and arsenic pollution in karst groundwater at the xks mine wen et al 2018 20116 applied s and sr isotopes to track sources of sb and as contamination indicating sb and as mainly derived from stibnite and silicified limestone li et al 2020 aimed to reveal the source of sb and geochemical behaviors of the mine drainage water hao et al 2020 compared the chemical characteristics of groundwater between high and low antimony based on once sampling however here are several key problems still require clarification 1 what are the temporal variations of sb and as pollution in different karst aquifers 2 how to identify pollution types of sb and as in groundwater associated with the complex mining activities 3 how does the long term mine activities affect karst groundwater geochemistry to address such questions we analyzed sb and as and major ions δ34s and δ18o of dissolved sulfate and δd and δ18o of the karst groundwater sampled from three main carbonate aquifers at the xks mine area during the six periods from 2013 to 2017 we attempted to apply a cluster analysis method of all the sampling periods lumped together to classify and characterize spatial temporal antimony and arsenic pollution and further to identify the sources and pollution types of sb and as in groundwater associated with mine activities the connection between increased sb levels and mine activities was demonstrated by tracing sulfate sources via stable isotopes of sulfate the principal objective of this study to clarify the effects of antimony mine activities on the evolution of karst groundwater geochemistry and sb and as pollution 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the xks sb mine is one of the oldest and best known antimony mining districts worldwide remaining as much as approximately 40 million tons of antimony reserves after more than 120 years of exploration qi et al 2011 it is located in a mountainous area with a ne sw orientation 13 km north of lengshuijiang city hunan province central china covering an area of 26 km2 the climate is typically subtropical monsoon with an average annual temperature precipitation and evaporation of 16 7 c 1381 mm and 903 mm respectively wen et al 2016 the rainy season primarily occurs during march to august several streams belonging to upstream of zijiang water system originate from the xks mine the mining area is divided into two mines the south mine and the north mine with the qilijiang as the boundary this study is focused on the north mine as shown in fig 1 the xks sb mine in which the major ore controlling structures are ne trending faults is a half edge anticline with an axial at ne30 and ends that plunge to the south and north the core of the anticline is composed of the upper devonian xikuangshan and shetianqiao formations surrounded by the lower carboniferous datang and yanguan formations fan et al 2004 the distribution of the outcrops is shown in fig 1 the west and east of the anticline are cut by a large f75 fault and a 10 km long lamprophyre vein respectively the xks sb deposit is a specific middle low temperature mineralization depression zone with most wall rock alteration of silication and carbonatization yang et al 2006 it occurs as stratiform bodies and veins in the upper silicified limestone layers of the shetianqiao formation which constitutes 80 of the total sb deposit reserves fan et al 2004 stibnite sb2s3 is the primary ore mineral accompanied by pyrite fes2 arsenopyrite feass sphalerite zns and galena pbs yang et al 2006 the two main groundwater systems in the xks sb mine are the lower shetianqiao karst aquifer d3s2 aquifer and the upper magunao karst aquifer d3x4 aquifer their lithology histogram in fig 1 the d3s2 aquifer consists of micrite limestone silicified limestone and shale with a thickness of 220 m and hosts the sb ore bodies the d3x4 aquifer as the primary source of the local drinking water is mainly composed of limestone and sandy limestone with a thickness of 258 m furthermore another c1y3 aquifer distributes near the lamprophyre vein and f75 fault the karst aquifers are recharged by precipitation and discharged by springs and mine drainage controlled by the topography geological structure and mining activities the regional groundwater mainly flows from southeast to northwest in the north mine through interlayer fracture zone limestone fissures passages and caves with different flowpaths in length wen et al 2018 many smelters were also in the xks mining area including antimony lead and zinc smelters mining related activities have generated large amounts of waste rock tailing and smelting waste these mine wastes cover over an extensive area of the xks mine for many years specifically arsenic alkali residue that was not handled properly and was piled up in the open air guo et al 2014a as a consequence the elevated levels of sb and as were observed in soils sediments surface ground water and biological systems e g guo et al 2018 li et al 2017 wang et al 2011 wen et al 2016 that posed large threats to drinking and irrigation water agricultural crop productivity food chain as well as human health 2 2 sampling and analytical methods a total of fifty seven groundwater samples were collected from running springs of three typical aquifers d3s2 d3x4 and c1y3 at the xks mine during six periods including dry and rainy seasons from 2013 to 2017 three mine drainage samples four mine tunnel karst fissure water samples three leachates from mine wastes and one smelting wastewater as well as three rainwater samples were collected within the mining area the locations of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 all water samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm acid washed membrane filters and stored in pre cleaned hdpe bottles the filtered samples for measurement of major cations sb and as were acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure hno3 for sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate analyses so4 2 in water samples was precipitated as baso4 by adding saturated bacl2 solution after acidified to ph 2 3 using 3 m hcl the baso4 precipitates were further treated with a dtpa dissolution and re precipitation method bao 2006 for oxygen isotopic measurement on site measurements of temperature ph and electric conductivity ec were determined using a hach portable water quality analyzer hq40d hco3 was measured with alkalinity titration method within 24 h after sampling the concentrations of major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions cl so4 2 no3 and f were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes and ion chromatography ic respectively ion charge imbalances are within 10 concentrations of sb and as were determined by atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry afs 820 with a precision better than 0 001 mg l the δ18o and δd values of water samples were determined by an isotopic water liquid and vapor analyzer lgr 920 0032 with a precision of 0 1 for δ18o and of 0 5 for δd δ34sso4 was analyzed by a delta v advantage equipped with a flash ea 2000 after the complete conversion of baso4 to so2 via a high temperature combustion with o2 and v2o5 at 1030 c corrections were assumed to be linear over the entire range of isotopic compositions and analytical reproducibility was better than 0 3 for standards and analytical duplicates δ18oso4 was determined via co generated on a thermal conversion elemental analyzer tcea at 1450 c coupled with a thermo fisher mat253 the δ18oso4 for each sample is the average of two runs on tcea and has an error less than 0 5 the results of δd and δ18o are reported in relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and δ34s was relative to vienna canyon diablo troilite standard v cdt the geochemical and isotopic analytical results are shown in table a and b 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis a recently developed cluster analysis method pacheco castro et al 2018 was applied to lumped data of all the sampling periods at the xks mine given a set of clusters classified using ward method with euclidean distance if chemical data at the same sampling location do not vary significantly in time the data belong to the same cluster this observation allows to identify the sample sites where groundwater geochemistry changes in time and to analyze the temporal and spatial processes affecting groundwater geochemistry thirteen chemical variables sb as ph tds k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f of the lumped groundwater samples were selected for cluster analysis any two variables of which have a correlation coefficient 90 and coefficient of variation more than 5 the cluster analysis was applied to the log transformed and standardized data güler et al 2002 once the cluster analysis is complete the dendrogram is used to select the number of clusters for further analysis the principal component analysis was conducted independently from the cluster analysis to verify whether the determined cluster number is reasonable and to identify the main variables that explain most of the variation of groundwater geochemistry pacheco castro et al 2018 yang et al 2020 all parameters were plotted using box plots grouped by cluster the box plots provide information about the main characteristics of each cluster and allows a direct comparison of differences among clusters 3 results 3 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of groundwater groundwater samples from the d3x4 d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers in 2013 2017 have δd and δ18o ranging from 51 7 to 36 6 and from 8 3 to 6 2 respectively the δd and δ18o averages are 39 3 0 4 and 6 4 0 1 for mine drainage and 39 6 1 5 and 6 3 0 2 for mine tunnel karst fissure water respectively all the groundwater samples as well as rainwater samples are plotted near the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 2 indicating groundwater originated from local meteoric water the lmwl was cited from that of the adjacent changsha city in hunan province wu et al 2012 the groundwater has significant difference in isotopic compositions among the three aquifers p 0 01 particularly the groundwater samples of the d3s2 aquifer have a positive linear correlation r2 0 897 fig 2 with a lower slop of 6 67 indicating evaporation effect of groundwater the isotope compositions show a significant decreasing with time which may indicate upward recharge of deep groundwater caused by large mine drainage from the d3s2 aquifer 3 2 spatial and temporal variations of sb and as in groundwater concentrations of sb and as in groundwater of the d3x4 d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers during the periods of 2013 2017 have a wide range from 5 μg l to 50 mg l and from 0 5 μg l to 3 mg l respectively the spatial and temporal variation of sb and as is shown in fig 3 groundwater samples from the d3x4 d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers were named beginning with x s and y respectively the sb concentration showed an order of magnitude difference among aquifers as shown in fig 3a the groundwater samples of the d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers have sb more than 1 mg l of which 32 5 47 4 mg l for s 18 10 20 mg l for s 17 5 10 mg l for y 19 and 1 5 mg l for s 51 s 52 and s 53 whereas the groundwater samples of the d3x4 aquifer basically have lower sb than 1 mg l of which x 03 x 05 and x 10 have sb ranging from 0 1 mg l to 0 5 mg l except for a large increase in 2017 in particular x 02 has the lowest sb with an average of 0 03 mg l and significant seasonal variation characterized as higher in winter but lower in summer in terms of temporal variation groundwater samples named as x 03 x 05 x 10 and s 53 showed an increasing sb from 2015 to 2017 especially in 2017 compared with sb the as concentration did not vary with aquifers as shown in fig 3b the s 17 and x 03 have stable high as more than 0 5 mg l while the s 18 and y 19 have high as decreasing from 0 4 mg l in 2013 to 0 04 mg l in 2017 the x 05 x 10 s 51 and s 52 fluctuated between 0 005 and 0 02 mg l in 2014 2017 while the x 02 and s 53 had the lowest as ranging from 0 5 to 5 μg l at the same periods however seasonal effect is observed in fig 3b for as concentration that is higher in winter than in summer it is indicated the as mainly came from leachate of rain affected surface mine wastes during the periods of 2013 2014 the as concentrations of s 17 and s 18 increased significantly whereas the others decreased of which the as concentrations of x 02 x 05 and x 10 dropped from 0 5 to 0 005 mg l the decreasing as concentration in 2014 may be attributed to removal several arsenic alkali residues at the xks mine since 2014 3 3 classified four clusters the dendrogram of cluster analysis for the selected variables is shown in fig a for this study a dissimilarity value of about 18 was selected which splits the dendrogram into four clusters the cluster 1 c1 included 39 groundwater samples mainly from the y 19 s 17 s 51 x 03 x 10 s 52 and x 05 the cluster 2 c2 cluster 3 c3 and cluster 4 c4 included 6 groundwater samples of s 18 4 groundwater samples of x 02 and 5 samples of s 53 respectively the clusters result showed samples from the same sampling site of all the sampling periods nearly belong to the same cluster with the exceptions of 4 samples of x 02 x 05 and s 52 sampled in july 2014 and x 02 in december 2017 the resulted four clusters were plotted into biplots using principal components as shown in fig b while fig b 1 for principal component 1 pc1 and 2 pc2 shows that the data corresponding to c1 and c2 are apparently overlapping the two clusters have substantial difference in fig b 2 for principal component 1 and 3 pc3 therefore the four clusters are clearly distinguished from each other indicating that the cluster classification is reasonable the main variables that explain most of the variation of groundwater geochemistry were also identified by the principal component analysis the pc1 explains 43 of the total variance and is characterized by the high loadings of tds 0 92 and major ions 0 6 0 8 such as k cl no3 na ca2 so4 2 mg2 and f the pc2 explains 17 of the total variances and is characterized by the high loadings of hco3 0 74 ph 0 70 ca2 0 57 and so4 2 0 56 therefore pc1 can be related to comprehensive rocks weathering and pc2 can be related to weathering of limestone with sulfuric acid components 3 and 4 is dominated by sb 0 66 and as 0 63 respectively which explain 11 6 and 8 7 of the total variation therefore pc3 and pc4 together highlight the sb and as pollution in groundwater associated with mine activities 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of sb as co pollution in groundwater of classified clusters sb and as are typical pollutants in groundwater at the xks mine which far exceed china s and the who guideline s drinking water standard wen et al 2018 2016 the distinctly distinguished characteristics of sb and as co pollution in groundwater of the classified four clusters are displayed in fig 4 the c3 is characterized by low levels of sb 50 μg l and low as 10 μg l with an exception of 0 5 mg l as in july 2013 which are close to sb and as background at the xks mine where hardly affected by mine activities the high as concentration of x 02 sampled in july 2013 may be contributed by leaching of the arsenic alkali residue once piled nearby that had been removed since 2014 in contrast the c2 is characterized by anomalously high sb of 32 5 47 4 mg l and varying as as high as 1 36 mg l such high concentrations of sb and as in groundwater are the result of continuous accumulation of leaching of smelting solid waste and smelting waste water which is supported by concentrations of sb and as sampled from slags leachate and smelting waste water as shown in fig 4 the as concentrations varied from 0 025 to 1 36 mg l between 2013 and 2017 and peaked in 2014 which depends on leaching behavior of arsenic alkali residue influenced by a variety of factors guo et al 2014a compared to the c3 groundwater of the c4 had low as 10 μg l but high sb ranging from 0 8 to 3 0 mg l this may be related to oxidative dissolution of stibnite within the ore bearing aquifer d3s2 the primary mineral of xks ore deposit is stibnite sb2s3 with little associated minerals such as arsenopyrite feass hu et al 2017 the as content is 0 8 6 1 mg kg of non silicified limestone and 4 5 26 3 mg kg of silicified limestone ma et al 2002 during the process of mining sb2s3 can dissolve under oxidized conditions and lead to sb releasing into groundwater as sb oh 6 that is stable and can be transported over a long distance biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2011 complexly the c1 covered a wide range of sb and as concentrations indicating the result from combined contamination there is a distinct tendency of the cluster 1 to be divided into three groups as shown in fig 4 which are controlled by different pollution sources associated with mine activities the group 1 including samples y 19 and s 17 distributed between the c2 and the c4 but near the c2 with anomalous high sb and as concentrations indicating the dominated source is leachate of mine wastes the group 2 including samples such as x 02 x 10 s 51 and s 52 distributed between c3 and c4 with low as and high sb indicating the sb is dominated by oxidative dissolution of sb2s3 the group 3 with medium sb 0 1 1 mg l and high as 0 3 2 mg l may be related to leaching of arsenic alkali residue combined with oxidative dissolution of sb2s3 4 2 geochemical indicators of sb as pollution types associated with mine activities in order to determine sb and as pollution types related to mine activities at the xks mine geochemical parameters of groundwater that may indicate pollution sources and processes are further discussed by the box plots and pearson correlation analysis on the basis of the above discussion of sb and as co pollution characteristics of the four clusters the box plots of geochemical parameters such as sb as ph tds ca2 mg2 na hco3 and so4 2 for the four clusters are shown in fig 5 the result of the pearson correlation analysis between any two of geochemical parameters for each cluster are listed in table c for the c3 groundwater is of hco3 ca type with a ph ranging from 7 5 to 8 6 total dissolved solids tds varying from 129 to 188 mg l and so4 2 as low as 25 5 3 8 mg l the tds has significant correlation with mg2 1 000 p 0 01 si 0 999 p 0 05 and hco3 0 987 p 0 05 and the hco3 has significant correlation with mg2 0 989 p 0 05 and ca2 0 955 p 0 05 these are typical hydrogeochemical characteristics for groundwater dominated by carbonate weathering the as with an average of 2 5 μg l showed positive correlation with si and cl at a significant level of p 0 01 whereas the sb with an average of 0 02 mg l has no significant correlation with any other geochemical parameters therefore the c3 can represent the background groundwater far away from mining affected area with the low sb and as released from bedrock weathering the anomalous high sb of the c2 is as high as 47 4 mg l along with high as of 0 38 10 54 mg l the ph values range from 7 0 to 8 0 compared to the c3 the c2 has lower concentrations of mg2 and hco3 but higher so4 2 with an average of 63 8 10 9 mg l and the tds is significantly correlated with so4 2 0 844 p 0 05 these geochemical differences indicated that leaching of mine solid waste contributed to the anomalous high sb and as in groundwater actually a large amount of solid waste has been produced by smelting processes at the xks mine li and liang 2010 including water quenched slag arsenic alkali residue desulfurized slag and blast furnace dust the study on leaching behaviors of these four types of solid waste guo et al 2014a shows they are enriched in sb and as and can be leached out of sb and as being three orders of magnitude higher than the regulatory level and more specifically with high as level in arsenic alkali residue they are also supported by chemical characterization of leachate samples from waste dump and smelting waste water table b the most striking feature of the c4 is that groundwater is weakly acid with ph values of 6 0 7 4 the ph is consistent with the result of sb2s3 oxidation to h2so4 buffered and neutralized by carbonate minerals the oxidation of sb2s3 also contributed more so4 2 in groundwater of the cluster 4 moreover the tds is significantly correlated with so4 2 0 975 p 0 01 and sb is significantly correlated with si 0 962 p 0 01 the xrd results of the xks ores showed they contained sb2s3 sio2 and a little caco3 which can explain the relationship between sb and si in groundwater of the c4 in contrast to the c3 the c4 has higher mg2 and na but lower ca2 the calculated saturated index si of gypsum is greater than zero si 0 indicating gypsum of groundwater is in saturated state that means ca2 concentration in groundwater may decrease besides the lower concentrations of ca2 may be related to cation exchange that can result in increasing na and decreasing ca2 in groundwater in addition to a large variation of sb and as concentrations the c1 with a ph ranging from 7 0 to 8 5 has a wide range of tds and other major ions with significantly higher averaged values than other three clusters the tds ranged from 194 to 514 mg l and significantly correlated with all the major ions at a significant level of p 0 01 the sb significantly correlated with k si na no3 cl and so4 2 whereas the as significantly correlated with na f si and k respectively at a significant level of p 0 01 moreover a significant positive correlation is between sb and as 0 570 p 0 01 the correlation between these geochemical parameters indicates complex sb and as sources and pollution processes in groundwater of the c1 therefore the above evidences elucidate that the elevated concentrations of sb and as in groundwater of the c1 are influenced by bedrock weathering slag heap infiltration mine drainage smelting wastewater and domestic sewage 4 3 effects of mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry 4 3 1 hydrogeochemistry changed from hco3 ca to so4 ca type as indicated by the piper diagram fig 6 for the four clusters the dominant ions of groundwater samples changed from hco3 to so4 for anions and from ca to na for cations respectively weathering and dissolution of widely distributed carbonates is the most important hydrogeochemical process to control groundwater chemistry in the karst area the groundwater is dominated by hco3 ca such as groundwater of the c3 with background level of sb and as which is a typical karstic composition as indicated by other studies of the geochemistry of karst waters e g jiang et al 2009 long et al 2012 valdes et al 2007 however the chemical composition of groundwater with high sb and as becomes complex because of the impact of sb mine activities the elevated so4 2 accounts for 25 92 of the total anions on a molar basis with an average of 48 the hydrogeochemical type of the c2 is dominated by hco3 so4 ca and that of the c4 is dominated by so4 ca while that of the c1 is diverse including hco3 so4 ca so4 hco3 ca hco3 so4 ca na and so4 hco3 ca na the difference in hydrochemical types among clusters indicate difference in the degree of the influence of pollution types on hydrogeochemistry a significant positive linear correlation is observed between sb so4 2 molar ratio and sb molar concentration as shown in fig 7 a suggesting sb has a certain homology with sulfate the two distinct end member are groundwater of background c3 and of c2 polluted by leachate of mine wastes along with groundwater of c2 controlled by stibnite oxidation plotted in the middle indicating the influences of mine activities on both sb and so4 2 in groundwater therefore using isotopic method tracing sulfate sources may help understand sb sources associated with mine activities the sources of so4 2 in groundwater are potentially contributed by atmospheric precipitation dissolution of sulfate evaporite minerals such as gypsum oxidation of reduced sulfide minerals and mineralization of organic s compounds within soil as well as human activities li et al 2011 the anthropogenic so4 2 sources at the xks mine are mainly associated with mine activities including mine drainage leachate of waste heaps and smelting slags and smelting wastewater since so4 2 behaves conservatively in groundwater under relative oxidation condition sulfur and oxygen isotopic signatures of sulfate from different sources may be revealed in the total so4 2 edraki et al 2005 gammons et al 2013 samborska et al 2013 sun et al 2017 taylor and wheeler 1994 fig 7b shows the isotopic compositions of sulfate sources at the xks mine together with plots of groundwater samples the majority of stibnite at the xks mine ranges between 5 to 10 with a mean of 7 4 ma et al 2003 r yang et al 2006 the δ34sso4 values of gypsum in the study area were 2 59 11 09 with an average value of 5 33 liu et al 1985 jin et al 2001 the average δ34sso4 value of pyrite in the lamprophyre dike is 5 4 d yang et al 2006 the mine drainage water as well as mine tunnel fissure water has an average of 4 5 1 3 for δ34sso4 and of 3 4 2 0 for δ18oso4 the leachate of mine heaps and slags and smelting waster has δ34sso4 values ranging between 1 4 and 8 5 and δ18oso4 values ranging between 0 5 and 5 2 according to the isotopic compositions of the plotted groundwater samples sources relating to mine activities such as stibnite oxidation and leaching of mine wastes are the main sources contributing to groundwater so4 2 rather than atmospheric precipitation gypsum dissolution and pyrite oxidation the groundwater samples are plotted within the triangle area that takes mine heap leachate smelting waste and the c3 as the vertex respectively in fig 7c and fig 7d the consistence of the relationship between δ34sso4 and so4 2 and between δ34sso4 and sb further demonstrates the influence of mine activities on co increasing concentrations of sb and so4 2 in groundwater samples in contrast with background groundwater of the c3 it is worthwhile pointing out that δ34sso4 values of both groundwater of the c4 and mine drainage water are more negative than the δ34s value of stibnite δ34ssb2s3 this might be explained by the formation of sulfur intermediates during sb2s3 oxidation which can result in an enrichment of 32s in sulfate relative to sulfide large isotope fractionations were observed in the oxidation experiments of other sulfide minerals such as pyrite balci et al 2007 sphalerite heidel et al 2011 galena heidel and tichomirowa 2011 chalcopyrite thurston et al 2010 and sulfide mixtures heidel et al 2013 so4 2 was illustrated not the primary end product of sb2s3 oxidation but instead intermediate valence s n species 2 n 6 such as elemental sulfur thiosulfates and sulfite were the primary oxidation products of s ii e g biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 ullrich et al 2013 4 3 2 significant participation of sulfuric acid in carbonate weathering in karst groundwater ca2 mg2 and hco3 are the main products of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid that exists in natural environment following the reaction of eq 1 1 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 h 2 c o 3 x c a 2 1 x m g 2 2 h c o 3 0 x 1 as shown by eq 1 the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent charge ratio should be close to 1 when only carbonic acid is involved in the reaction however the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent charge ratios of groundwater samples mostly range between 1 and 2 fig c 1 showing hco3 produced by carbonic acid was not enough to balance ca2 mg2 other sources of acid thus should have contribution to carbonate weathering sulfuric acid produced by natural and anthropogenic activities participates in carbonate weathering following the reaction of eq 2 by which the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio should be 2 2 2 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 h 2 s o 4 2 x c a 2 2 1 x m g 2 2 h c o 3 s o 4 2 0 x 1 as indicated by eq 1 and eq 2 when carbonate weathering is governed by carbonic and sulfuric acid together the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 equivalent ratio should be 1 fig c 2 shows most groundwater samples were plotted above the 1 1 line which implies that sulfuric acid plays a significant role in carbonate weathering sb mining results in the exposure of sulfide minerals mainly stibnite sb2s3 to oxygen and water where sb2s3 oxidation reaction occurs to produce so4 2 and h that is subsequently neutralized by carbonates as shown in eq 3 and eq 4 3 s b 2 s 3 8 h 2 o 7 o 2 2 s b oh 6 3 s o 4 2 8 h 4 s b 2 s 3 8 c a c o 3 7 o 2 10 h 2 o 2 s b oh 6 8 c a 2 3 s o 4 2 8 h c o 3 thus the co variation of the equivalent ratios of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 as well as netural to weak alkaline ph and high so4 2 concentration is evidence that sulfur acid plays a relatively important role in carbonate weathering at the xks mine area the weathering of carbonate by sulfuric acid is regarded as a source for the atmospheric co2 with no rapid balancing atmospheric co2 sink lerman et al 2007 martin 2017 which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate change xie et al 2021 as sulfuric acid are playing more and more significant role in carbonate weathering with the intensification of mine activities ali and atekwana 2011 li et al 2018 ren et al 2021 sun et al 2013 more attention should be paid to the role of mine activities on carbonate weathering and carbon cycle 4 3 3 enhancement of silicate weathering as suggested by the bi variate mixing diagrams of na normalized ca vs hco3 and na normalized ca vs mg gaillardet et al 1999 groundwater a is controlled by carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering at the xks mine are fig d silicified limestone is the main rock forming mineral containing sb ores and also the main component of the solid waste from mining therefore silicate weathering by carbonic acid and sulfuric acid is assumed to contribute to large groundwater chemistry expressed as eqs 5 8 0 x 1 5 c a x m g 1 x a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 h 2 c o 3 2

related to carbonate and silicate weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids triangular diagram for the milligram equivalent percentages of hco3 so4 2 and sio2 for groundwater of clusters are shown in fig 8 a as well as end member compositions of exclusive reactions compared to the c3 the milligram equivalent percentage of sio2 in groundwater of the other clusters increased to 12 50 the c2 has the highest percentage of sio2 ranging between 37 and 50 which probably related to strong silicate weathering the saturation indices of calcite and sio2 a were calculated and presented in fig 8b which can indicate whether rock minerals have the ability to dissolve in groundwater as shown in fig 8b the si of calcite in most groundwater was above zero indicating that calcite was over saturated and would not dissolve in most parts of the karst groundwater however the si of sio2 a in groundwater with high level sb was greater than that of c3 with low level of sb moreover the si of sio2 a in groundwater of c4 was above zero while that of c1 and c2 was below zero the order of si of sio2 a for the clusters is c4 c2 c1 c3 the results are evidence that high si content in groundwater is enhanced by the dissolution of sb rich silicified limestone 4 3 4 control of cation exchange on groundwater geochemistry the evidence of cation exchange can be identified by plotting the bivariate plots of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 versus na k cl of water samples li et al 2019 wang et al 2015 2017 in most cases na and cl originate from halite dissolution and na k cl indicates an increase or decrease in na induced by processes excluding halite dissolution ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 represents the increase or decrease in ca2 and mg2 by processes other than the dissolution or precipitation of calcite dolomite and gypsum ideally when cation exchange is a significant process controlling groundwater chemistry the relationship between these two parameters should be linear with a slope of 1 fisher and mullican 1997 fig 9 a illustrated that the relationship between na k cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 of groundwater samples can be expressed as y 0 97x 0 117 with a correlation coefficient of 0 822 this suggests that cation exchange also plays an important role in the evolution of groundwater chemical composition furthermore chloro alkaline indices cai were employed to understand the influence of ion exchange in the chemical composition of groundwater schoeller 1965 typically two main factors cai 1 and cai 2 were expressed as cai 1 cl na k cl and cai 2 cl na k hco3 so4 2 co3 2 no3 respectively where all ions were expressed in meq l negative values for the two indices indicate ion exchange between ca2 or mg2 in groundwater with na and k in the aquifer material resulting in an increase in na and k concentration in groundwater and vice versa the larger the absolute cai values are the stronger the cation exchange is in this study about 90 of the groundwater samples are plotted in the lower left region of fig 9b suggesting that cation exchange expressed as eq 9 is an important process high sb groundwater samples of c1 c2 and c4 have higher absolute values of cai 1 and cai 2 than that of low sb groundwater of c3 indicating cation exchange interaction is stronger under the influence of mine activities 9 c a 2 2 n a x 2 n a c a x 2 o r m g 2 2 n a x 2 n a m g x 2 5 conclusions long term mine activities at the xks antimony mine resulted in serious sb and as pollution in groundwater which has a significant influence on the geochemistry of karst groundwater based on the monitoring data of six periods from 2013 to 2017 the temporal and seasonal variation of sb and as in groundwater of the three main karst aquifers was firstly characterized sb concentrations varied with aquifers lower in d3x4 aquifer than in aquifers of d3s2 and c1y3 but did not differ seasonally whereas differently as concentrations had a significant seasonal effect that is higher in winter and lower in summer but were not controlled by aquifers the cluster analysis applied to lumped data of all the sampling periods as well as geochemical indicators can identify pollution types of sb and as in groundwater related to complex mine activities the classified four clusters represent background karst groundwater with low levels of sb and as and three pollution patterns dominated by oxidative dissolution of stibnite leaching of mine waste and mixed pollution respectively these pollution types controlled spatial and temporal variation of sb and as and geochemical evolution of karst groundwater as a result the hydrogeochemical compositions of the karst groundwater changed from hco3 ca type to so4 ca type the dominance of so4 2 in groundwater was related to the elevated sb was confirmed by a positive correlation between molar ratio of sb so4 2 and sb and the common mine pollution sources traced by sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate moreover sulfuric acid resulted from sulfide oxidation played an important role in carbonate and silicate weathering and dissolution with the intensification of mine activities cation exchange was also enhanced to dominate groundwater geochemistry these findings

3986,the elevated levels of antimony sb and arsenic as in groundwater caused by mine activities is of particular global concern understanding pollution mechanism of sb and as related to mine activities and their influence on karst groundwater geochemistry is of great significance however it is still unclear to address such questions sb and as and major ions δ34s and δ18o of dissolved sulfate as well as δd and δ18o of water were analyzed for groundwater sampled from three main karst aquifers at the xikuangshan xks antimony mine from 2013 to 2017 spatial and temporal variations of sb and as of the three main karst aquifers were characterized as that 1 sb concentrations rather than as varied with aquifers with high sb 1 50 mg l of the d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers and low sb 0 01 1 0 mg l of the d3x4 aquifer 2 as concentrations had significant seasonal effect that was higher in winter and lower in summer whereas sb concentrations did not differ seasonally here we applied a recently developed cluster analysis method as well as geochemical indicators to identify pollution types of sb and as in groundwater related to complex mine activities and further to reveal main effects on karst groundwater geochemistry the cluster analysis yielded a classification of four clusters which was confirmed by principal component analysis the groundwater of cluster 3 is of weakly alkaline hco3 ca type with low sb 0 015 mg l and low as 0 005 mg l which is typical karst groundwater controlled by limestone dissolution whereas the other three clusters with high concentrations of sb and as were identified to represent three pollution patterns dominated by oxidative dissolution of stibnite leaching of mine wastes and mixed pollution respectively moreover the effects of long term mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry are revealed including 1 hydrogeochemical compositions of groundwater changed from hco3 ca type to so4 ca type 2 sulfuric acid significantly participated in carbonate weathering 3 weathering of silicate main as silicified limestone by h2co3 and h2so4 was accelerated 4 cation exchange was enhanced to dominate groundwater geochemistry another striking finding is that sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate can effectively distinguish sulfate sources related to mine activities and to trace sb sources in karst groundwater keywords arsenic mine activities karst groundwater geochemistry cluster analysis xikuangshan mine 1 introduction antimony sb and arsenic as are metalloids of high interest that are considered to be toxic and hazardous to human health or even carcinogenic gebel 1997 guo et al 2021 wu et al 2011 and their compounds are also considered as pollutants of priority interest by the european union 1976 and the united states environmental protection agency 1979 the world health organization who recommended 10 μg l for as in 1993 and 5 μg l for sb in 2019 respectively as provisional guideline values in drinking water however whether the who limits ensures protection of human health is a considerable uncertainty ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 a lower value may be recommended like the netherlands where as level in drinking water reduces to below 1 μg l ahmad et al 2020 the elevated levels of sb and as in soils sediments surface ground water and biological systems caused by increasing mine activities during the past decades have received considerable attention worldwide ashley et al 2003 bundschuh et al 2017 cidu et al 2014 filella et al 2009a fu et al 2016 hiller et al 2012 palmer et al 2019 tapia et al 2019 mine activities contribute to the release of sb and as from host minerals and its subsequent mobility in the surrounding environment through the process of cushing milling and sulfide oxidation amos et al 2015 approximately 40 of groundwater in china have been affected by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines liang et al 2018 exploitation and processing of sb ores are believed to be one of the most important sources for environmentally significant sb and as contamination guo et al 2014a hiller et al 2012 hu et al 2017 johnston et al 2020 palmer et al 2019 telford

groundwater furthermore a series of critical reviews filella et al 2009b 2007 2002a 2002b filella and williams 2012 he et al 2019 2012 herath et al 2017 multani et al 2016 wilson et al 2010 on the occurrence characteristic of solution chemistry geochemical behavior and mobilization mechanisms of sb have been published helping elucidate the geochemistry mobility and fate of sb in different environmental systems and making raising awareness of sb to establish a sustainable sb mitigation on a global scale karst aquifers capable of storing and transmitting large amount water are critical for the support of human societies and ecological systems in many regions worldwide chen et al 2017 their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerabiligy to retain and spread the contamination and the complexity of karst systems makes it challenging to investigate and understand hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst kalhor et al 2019 valdes et al 2007 more attention was paid on the occurence origin geochemcal mechanisms and factors that regulate the mobilization and fate of as in aquifer systems e g lima et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 sracek et al 2004 tapia et al 2019 2020 which help understand the as behavior in different settings across continents few relevant research works were conducted on sb behavior in karst aquifers primary antimony minerals are typically sulfides because of a higher affinity of antimony for sulfur than oxygen due to geologic disturbance from mining activities antimony minerals mainly stibnite sb2s3 are exposed to an oxidizing environment and react with oxygen and water to produce acid mine drainage amd and release sb as and other toxic metals to the surrounding groundwater biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2017 li et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 on one hand the amd exhausts the bicarbonate buffering capacity of carbonate aquifers and results in a series of geochemical processes such as dissolution of carbonates and silicates and hydrolysis of metal ions which complicated groundwater geochemical evolution ren et al 2021 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 on the other hand groundwater chemical components such as ph eh concentrations of dissolved oxygen elemental sulfur metal ions fe mn ca mg etc and other organic ligands can have an impact on the dissolution of natural sb2s3 and transport and fate of sb and as in groundwater arsic et al 2018 besold et al 2019 biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2015 kong and he 2016 in the special case of stibnite even under very drastic acid drainage conditions sb is not as rapidly mobilized as under relatively mild basic conditions biver and shotyk 2012 this means that naturally buffered karst groundwater is more conducive to antimony release from its host minerals therefore it is of great significance to understand the effects of mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry and sb as pollution the xikuangshan xks antimony mine in china is the largest sb mine in the world with mining and smelting history more than 120 years mining mineral processing smelting and other mine activities have generated large amounts of waste materials such as waste rock smelting slag and tailing which occurred over an extensive area and have been subjected to water runoff and aeolian erosion for many years yang et al 2015 as a result sb concentration was strikingly observed as high as 42 mg l in mining impacted karst groundwater up to date there are still few field studies on antimony and arsenic pollution in karst groundwater at the xks mine wen et al 2018 20116 applied s and sr isotopes to track sources of sb and as contamination indicating sb and as mainly derived from stibnite and silicified limestone li et al 2020 aimed to reveal the source of sb and geochemical behaviors of the mine drainage water hao et al 2020 compared the chemical characteristics of groundwater between high and low antimony based on once sampling however here are several key problems still require clarification 1 what are the temporal variations of sb and as pollution in different karst aquifers 2 how to identify pollution types of sb and as in groundwater associated with the complex mining activities 3 how does the long term mine activities affect karst groundwater geochemistry to address such questions we analyzed sb and as and major ions δ34s and δ18o of dissolved sulfate and δd and δ18o of the karst groundwater sampled from three main carbonate aquifers at the xks mine area during the six periods from 2013 to 2017 we attempted to apply a cluster analysis method of all the sampling periods lumped together to classify and characterize spatial temporal antimony and arsenic pollution and further to identify the sources and pollution types of sb and as in groundwater associated with mine activities the connection between increased sb levels and mine activities was demonstrated by tracing sulfate sources via stable isotopes of sulfate the principal objective of this study to clarify the effects of antimony mine activities on the evolution of karst groundwater geochemistry and sb and as pollution 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the xks sb mine is one of the oldest and best known antimony mining districts worldwide remaining as much as approximately 40 million tons of antimony reserves after more than 120 years of exploration qi et al 2011 it is located in a mountainous area with a ne sw orientation 13 km north of lengshuijiang city hunan province central china covering an area of 26 km2 the climate is typically subtropical monsoon with an average annual temperature precipitation and evaporation of 16 7 c 1381 mm and 903 mm respectively wen et al 2016 the rainy season primarily occurs during march to august several streams belonging to upstream of zijiang water system originate from the xks mine the mining area is divided into two mines the south mine and the north mine with the qilijiang as the boundary this study is focused on the north mine as shown in fig 1 the xks sb mine in which the major ore controlling structures are ne trending faults is a half edge anticline with an axial at ne30 and ends that plunge to the south and north the core of the anticline is composed of the upper devonian xikuangshan and shetianqiao formations surrounded by the lower carboniferous datang and yanguan formations fan et al 2004 the distribution of the outcrops is shown in fig 1 the west and east of the anticline are cut by a large f75 fault and a 10 km long lamprophyre vein respectively the xks sb deposit is a specific middle low temperature mineralization depression zone with most wall rock alteration of silication and carbonatization yang et al 2006 it occurs as stratiform bodies and veins in the upper silicified limestone layers of the shetianqiao formation which constitutes 80 of the total sb deposit reserves fan et al 2004 stibnite sb2s3 is the primary ore mineral accompanied by pyrite fes2 arsenopyrite feass sphalerite zns and galena pbs yang et al 2006 the two main groundwater systems in the xks sb mine are the lower shetianqiao karst aquifer d3s2 aquifer and the upper magunao karst aquifer d3x4 aquifer their lithology histogram in fig 1 the d3s2 aquifer consists of micrite limestone silicified limestone and shale with a thickness of 220 m and hosts the sb ore bodies the d3x4 aquifer as the primary source of the local drinking water is mainly composed of limestone and sandy limestone with a thickness of 258 m furthermore another c1y3 aquifer distributes near the lamprophyre vein and f75 fault the karst aquifers are recharged by precipitation and discharged by springs and mine drainage controlled by the topography geological structure and mining activities the regional groundwater mainly flows from southeast to northwest in the north mine through interlayer fracture zone limestone fissures passages and caves with different flowpaths in length wen et al 2018 many smelters were also in the xks mining area including antimony lead and zinc smelters mining related activities have generated large amounts of waste rock tailing and smelting waste these mine wastes cover over an extensive area of the xks mine for many years specifically arsenic alkali residue that was not handled properly and was piled up in the open air guo et al 2014a as a consequence the elevated levels of sb and as were observed in soils sediments surface ground water and biological systems e g guo et al 2018 li et al 2017 wang et al 2011 wen et al 2016 that posed large threats to drinking and irrigation water agricultural crop productivity food chain as well as human health 2 2 sampling and analytical methods a total of fifty seven groundwater samples were collected from running springs of three typical aquifers d3s2 d3x4 and c1y3 at the xks mine during six periods including dry and rainy seasons from 2013 to 2017 three mine drainage samples four mine tunnel karst fissure water samples three leachates from mine wastes and one smelting wastewater as well as three rainwater samples were collected within the mining area the locations of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 all water samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm acid washed membrane filters and stored in pre cleaned hdpe bottles the filtered samples for measurement of major cations sb and as were acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure hno3 for sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate analyses so4 2 in water samples was precipitated as baso4 by adding saturated bacl2 solution after acidified to ph 2 3 using 3 m hcl the baso4 precipitates were further treated with a dtpa dissolution and re precipitation method bao 2006 for oxygen isotopic measurement on site measurements of temperature ph and electric conductivity ec were determined using a hach portable water quality analyzer hq40d hco3 was measured with alkalinity titration method within 24 h after sampling the concentrations of major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions cl so4 2 no3 and f were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes and ion chromatography ic respectively ion charge imbalances are within 10 concentrations of sb and as were determined by atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry afs 820 with a precision better than 0 001 mg l the δ18o and δd values of water samples were determined by an isotopic water liquid and vapor analyzer lgr 920 0032 with a precision of 0 1 for δ18o and of 0 5 for δd δ34sso4 was analyzed by a delta v advantage equipped with a flash ea 2000 after the complete conversion of baso4 to so2 via a high temperature combustion with o2 and v2o5 at 1030 c corrections were assumed to be linear over the entire range of isotopic compositions and analytical reproducibility was better than 0 3 for standards and analytical duplicates δ18oso4 was determined via co generated on a thermal conversion elemental analyzer tcea at 1450 c coupled with a thermo fisher mat253 the δ18oso4 for each sample is the average of two runs on tcea and has an error less than 0 5 the results of δd and δ18o are reported in relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and δ34s was relative to vienna canyon diablo troilite standard v cdt the geochemical and isotopic analytical results are shown in table a and b 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis a recently developed cluster analysis method pacheco castro et al 2018 was applied to lumped data of all the sampling periods at the xks mine given a set of clusters classified using ward method with euclidean distance if chemical data at the same sampling location do not vary significantly in time the data belong to the same cluster this observation allows to identify the sample sites where groundwater geochemistry changes in time and to analyze the temporal and spatial processes affecting groundwater geochemistry thirteen chemical variables sb as ph tds k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f of the lumped groundwater samples were selected for cluster analysis any two variables of which have a correlation coefficient 90 and coefficient of variation more than 5 the cluster analysis was applied to the log transformed and standardized data güler et al 2002 once the cluster analysis is complete the dendrogram is used to select the number of clusters for further analysis the principal component analysis was conducted independently from the cluster analysis to verify whether the determined cluster number is reasonable and to identify the main variables that explain most of the variation of groundwater geochemistry pacheco castro et al 2018 yang et al 2020 all parameters were plotted using box plots grouped by cluster the box plots provide information about the main characteristics of each cluster and allows a direct comparison of differences among clusters 3 results 3 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of groundwater groundwater samples from the d3x4 d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers in 2013 2017 have δd and δ18o ranging from 51 7 to 36 6 and from 8 3 to 6 2 respectively the δd and δ18o averages are 39 3 0 4 and 6 4 0 1 for mine drainage and 39 6 1 5 and 6 3 0 2 for mine tunnel karst fissure water respectively all the groundwater samples as well as rainwater samples are plotted near the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 2 indicating groundwater originated from local meteoric water the lmwl was cited from that of the adjacent changsha city in hunan province wu et al 2012 the groundwater has significant difference in isotopic compositions among the three aquifers p 0 01 particularly the groundwater samples of the d3s2 aquifer have a positive linear correlation r2 0 897 fig 2 with a lower slop of 6 67 indicating evaporation effect of groundwater the isotope compositions show a significant decreasing with time which may indicate upward recharge of deep groundwater caused by large mine drainage from the d3s2 aquifer 3 2 spatial and temporal variations of sb and as in groundwater concentrations of sb and as in groundwater of the d3x4 d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers during the periods of 2013 2017 have a wide range from 5 μg l to 50 mg l and from 0 5 μg l to 3 mg l respectively the spatial and temporal variation of sb and as is shown in fig 3 groundwater samples from the d3x4 d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers were named beginning with x s and y respectively the sb concentration showed an order of magnitude difference among aquifers as shown in fig 3a the groundwater samples of the d3s2 and c1y3 aquifers have sb more than 1 mg l of which 32 5 47 4 mg l for s 18 10 20 mg l for s 17 5 10 mg l for y 19 and 1 5 mg l for s 51 s 52 and s 53 whereas the groundwater samples of the d3x4 aquifer basically have lower sb than 1 mg l of which x 03 x 05 and x 10 have sb ranging from 0 1 mg l to 0 5 mg l except for a large increase in 2017 in particular x 02 has the lowest sb with an average of 0 03 mg l and significant seasonal variation characterized as higher in winter but lower in summer in terms of temporal variation groundwater samples named as x 03 x 05 x 10 and s 53 showed an increasing sb from 2015 to 2017 especially in 2017 compared with sb the as concentration did not vary with aquifers as shown in fig 3b the s 17 and x 03 have stable high as more than 0 5 mg l while the s 18 and y 19 have high as decreasing from 0 4 mg l in 2013 to 0 04 mg l in 2017 the x 05 x 10 s 51 and s 52 fluctuated between 0 005 and 0 02 mg l in 2014 2017 while the x 02 and s 53 had the lowest as ranging from 0 5 to 5 μg l at the same periods however seasonal effect is observed in fig 3b for as concentration that is higher in winter than in summer it is indicated the as mainly came from leachate of rain affected surface mine wastes during the periods of 2013 2014 the as concentrations of s 17 and s 18 increased significantly whereas the others decreased of which the as concentrations of x 02 x 05 and x 10 dropped from 0 5 to 0 005 mg l the decreasing as concentration in 2014 may be attributed to removal several arsenic alkali residues at the xks mine since 2014 3 3 classified four clusters the dendrogram of cluster analysis for the selected variables is shown in fig a for this study a dissimilarity value of about 18 was selected which splits the dendrogram into four clusters the cluster 1 c1 included 39 groundwater samples mainly from the y 19 s 17 s 51 x 03 x 10 s 52 and x 05 the cluster 2 c2 cluster 3 c3 and cluster 4 c4 included 6 groundwater samples of s 18 4 groundwater samples of x 02 and 5 samples of s 53 respectively the clusters result showed samples from the same sampling site of all the sampling periods nearly belong to the same cluster with the exceptions of 4 samples of x 02 x 05 and s 52 sampled in july 2014 and x 02 in december 2017 the resulted four clusters were plotted into biplots using principal components as shown in fig b while fig b 1 for principal component 1 pc1 and 2 pc2 shows that the data corresponding to c1 and c2 are apparently overlapping the two clusters have substantial difference in fig b 2 for principal component 1 and 3 pc3 therefore the four clusters are clearly distinguished from each other indicating that the cluster classification is reasonable the main variables that explain most of the variation of groundwater geochemistry were also identified by the principal component analysis the pc1 explains 43 of the total variance and is characterized by the high loadings of tds 0 92 and major ions 0 6 0 8 such as k cl no3 na ca2 so4 2 mg2 and f the pc2 explains 17 of the total variances and is characterized by the high loadings of hco3 0 74 ph 0 70 ca2 0 57 and so4 2 0 56 therefore pc1 can be related to comprehensive rocks weathering and pc2 can be related to weathering of limestone with sulfuric acid components 3 and 4 is dominated by sb 0 66 and as 0 63 respectively which explain 11 6 and 8 7 of the total variation therefore pc3 and pc4 together highlight the sb and as pollution in groundwater associated with mine activities 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of sb as co pollution in groundwater of classified clusters sb and as are typical pollutants in groundwater at the xks mine which far exceed china s and the who guideline s drinking water standard wen et al 2018 2016 the distinctly distinguished characteristics of sb and as co pollution in groundwater of the classified four clusters are displayed in fig 4 the c3 is characterized by low levels of sb 50 μg l and low as 10 μg l with an exception of 0 5 mg l as in july 2013 which are close to sb and as background at the xks mine where hardly affected by mine activities the high as concentration of x 02 sampled in july 2013 may be contributed by leaching of the arsenic alkali residue once piled nearby that had been removed since 2014 in contrast the c2 is characterized by anomalously high sb of 32 5 47 4 mg l and varying as as high as 1 36 mg l such high concentrations of sb and as in groundwater are the result of continuous accumulation of leaching of smelting solid waste and smelting waste water which is supported by concentrations of sb and as sampled from slags leachate and smelting waste water as shown in fig 4 the as concentrations varied from 0 025 to 1 36 mg l between 2013 and 2017 and peaked in 2014 which depends on leaching behavior of arsenic alkali residue influenced by a variety of factors guo et al 2014a compared to the c3 groundwater of the c4 had low as 10 μg l but high sb ranging from 0 8 to 3 0 mg l this may be related to oxidative dissolution of stibnite within the ore bearing aquifer d3s2 the primary mineral of xks ore deposit is stibnite sb2s3 with little associated minerals such as arsenopyrite feass hu et al 2017 the as content is 0 8 6 1 mg kg of non silicified limestone and 4 5 26 3 mg kg of silicified limestone ma et al 2002 during the process of mining sb2s3 can dissolve under oxidized conditions and lead to sb releasing into groundwater as sb oh 6 that is stable and can be transported over a long distance biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2011 complexly the c1 covered a wide range of sb and as concentrations indicating the result from combined contamination there is a distinct tendency of the cluster 1 to be divided into three groups as shown in fig 4 which are controlled by different pollution sources associated with mine activities the group 1 including samples y 19 and s 17 distributed between the c2 and the c4 but near the c2 with anomalous high sb and as concentrations indicating the dominated source is leachate of mine wastes the group 2 including samples such as x 02 x 10 s 51 and s 52 distributed between c3 and c4 with low as and high sb indicating the sb is dominated by oxidative dissolution of sb2s3 the group 3 with medium sb 0 1 1 mg l and high as 0 3 2 mg l may be related to leaching of arsenic alkali residue combined with oxidative dissolution of sb2s3 4 2 geochemical indicators of sb as pollution types associated with mine activities in order to determine sb and as pollution types related to mine activities at the xks mine geochemical parameters of groundwater that may indicate pollution sources and processes are further discussed by the box plots and pearson correlation analysis on the basis of the above discussion of sb and as co pollution characteristics of the four clusters the box plots of geochemical parameters such as sb as ph tds ca2 mg2 na hco3 and so4 2 for the four clusters are shown in fig 5 the result of the pearson correlation analysis between any two of geochemical parameters for each cluster are listed in table c for the c3 groundwater is of hco3 ca type with a ph ranging from 7 5 to 8 6 total dissolved solids tds varying from 129 to 188 mg l and so4 2 as low as 25 5 3 8 mg l the tds has significant correlation with mg2 1 000 p 0 01 si 0 999 p 0 05 and hco3 0 987 p 0 05 and the hco3 has significant correlation with mg2 0 989 p 0 05 and ca2 0 955 p 0 05 these are typical hydrogeochemical characteristics for groundwater dominated by carbonate weathering the as with an average of 2 5 μg l showed positive correlation with si and cl at a significant level of p 0 01 whereas the sb with an average of 0 02 mg l has no significant correlation with any other geochemical parameters therefore the c3 can represent the background groundwater far away from mining affected area with the low sb and as released from bedrock weathering the anomalous high sb of the c2 is as high as 47 4 mg l along with high as of 0 38 10 54 mg l the ph values range from 7 0 to 8 0 compared to the c3 the c2 has lower concentrations of mg2 and hco3 but higher so4 2 with an average of 63 8 10 9 mg l and the tds is significantly correlated with so4 2 0 844 p 0 05 these geochemical differences indicated that leaching of mine solid waste contributed to the anomalous high sb and as in groundwater actually a large amount of solid waste has been produced by smelting processes at the xks mine li and liang 2010 including water quenched slag arsenic alkali residue desulfurized slag and blast furnace dust the study on leaching behaviors of these four types of solid waste guo et al 2014a shows they are enriched in sb and as and can be leached out of sb and as being three orders of magnitude higher than the regulatory level and more specifically with high as level in arsenic alkali residue they are also supported by chemical characterization of leachate samples from waste dump and smelting waste water table b the most striking feature of the c4 is that groundwater is weakly acid with ph values of 6 0 7 4 the ph is consistent with the result of sb2s3 oxidation to h2so4 buffered and neutralized by carbonate minerals the oxidation of sb2s3 also contributed more so4 2 in groundwater of the cluster 4 moreover the tds is significantly correlated with so4 2 0 975 p 0 01 and sb is significantly correlated with si 0 962 p 0 01 the xrd results of the xks ores showed they contained sb2s3 sio2 and a little caco3 which can explain the relationship between sb and si in groundwater of the c4 in contrast to the c3 the c4 has higher mg2 and na but lower ca2 the calculated saturated index si of gypsum is greater than zero si 0 indicating gypsum of groundwater is in saturated state that means ca2 concentration in groundwater may decrease besides the lower concentrations of ca2 may be related to cation exchange that can result in increasing na and decreasing ca2 in groundwater in addition to a large variation of sb and as concentrations the c1 with a ph ranging from 7 0 to 8 5 has a wide range of tds and other major ions with significantly higher averaged values than other three clusters the tds ranged from 194 to 514 mg l and significantly correlated with all the major ions at a significant level of p 0 01 the sb significantly correlated with k si na no3 cl and so4 2 whereas the as significantly correlated with na f si and k respectively at a significant level of p 0 01 moreover a significant positive correlation is between sb and as 0 570 p 0 01 the correlation between these geochemical parameters indicates complex sb and as sources and pollution processes in groundwater of the c1 therefore the above evidences elucidate that the elevated concentrations of sb and as in groundwater of the c1 are influenced by bedrock weathering slag heap infiltration mine drainage smelting wastewater and domestic sewage 4 3 effects of mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry 4 3 1 hydrogeochemistry changed from hco3 ca to so4 ca type as indicated by the piper diagram fig 6 for the four clusters the dominant ions of groundwater samples changed from hco3 to so4 for anions and from ca to na for cations respectively weathering and dissolution of widely distributed carbonates is the most important hydrogeochemical process to control groundwater chemistry in the karst area the groundwater is dominated by hco3 ca such as groundwater of the c3 with background level of sb and as which is a typical karstic composition as indicated by other studies of the geochemistry of karst waters e g jiang et al 2009 long et al 2012 valdes et al 2007 however the chemical composition of groundwater with high sb and as becomes complex because of the impact of sb mine activities the elevated so4 2 accounts for 25 92 of the total anions on a molar basis with an average of 48 the hydrogeochemical type of the c2 is dominated by hco3 so4 ca and that of the c4 is dominated by so4 ca while that of the c1 is diverse including hco3 so4 ca so4 hco3 ca hco3 so4 ca na and so4 hco3 ca na the difference in hydrochemical types among clusters indicate difference in the degree of the influence of pollution types on hydrogeochemistry a significant positive linear correlation is observed between sb so4 2 molar ratio and sb molar concentration as shown in fig 7 a suggesting sb has a certain homology with sulfate the two distinct end member are groundwater of background c3 and of c2 polluted by leachate of mine wastes along with groundwater of c2 controlled by stibnite oxidation plotted in the middle indicating the influences of mine activities on both sb and so4 2 in groundwater therefore using isotopic method tracing sulfate sources may help understand sb sources associated with mine activities the sources of so4 2 in groundwater are potentially contributed by atmospheric precipitation dissolution of sulfate evaporite minerals such as gypsum oxidation of reduced sulfide minerals and mineralization of organic s compounds within soil as well as human activities li et al 2011 the anthropogenic so4 2 sources at the xks mine are mainly associated with mine activities including mine drainage leachate of waste heaps and smelting slags and smelting wastewater since so4 2 behaves conservatively in groundwater under relative oxidation condition sulfur and oxygen isotopic signatures of sulfate from different sources may be revealed in the total so4 2 edraki et al 2005 gammons et al 2013 samborska et al 2013 sun et al 2017 taylor and wheeler 1994 fig 7b shows the isotopic compositions of sulfate sources at the xks mine together with plots of groundwater samples the majority of stibnite at the xks mine ranges between 5 to 10 with a mean of 7 4 ma et al 2003 r yang et al 2006 the δ34sso4 values of gypsum in the study area were 2 59 11 09 with an average value of 5 33 liu et al 1985 jin et al 2001 the average δ34sso4 value of pyrite in the lamprophyre dike is 5 4 d yang et al 2006 the mine drainage water as well as mine tunnel fissure water has an average of 4 5 1 3 for δ34sso4 and of 3 4 2 0 for δ18oso4 the leachate of mine heaps and slags and smelting waster has δ34sso4 values ranging between 1 4 and 8 5 and δ18oso4 values ranging between 0 5 and 5 2 according to the isotopic compositions of the plotted groundwater samples sources relating to mine activities such as stibnite oxidation and leaching of mine wastes are the main sources contributing to groundwater so4 2 rather than atmospheric precipitation gypsum dissolution and pyrite oxidation the groundwater samples are plotted within the triangle area that takes mine heap leachate smelting waste and the c3 as the vertex respectively in fig 7c and fig 7d the consistence of the relationship between δ34sso4 and so4 2 and between δ34sso4 and sb further demonstrates the influence of mine activities on co increasing concentrations of sb and so4 2 in groundwater samples in contrast with background groundwater of the c3 it is worthwhile pointing out that δ34sso4 values of both groundwater of the c4 and mine drainage water are more negative than the δ34s value of stibnite δ34ssb2s3 this might be explained by the formation of sulfur intermediates during sb2s3 oxidation which can result in an enrichment of 32s in sulfate relative to sulfide large isotope fractionations were observed in the oxidation experiments of other sulfide minerals such as pyrite balci et al 2007 sphalerite heidel et al 2011 galena heidel and tichomirowa 2011 chalcopyrite thurston et al 2010 and sulfide mixtures heidel et al 2013 so4 2 was illustrated not the primary end product of sb2s3 oxidation but instead intermediate valence s n species 2 n 6 such as elemental sulfur thiosulfates and sulfite were the primary oxidation products of s ii e g biver and shotyk 2012 hu et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 ullrich et al 2013 4 3 2 significant participation of sulfuric acid in carbonate weathering in karst groundwater ca2 mg2 and hco3 are the main products of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid that exists in natural environment following the reaction of eq 1 1 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 h 2 c o 3 x c a 2 1 x m g 2 2 h c o 3 0 x 1 as shown by eq 1 the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent charge ratio should be close to 1 when only carbonic acid is involved in the reaction however the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent charge ratios of groundwater samples mostly range between 1 and 2 fig c 1 showing hco3 produced by carbonic acid was not enough to balance ca2 mg2 other sources of acid thus should have contribution to carbonate weathering sulfuric acid produced by natural and anthropogenic activities participates in carbonate weathering following the reaction of eq 2 by which the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio should be 2 2 2 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 h 2 s o 4 2 x c a 2 2 1 x m g 2 2 h c o 3 s o 4 2 0 x 1 as indicated by eq 1 and eq 2 when carbonate weathering is governed by carbonic and sulfuric acid together the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 equivalent ratio should be 1 fig c 2 shows most groundwater samples were plotted above the 1 1 line which implies that sulfuric acid plays a significant role in carbonate weathering sb mining results in the exposure of sulfide minerals mainly stibnite sb2s3 to oxygen and water where sb2s3 oxidation reaction occurs to produce so4 2 and h that is subsequently neutralized by carbonates as shown in eq 3 and eq 4 3 s b 2 s 3 8 h 2 o 7 o 2 2 s b oh 6 3 s o 4 2 8 h 4 s b 2 s 3 8 c a c o 3 7 o 2 10 h 2 o 2 s b oh 6 8 c a 2 3 s o 4 2 8 h c o 3 thus the co variation of the equivalent ratios of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 as well as netural to weak alkaline ph and high so4 2 concentration is evidence that sulfur acid plays a relatively important role in carbonate weathering at the xks mine area the weathering of carbonate by sulfuric acid is regarded as a source for the atmospheric co2 with no rapid balancing atmospheric co2 sink lerman et al 2007 martin 2017 which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate change xie et al 2021 as sulfuric acid are playing more and more significant role in carbonate weathering with the intensification of mine activities ali and atekwana 2011 li et al 2018 ren et al 2021 sun et al 2013 more attention should be paid to the role of mine activities on carbonate weathering and carbon cycle 4 3 3 enhancement of silicate weathering as suggested by the bi variate mixing diagrams of na normalized ca vs hco3 and na normalized ca vs mg gaillardet et al 1999 groundwater a is controlled by carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering at the xks mine are fig d silicified limestone is the main rock forming mineral containing sb ores and also the main component of the solid waste from mining therefore silicate weathering by carbonic acid and sulfuric acid is assumed to contribute to large groundwater chemistry expressed as eqs 5 8 0 x 1 5 c a x m g 1 x a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 h 2 c o 3 2

related to carbonate and silicate weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids triangular diagram for the milligram equivalent percentages of hco3 so4 2 and sio2 for groundwater of clusters are shown in fig 8 a as well as end member compositions of exclusive reactions compared to the c3 the milligram equivalent percentage of sio2 in groundwater of the other clusters increased to 12 50 the c2 has the highest percentage of sio2 ranging between 37 and 50 which probably related to strong silicate weathering the saturation indices of calcite and sio2 a were calculated and presented in fig 8b which can indicate whether rock minerals have the ability to dissolve in groundwater as shown in fig 8b the si of calcite in most groundwater was above zero indicating that calcite was over saturated and would not dissolve in most parts of the karst groundwater however the si of sio2 a in groundwater with high level sb was greater than that of c3 with low level of sb moreover the si of sio2 a in groundwater of c4 was above zero while that of c1 and c2 was below zero the order of si of sio2 a for the clusters is c4 c2 c1 c3 the results are evidence that high si content in groundwater is enhanced by the dissolution of sb rich silicified limestone 4 3 4 control of cation exchange on groundwater geochemistry the evidence of cation exchange can be identified by plotting the bivariate plots of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 versus na k cl of water samples li et al 2019 wang et al 2015 2017 in most cases na and cl originate from halite dissolution and na k cl indicates an increase or decrease in na induced by processes excluding halite dissolution ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 represents the increase or decrease in ca2 and mg2 by processes other than the dissolution or precipitation of calcite dolomite and gypsum ideally when cation exchange is a significant process controlling groundwater chemistry the relationship between these two parameters should be linear with a slope of 1 fisher and mullican 1997 fig 9 a illustrated that the relationship between na k cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 of groundwater samples can be expressed as y 0 97x 0 117 with a correlation coefficient of 0 822 this suggests that cation exchange also plays an important role in the evolution of groundwater chemical composition furthermore chloro alkaline indices cai were employed to understand the influence of ion exchange in the chemical composition of groundwater schoeller 1965 typically two main factors cai 1 and cai 2 were expressed as cai 1 cl na k cl and cai 2 cl na k hco3 so4 2 co3 2 no3 respectively where all ions were expressed in meq l negative values for the two indices indicate ion exchange between ca2 or mg2 in groundwater with na and k in the aquifer material resulting in an increase in na and k concentration in groundwater and vice versa the larger the absolute cai values are the stronger the cation exchange is in this study about 90 of the groundwater samples are plotted in the lower left region of fig 9b suggesting that cation exchange expressed as eq 9 is an important process high sb groundwater samples of c1 c2 and c4 have higher absolute values of cai 1 and cai 2 than that of low sb groundwater of c3 indicating cation exchange interaction is stronger under the influence of mine activities 9 c a 2 2 n a x 2 n a c a x 2 o r m g 2 2 n a x 2 n a m g x 2 5 conclusions long term mine activities at the xks antimony mine resulted in serious sb and as pollution in groundwater which has a significant influence on the geochemistry of karst groundwater based on the monitoring data of six periods from 2013 to 2017 the temporal and seasonal variation of sb and as in groundwater of the three main karst aquifers was firstly characterized sb concentrations varied with aquifers lower in d3x4 aquifer than in aquifers of d3s2 and c1y3 but did not differ seasonally whereas differently as concentrations had a significant seasonal effect that is higher in winter and lower in summer but were not controlled by aquifers the cluster analysis applied to lumped data of all the sampling periods as well as geochemical indicators can identify pollution types of sb and as in groundwater related to complex mine activities the classified four clusters represent background karst groundwater with low levels of sb and as and three pollution patterns dominated by oxidative dissolution of stibnite leaching of mine waste and mixed pollution respectively these pollution types controlled spatial and temporal variation of sb and as and geochemical evolution of karst groundwater as a result the hydrogeochemical compositions of the karst groundwater changed from hco3 ca type to so4 ca type the dominance of so4 2 in groundwater was related to the elevated sb was confirmed by a positive correlation between molar ratio of sb so4 2 and sb and the common mine pollution sources traced by sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate moreover sulfuric acid resulted from sulfide oxidation played an important role in carbonate and silicate weathering and dissolution with the intensification of mine activities cation exchange was also enhanced to dominate groundwater geochemistry these findings suggest that the effects of mine activities on karst groundwater geochemistry should arouse more attention for its significance on groundwater quality declaration of competing interest the authors

3987,in a recent paper published in this journal bretreger et al 2020 estimate irrigation water use from satellite remotely sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration in five irrigated districts of the murray darling basin southeast australia they used three models that scale crop reference evapotranspiration with vegetation indices acquired by recent landsat satellites i irrisat ii kamble and iii cmrset in their paper irrigation water use computed with cmrset generally overestimated observed irrigation water use sometimes fivefold based on these results bretreger et al 2020 discouraged the use of cmrset for irrigation monitoring in this comment we reproduce the experiments in bretreger et al 2020 and demonstrate that their overestimation was because they used an incorrect landsat band in their implementation of cmrset cmrset was originally calibrated using both modis derived enhanced vegetation index evi and global vegetation moisture index gvmi to calculate gvmi a shortwave infrared swir band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm was used which for modis is named swir2 and for landsat is named swir1 i e different sensors have different bands and a different number of bands and swir1 in modis has a wavelength of 1 2 μm in their landsat cmrset implementation bretreger et al 2020 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm see their table 3 we show that cmrset implemented with the landsat swir1 band i e with a wavelength of 1 6 μm so being the correct landsat band to calculate gvmi yields similar results both for temporal patterns and magnitude when compared to the other two remote sensing actual evapotranspiration models in bretreger et al 2020 for the irrigation districts these similar results meant that the mean water year i e july to next june from 2010 to 2017 actual evapotranspiration mean absolute relative difference was 15 3 with a 5 4 26 5 range and the water year irrigation water use mean absolute relative difference was 4 1 with a 9 8 18 9 range conversely we show that a landsat cmrset implementation using the incorrect landsat band for the calculation of gvmi i e with a wavelength of 2 1 μm led to a large overestimation agreeing with the cmrset results reported by bretreger et al 2020 both for water year actual evapotranspiration mean absolute relative difference of 64 6 with a 51 1 83 6 range and irrigation water use mean absolute relative difference of 44 1 with a 31 4 65 1 range the use of the incorrect landsat band means that the bretreger et al 2020 recommendation specific to their landsat cmrset implementation is invalid a demonstration of bretreger et al s 2020 incorrect landsat cmrset implementation and the correct one can be accessed at https jorgepena users earthengine app view comment on bretreger 2020 joh paper despite bretreger et al s 2020 shortcomings in their implementation of the landsat cmrset actual evapotranspiration model timely monitoring of irrigation water use via satellite remote sensing is required at landsat resolutions i e 30 m or higher due to the heterogeneous nature of irrigation in most agricultural landscapes and we applaud them for pursuing this line of research keywords actual evapotranspiration remote sensing irrigation water use crop coefficient 1 introduction remote sensing rs used alongside hydrological modelling has the potential to close or minimise data gaps e g diversions irrigation efficiencies groundwater use and inform irrigation management especially in large irrigated systems that are difficult to monitor as evidenced by numerous studies across the globe ahmad et al 2005 bawa et al 2021 karimi et al 2019 koch et al 2020 peña arancibia et al 2016 simons et al 2020 van niel and mcvicar 2004a rs actual evapotranspiration eta estimates provide timely and accurate information related to irrigation water use bastiaanssen et al 2012 gowda et al 2008 therefore the assessment of rs based models that estimate eta for monitoring irrigation in a local context is a worthy research pursuit in selected irrigated areas in the murray darling basin mdb southeast australia bretreger et al 2020 used three satellite driven rs models that scale crop reference evapotranspiration et0 via a crop coefficient kc to estimate eta two of the models irrisat hornbuckle et al 2016 and kamble kamble et al 2013 follow a vegetation index vi approach by linearly scaling et0 with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kriegler et al 1969 a vi that primarily provides information about vegetation vigour irrisat was originally calibrated with landsat derived ndvi whereas kamble was originally calibrated with modis derived ndvi the third model cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration guerschman et al 2009 uses a hybrid approach that non linearly scales potential evapotranspiration etp via two vis that provide information about vegetation vigour and vegetation moisture content respectively the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 and the global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002 cmrset was calibrated with modis derived vis to predict eta for a broad range of land covers including open water guerschman et al 2009 it provides accurate eta estimates that have been successfully used in irrigation area assessment and water accounting balance inter alia in africa australia

in australia cmrset provided the best results among five satellite driven rs eta products king et al 2011 using digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli surface reflectance data hereafter referred to as l578 bretreger et al 2020 obtained eta spatial estimates for four large 500 km2 and one small 100 km2 irrigation districts within the mdb the estimates in mm depth were then aggregated to monthly time step using irrigable areas from static land use maps at the irrigation district scale and subsequently used as inputs in a one dimensional water balance to estimate irrigation water use as irrest p eta where p in mm per month is precipitation over irrigable areas the estimated irrest was compared to observed irrigation irrobs which was computed from volumetric canal offtake data and converted to mm depth using the same irrigation district irrigable area values the results of the comparison informed the potential suitability for monitoring irrigation in the mdb of the three models evaluated only irrest obtained with cmrset model 2b see guerschman et al 2009 largely overestimated irrobs sometimes fivefold see fig 5 in bretreger et al 2020 consequently bretreger et al 2020 concluded that both irrisat and kamble were suitable for monitoring irrigation in the mdb whilst they did not recommend cmrset here we show that bretreger et al 2020 did not implement cmrset correctly for landsat data because of i spectral and radiometric differences between modis and landsat and more importantly ii their incorrect use of spectral wavelength characteristics to calculate landsat gvmi when implementing cmrset bretreger et al 2020 used the generic band names rather than considering the band spectral wavelength characteristics when translating cmrset from modis to landsat see table 1 gvmi uses a shortwave infrared swir band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm ceccato et al 2002 which corresponds in modis to swir2 and in landsat to swir1 in their landsat cmrset implementation bretreger et al 2020 see their table 3 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm the vi differences between different sensors may not have large undue influence when using the irrisat and kamble algorithms because of the simple linear relation between ndvi and et0 noting that ndvi does not utilise a swir band only red and nir bands are used in contrast cmrset uses a more complex sigmoidal relationship which has the advantage that it provides accurate open water eta estimates guerschman et al 2009 and accurate eta estimates across a range of land covers and climates king et al 2011 and therefore differences in vis arising from the use of different swir bands can have a large impact on eta estimates due to the non linear nature of the cmrset formulation see section 4 1 herein we reproduce the experiments in bretreger et al 2020 that pertain to satellite remote sensing irrigation water use via l578 and modis reflectance data which here are both sourced from google earth engine gee gorelick et al 2017 we used gee data because modis data are not yet available in dea and compared dea l578 against gee landsat l578 ndvi evi and gvmi images to ensure that the gee l578 vi images are statistically like the dea l578 vi images see figs s1 s4 in the supplementary information and thus are suitable to reproduce the irrest experiments in bretreger et al 2020 here our aim is to identify the reason s for the overestimation of irrest by cmrset in bretreger et al 2020 as previous cmrset eta estimates in australia and elsewhere have not yielded such poor results as those reported in bretreger et al 2020 for this purpose three experiments are conducted 1 a comparison of cmrset s gvmi residual moisture index rmi and kc with the objective to assess the differences of the bretreger et al 2020 gvmi computation using the landsat swir2 band 2 1 μm against the original cmrset gvmi

objective to assess the differences in gvmi rmi and kc when l578 data are used without cross sensor band transformation coefficients chastain et al 2019 or intercalibration of vegetation indices steven et al 2003 3 a comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 in the computation of gvmi aggregated over irrigable areas at the irrigation district scale the comparisons are performed per pixel resampled 25 m pixel for landsat and 500 m for modis for gvmi and cmrset s residual moisture index rmi and kc and aggregated to the irrigation district scale 500

july 2010 to june 2017 except for iio3 which started in july 2013 and iio4 which started in july 2009 the difference in study periods is because bretreger et al s 2020 evaluation period was

satellite driven actual evapotranspiration models herein we provide the main equations of the three rs satellite driven eta models for the rationale and details of their respective calibrations

correlation between modis evi and gvmi for all the pixels in australia for the months of january may and september in 2001 rmi was calculated per pixel as the vertical distance between its corresponding gvmi and a baseline as 6 rmi max 0 gvmi k rmi evi c rmi where krmi and crmi are calibrated parameters which describe the exact position of the baseline the values for krmi and crmi after

2020 obtained atmospherically corrected l578 surface reflectance images from dea then proceeded to mask clouds and cloud shadows from the images followed by the computation of ndvi evi and gvmi because of differences in the atmospheric correction and cloud and cloud shadow masking algorithms we compared ndvi evi and gvmi obtained using dea images against their gee image counterparts see figs s1 s4 in the supplementary information we performed the comparison for each landsat sensor landsat 5 tm for images in 2010 2011 landsat 7 etm for images in 2013 2014 and landsat 8 oli for images in 2015 2016 this was implemented for the representative geographic subsets see l578 insets in fig 1 for both the austral winter july to october and summer december to march cropping seasons as suggested by crop calendars abares 2012 4 3 experiment 1 comparing dea cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 and swir2 this comparison was performed to assess the differences of the bretreger et al 2020 gvmi rmi and kc computation using dea l578 swir2 bands wavelength 2 1 μm against the original cmrset gvmi rmi and kc computation as in guerschman et al 2009 using dea l578 swir1 bands wavelength 1 6 μm the experiment used all the individual images corresponding to the geographic subsets as described in section 4 2 for the respective years and for the austral winter july october and summer december march cropping months the similarity for all iios was visually assessed using a density scatterplot and statistically assessed using the following goodness of fit metrics gofs as in richter et al 2011 i the coefficient of determination r2 of a fitted linear regression between dea gvmi with swir1 and corresponding rmi and kc against dea gvmi with swir2 and corresponding rmi and kc which reflects spatial temporal correlation it is bound between 0 and 1 with r2 0 9 indicating excellent correlation 0 8 r2 0 9 indicating very good correlation and 0 5 r2 0 8 indicating good correlation ii slope m and intercept b of the fitted linear regression the slope indicates model under overestimation with 0 95 m 1 05 indicating excellent accuracy and 0 80 m 1 20 indicating good accuracy the intercept b indicates linear model biases with an excellent accuracy if b is close to 0 iii the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 which quantifies accuracy it is bound between and 1 with nse 0 9 indicating excellent accuracy and 0 5 nse 0 9 indicating good accuracy if nse 0 then the mean of observed values is at least as accurate as the response values fitted with the linear regression 4 4 experiment 2 comparing cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using resampled 500 m dea l578 against 500 m gee modis the objective of this experiment is to assess the differences in gvmi rmi and kc images between l578 and modis when l578 data is used without cross sensor band transformation coefficients or intercalibration of vegetation indices we compared mean resampled 500 m dea l578 images against their 500 m gee modis image counterparts the experiment used the individual images both for l578 and modis corresponding to the geographic subsets as described in section 4 2 for the respective years and for the austral winter july october and summer december march cropping months the same visual and statistical comparisons as experiment 1 section 4 3 were conducted for resampled 500 m dea l578 gvmi rmi and kc images against 500 m gee modis gvmi rmi and kc images both for the austral winter and summer cropping months 4 5 experiment 3 comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 monthly gee l578 cmrset irrisat and kamble eta and irrest are estimated for all four iios cmrset is implemented both using gvmi computed with the correct landsat swir1 band wavelength 1 6 μm according to guerschman et al 2009 and the incorrect swir2 band wavelength 2 1 μm as in bretreger et al 2020 the comparisons for irrest were performed visually using time series aggregated at the iio scale by averaging all irrigable pixels using the land use map described in section 3 3 the absolute mean percentage differences in eta and irrest for five water years from july 2011 to june 2016 between both variants of cmrset model 2b correctly using landsat swir1 with wavelength 1 6 μm and incorrectly using landsat swir2 with wavelength 2 1 μm and irrisat and kamble are computed as gofs 5 results 5 1 experiment 1 comparing dea cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 and swir2 a density scatterplot of dea l578 image gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 against dea l578 image gvmi rmi and kc using swir2 pooled for all iio subsets is shown in fig 2 the scatter and linear regression statistics show that using landsat swir2 in the computation of gvmi introduces a systematic overestimation and bias the overestimation and bias of gvmi swir2 2 1 μm is large see the density for gvmi values 0 1 for low gvmi swir1 1 6 μm values in both austral summer and winter fig 2a and d the use of swir2 2 1 μm in the computation of gvmi does not introduce errors that affect much the temporal patters in both austral summer and winter with good correlation r2 0 8 between both gvmi calculated with swir1 1 6 μm and swir2 2 1 μm because of the linear nature of rmi correlations are still good r2 0 5 although the accuracy in terms of nse is degraded with respect to gvmi s nse fig 2b and e due to the non linearity and constraints of kc r2 is dominated by the kc values at the upper limit kcmax 0 680 but the scatter shows a large spread of values and higher density for larger kc values using swir2 2 1 μm when kc values using swir1 1 6 μm are 0 1 fig 2c and f especially during austral summer from the kc results it can be inferred that cmrset eta and irrest that use swir2 2 1 μm to compute gvmi as in bretreger et al 2020 will be greater than cmrset eta and irrest that use swir1 1 6 μm according to guerschman et al 2009 particularly during the austral summer and for low 0 1 gvmi values because gvmi during the austral summer is generally low see fig 2c it is very likely that using swir2 2 1 μm will result in an overestimation of cmrset eta and irrest as reported by bretreger et al 2020 this issue is tested and quantified in full detail in experiment 3 which is reported in section 5 3 5 2 experiment 2 comparing cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using resampled 500 m dea l578 against 500 m gee modis a density scatterplot of mean resampled dea l578 500 m image gvmi rmi and kc against modis 500 m image gvmi rmi and kc pooled for all four iio subsets is shown in fig 3 fig 3a and d show that gvmi values from a mean resampled dea l578 500 m tend to overestimate their modis counterparts at gvmi values 0 1 and underestimate at gvmi values 0 1 this can be generalised for rmi and kc because of the coarser nature of the analysed pixels 500 m in this subsection and the fragmented nature of irrigated agriculture there is not much kc saturation during the austral summer months because the over underestimation in gvmi seems to follow a linear relationship mainly during the austral winter months the scale in the austral summer months precludes a visual assessment but slopes in both regressions are similar it would be possible to use cross sensor band transformation coefficients slope m and intercept b and reduce the overestimation and bias and consequently also reduce these differences in both rmi and kc 5 3 experiment 3 comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 fig 4 shows the time series comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s model 2b irrest using the correct swir1 1 6 μm and the incorrect swir2 2 1 μm in the computation of gvmi aggregated at the irrigation district scale alongside irrest obtained by the irrisat and kamble models as per bretreger et al 2020 it can be readily seen that the cmrset irrest using the incorrect l578 swir2 2 1 μm generally overestimates irrest when compared to the cmrset irrest using l578 swir1 1 6 μm in contrast the cmrset irrest using the correct swir1 1 6 μm is much better than its swir2 2 1 μm counterpart and is comparable to both the irrisat and kamble irrest estimates overall a landsat cmrset implementation using the incorrect swir2 2 1 μm leads to a water year eta mean absolute relative difference of 64 6 with a 51 1 83 6 range and irrest mean absolute relative difference of 44 1 with a 31 4 65 1 range overestimation which is similar to the results reported in bretreger et al 2020 in contrast a landsat cmrset implementation using the correct swir1 1 6 μm was closer to both irrisat and kamble eta mean absolute relative difference of 15 3 with a 5 4 26 5 range and irrest mean absolute relative difference of 14 1 with a 9 8 18 9 range it is noted that although study periods differ slightly the cmrset model using l578 swir1 1 6 μm irrest generally underestimates irrisat with the mean percentage difference i e the mean of each irrisatmonth cmrsetmonth irrisatmonth expressed as a percentage between the two models being 13 4 and mean percentage difference as calculated above for kamble being 15 0 in all iios this underestimation places the cmrset based irrest using the correct swir1 landsat band 1 6 μm closer to irrobs according to fig 5 in bretreger et al 2020 6 discussion 6 1 comparing dea and gee data the procedure of obtaining the landsat ndvi evi and gvmi in bretreger et al 2020 differs in both data source and pre processing used here the detailed comparison results see figs s1 to s4 in the supplementary information demonstrated that the gee data used here are statistically similar to the dea data used in bretreger et al 2020 and thus suitable to reproduce the estimation of irrest in the four iios it is noted that we used gee so we could access modis data which are not available from dea to allow the impact of landsat and modis spectral and radiometric differences the focus of experiment 2 on cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc to be assessed 6 2 experiment 1 comparing dea cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 and swir2 experiment 1 revealed that use of band names is not sufficient as band names are not generic they are sensor specific as shown in table 1 and band spectral characteristics should be matched as best as possible when translating across remote sensing instruments across modis to landsat bands in this case bretreger et al 2020 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm see their table 3 when they should have used the landsat swir1 band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm which is approximately equivalent to the wavelength of what is termed modis swir2 see table 1 this implementation error of using the landsat swir2 band 2 1 μm resulted in larger gvmi values being calculated in bretreger et al 2020 when compared to gvmi values calculated using the correct landsat 1 6 μm band performed herein this implementation error leads to an overestimation of rmi and kc particularly for low kc 0 1 during austral summer 6 3 experiment 2 comparing cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using resampled 500 m dea l578 against 500 m gee modis experiment 2 shows that due care should be exercised when using models calibrated with different satellite sensors especially when such models are non linear like cmrset modis and landsat spectral and radiometric differences can result in different vis values in semi arid agricultural environments spectral extent i e band wavelength differences in the nir band between modis 0 84 0 88 μm and landsat tm etm 0 77 0 90 μm result in different evi values particularly for peak evi values in agricultural fields and in sparsely vegetated areas see figs 6 and 7 in jarchow et al 2018 these differences are exacerbated in non linear models like cmrset mancino et al 2020 found that differences in the land surface water index lswi a vi mathematically similar to gvmi that also uses the normalised differences between the nir and a swir bands located around 1 6 μm because of dissimilar swir1 spectral extent in l7 etm and l8 oli 1 57 1 78 μm and 1 57 1 65 μm respectively result in statistically significantly p 0 05 different lswi values in mixed agricultural areas grasslands and pastures see fig 5 in mancino et al 2020 to illustrate implementations of cmrset model 2b in australia using the same dea l578 data as in bretreger et al 2020 and modis we refer to mcvicar et al 2017 for locations in southeast australia and van niel et al 2017 for locations in northern australia these implementations included a range of land covers including parts of the mdb with agricultural areas both studies compared the accuracy of landsat only eta estimates modis only eta estimates and a new set of eta estimates developed by blending eta from the high spatial resolution and low temporal frequency landsat data and eta from the high temporal frequency daily composited to 8 day and low spatial resolution modis data referred to here as landsat modis blend the accuracy of the three i e landsat modis and landsat modis blend estimates in both geographic domains were assessed against two independent datasets i observed eta at flux towers and ii estimated eta from long term unimpaired catchment water balance as eta p q with p being long term catchment precipitation and q being long term observed streamflow respectively this is similar to the procedure of estimating irrest in bretreger et al 2020 in southeast australia mcvicar et al 2017 the three i e landsat modis and landsat modis blend cmrset eta model 2b variants described above were validated against eta from an eddy covariance flux tower and evaluated with long term eta from 16 unimpaired catchments and 5 river reach long term water balances although the landsat only cmrset eta performed well against the one eddy covariance flux tower eta the accuracy degraded at the catchment reach water balance scale showing a systematic overestimation which could be indicative of i the spectral and radiometric differences in sensors that were reduced by bias correcting the landsat only eta using modis eta estimates the existence of such biases can be inferred from experiment 2 and ii the error introduced by the lower temporal density of landsat observations when compared to the modis or landsat modis blended results mcvicar et al 2017 similarly for northern australia van niel et al 2017 the three i e landsat modis and landsat modis blend cmrset model 2b variants were assessed against eta estimates from seven eddy covariance flux towers and long term eta estimates from 15 unimpaired catchments the landsat only cmrset eta revealed a large overestimation against eta estimates from eddy covariance flux towers the overestimation was largely removed in the comparison with landsat modis blend eta estimates indicating undue influence of the differences in band spectral characteristics between landsat and modis the accuracy was also degraded at the catchment water balance scale when using the landsat only eta estimates oversampled modis eta estimates were used when landsat imagery was not available compared to the landsat modis blend eta estimates landsat only eta showed a systematic overestimation that was largely removed in the landsat modis blend eta van niel et al 2017 the results in experiment 2 although performed in a different geographical setting similarly point to a potential overestimation if cmrset is implemented using landsat without consideration of the spectral and radiometric differences with modis 6 4 experiment 3 comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 experiment 3 shows the impact of incorrectly using landsat swir2 2 1 μm in the estimation of gvmi which results in a large overestimation of eta and irrest several studies across the globe e g dembele et al 2020 karimi et al 2019 paca et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 peña arancibia and ahmad 2020 simons et al 2016 sriwongsitanon et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 have used cmrset s eta and such large cmrset errors as reported by bretreger et al 2020 have not been previously reported we note that not all these studies have reported cmrset to provide accurate eta values as in some instances e g karimi et al 2019 paca et al 2019 and simons et al 2016 cmrset is one of multiple eta models used in ensemble blending more recently cmrset s eta was evaluated in thailand using independent unimpaired water balance data for 172 catchments and their results were comparable or better that other rs driven models sriwongsitanon et al 2020 cmrset s eta estimates were also used to improve the calibration of the awra l model in 11 catchments in australia kunnath poovakka et al 2016 which demonstrated that the accuracy of cmrset s eta estimates can be used to improve streamflow predictions 6 5 other considerations landsat 578 have a 16 day revisit time or 8 day revisit with two satellites or a higher revisit in east west footprint overlap areas but these are limited to small areas see fig 2 in van niel and mcvicar 2004b for an illustrative example in the mdb so although it is also possible to capture two or three vis values within a month cloud contamination is likely a more pervasive issue for landsat than for modis see fig 10 in ju and roy 2008 in addition since late may 2003 the scan line corrector failed in landsat 7 etm leaving a 20 data gap in images goward et al 2006 thus in any given month it is likely that modis will provide vis that are more temporally representative of vegetation conditions than landsat albeit at a lower spatial resolution as mentioned in bretreger et al 2020 and others cammalleri et al 2014 gowda et al 2008 semmens et al 2016 the higher spatial resolution of landsat has clear advantages for the understanding of paddock scale irrigation dynamics for extreme cases in crop development stages such as pre and post harvesting or in multiple cropping systems it is possible that landsat may miss a more representative vi value if only one image is captured in a month see fig 8 in both nguyen et al 2020 and yan and roy 2020 landsat modis blending can be useful in these extreme cases or when landsat data are sparse due to prevalent cloud conditions atmospheric evaporative demand formulations either for etp or et0 have differences and it is misleading to implicitly assume that their differences are negligible e g donohue et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2013 in bretreger et al 2020 the three eta models were implemented using variants of the fao 56 penman monteith pm et0 approach allen et al 1998 allen et al 2005 to estimate irrigation district water use whereas in their original implementations irrisat was parameterised using pm et0 kamble was parameterised using hargreaves and samani 1985 et0 and cmrset was parameterised using priestley and taylor 1972 etp differences in atmospheric evaporative demand formulations are summarised in table 6 of mcmahon et al 2013 with priestley and taylor being on average 7 higher than pm range 11 to 45 and hargreaves being on average 6 higher than pm range 13 to 40 despite such differences formulations can still be spatially and temporally consistent as demonstrated by chiew and leahy 2003 for priestley and taylor etp and fao 56 penman monteith et0 at selected australian sites although not considered a first order factor in the large overestimation of irrest using cmrset in bretreger et al 2020 differences could be amplified by the non linear nature of the cmrset model in this comment and in bretreger et al 2020 for 2010 2017 eta in irrest was aggregated with irrigated land use static maps for 2013 this adds another source of uncertainty in the estimation of irrest as not all irrigable paddocks are irrigated in any given season year see fig 7 in schauer and senay 2019 identifying irrigated paddocks in all years particularly when irrigation is out of phase with timing of maximum precipitation is feasible with rs reflectance data and can improve the estimates of irrest see ozdogan and gutman 2008 peña arancibia et al 2014 for examples in the united states and australia respectively 6 6 code availability a demonstration of bretreger et al s 2020 incorrect landsat cmrset implementation and the correct one has been developed in gee using landsat 8 oli and metereological data from era5 land monthly averaged data muñoz sabater 2019 both available in gee it can be accessed at https jorgepena users earthengine app view comment on bretreger 2020 joh paper source code for the gee implementation is hosted on github at https github com gee hydro gee cmrset additional gee and dea scripts demonstrations and pdf images are available in the supplementary information and in the above github repository 7 concluding remarks the large overestimation of irrigation water use obtained with cmrset actual evapotranspiration estimates in bretreger et al 2020 arises not because of the unsuitability or low accuracy of the cmrset model which was calibrated using modis data but due to how they incorrectly implemented cmrset with landsat data we reproduced the results of bretreger et al 2020 and demonstrated their error of incorrectly assuming that modis bands were equivalent to landsat bands originally cmrset was calibrated using the global vegetation moisture index gvmi with the modis swir2 band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm yet in their landsat cmrset implementation bretreger et al 2020 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm see their table 3 when they should have used the landsat swir1 band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm which is equivalent to the modis swir2 band we showed that a landsat cmrset implementation using gvmi with swir1 1 6 μm yielded similar results when compared to the other two rs satellite driven evapotranspiration models reported in bretreger et al 2020 conversely we showed that a landsat cmrset implementation using swir2 2 1 μm lead to a water year actual evapotranspiration and irrigation season water use overestimation confirming that bretreger et al s 2020 results were due to their incorrect landsat cmrset implementation the rationale for this assessment also applies to a previous study at the paddock scale by the same group bretreger et al 2019 besides the above mentioned implementation error landsat and modis sensors differ in spectral and radiometric characteristics thus using the same model on reflectance data from different sensors will to some degree result in different outputs these differences are amplified in non linear models like cmrset there are methods including cross sensor band transformation coefficients intercalibration of vegetation indices and modis landsat blending to reduce biases due to these differences previously published results in australia summarised in section 6 of this comment attest that bias correction and blending of landsat and modis evapotranspiration can reduce the inaccuracies of landsat only derived cmrset actual evapotranspiration despite the landsat implementation error of cmrset in bretreger et al 2019 and bretreger et al 2020 timely actual evapotranspiration estimates at landsat spatial resolutions or higher are desirable for monitoring irrigation due to the heterogeneous

3987,in a recent paper published in this journal bretreger et al 2020 estimate irrigation water use from satellite remotely sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration in five irrigated districts of the murray darling basin southeast australia they used three models that scale crop reference evapotranspiration with vegetation indices acquired by recent landsat satellites i irrisat ii kamble and iii cmrset in their paper irrigation water use computed with cmrset generally overestimated observed irrigation water use sometimes fivefold based on these results bretreger et al 2020 discouraged the use of cmrset for irrigation monitoring in this comment we reproduce the experiments in bretreger et al 2020 and demonstrate that their overestimation was because they used an incorrect landsat band in their implementation of cmrset cmrset was originally calibrated using both modis derived enhanced vegetation index evi and global vegetation moisture index gvmi to calculate gvmi a shortwave infrared swir band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm was used which for modis is named swir2 and for landsat is named swir1 i e different sensors have different bands and a different number of bands and swir1 in modis has a wavelength of 1 2 μm in their landsat cmrset implementation bretreger et al 2020 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm see their table 3 we show that cmrset implemented with the landsat swir1 band i e with a wavelength of 1 6 μm so being the correct landsat band to calculate gvmi yields similar results both for temporal patterns and magnitude when compared to the other two remote sensing actual evapotranspiration models in bretreger et al 2020 for the irrigation districts these similar results meant that the mean water year i e july to next june from 2010 to 2017 actual evapotranspiration mean absolute relative difference was 15 3 with a 5 4 26 5 range and the water year irrigation water use mean absolute relative difference was 4 1 with a 9 8 18 9 range conversely we show that a landsat cmrset implementation using the incorrect landsat band for the calculation of gvmi i e with a wavelength of 2 1 μm led to a large overestimation agreeing with the cmrset results reported by bretreger et al 2020 both for water year actual evapotranspiration mean absolute relative difference of 64 6 with a 51 1 83 6 range and irrigation water use mean absolute relative difference of 44 1 with a 31 4 65 1 range the use of the incorrect landsat band means that the bretreger et al 2020 recommendation specific to their landsat cmrset implementation is invalid a demonstration of bretreger et al s 2020 incorrect landsat cmrset implementation and the correct one can be accessed at https jorgepena users earthengine app view comment on bretreger 2020 joh paper despite bretreger et al s 2020 shortcomings in their implementation of the landsat cmrset actual evapotranspiration model timely monitoring of irrigation water use via satellite remote sensing is required at landsat resolutions i e 30 m or higher due to the heterogeneous nature of irrigation in most agricultural landscapes and we applaud them for pursuing this line of research keywords actual evapotranspiration remote sensing irrigation water use crop coefficient 1 introduction remote sensing rs used alongside hydrological modelling has the potential to close or minimise data gaps e g diversions irrigation efficiencies groundwater use and inform irrigation management especially in large irrigated systems that are difficult to monitor as evidenced by numerous studies across the globe ahmad et al 2005 bawa et al 2021 karimi et al 2019 koch et al 2020 peña arancibia et al 2016 simons et al 2020 van niel and mcvicar 2004a rs actual evapotranspiration eta estimates provide timely and accurate information related to irrigation water use bastiaanssen et al 2012 gowda et al 2008 therefore the assessment of rs based models that estimate eta for monitoring irrigation in a local context is a worthy research pursuit in selected irrigated areas in the murray darling basin mdb southeast australia bretreger et al 2020 used three satellite driven rs models that scale crop reference evapotranspiration et0 via a crop coefficient kc to estimate eta two of the models irrisat hornbuckle et al 2016 and kamble kamble et al 2013 follow a vegetation index vi approach by linearly scaling et0 with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kriegler et al 1969 a vi that primarily provides information about vegetation vigour irrisat was originally calibrated with landsat derived ndvi whereas kamble was originally calibrated with modis derived ndvi the third model cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration guerschman et al 2009 uses a hybrid approach that non linearly scales potential evapotranspiration etp via two vis that provide information about vegetation vigour and vegetation moisture content respectively the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 and the global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002 cmrset was calibrated with modis derived vis to predict eta for a broad range of land covers including open water guerschman et al 2009 it provides accurate eta estimates that have been successfully used in irrigation area assessment and water accounting balance inter alia in africa australia

in australia cmrset provided the best results among five satellite driven rs eta products king et al 2011 using digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli surface reflectance data hereafter referred to as l578 bretreger et al 2020 obtained eta spatial estimates for four large 500 km2 and one small 100 km2 irrigation districts within the mdb the estimates in mm depth were then aggregated to monthly time step using irrigable areas from static land use maps at the irrigation district scale and subsequently used as inputs in a one dimensional water balance to estimate irrigation water use as irrest p eta where p in mm per month is precipitation over irrigable areas the estimated irrest was compared to observed irrigation irrobs which was computed from volumetric canal offtake data and converted to mm depth using the same irrigation district irrigable area values the results of the comparison informed the potential suitability for monitoring irrigation in the mdb of the three models evaluated only irrest obtained with cmrset model 2b see guerschman et al 2009 largely overestimated irrobs sometimes fivefold see fig 5 in bretreger et al 2020 consequently bretreger et al 2020 concluded that both irrisat and kamble were suitable for monitoring irrigation in the mdb whilst they did not recommend cmrset here we show that bretreger et al 2020 did not implement cmrset correctly for landsat data because of i spectral and radiometric differences between modis and landsat and more importantly ii their incorrect use of spectral wavelength characteristics to calculate landsat gvmi when implementing cmrset bretreger et al 2020 used the generic band names rather than considering the band spectral wavelength characteristics when translating cmrset from modis to landsat see table 1 gvmi uses a shortwave infrared swir band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm ceccato et al 2002 which corresponds in modis to swir2 and in landsat to swir1 in their landsat cmrset implementation bretreger et al 2020 see their table 3 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm the vi differences between different sensors may not have large undue influence when using the irrisat and kamble algorithms because of the simple linear relation between ndvi and et0 noting that ndvi does not utilise a swir band only red and nir bands are used in contrast cmrset uses a more complex sigmoidal relationship which has the advantage that it provides accurate open water eta estimates guerschman et al 2009 and accurate eta estimates across a range of land covers and climates king et al 2011 and therefore differences in vis arising from the use of different swir bands can have a large impact on eta estimates due to the non linear nature of the cmrset formulation see section 4 1 herein we reproduce the experiments in bretreger et al 2020 that pertain to satellite remote sensing irrigation water use via l578 and modis reflectance data which here are both sourced from google earth engine gee gorelick et al 2017 we used gee data because modis data are not yet available in dea and compared dea l578 against gee landsat l578 ndvi evi and gvmi images to ensure that the gee l578 vi images are statistically like the dea l578 vi images see figs s1 s4 in the supplementary information and thus are suitable to reproduce the irrest experiments in bretreger et al 2020 here our aim is to identify the reason s for the overestimation of irrest by cmrset in bretreger et al 2020 as previous cmrset eta estimates in australia and elsewhere have not yielded such poor results as those reported in bretreger et al 2020 for this purpose three experiments are conducted 1 a comparison of cmrset s gvmi

objective to assess the differences in gvmi rmi and kc when l578 data are used without cross sensor band transformation coefficients chastain et al 2019 or intercalibration of vegetation indices steven et al 2003 3 a comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 in the computation of gvmi aggregated over irrigable areas at the irrigation district scale the comparisons are performed per pixel resampled 25 m pixel for landsat and 500 m for modis for gvmi and cmrset s residual moisture index rmi and kc and aggregated to the irrigation district scale 500

evi min where evimin 0 and evimax 0 9 evir is subsequently scaled by a calibrated parameter keimax 0 229 as 5 k ei k eimax evi r secondly to obtain a kc a rmi is estimated using the residuals of the correlation between modis evi and gvmi for all the pixels in australia for the months of january may and september in 2001 rmi was calculated per pixel as the vertical distance between its corresponding gvmi and a baseline as 6 rmi max 0 gvmi k rmi evi c rmi where krmi and crmi are calibrated parameters which describe the exact position of the baseline the values for krmi and crmi after calibration were 0 755 and 0 076 respectively guerschman et al 2009 thirdly and finally kc was estimated as 7 k c k cmax 1 exp a evi r α b rmi β where kcmax is multiplied by a sigmoidal function of

2020 obtained atmospherically corrected l578 surface reflectance images from dea then proceeded to mask clouds and cloud shadows from the images followed by the computation of ndvi evi and gvmi because of differences in the atmospheric correction and cloud and cloud shadow masking algorithms we compared ndvi evi and gvmi obtained using dea images against their gee image counterparts see figs s1 s4 in the supplementary information we performed the comparison for each landsat sensor landsat 5 tm for images in 2010 2011 landsat 7 etm for images in 2013 2014 and landsat 8 oli for images in 2015 2016 this was implemented for the representative geographic subsets see l578 insets in fig 1 for both the austral winter july to october and summer december to march cropping seasons as suggested by crop calendars abares 2012 4 3 experiment 1 comparing dea cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 and swir2 this comparison was performed to assess the differences of the bretreger et al 2020 gvmi rmi and kc computation using dea l578 swir2 bands wavelength 2 1 μm against the original cmrset gvmi rmi and kc computation as in guerschman et al 2009 using dea l578 swir1 bands wavelength 1 6 μm the experiment used all the individual images corresponding to the geographic subsets as described in section 4 2 for the respective years and for the austral winter july october and summer december march cropping months the similarity for all iios was visually assessed using a density scatterplot and statistically assessed using the following goodness of fit metrics gofs as in richter et al 2011 i the coefficient of determination r2 of a fitted linear regression between dea gvmi with swir1 and corresponding rmi and kc against dea gvmi with swir2 and corresponding rmi and kc which reflects spatial temporal correlation it is bound between 0 and 1 with r2 0 9 indicating excellent correlation 0 8 r2 0 9 indicating very good correlation and 0 5 r2 0 8 indicating good correlation ii slope m and intercept b of the fitted linear regression the slope indicates model under overestimation with 0 95 m 1 05 indicating excellent accuracy and 0 80 m 1 20 indicating good accuracy the intercept b indicates linear model biases with an excellent accuracy if b is close to 0 iii the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 which quantifies accuracy it is bound between and 1 with nse 0 9 indicating excellent accuracy and 0 5 nse 0 9 indicating good accuracy if nse 0 then the mean of observed values is at least as accurate as the response values fitted with the linear regression 4 4 experiment 2 comparing cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using resampled 500 m dea l578 against 500 m gee modis the objective of this experiment is to assess the differences in gvmi rmi and kc images between l578 and modis when l578 data is used without cross sensor band transformation coefficients or intercalibration of vegetation indices we compared mean resampled 500 m dea l578 images against their 500 m gee modis image counterparts the experiment used the individual images both for l578 and modis corresponding to the geographic subsets as described in section 4 2 for the respective years and for the austral winter july october and summer december march cropping months the same visual and statistical comparisons as experiment 1 section 4 3 were conducted for resampled 500 m dea l578 gvmi rmi and kc images against 500 m gee modis gvmi rmi and kc images both for the austral winter and summer cropping months 4 5 experiment 3 comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 monthly gee l578 cmrset irrisat and kamble eta and irrest are estimated for all four iios cmrset is implemented both using gvmi computed with the correct landsat swir1 band wavelength 1 6 μm according to guerschman et al 2009 and the incorrect swir2 band wavelength 2 1 μm as in bretreger et al 2020 the comparisons for irrest were performed visually using time series aggregated at the iio scale by averaging all irrigable pixels using the land use map described in section 3 3 the absolute mean percentage differences in eta and irrest for five water years from july 2011 to june 2016 between both variants of cmrset model 2b correctly using landsat swir1 with wavelength 1 6 μm and incorrectly using landsat swir2 with wavelength 2 1 μm and irrisat and kamble are computed as gofs 5 results 5 1 experiment 1 comparing dea cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 and swir2 a density scatterplot of dea l578 image gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 against dea l578 image gvmi rmi and kc using swir2 pooled for all iio subsets is shown in fig 2 the scatter and linear regression statistics show that using landsat swir2 in the computation of gvmi introduces a systematic overestimation and bias the overestimation and bias of gvmi swir2 2 1 μm is large see the density for gvmi values 0 1 for low gvmi swir1 1 6 μm values in both austral summer and winter fig 2a and d the use of swir2 2 1 μm in the computation of gvmi does not introduce errors that affect much the temporal patters in both austral summer and winter with good correlation r2 0 8 between both gvmi calculated with swir1 1 6 μm and swir2 2 1 μm because of the linear nature of rmi correlations are still good r2 0 5 although the accuracy in terms of nse is degraded with respect to gvmi s nse fig 2b and e due to the non linearity and constraints of kc r2 is dominated by the kc values at the upper limit kcmax 0 680 but the scatter shows a large spread of values and higher density for larger kc values using swir2 2 1 μm when kc values using swir1 1 6 μm are 0 1 fig 2c and f especially during austral summer from the kc results it can be inferred that cmrset eta and irrest that use swir2 2 1 μm to compute gvmi as in bretreger et al 2020 will be greater than cmrset eta and irrest that use swir1 1 6 μm according to guerschman et al 2009 particularly during the austral summer and for low 0 1 gvmi values because gvmi during the austral summer is generally low see fig 2c it is very likely that using swir2 2 1 μm will result in an overestimation of cmrset eta and irrest as reported by bretreger et al 2020 this issue is tested and quantified in full detail in experiment 3 which is reported in section 5 3 5 2 experiment 2 comparing cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using resampled 500 m dea l578 against 500 m gee modis a density scatterplot of mean resampled dea l578 500 m image gvmi rmi and kc against modis 500 m image gvmi rmi and kc pooled for all four iio subsets is shown in fig 3 fig 3a and d show that gvmi values from a mean resampled dea l578 500 m tend to overestimate their modis counterparts at gvmi values 0 1 and underestimate at gvmi values 0 1 this can be generalised for rmi and kc because of the coarser nature of the analysed pixels 500 m in this subsection and the fragmented nature of irrigated agriculture there is not much kc saturation during the austral summer months because the over underestimation in gvmi seems to follow a linear relationship mainly during the austral winter months the scale in the austral summer months precludes a visual assessment but slopes in both regressions are similar it would be possible to use cross sensor band transformation coefficients slope m and intercept b and reduce the overestimation and bias and consequently also reduce these differences in both rmi and kc 5 3 experiment 3 comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 fig 4 shows the time series comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s model 2b irrest using the correct swir1 1 6 μm and the incorrect swir2 2 1 μm in the computation of gvmi aggregated at the irrigation district scale alongside irrest obtained by the irrisat and kamble models as per bretreger et al 2020 it can be readily seen that the cmrset irrest using the incorrect l578 swir2 2 1 μm generally overestimates irrest when compared to the cmrset irrest using l578 swir1 1 6 μm in contrast the cmrset irrest using the correct swir1 1 6 μm is much better than its swir2 2 1 μm counterpart and is comparable to both the irrisat and kamble irrest estimates overall a landsat cmrset implementation using the incorrect swir2 2 1 μm leads to a water year eta mean absolute relative difference of 64 6 with a 51 1 83 6 range and irrest mean absolute relative difference of 44 1 with a 31 4 65 1 range overestimation which is similar to the results reported in bretreger et al 2020 in contrast a landsat cmrset implementation using the correct swir1 1 6 μm was closer to both irrisat and kamble eta mean absolute relative difference of 15 3 with a 5 4 26 5 range and irrest mean absolute relative difference of 14 1 with a 9 8 18 9 range it is noted that although study periods differ slightly the cmrset model using l578 swir1 1 6 μm irrest generally underestimates irrisat with the mean percentage difference i e the mean of each irrisatmonth cmrsetmonth irrisatmonth expressed as a percentage between the two models being 13 4 and mean percentage difference as calculated above for kamble being 15 0 in all iios this underestimation places the cmrset based irrest using the correct swir1 landsat band 1 6 μm closer to irrobs according to fig 5 in bretreger et al 2020 6 discussion 6 1 comparing dea and gee data the procedure of obtaining the landsat ndvi evi and gvmi in bretreger et al 2020 differs in both data source and pre processing used here the detailed comparison results see figs s1 to s4 in the supplementary information demonstrated that the gee data used here are statistically similar to the dea data used in bretreger et al 2020 and thus suitable to reproduce the estimation of irrest in the four iios it is noted that we used gee so we could access modis data which are not available from dea to allow the impact of landsat and modis spectral and radiometric differences the focus of experiment 2 on cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc to be assessed 6 2 experiment 1 comparing dea cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using swir1 and swir2 experiment 1 revealed that use of band names is not sufficient as band names are not generic they are sensor specific as shown in table 1 and band spectral characteristics should be matched as best as possible when translating across remote sensing instruments across modis to landsat bands in this case bretreger et al 2020 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm see their table 3 when they should have used the landsat swir1 band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm which is approximately equivalent to the wavelength of what is termed modis swir2 see table 1 this implementation error of using the landsat swir2 band 2 1 μm resulted in larger gvmi values being calculated in bretreger et al 2020 when compared to gvmi values calculated using the correct landsat 1 6 μm band performed herein this implementation error leads to an overestimation of rmi and kc particularly for low kc 0 1 during austral summer 6 3 experiment 2 comparing cmrset s gvmi rmi and kc using resampled 500 m dea l578 against 500 m gee modis experiment 2 shows that due care should be exercised when using models calibrated with different satellite sensors especially when such models are non linear like cmrset modis and landsat spectral and radiometric differences can result in different vis values in semi arid agricultural environments spectral extent i e band wavelength differences in the nir band between modis 0 84 0 88 μm and landsat tm etm 0 77 0 90 μm result in different evi values particularly for peak evi values in agricultural fields and in sparsely vegetated areas see figs 6 and 7 in jarchow et al 2018 these differences are exacerbated in non linear models like cmrset mancino et al 2020 found that differences in the land surface water index lswi a vi mathematically similar to gvmi that also uses the normalised differences between the nir and a swir bands located around 1 6 μm because of dissimilar swir1 spectral extent in l7 etm and l8 oli 1 57 1 78 μm and 1 57 1 65 μm respectively result in statistically significantly p 0 05 different lswi values in mixed agricultural areas grasslands and pastures see fig 5 in mancino et al 2020 to illustrate implementations of cmrset model 2b in australia using the same dea l578 data as in bretreger et al 2020 and modis we refer to mcvicar et al 2017 for locations in southeast australia and van niel et al 2017 for locations in northern australia these implementations included a range of land covers including parts of the mdb with agricultural areas both studies compared the accuracy of landsat only eta estimates modis only eta estimates and a new set of eta estimates developed by blending eta from the high spatial resolution and low temporal frequency landsat data and eta from the high temporal frequency daily composited to 8 day and low spatial resolution modis data referred to here as landsat modis blend the accuracy of the three i e landsat modis and landsat modis blend estimates in both geographic domains were assessed against two independent datasets i observed eta at flux towers and ii estimated eta from long term unimpaired catchment water balance as eta p q with p being long term catchment precipitation and q being long term observed streamflow respectively this is similar to the procedure of estimating irrest in bretreger et al 2020 in southeast australia mcvicar et al 2017 the three i e landsat modis and landsat modis blend cmrset eta model 2b variants described above were validated against eta from an eddy covariance flux tower and evaluated with long term eta from 16 unimpaired catchments and 5 river reach long term water balances although the landsat only cmrset eta performed well against the one eddy covariance flux tower eta the accuracy degraded at the catchment reach water balance scale showing a systematic overestimation which could be indicative of i the spectral and radiometric differences in sensors that were reduced by bias correcting the landsat only eta using modis eta estimates the existence of such biases can be inferred from experiment 2 and ii the error introduced by the lower temporal density of landsat observations when compared to the modis or landsat modis blended results mcvicar et al 2017 similarly for northern australia van niel et al 2017 the three i e landsat modis and landsat modis blend cmrset model 2b variants were assessed against eta estimates from seven eddy covariance flux towers and long term eta estimates from 15 unimpaired catchments the landsat only cmrset eta revealed a large overestimation against eta estimates from eddy covariance flux towers the overestimation was largely removed in the comparison with landsat modis blend eta estimates indicating undue influence of the differences in band spectral characteristics between landsat and modis the accuracy was also degraded at the catchment water balance scale when using the landsat only eta estimates oversampled modis eta estimates were used when landsat imagery was not available compared to the landsat modis blend eta estimates landsat only eta showed a systematic overestimation that was largely removed in the landsat modis blend eta van niel et al 2017 the results in experiment 2 although performed in a different geographical setting similarly point to a potential overestimation if cmrset is implemented using landsat without consideration of the spectral and radiometric differences with modis 6 4 experiment 3 comparison of monthly l578 cmrset s eta and irrest using swir1 and swir2 experiment 3 shows the impact of incorrectly using landsat swir2 2 1 μm in the estimation of gvmi which results in a large overestimation of eta and irrest several studies across the globe e g dembele et al 2020 karimi et al 2019 paca et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 peña arancibia and ahmad 2020 simons et al 2016 sriwongsitanon et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 have used cmrset s eta and such large cmrset errors as reported by bretreger et al 2020 have not been previously reported we note that not all these studies have reported cmrset to provide accurate eta values as in some instances e g karimi et al 2019 paca et al 2019 and simons et al 2016 cmrset is one of multiple eta models used in ensemble blending more recently cmrset s eta was evaluated in thailand using independent unimpaired water balance data for 172 catchments and their results were comparable or better that other rs driven models sriwongsitanon et al 2020 cmrset s eta estimates were also used to improve the calibration of the awra l model in 11 catchments in australia kunnath poovakka et al 2016 which demonstrated that the accuracy of cmrset s eta estimates can be used to improve streamflow predictions 6 5 other considerations landsat 578 have a 16 day revisit time or 8 day revisit with two satellites or a higher revisit in east west footprint overlap areas but these are limited to small areas see fig 2 in van niel and mcvicar 2004b for an illustrative example in the mdb so although it is also possible to capture two or three vis values within a month cloud contamination is likely a more pervasive issue for landsat than for modis see fig 10 in ju and roy 2008 in addition since late may 2003 the scan line corrector failed in landsat 7 etm leaving a 20 data gap in images goward et al 2006 thus in any given month it is likely that modis will provide vis that are more temporally representative of vegetation conditions than landsat albeit at a lower spatial resolution as mentioned in bretreger et al 2020 and others cammalleri et al 2014 gowda et al 2008 semmens et al 2016 the higher spatial resolution of landsat has clear advantages for the understanding of paddock scale irrigation dynamics for extreme cases in crop development stages such as pre and post harvesting or in multiple cropping systems it is possible that landsat may miss a more representative vi value if only one image is captured in a month see fig 8 in both nguyen et al 2020 and yan and roy 2020 landsat modis blending can be useful in these extreme cases or when landsat data are sparse due to prevalent cloud conditions atmospheric evaporative demand formulations either for etp or et0 have differences and it is misleading to implicitly assume that their differences are negligible e g donohue et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2013 in bretreger et al 2020 the three eta models were implemented using variants of the fao 56 penman monteith pm et0 approach allen et al 1998 allen et al 2005 to estimate irrigation district water use whereas in their original implementations irrisat was parameterised using pm et0 kamble was parameterised using hargreaves and samani 1985 et0 and cmrset was parameterised using priestley and taylor 1972 etp differences in atmospheric evaporative demand formulations are summarised in table 6 of mcmahon et al 2013 with priestley and taylor being on average 7 higher than pm range 11 to 45 and hargreaves being on average 6 higher than pm range 13 to 40 despite such differences formulations can still be spatially and temporally consistent as demonstrated by chiew and leahy 2003 for priestley and taylor etp and fao 56 penman monteith et0 at selected australian sites although not considered a first order factor in the large overestimation of irrest using cmrset in bretreger et al 2020 differences could be amplified by the non linear nature of the cmrset model in this comment and in bretreger et al 2020 for 2010 2017 eta in irrest was aggregated with irrigated land use static maps for 2013 this adds another source of uncertainty in the estimation of irrest as not all irrigable paddocks are irrigated in any given season year see fig 7 in schauer and senay 2019 identifying irrigated paddocks in all years particularly when irrigation is out of phase with timing of maximum precipitation is feasible with rs reflectance data and can improve the estimates of irrest see ozdogan and gutman 2008 peña arancibia et al 2014 for examples in the united states and australia respectively 6 6 code availability a demonstration of bretreger et al s 2020 incorrect landsat cmrset implementation and the correct one has been developed in gee using landsat 8 oli and metereological data from era5 land monthly averaged data muñoz sabater 2019 both available in gee it can be accessed at https jorgepena users earthengine app view comment on bretreger 2020 joh paper source code for the gee implementation is hosted on github at https github com gee hydro gee cmrset additional gee and dea scripts demonstrations and pdf images are available in the supplementary information and in the above github repository 7 concluding remarks the large overestimation of irrigation water use obtained with cmrset actual evapotranspiration estimates in bretreger et al 2020 arises not because of the unsuitability or low accuracy of the cmrset model which was calibrated using modis data but due to how they incorrectly implemented cmrset with landsat data we reproduced the results of bretreger et al 2020 and demonstrated their error of incorrectly assuming that modis bands were equivalent to landsat bands originally cmrset was calibrated using the global vegetation moisture index gvmi with the modis swir2 band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm yet in their landsat cmrset implementation bretreger et al 2020 computed gvmi using the landsat swir2 band which has a wavelength of 2 1 μm see their table 3 when they should have used the landsat swir1 band with a wavelength of 1 6 μm which is equivalent to the modis swir2 band we showed that a landsat cmrset implementation using gvmi with swir1 1 6 μm yielded similar results when compared to the other two rs satellite driven evapotranspiration models reported in bretreger et al 2020 conversely we showed that a landsat cmrset implementation using swir2 2 1 μm lead to a water year actual evapotranspiration and irrigation season water use overestimation confirming that bretreger et al s 2020 results were due to their incorrect landsat cmrset implementation the rationale for this assessment also applies to a previous study at the paddock scale by the same group bretreger et al 2019 besides the above mentioned implementation error landsat and modis sensors differ in spectral and radiometric characteristics thus using the same model on reflectance data from different sensors will to some degree result in different outputs these differences are amplified in non linear models like cmrset there are methods including cross sensor band transformation coefficients intercalibration of vegetation indices and modis landsat blending to reduce biases due to these differences previously published results in australia summarised in section 6 of this comment attest that bias correction and blending of landsat and modis evapotranspiration can reduce the inaccuracies of landsat only derived cmrset actual evapotranspiration despite the landsat implementation error of cmrset in bretreger et al 2019 and bretreger et al 2020 timely actual evapotranspiration estimates at landsat spatial resolutions or higher are desirable for monitoring irrigation due to the heterogeneous

3988,the aggregation of the same type of socio economic activities in urban space generates urban functional zones each of which has one function as the main e g residential educational or commercial and is an important part of the city with the development of deep learning technology in the field of remote sensing the accuracy of land use decoding has been greatly improved however no finer remote sensing image could directly obtain economic and social information and it has a high revisit cycle low temporal resolution while urban flooding often lasts only a few hours cities contain a large amount of social sensing data that records human socio economic activities and gis is a natural discipline with strong socio economic ties we propose a new geosemantic2vec algorithm for urban function recognition based on the latest advances in natural language processing technology bert model which utilizes the rich semantic information in urban poi data to portray urban functions taking the wuhan flooding event in summer 2020 as an example we identified 84 55 of the flooding locations in social media we also use the new algorithm proposed in this paper to divide the main urban area of wuhan into 8 types of urban functional zones kappa coefficient is 0 615 and construct a city portrait of flooding locations this paper summarizes the progress of existing research on urban function identification using natural language processing techniques and proposes a better algorithm which is of great value for urban flood location detection and risk assessment keywords geoai nlp deep learning social sensing urban functional zone city portrait 1 introduction the coupling effect of global climate change sea level rise and urbanization has been accentuated and hydro meteorological disaster events are frequent chang et al 2021 according to statistics the economic losses caused by global floods account for more than 30 of the total losses from natural disasters floods are among the most devastating hazards on earth posing great threats to a large amount of population in the world huang 2020 wan and fell 2004 china is one of the most severely flooded regions in the world and the yangtze river basin is the third largest in the world with a total basin area of 1 8 million square kilometers accounting for 18 8 of china s land area with the economic development of southern china the economic losses caused by the flooding of the yangtze river have become more and more serious 2020 china s yangtze river basin suffered the most serious flooding since 1998 a total of 70 471 000 people were affected by the disaster with direct economic losses of 214 31 billion rmb about 325 966 billion dollars 1 http www gov cn xinwen 2020zccfh 24 index htm 1 in this paper we study the 2020 floods in wuhan the largest city in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and use a social sensing approach for location extraction and semantic computation of urban flooding events there has been considerable research using specifically synthetic aperture radar sar imagery optical satellite imagery and a digital elevation model dem rakwatin et al 2013 monitoring and analysis of flooding events such as analyzing the extent of damage and affected population sun et al 2016 integrating remote sensing and deep learning methods to extract the depth of standing water hultquist and cervone 2020 syifa et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 etc however traditional sensor networks provide data with insufficient spatial and temporal resolution and satellite observations of the surface are easily obscured by clouds resulting in longer access cycles schnebele et al 2014 at the same time urban flooding and waterlogging is characterized by a short impact time which also places a high demand on the temporal resolution density of the data xu et al 2021 the social sensing approach represented by the crowd sourced volunteered geographic information vgi data is an important complement to the physical sensing network schnebele and cervone 2013 yan et al 2020 focusing on the socio economic domain cowie et al 2018 plays an equally important role in natural disaster monitoring and early warning and is a fast low cost and efficient survey monitoring method zou et al 2018 with the spread of 5g and the extensive coverage of smart devices these changes have greatly enriched the means and range of data for social sensing where everyone is a sensor providing real time feedback on real space events and entities liu et al 2015 sensor networks are highly accurate and fixed in format with a high density of available data zhang et al 2021 compared to it social sensing data has the advantages of massive data volume wide coverage area high observation density and can record human behavior patterns in detail forrest et al 2020 however the huge amount of observed data obtained by social sensing methods has a serious noise problem it has diverse sources inconsistent structures and low density of valid information the information describing natural disasters exists mostly in the form of textual descriptions and a large amount of valuable information is submerged in irrelevant messages this irregular information undoubtedly brings some impact on scientific research and it is time consuming and not time sensitive to filter it manually it is a popular and challenging research direction to extract disaster information from social sensing data by using artificial intelligence technologies with the development of natural language processing technology nlp the extraction of disaster information from social sensing data has been greatly advanced kaufhold et al 2020 in recent years many scholars have conducted research on this issue extracting and analyzing social media

temporal resolution of physical sensing network represented by remote sensing satellites is too low after searching open source satellite data from gf and zy series landsat modis and sentinel we found no high quality remote sensing imagery in wuhan in early july when the flooding was at its worst in 2020 in addition the land use interpretation results of remote sensing images do not have economic and social information these are the two main problems that we set out to solve in this paper our main contributions are twofold from an application perspective this paper proposes a social sensing approach for flooding location identification distinguishing waterlogged locations from common locations based on semantic information using the bert bilstm crf model from a methodological perspective this paper contributes a new geosemantic2vec algorithm that can learn the spatial context relationships from poi data to define urban functional zones the areas assigned to different social and economic activities yuan et al 2014 through economic and social spatial semantics the article is organized as follows section 2 introduces the work related to this paper and section 3 presents the research methodology which is divided into two parts flood area identification and urban function extraction sections 4 and 5 are our experimental sections which introduce our experimental background flood identification and urban function calculation based on the new method respectively the urban function calculation includes the accuracy comparison with the baseline algorithm and identifying urban functions in flooded locations the last section concludes the article 2 related works remote sensing images are often used in urban land use studies the advantage of remote sensing technology is that it covers a large area and can still obtain more accurate land use information in many inaccessible areas but remote sensing methods do not directly reflect socio economic information in addition remote sensing images have the same resolution in both suburban and urban areas but urban areas contain a large amount of social sensing data the most common data source for land use related research using social sensing methods is point of interest poi data which is a kind of mapping of geographic entities poi information in cities is much richer than remote sensing images we have collected more than 500 000 poi records within the third ring road of wuhan city and has great research potential there have been a considerable number of studies using social sensing data such as cab trajectories zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 cell phone signaling data yuan et al 2012 and bicycle sharing data zhang et al 2018 for studies related to urban functional zoning or land use most of them use geospatial analysis methods for trajectory similarity matching or origin destination analysis the use of nlp algorithms to extract potential geospatial features based on poi social media and other related data and then identify urban functional zoning sun et al 2016 is another research direction the earliest and most commonly used mining algorithms are the term frequency inverse document frequency tf idf method aizawa 2003 latent dirichlet allocation lda method blei et al 2003 and probabilistic latent semantic analysis plsa bosch et al 2006 method these unsupervised clustering methods are not restricted by the text form and automatically find the number of topics urban functional zones they could generate topic vectors and the distance between vectors indicates semantic similarity gao et al 2017 with the introduction of the word2vec model by google this word embedding method has been well received and widely used in urban feature recognition yao et al 2017 liu et al 2020 zhai et al 2019 improved algorithms based on word2vec represented by place2vec could consider the spatial context and embed the text into tighter vectors zhai et al 2019 however these methods have some drawbacks as words poi and vectors are in a one to one relationship it is difficult to solve the problem of multiple meanings of words one poi may assume multiple functions and different pois may belong to the same function such as parks and green spaces restaurants and eateries the traditional method represented by lda is actually a probabilistic model and does not contain semantic information angelov 2020 besides word2vec algorithm is a static approach although general but can not do dynamic optimization for specific tasks with the advancement of natural language processing technology transformer has successfully replaced the traditional recurrent neural network rnn lstm gru structure network tay et al 2020 in this paper we propose a new geosemantic2vec algorithm based on the latest bidirectional encoder representation from transformers bert model unlike the spatial random sampling method gao et al 2017 and the traffic analysis zone taz delineation method yao et al 2017 we perform a uniform spatial sampling of the city intensive point coverage to obtain as much fine scale spatial semantic information as possible compared with the place2vec method the algorithm takes the bert model as input and this pre trained model can better take into account the spatial contextual information even if the same poi will return different vector embedding results under different spatial contextual relationships in addition compared with the k means clustering method of the place2vec algorithm this paper adopts the density based hierarchical density based spatial clustering of applications with noise hdbscan method which can effectively eliminate the influence of outliers yan et al 2017 campello et al 2013 we use the uniform manifold approximation and projection umap algorithm mcinnes et al 2018 to reduce the dimensionality of the semantic vector the algorithm proposed in this paper is interpretable and could avoid complicated hyperparameter adjustment lu et al 2011 this paper belongs to the study of urban flood risk analysis which is different from the traditional use of flood related geographical factors elevation slope curvature distance to river and land use etc to determine flood risk löwe et al 2021 herbert et al 2021 pham et al 2021 lei et al 2021 we perform a data driven social sensing of urban flooding events and the assessment of their riskiness it enriches the existing means of flood data collection the advantage of our approach is that it is based on crowdsourced data extraction of flood locations but also considers the socio economic attributes of flood locations and is based on a data driven study of the socio economic risk of floods to humans romascanu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 3 research methods as shown in fig 1 this paper is organized by two main parts firstly named entity identification ner method to extract the location of waterlogging from social media weibo chinese twitter data secondly we propose the geosemantic2vec algorithm which extracts semantic information and clusters different functional areas of the city by spatially sampling the study area and computing the poi spatial context of the sampled points using the bert model then the semantic computing and socio economic mining are performed on the location of waterlogging our method could be applied to rapid mapping of flooding disasters which is faster compared to traditional methods such as remote sensing and manual census it fully considers the coupling relationship between people and the environment and the complex impact of urban flooding on the social environment 3 1 bert introduction and named entity identification bert is a novel language model based on transformer architecture devlin et al 2018 which is mainly divided into two steps pre training and fine tune compared with traditional neural network novel language models bert has achieved best results in several natural language processing tasks such as text classification text similarity intelligent question and answer text labeling and named entity recognition the mlm mask language model strategy is used to capture semantic connotations during bert pre training the specific approach is model randomly masks 15 of the words in the corpus 80 of training time randomly replaces the word with another word 10 of the time and keeps the original word unchanged for the remaining 10 of the time bert uses this noise injection training approach to improve the model s ability to acquire semantic information while also making it difficult to acquire the full amount of information thus ensuring its excellent generalization ability however the cost of pre training is very expensive in this paper we use the pre trained bert model based on the chinese wiki released by google number of hidden layers in the transformer encoder 12 size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer 768 number of attention heads for each attention layer in the transformer encoder 12 total parameters 110 m including dictionary of 7 322 chinese characters 2 https github com google research bert 2 fine tuning the model to identify flooding locations research has been conducted using bert to extract location from social media data ner task zhang et al 2020 li et al 2020 the principle of which is shown in fig 2 the basic idea is to transform the sequence annotation task recognizing words in text that describe an address into a classification task tagging each word appropriately at which machine learning excels the model inputs are sentences and bert encodes each word x i and outputs a word vector the word vectors are input to the bi directional long short term memory bi lstm layer for learning which samples the sentences separately according to the inverse order and outputs the probability distribution of the words belonging to each type of entity this distribution is fed to the conditional random field crf layer for judgment tseng et al 2005 to assign appropriate labels y i to the words 3 2 geosemantic2vec algorithm based on bert model and urban poi data we propose a geosemantic2vec algorithm for extracting urban functional areas from poi semantic information and location information inspiring by text classification tasks in natural language processing research we perform uniform sampling in the study area to obtain the sampling location generate the buffer of the sampling location at a certain distance sampling distance and arrange the pois word according to the distance from the sampling location the arrangement of poi is the expression of sampling location document as shown in fig 3 we consider that the closer the distance to the sampling location the stronger the effect of the poi on the sampling location property we use the enhancement parameter distance effects attenuation to carry out the weighting and the formula of this factor is 1 α dis tan ce l j 1 k 1 l p lk l 1 d β l i l j among them the context sampling location is l j l represents the total number of pois d β l i l j represents the distance between the poi l i and the sampling location l j β represents an inverse distance factor set to 1 in this paper the numerator can be regarded as a smoothing constant for a given poi dataset p lk represents the total poi count associated with the sampling location l j as we explained in this paper we let p lk 1 therefore the numerator is a constant equal to 2 for all pois α dis tan ce l j is rounding up to an integer our enhancement method is also simple if the enhancement parameter α value of poi a is 2 then poi a will appear twice in the list of sampling location l j expressions after the weighting process we use the list consisting of pois as a representation of sampling location we used the bert model to generate this expression into a sentence vector with 1 976 sampling locations in the study area generating a sentence vector of 768 dimensions size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer considering that the total number of poi types is not as rich as that total number of real world words we use umap to reduce the sentence vector to 70 dimensions zhai et al 2019 then we use the hdbscan algorithm mcinnes et al 2017 to cluster the reduced dimensional sentence vector and extract the urban themes of sampling location we provide the pseudo code of the algorithm with the flowchart here 3 step1 spatially sample the study area and all pois in the sampling location buffer are considered as a document step2 each poi in the buffer is considered as a word and arranged according to the spatial relationship between the pois and the sampling location and the distance enhancement factor is used to strengthen this relationship we get a matrix of the number of sampling locations multiplied by 768 the number of bert hidden layers step3 we reduce the dimensionality of the matrix obtained by step2 cluster the results and label each sampling position with the clustering results 3 in fact the two applications mentioned in this paper flood address identification and urban function study correspond to bert s annotation tasks fig 4 a tagging tasks and sentence classification tasks fig 4b for example in fig 4b the representation of a sampling location input poi list is chinese restaurant zoo bank of china wal mart train station bert will prefix the sentence poi list with cls classifier to generate a new poi list cls chinese restaurant zoo bank of china wal mart train station for the next step of model training as shown in fig 4b we embed the input poi list including poi word embedding sampling location information embedding and distance embedding the poi word embedding represents the poi name the sample location embedding represents the sample location and the distance embedding represents the spatial relationship between poi and sample location the composite input is fine tuned by the bert model and the output results are then used for downstream tasks as shown in fig 4a our sequence annotation task uses a single word bert encoding result vector which is input to bilstm crf for flood address extraction while our urban functional partitioning only requires the encoding result of cls a 768 dimensional vector for the downstream task algorithm 1 geosenmantic2vec algorithm 4 identification of waterlogged locations from social sensing data 4 1 study area and study time wuhan is the largest city in the middle reaches of the yangtze river with more than 100 urban lakes and is known as the water city in the context of rapid urbanization wuhan city faces serious urban flood control pressure during the rainy season every year zhou et al 2021 fig 5 shows the water level changes at wuhan hankou station from january to november 2020 the water level at hankou station reaches preventing water level on june 30 2020 warning water level on july 7 and the water level reaches its peak on july 12 similarly according to national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa data as shown in fig 6 the precipitation in wuhan reached 71 5 mm day on july 5 and 111 55 mm day on july 19 2020 which means that there is a short period of heavy precipitation and the flood season overlaps with the rainy season bringing a high risk of flooding in the main city we searched and obtained all weibos similar to tweets in twitter about waterlogging in wuhan after 2013 as shown in the attached figure there are more weibos in summer and spring we selected the weibos related to urban flooding in july and august 2020 as our data source to extract the location of waterlogging 4 2 bert training process as mentioned in sec 4 1 we obtained weibos related to flooding and waterlogging in wuhan city in july and august 2020 with a total data of about 100 000 words social media does not fully cover everyone and people react and express themselves differently to flooding events however if the amount of data is large enough suitable algorithms can extract reliable information from the big data containing noise wang et al 2015 chen et al 2021 we use bio ternary annotation pattern b begin i inside o outside b i e begin means start i i e intermediate means middle o i e other means other is used to mark irrelevant characters yang et al 2017 4 https github com jiesutd yedda 4 to annotate entities word by word for example a weibo serious flooding occurred on luoyu road water depth of 20 mm good road access on guangba road no waterlogging occurred here although there are two locations at the same time however guangba road is obviously not the location we need we label it verbatim as o o and luoyu road as b area begin i area begin in addition to waterlogging area we also labeled time rain precipitation level station monitoring stations depart response departments measure anti disaster measures stain waterlogging specifics water yangtze river level description and level risk level description fig 7 shows our labeling process the experimental environment is centos operating system tesla v100 gpu is used for training and the model is built by tensorflow 5 https tensorflow google cn 5 the experimental parameters are set as follows input dimension max seq length is 128 train batch size is 32 and learning rate is 2e 5 20 of the data were randomly selected as the test set and the rest of the data were used as the training set the precision recall and summation mean f 1 score are used as the evaluation criteria of model performance which is calculated as follows 2 precision tp tp fp 3 re call tp tp fn 4 f 1 2 precision re call precision re call where true positive tp indicates the case of correctly classifying i class as i class and true negative tn indicates the case of predicting j class as j class both of which are correct predictions false positives fp are the predictions that mark j class as i class and false negatives fn are the cases that predict i class as j class table 1 shows the evaluation results of our model number represents the number of entities in the test set among the eight recognition targets the model has better recognition ability for the location of waterlogging the precision of it is 0 819 recall is 0 846 and the summed mean f 1 score is 83 2 which means that our model has a good ability to accurately identify the location of inundation from a large number of locations 4 3 waterlogging location and geocoding we manually checked the waterlogging addresses extracted by the ner model and collected 2 989 weibos related to waterlogging in wuhan these weibos contained 190 waterlogging locations area we geocoded these locations to obtain detailed latitude and longitude coordinates as shown in fig 8 the waterlogging locations are almost all concentrated in the urban area and the waterlogging phenomenon is more intensive in the third ring road 101 waterlogging locations and 1 774 related weibos we selected the area within the third ring road of wuhan city as the main study area the water hazard risk is measured by the number of waterlogging number of weibo notifications as shown in fig 9 the water hazard risk is presented on two scales with fig 9a indicating the road sections prone to waterlogging and fig 9b indicating the streets with a high number of waterlogging phenomena this assessment method does not take into account the road class as well as the socio economic attributes of the waterlogging location darabi et al 2019 in the next section we will further explore the geo semantic information of waterlogging locations using the geosemantic2vec algorithm 5 semantic calculation of waterlogged locations based on the geosemantic2vec algorithm 5 1 city poi dataset the poi data used in the paper comes from baidu maps which is the largest online map provider in china 6 map baidu com 6 our study area is the main urban area within the third ring road of wuhan city with about 500 634 poi data poi data are classified into 22 basetypes caf tea roadfac adr loc touratr shopmal trabsfac bank fina sci edu motserv carserv carrepa carsale residen livserv indofac spr rec comuserv hospital gov pub factory 220 subtype and a more detailed 647 category by attributes we show the distribution of pois according to basetype classification criteria in table 2 5 2 urban functional zone identification we use a 500 by 500 grid to divide the land within the 3rd ring road of wuhan into 1 976 regions and set a buffer radius of 500 meters for the centroid of each region the resolution can be higher if the computing power allows the buffers of adjacent centroids are overlapped which allows the model to learn information about the surrounding sampling areas based on the distance from the centroid the pois in the buffer are ranked and a list of pois is obtained as an expression of the region here we take the value of enhancement parameter as 1 using the geosemantic2vec algorithm mentioned earlier this poi list is sampled and learned to learn the spatial interleaving relationships and contextual semantic information of all pois in the buffer it uses the distance embeddings layer of the neural network to learn the spatial location relationships and again learns the semantic information of different pois through the poi embeddings layer even for pois with the same name but with different spatial contextual relationships their embeddings generate different vectors this means that phrases are formed based on common poi pairings e g kentucky fried chicken kfc often appears with retail stores while retail stores often appear with residential areas and pois with the same name kfc have different meanings in different pairings kfc retail store kfc residential area we use hdbscan algorithm to cluster the vector of each sampling location to get the label functional partition according to the clustering results we divided the 1 976 areas into 8 categories in fig 10 namely water 158 mainly composed of water area scenic area 123 mainly taking on the functions of parks water friendly wetlands etc university 162 mainly composed of universities and colleges company 114 mainly taking on the functions of industrial parks and factories residence 242 mainly for residential land use public service 217 mainly for urban public services business 112 mainly for commercial and financial functions and other 848 it has no definite relationship in addition to that we also take the vector mean of each functional zone to represent this functional zone and calculate the similarity of different urban functional zones table 3 shows the calculation results of pearson correlation coefficients for different functional zones the functional zone other seems to be a multifunctional mixture with similar vector expressions to the rest of the types of functional zones except water water functional zone is very different from the rest of the functional zones due to the low density of poi and the single type of this functional area scenic area has a similarity to university 0 818 which may be the fact that universities have better forest cover and some historic universities also assume a certain tourism function university has a high similarity with many types with the largest difference with residence 0 701 company is significantly different from scenic residence and business but has a closer resemblance to public serv residence is strongly correlated with business 0 935 indicating that mature neighborhoods with more residents tend to have well established commercial services public serv has the strongest correlation with residence 0 912 indicating that public services tend to be built in more residential areas the correlation between business and company is the weakest 0 680 indicating that there is spatial heterogeneity between these two types of urban functional areas overall the city is a spatially coherent and multi functional mixed complex system and there is spatial heterogeneity as well as similarity calafiore et al 2021 5 3 identification and pattern classification in the previous section we divided the study area into 8 functional zones and in this section we evaluate the results of this division we calculate the distribution of poi in different urban functional zones by the following two indicators indicator 1 is poi density pd which aims to reveal the density of various types of poi in different functional zones and its calculation formula is as follows 5 pd i q n i q a i pd i q represents the density of class q pois in functional area i n i q represents the number of class q pois in functional area i and a i represents the total area of functional area i as shown in table 2 the number of different kinds of pois varies some pois are common and some pois are rarer which can lead to biased estimation results of pd metrics we mimic the tfidf algorithm in natural language processing and use the indicator2 the enrichment factor ef to overcome this bias which is calculated as follows 6 ef i q n i q n i n q n where ef i q represents the ef value of the class q poi in functional area i represents the total number of pois in functional area i n q represents the total number of class q pois represents the total number of all pois which is 500 634 in this paper in table 4 we calculate the pd and ef values for each urban functional zone the f scenic functional area has the highest poi density of touratr type pd 42 263 ef 37 163 which is very distinctive we classify these regions as scenic area type which take on the function of recreation in the city similarly the ef value of f university functional area sci edu type poi is the highest along with the high density of residen type livserv type transserv type and caf tea type poi a college or university is a mixture of multiple types of pois and the model extracts this particular mixed structure in addition to having various living service facilities provided to students and faculty members education is the most important function undertaken by colleges and universities the f company functional area is also easy to identify and he has the highest ef value of factory type poi the f residence functional area as the most relevant functional area for residents is rich in all kinds of living service facilities and the poi distribution is similar to that of the f business functional area the difference is that the f business functional area has more indofac type pois and less adr loc type pois the bert model could extract the semantic information of poi names even if the density of pois is the same the difference of semantic information will make the vector embedding representation of the two types of functional areas different the f publicserv functional area has the highest ef value of gov pub type poi and the vast majority of public service institutions are distributed here finally the f other functional zone does not show significant spatial aggregation characteristics at the spatial scale used in the paper and the urban functions are more ambiguous 5 4 algorithm accuracy comparison and effectiveness evaluation we use the word2vec method tfidf method and lda method mentioned in the previous paper as the comparison baseline for feature extraction and use the k means algorithm to cluster the feature extraction results to evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm we used a crowdsourcing approach and invited a dozen of master s students with a background in gis or urban planning to judge the type of urban functions at the sampled locations after eliminating locations where it was difficult to accurately determine the function types we kept 1 012 judgment results and verified them using precision recall and f1 score commonly used in machine learning from the confusion matrix fig 11 we can see that there are some particularly confusing locations such as water and scenic residence publicserv and business which may be due to the fact that spatially uniform sampling breaks up functional areas and one area will contain multiple functions with more information on special types of poi features in addition even though we define the attributes of functional areas there will still be bias in the perception of functional areas by different volunteers as shown in fig 12 our algorithm achieved a test score of 0 712 for precision 0 676 for recall and 0 683 for f1 which is about 15 improvement compared to the baseline algorithm 5 5 socio economic information mining of waterlogging locations we plot the road class the city function the number of peripheral pois and the number of times the water accumulates as shown in fig 13a the most serious waterlogging is in the residential and universities areas which have dense pois around these waterlogging locations more developed economies and higher road grades the risk caused by waterlogging in these areas is greater which seriously affect the life of the surrounding residents and traffic travel zeng et al 2020 we grouped the locations of waterlogging according to urban functions and discussed them using one way analysis of variance anova as shown in fig 13b there is a significant difference in the number of pois around public serv and residence functional zones containing water hazards p 0 002 residence functional areas have more poi information followed by commercial areas and universities at the confidence level of p 0 081 there is a significant difference in the number of pois in the different functional zones of the city in contrast the difference in the number of waterlogging in different functional areas was not significant p 0 41 even though the number of waterlogging in the two areas is similar the impact on the city varies greatly the impact of flooding is not only related to the severity of the hazard but also to the socio economic factors surrounding the location of flooding with flooding in busy areas and major transportation routes causing more serious impacts on the city it means that mining the socio economic attributes of different functional areas has more important value for the differentiation and research of flooding risk wang et al 2015 6 conclusion and prospect urban flooding has a wide range of impact and high intensity in a short period of time and its risk detection is a very meaningful research direction kankanamge et al 2020 we took the july september floods in wuhan as a research object and provided an effective solution for flood risk detection and assessment using social sensing data the bert bi lstm crf model is introduced into the identification of flooding locations and irrelevant locations for the first time it greatly improves the identification accuracy based on the pre trained prior knowledge and the semantic information of the context in social media texts considering the different social attributes of different waterlogged location steiger et al 2016 we proposed a new geosemantic2vec algorithm for urban functional zone the algorithm combines semantic information about the location of flooding and mines it for socio economic information data such as poi cab tracks twitter flickr photos etc which record human behavioral activities are abundant in the urban space by using these spontaneous vgi data we can make use of the semantic information to portray the functional areas of the city and build a city portrait the geosemantic2vec method proposed in this paper is suitable for areas with more human activities and more developed socio economics where the density of pois is high and can provide rich semantic information the method can use the historical poi data of multiple years to analyze the land use change trend of cities and use the poi data of multiple cities to build a global city portrait database the paper still has certain shortcomings it does not consider the floor area of poi for weighting the urban functional areas classified as other need to continue to be refined due to the limitation of arithmetic power the spatial resolution we set is low and the semantic information obtained is relatively limited and the results of urban function identification and the classification criteria of remote sensing images do not fully match which is pending for new supervised classification algorithms in the future we will try to use small samples of urban social sensing data for fast real time large scale flood location detection and risk assessment funding this research was supported by the national key r d program no 2018yfb2100500

3988,the aggregation of the same type of socio economic activities in urban space generates urban functional zones each of which has one function as the main e g residential educational or commercial and is an important part of the city with the development of deep learning technology in the field of remote sensing the accuracy of land use decoding has been greatly improved however no finer remote sensing image could directly obtain economic and social information and it has a high revisit cycle low temporal resolution while urban flooding often lasts only a few hours cities contain a large amount of social sensing data that records human socio economic activities and gis is a natural discipline with strong socio economic ties we propose a new geosemantic2vec algorithm for urban function recognition based on the latest advances in natural language processing technology bert model which utilizes the rich semantic information in urban poi data to portray urban functions taking the wuhan flooding event in summer 2020 as an example we identified 84 55 of the flooding locations in social media we also use the new algorithm proposed in this paper to divide the main urban area of wuhan into 8 types of urban functional zones kappa coefficient is 0 615 and construct a city portrait of flooding locations this paper summarizes the progress of existing research on urban function identification using natural language processing techniques and proposes a better algorithm which is of great value for urban flood location detection and risk assessment keywords geoai nlp deep learning social sensing urban functional zone city portrait 1 introduction the coupling effect of global climate change sea level rise and urbanization has been accentuated and hydro meteorological disaster events are frequent chang et al 2021 according to statistics the economic losses caused by global floods account for more than 30 of the total losses from natural disasters floods are among the most devastating hazards on earth posing great threats to a large amount of population in the world huang 2020 wan and fell 2004 china is one of the most severely flooded regions in the world and the yangtze river basin is the third largest in the world with a total basin area of 1 8 million square kilometers accounting for 18 8 of china s land area with the economic development of southern china the economic losses caused by the flooding of the yangtze river have become more and more serious 2020 china s yangtze river basin suffered the most serious flooding since 1998 a total of 70 471 000 people were affected by the disaster with direct economic losses of 214 31 billion rmb about 325 966 billion dollars 1 http www gov cn xinwen 2020zccfh 24 index htm 1 in this paper we study the 2020 floods in wuhan the largest city in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and use a social sensing approach for location extraction and semantic computation of urban flooding events there has been considerable research using specifically synthetic aperture radar sar imagery optical satellite imagery and a digital elevation model dem rakwatin et al 2013 monitoring and analysis of flooding events such as analyzing the extent of damage and affected population sun et al 2016 integrating remote sensing and deep learning methods to extract the depth of standing water hultquist and cervone 2020 syifa et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 etc however traditional sensor networks provide data with insufficient spatial and temporal resolution and satellite observations of the surface are easily obscured by clouds resulting in longer access cycles schnebele et al 2014 at the same time urban flooding and waterlogging is characterized by a short impact time which also places a high demand on the temporal resolution density of the data xu et al 2021 the social sensing approach represented by the crowd sourced volunteered geographic information vgi data is an important complement to the physical sensing network schnebele and cervone 2013 yan et al 2020 focusing on the socio economic domain cowie et al 2018 plays an equally important role in natural disaster monitoring and early warning and is a fast low cost and efficient survey monitoring method zou et al 2018 with the spread of 5g and the extensive coverage of smart devices these changes have greatly enriched the means and range of data for social sensing where everyone is a sensor providing real time feedback on real space events and entities liu et al 2015 sensor networks are highly accurate and fixed in format with a high density of available data zhang et al 2021 compared to it social sensing data has the advantages of massive data volume wide coverage area high observation density and can record human behavior patterns in detail forrest et al 2020 however the huge amount of observed data obtained by social sensing methods has a serious noise problem it has diverse sources inconsistent structures and low density of valid information the information describing natural disasters exists mostly in the form of textual descriptions and a large amount of valuable information is submerged in irrelevant messages this irregular information undoubtedly brings some impact on scientific research and it is time consuming and not time sensitive to filter it manually it is a popular and challenging research direction to extract disaster information from social sensing data by using artificial intelligence technologies with the development of natural language processing technology nlp the extraction of disaster information from social sensing data has been greatly advanced kaufhold et al 2020 in recent years many scholars have conducted research on this issue extracting and analyzing social media information for situational awareness and disaster assessment atefeh and khreich 2015 wang et al 2020 attempting to quantify and regularize social sensing data constructing knowledge service systems de bruijn et al 2019 improve disaster response capability barker and macleod 2019 wang and ye 2018 it has been heavily applied in various phases of disaster preparedness response and recovery zahra et al 2020 such as wildfire hazards wang et al 2016 earthquake robinson et al 2013 hurricane harvey yang et al 2019 zou et al 2019 and hurricane sandy wang et al 2019 in the face of flooding events the temporal resolution of physical sensing network represented by remote sensing satellites is too low after searching open source satellite data from gf and zy series landsat modis and sentinel we found no high quality remote sensing imagery in wuhan in early july when the flooding was at its worst in 2020 in addition the land use interpretation results of remote sensing images do not have economic and social information these are the two main problems that we set out to solve in this paper our main contributions are twofold from an application perspective this paper proposes a social sensing approach for flooding location identification distinguishing waterlogged locations from common locations based on semantic information using the bert bilstm crf model from a methodological perspective this paper contributes a new geosemantic2vec algorithm that can learn the spatial context relationships from poi data to define urban functional zones the areas assigned to different social and economic activities yuan et al 2014 through economic and social spatial semantics the article is organized as follows section 2 introduces the work related to this paper and section 3 presents the research methodology which is divided into two parts flood area identification and urban function extraction sections 4 and 5 are our experimental sections which introduce our experimental background flood identification and urban function calculation based on the new method respectively the urban function calculation includes the accuracy comparison with the baseline algorithm and identifying urban functions in flooded locations the last section concludes the article 2 related works remote sensing images are often used in urban land use studies the advantage of remote sensing technology is that it covers a large area and can still obtain more accurate land use information in many inaccessible areas but remote sensing methods do not directly reflect socio economic information in addition remote sensing images have the same resolution in both suburban and urban areas but urban areas contain a large amount of social sensing data the most common data source for land use related research using social sensing methods is point of interest poi data which is a kind of mapping of geographic entities poi information in cities is much richer than remote sensing images we have collected more than 500 000 poi records within the third ring road of wuhan city and has great research potential there have been a considerable number of studies using social sensing data such as cab trajectories zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 cell phone signaling data yuan et al 2012 and bicycle sharing data zhang et al 2018 for studies related to urban functional zoning or land use most of them use geospatial analysis methods for trajectory similarity matching or origin destination analysis the use of nlp algorithms to extract potential geospatial features based on poi social media and other related data and then identify urban functional zoning sun et al 2016 is another research direction the earliest and most commonly used mining algorithms are the term frequency inverse document frequency tf idf method aizawa 2003 latent dirichlet allocation lda method blei et al 2003 and probabilistic latent semantic analysis plsa bosch et al 2006 method these unsupervised clustering methods are not restricted by the text form and automatically find the number of topics urban functional zones they could generate topic vectors and the distance between vectors indicates semantic similarity gao et al 2017 with the introduction of the word2vec model by google this word embedding method has been well received and widely used in urban feature recognition yao et al 2017 liu et al 2020 zhai et al 2019 improved algorithms based on word2vec represented by place2vec could consider the spatial context and embed the text into tighter vectors zhai et al 2019 however these methods have some drawbacks as words poi and vectors are in a one to one relationship it is difficult to solve the problem of multiple meanings of words one poi may assume multiple functions and different pois may belong to the same function such as parks and green spaces restaurants and eateries the traditional method represented by lda is actually a probabilistic model and does not contain semantic information angelov 2020 besides word2vec algorithm is a static approach although general but can not do dynamic optimization for specific tasks with the advancement of natural language processing technology transformer has successfully replaced the traditional recurrent neural network rnn lstm gru structure network tay et al 2020 in this paper we propose a new geosemantic2vec algorithm based on the latest bidirectional encoder representation from transformers bert model unlike the spatial random sampling method gao et al 2017 and the traffic analysis zone taz delineation method yao et al 2017 we perform a uniform spatial sampling of the city intensive point coverage to obtain as much fine scale spatial semantic information as possible compared with the place2vec method the algorithm takes the bert model as input and this pre trained model can better take into account the spatial contextual information even if the same poi will return different vector embedding results under different spatial contextual relationships in addition compared with the k means clustering method of the place2vec algorithm this paper adopts the density based hierarchical density based spatial clustering of applications with noise hdbscan method which can effectively eliminate the influence of outliers yan et al 2017 campello et al 2013 we use the uniform manifold approximation and projection umap algorithm mcinnes et al 2018 to reduce the dimensionality of the semantic vector the algorithm proposed in this paper is interpretable and could avoid complicated hyperparameter adjustment lu et al 2011 this paper belongs to the study of urban flood risk analysis which is different from the traditional use of flood related geographical factors elevation slope curvature distance to river and land use etc to determine flood risk löwe et al 2021 herbert et al 2021 pham et al 2021 lei et al 2021 we perform a data driven social sensing of urban flooding events and the assessment of their riskiness it enriches the existing means of flood data collection the advantage of our approach is that it is based on crowdsourced data extraction of flood locations but also considers the socio economic attributes of flood locations and is based on a data driven study of the socio economic risk of floods to humans romascanu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 3 research methods as shown in fig 1 this paper is organized by two main parts firstly named entity identification ner method to extract the location of waterlogging from social media weibo chinese twitter data secondly we propose the geosemantic2vec algorithm which extracts semantic information and clusters different functional areas of the city by spatially sampling the study area and computing the poi spatial context of the sampled points using the bert model then the semantic computing and socio economic mining are performed on the location of waterlogging our method could be applied to rapid mapping of flooding disasters which is faster compared to traditional methods such as remote sensing and manual census it fully considers the coupling relationship between people and the environment and the complex impact of urban flooding on the social environment 3 1 bert introduction and named entity identification bert is a novel language model based on transformer architecture devlin et al 2018 which is mainly divided into two steps pre training and fine tune compared with traditional neural network novel language models bert has achieved best results in several natural language processing tasks such as text classification text similarity intelligent question and answer text labeling and named entity recognition the mlm mask language model strategy is used to capture semantic connotations during bert pre training the specific approach is model randomly masks 15 of the words in the corpus 80 of training time randomly replaces the word with another word 10 of the time and keeps the original word unchanged for the remaining 10 of the time bert uses this noise injection training approach to improve the model s ability to acquire semantic information while also making it difficult to acquire the full amount of information thus ensuring its excellent generalization ability however the cost of pre training is very expensive in this paper we use the pre trained bert model based on the chinese wiki released by google number of hidden layers in the transformer encoder 12 size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer 768 number of attention heads for each attention layer in the transformer encoder 12 total parameters 110 m including dictionary of 7 322 chinese characters 2 https github com google research bert 2 fine tuning the model to identify flooding locations research has been conducted using bert to extract location from social media data ner task zhang et al 2020 li et al 2020 the principle of which is shown in fig 2 the basic idea is to transform the sequence annotation task recognizing words in text that describe an address into a classification task tagging each word appropriately at which machine learning excels the model inputs are sentences and bert encodes each word x i and outputs a word vector the word vectors are input to the bi directional long short term memory bi lstm layer for learning which samples the sentences separately according to the inverse order and outputs the probability distribution of the words belonging to each type of entity this distribution is fed to the conditional random field crf layer for judgment tseng et al 2005 to assign appropriate labels y i to the words 3 2 geosemantic2vec algorithm based on bert model and urban poi data we propose a geosemantic2vec algorithm for extracting urban functional areas from poi semantic information and location information inspiring by text classification tasks in natural language processing research we perform uniform sampling in the study area to obtain the sampling location generate the buffer of the sampling location at a certain distance sampling distance and arrange the pois word according to the distance from the sampling location the arrangement of poi is the expression of sampling location document as shown in fig 3 we consider that the closer the distance to the sampling location the stronger the effect of the poi on the sampling location property we use the enhancement parameter distance effects attenuation to carry out the weighting and the formula of this factor is 1 α dis tan ce l j 1 k 1 l p lk l 1 d β l i l j among them the context sampling location is l j l represents the total number of pois d β l i l j represents the distance between the poi l i and the sampling location l j β represents an inverse distance factor set to 1 in this paper the numerator can be regarded as a smoothing constant for a given poi dataset p lk represents the total poi count associated with the sampling location l j as we explained in this paper we let p lk 1 therefore the numerator is a constant equal to 2 for all pois α dis tan ce l j is rounding up to an integer our enhancement method is also simple if the enhancement parameter α value of poi a is 2 then poi a will appear twice in the list of sampling location l j expressions after the weighting process we use the list consisting of pois as a representation of sampling location we used the bert model to generate this expression into a sentence vector with 1 976 sampling locations in the study area generating a sentence vector of 768 dimensions size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer considering that the total number of poi types is not as rich as that total number of real world words we use umap to reduce the sentence vector to 70 dimensions zhai et al 2019 then we use the hdbscan algorithm mcinnes et al 2017 to cluster the reduced dimensional sentence vector and extract the urban themes of sampling location we provide the pseudo code of the algorithm with the flowchart here 3 step1 spatially sample the study area and all pois in the sampling location buffer are considered as a document step2 each poi in the buffer is considered as a word and arranged according to the spatial relationship between the pois and the sampling location and the distance enhancement factor is used to strengthen this relationship we get a matrix of the number of sampling locations multiplied by 768 the number of bert hidden layers step3 we reduce the dimensionality of the matrix obtained by step2 cluster the results and label each sampling position with the clustering results 3 in fact the two applications mentioned in this paper flood address identification and urban function study correspond to bert s annotation tasks fig 4 a tagging tasks and sentence classification tasks fig 4b for example in fig 4b the representation of a sampling location input poi list is chinese restaurant zoo bank of china wal mart train station bert will prefix the sentence poi list with cls classifier to generate a new poi list cls chinese restaurant zoo bank of china wal mart train station for the next step of model training as shown in fig 4b we embed the input poi list including poi word embedding sampling location information embedding and distance embedding the poi word embedding represents the poi name the sample location embedding represents the sample location and the distance embedding represents the spatial relationship between poi and sample location the composite input is fine tuned by the bert model and the output results are then used for downstream tasks as shown in fig 4a our sequence annotation task uses a single word bert encoding result vector which is input to bilstm crf for flood address extraction while our urban functional partitioning only requires the encoding result of cls a 768 dimensional vector for the downstream task algorithm 1 geosenmantic2vec algorithm 4 identification of waterlogged locations from social sensing data 4 1 study area and study time wuhan is the largest city in the middle reaches of the yangtze river with more than 100 urban lakes and is known as the water city in the context of rapid urbanization wuhan city faces serious urban flood control pressure during the rainy season every year zhou et al 2021 fig 5 shows the water level changes at wuhan hankou station from january to november 2020 the water level at hankou station reaches preventing water level on june 30 2020 warning water level on july 7 and the water level reaches its peak on july 12 similarly according to national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa data as shown in fig 6 the precipitation in wuhan reached 71 5 mm day on july 5 and 111 55 mm day on july 19 2020 which means that there is a short period of heavy precipitation and the flood season overlaps with the rainy season bringing a high risk of flooding in the main city we searched and obtained all weibos similar to tweets in twitter about waterlogging in wuhan after 2013 as shown in the attached figure there are more weibos in summer and spring we selected the weibos related to urban flooding in july and august 2020 as our data source to extract the location of waterlogging 4 2 bert training process as mentioned in sec 4 1 we obtained weibos related to flooding and waterlogging in wuhan city in july and august 2020 with a total data of about 100 000 words social media does not fully cover everyone and people react and express themselves differently to flooding events however if the amount of data is large enough suitable algorithms can extract reliable information from the big data containing noise wang et al 2015 chen et al 2021 we use bio ternary annotation pattern b begin i inside o outside b i e begin means start i i e intermediate means middle o i e other means other is used to mark irrelevant characters yang et al 2017 4 https github com jiesutd yedda 4 to annotate entities word by word for example a weibo serious flooding occurred on luoyu road water depth of 20 mm good road access on guangba road no waterlogging occurred here although there are two locations at the same time however guangba road is obviously not the location we need we label it verbatim as o o and luoyu road as b area begin i area begin in addition to waterlogging area we also labeled time rain precipitation level station monitoring stations depart response departments measure anti disaster measures stain waterlogging specifics water yangtze river level description and level risk level description fig 7 shows our labeling process the experimental environment is centos operating system tesla v100 gpu is used for training and the model is built by tensorflow 5 https tensorflow google cn 5 the experimental parameters are set as follows input dimension max seq length is 128 train batch size is 32 and learning rate is 2e 5 20 of the data were randomly selected as the test set and the rest of the data were used as the training set the precision recall and summation mean f 1 score are used as the evaluation criteria of model performance which is calculated as follows 2 precision tp tp fp 3 re call tp tp fn 4 f 1 2 precision re call precision re call where true positive tp indicates the case of correctly classifying i class as i class and true negative tn indicates the case of predicting j class as j class both of which are correct predictions false positives fp are the predictions that mark j class as i class and false negatives fn are the cases that predict i class as j class table 1 shows the evaluation results of our model number represents the number of entities in the test set among the eight recognition targets the model has better recognition ability for the location of waterlogging the precision of it is 0 819 recall is 0 846 and the summed mean f 1 score is 83 2 which means that our model has a good ability to accurately identify the location of inundation from a large number of locations 4 3 waterlogging location and geocoding we manually checked the waterlogging addresses extracted by the ner model and collected 2 989 weibos related to waterlogging in wuhan these weibos contained 190 waterlogging locations area we geocoded these locations to obtain detailed latitude and longitude coordinates as shown in fig 8 the waterlogging locations are almost all concentrated in the urban area and the waterlogging phenomenon is more intensive in the third ring road 101 waterlogging locations and 1 774 related weibos we selected the area within the third ring road of wuhan city as the main study area the water hazard risk is measured by the number of waterlogging number of weibo notifications as shown in fig 9 the water hazard risk is presented on two scales with fig 9a indicating the road sections prone to waterlogging and fig 9b indicating the streets with a high number of waterlogging phenomena this assessment method does not take into account the road class as well as the socio economic attributes of the waterlogging location darabi et al 2019 in the next section we will further explore the geo semantic information of waterlogging locations using the geosemantic2vec algorithm 5 semantic calculation of waterlogged locations based on the geosemantic2vec algorithm 5 1 city poi dataset the poi data used in the paper comes from baidu maps which is the largest online map provider in china 6 map baidu com 6 our study area is the main urban area within the third ring road of wuhan city with about 500 634 poi data poi data are classified into 22 basetypes caf tea roadfac adr loc touratr shopmal trabsfac bank fina sci edu motserv carserv carrepa carsale residen livserv indofac spr rec comuserv hospital gov pub factory 220 subtype and a more detailed 647 category by attributes we show the distribution of pois according to basetype classification criteria in table 2 5 2 urban functional zone identification we use a 500 by 500 grid to divide the land within the 3rd ring road of wuhan into 1 976 regions and set a buffer radius of 500 meters for the centroid of each region the resolution can be higher if the computing power allows the buffers of adjacent centroids are overlapped which allows the model to learn information about the surrounding sampling areas based on the distance from the centroid the pois in the buffer are ranked and a list of pois is obtained as an expression of the region here we take the value of enhancement parameter as 1 using the geosemantic2vec algorithm mentioned earlier this poi list is sampled and learned to learn the spatial interleaving relationships and contextual semantic information of all pois in the buffer it uses the distance embeddings layer of the neural network to learn the spatial location relationships and again learns the semantic information of different pois through the poi embeddings layer even for pois with the same name but with different spatial contextual relationships their embeddings generate different vectors this means that phrases are formed based on common poi pairings e g kentucky fried chicken kfc often appears with retail stores while retail stores often appear with residential areas and pois with the same name kfc have different meanings in different pairings kfc retail store kfc residential area we use hdbscan algorithm to cluster the vector of each sampling location to get the label functional partition according to the clustering results we divided the 1 976 areas into 8 categories in fig 10 namely water 158 mainly composed of water area scenic area 123 mainly taking on the functions of parks water friendly wetlands etc university 162 mainly composed of universities and colleges company 114 mainly taking on the functions of industrial parks and factories residence 242 mainly for residential land use public service 217 mainly for urban public services business 112 mainly for commercial and financial functions and other 848 it has no definite relationship in addition to that we also take the vector mean of each functional zone to represent this functional zone and calculate the similarity of different urban functional zones table 3 shows the calculation results of pearson correlation coefficients for different functional zones the functional zone other seems to be a multifunctional mixture with similar vector expressions to the rest of the types of functional zones except water water functional zone is very different from the rest of the functional zones due to the low density of poi and the single type of this functional area scenic area has a similarity to university 0 818 which may be the fact that universities have better forest cover and some historic universities also assume a certain tourism function university has a high similarity with many types with the largest difference with residence 0 701 company is significantly different from scenic residence and business but has a closer resemblance to public serv residence is strongly correlated with business 0 935 indicating that mature neighborhoods with more residents tend to have well established commercial services public serv has the strongest correlation with residence 0 912 indicating that public services tend to be built in more residential areas the correlation between business and company is the weakest 0 680 indicating that there is spatial heterogeneity between these two types of urban functional areas overall the city is a spatially coherent and multi functional mixed complex system and there is spatial heterogeneity as well as similarity calafiore et al 2021 5 3 identification and pattern classification in the previous section we divided the study area into 8 functional zones and in this section we evaluate the results of this division we calculate the distribution of poi in different urban functional zones by the following two indicators indicator 1 is poi density pd which aims to reveal the density of various types of poi in different functional zones and its calculation formula is as follows 5 pd i q n i q a i pd i q represents the density of class q pois in functional area i n i q represents the number of class q pois in functional area i and a i represents the total area of functional area i as shown in table 2 the number of different kinds of pois varies some pois are common and some pois are rarer which can lead to biased estimation results of pd metrics we mimic the tfidf algorithm in natural language processing and use the indicator2 the enrichment factor ef to overcome this bias which is calculated as follows 6 ef i q n i q n i n q n where ef i q represents the ef value of the class q poi in functional area i represents the total number of pois in functional area i n q represents the total number of class q pois represents the total number of all pois which is 500 634 in this paper in table 4 we calculate the pd and ef values for each urban functional zone the f scenic functional area has the highest poi density of touratr type pd 42 263 ef 37 163 which is very distinctive we classify these regions as scenic area type which take on the function of recreation in the city similarly the ef value of f university functional area sci edu type poi is the highest along with the high density of residen type livserv type transserv type and caf tea type poi a college or university is a mixture of multiple types of pois and the model extracts this particular mixed structure in addition to having various living service facilities provided to students and faculty members education is the most important function undertaken by colleges and universities the f company functional area is also easy to identify and he has the highest ef value of factory type poi the f residence functional area as the most relevant functional area for residents is rich in all kinds of living service facilities and the poi distribution is similar to that of the f business functional area the difference is that the f business functional area has more indofac type pois and less adr loc type pois the bert model could extract the semantic information of poi names even if the density of pois is the same the difference of semantic information will make the vector embedding representation of the two types of functional areas different the f publicserv functional area has the highest ef value of gov pub type poi and the vast majority of public service institutions are distributed here finally the f other functional zone does not show significant spatial aggregation characteristics at the spatial scale used in the paper and the urban functions are more ambiguous 5 4 algorithm accuracy comparison and effectiveness evaluation we use the word2vec method tfidf method and lda method mentioned in the previous paper as the comparison baseline for feature extraction and use the k means algorithm to cluster the feature extraction results to evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm we used a crowdsourcing approach and invited a dozen of master s students with a background in gis or urban planning to judge the type of urban functions at the sampled locations after eliminating locations where it was difficult to accurately determine the function types we kept 1 012 judgment results and verified them using precision recall and f1 score commonly used in machine learning from the confusion matrix fig 11 we can see that there are some particularly confusing locations such as water and scenic residence publicserv and business which may be due to the fact that spatially uniform sampling breaks up functional areas and one area will contain multiple functions with more information on special types of poi features in addition even though we define the attributes of functional areas there will still be bias in the perception of functional areas by different volunteers as shown in fig 12 our algorithm achieved a test score of 0 712 for precision 0 676 for recall and 0 683 for f1 which is about 15 improvement compared to the baseline algorithm 5 5 socio economic information mining of waterlogging locations we plot the road class the city function the number of peripheral pois and the number of times the water accumulates as shown in fig 13a the most serious waterlogging is in the residential and universities areas which have dense pois around these waterlogging locations more developed economies and higher road grades the risk caused by waterlogging in these areas is greater which seriously affect the life of the surrounding residents and traffic travel zeng et al 2020 we grouped the locations of waterlogging according to urban functions and discussed them using one way analysis of variance anova as shown in fig 13b there is a significant difference in the number of pois around public serv and residence functional zones containing water hazards p 0 002 residence functional areas have more poi information followed by commercial areas and universities at the confidence level of p 0 081 there is a significant difference in the number of pois in the different functional zones of the city in contrast the difference in the number of waterlogging in different functional areas was not significant p 0 41 even though the number of waterlogging in the two areas is similar the impact on the city varies greatly the impact of flooding is not only related to the severity of the hazard but also to the socio economic factors surrounding the location of flooding with flooding in busy areas and major transportation routes causing more serious impacts on the city it means that mining the socio economic attributes of different functional areas has more important value for the differentiation and research of flooding risk wang et al 2015 6 conclusion and prospect urban flooding has a wide range of impact and high intensity in a short period of time and its risk detection is a very meaningful research direction kankanamge et al 2020 we took the july september floods in wuhan as a research object and provided an effective solution for flood risk detection and assessment using social sensing data the bert bi lstm crf model is introduced into the identification of flooding locations and irrelevant locations for the first time it greatly improves the identification accuracy based on the pre trained prior knowledge and the semantic information of the context in social media texts considering the different social attributes of different waterlogged location steiger et al 2016 we proposed a new geosemantic2vec algorithm for urban functional zone the algorithm combines semantic information about the location of flooding and mines it for socio economic information data such as poi cab tracks twitter flickr photos etc which record human behavioral activities are abundant in the urban space by using these spontaneous vgi data we can make use of the semantic information to portray the functional areas of the city and build a city portrait the geosemantic2vec method proposed in this paper is suitable for areas with more human activities and more developed socio economics where the density of pois is high and can provide rich semantic information the method can use the historical poi data of multiple years to analyze the land use change trend of cities and use the poi data of multiple cities to build a global city portrait database the paper still has certain shortcomings it does not consider the floor area of poi for weighting the urban functional areas classified as other need to continue to be refined due to the limitation of arithmetic power the spatial resolution we set is low and the semantic information obtained is relatively limited and the results of urban function identification and the classification criteria of remote sensing images do not fully match which is pending for new supervised classification algorithms in the future we will try to use small samples of urban social sensing data for fast real time large scale flood location detection and risk assessment funding this research was supported by the national key r d program no 2018yfb2100500

3989,flood events in the harşit river basin which is located in the eastern black sea region and actively experienced one of the most flood events in turkey were discussed based on drainage basin morphometry using three different methods in this study 26 sub basins over 10 km2 are taken into account and flood dynamics of sub basins are evaluated depending on morphometric properties the results obtained according to the morphometric parameters are evaluated based on statistical techniques and the flood priority is determined a total of 20 different indices were used in this study the obtained morphometry results were evaluated according to the probability of occurrence of floods according to three different methods including morphometric priority flood priority according to principal component analysis method and redvan s priority ranking method each method is evaluated within itself and flood priorities of sub basins have been determined with respect to the 26 sub basins of the harşit river and according to the morphometric priority method and results obtained from this method 8 sub basins have low flood priority 12 basins have medium flood priority and 7 basins have high flood priority by examining the results obtained from the pca priority method 11 sub basins have low flood priority 6 sub basins have medium flood priority while 9 basins have high flood priority finally according to the redvan s priority method and its classification 11 sub basins are located in the low priority class 6 sub basins have medium flood priority according to this method the number of sub basins with high priority is 9 priorities obtained using three different techniques were checked for accuracy with 6 different statistical parameters based on predicted and inventory datasets accordingly the accuracy value for the rprm and pca methods are higher than the ma method on the other hand the rprm method has the highest tn value which is equal to 7 sub basins which shows the correct prediction of sub basins with the low flood risk based on the results it was seen that the obtained values have a high consistency in basin morphometry the rprm which is a new suggested technique in determining basin flood priority shows that common basins give very similar results with the results obtained according to morphometry and pca method sub basins with common flood risk due to outputs of used methods were compared with recorded floods map of turkey keywords principal component analysis method redvan s priority method morphometric priority method flood priorities basin morphometry 1 introduction floods are one of the natural disasters that occur in almost every country around the world affecting people in many economic and social aspects and also causing deaths bathrellos et al 2016 ceos 2003 yüksek et al 2013 the areas where flood events occur in more than 30 of the world also correspond to the areas where 82 of the world s population lives rivers sea coasts flood plains and their surroundings where approximately 2 billion people live are problematic areas on a global scale in terms of flood hazard and risk dilley et al 2005 jonkman 2005 tockner and stanford 2002 zhao and shao 2015 the global climate change hirabayashi et al 2013 and the anthropogenic factors alifujiang et al 2021 are considered to be some of the main reasons for the occurrence of floods hens et al 2018 luu et al 2021 thanh et al 2017 because climate change on a global scale especially changes in precipitation and temperature intensity frequency and pattern causes differences in global and regional scales alifujiang et al 2021 arnell and gosling 2016 besides the rapidly increasing world population and opening flood plains to settlements with wrong engineering practices on river banks destruction of vegetation and forest cover and unplanned land use are among the most important factors in the occurrence of floods aydin and raja 2020 milly et al 2002 tayanç

understanding the drainage basin characteristics singh and singh 2017 the geomorphometric approach is one of the ways to understanding the hydrological situation or flood potential in the drainage basin which plays crucial roles in terms of using different indices including linear areal and relief morphometry biswas et al 2014 diakakis 2011 many studies are carried out in different main rivers and sub basins to understanding the flooding potential using morphometric analysis thomas and prasannakumar 2015 farhan et al 2017 bhat et al 2019 abdeta et al 2020 utlu and ghasemlonia 2020 for instance patel et al 2015 focused on determining the water harvesting structure by reaching the best and most suitable result by morphometric analysis in 13 sub basins in the hatmati basin el tahan and elhanafy 2016 also used morphometric analysis for the purpose of determining morphometric and hydrologic situation of the wadi hadramut drainage basin using statistical methods and principal component analysis pca abdelkarim et al 2020 focused on specifying the flood hazard of the drainage basin area using morphometric indices that calculated the degree of hazard for each basin based on the geomorphological ranking model gunjan et al 2020 used the morphometric analysis in the nine sub basins of the mahanadi river basin which was prioritized based on linear areal and relief parameters they classified the erosion stage of each basin as high medium and low classes the major aim of the current study is to on the morphometric characterization of the harşit river basin which is one of the most humid and rainy regions in turkey in this respect the probability of flooding will be evaluated as a result of determining the morphometric properties of sub basins joining the mainstream in the harşit river basins therefore sub basins will be specified and morphometric properties will be calculated in terms of linear relief and areal morphometry thence the flood characteristics of each sub basin will be determined according to the morphometric features calculated in linear relief and areal aspects 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the harşit river basin located in the east black sea region and includes giresun and gümüşhane provinces of turkey is prone to mostly flood özcan 2006 fig 1 a the total drainage basin area of the harşit river basin covers 3308 82 km2 and is characterized by high hilly topography by the elevation ranges from 0 m to 3331 76 m from sea level in the east black sea mountains fig 1b this basin extends from the south to the north and its water drains into the black sea there are 26 sub basins with an area of more than 10 km2 on the harşit river basin these sub basins area ranges from 14 41 to 459 83 km2 fig 1c sb26 sub basin 26 has the minimum area while sb19 sub basin 19 has the maximum area fig 1d the study area is very young in terms of geomorphology settlements are generally located along river valleys and plains which have a very dense population with an impermeable surface in addition harşit river basin is characterized by dense vegetation forest cover and steep slopes up to 85 the study area and its immediate surroundings are generally composed of permeable and semi permeable volcanic rocks which are led to preventing the water to drain into the groundwater for this reason it increases the amount of surface runoff water and is extremely effective in increasing the flow rate of streams üçüncü et al 1994 yüksek et al 2013 according to the giresun meteorology station 38 m located in giresun city center the observed mean annual temperature and total precipitations are 14 5 c and 1270 5 mm respectively the region has a rainy and humid climate in all seasons the highest temperature is around 24 c which was observed in summer and in the period of july and september months sezer 2019 while the lowest temperature was about 7 c and was observed in winter between the months of september and february besides according to the koppen geiger classification the harşit river basin and its surroundings have a humid rainy climate in all seasons and corresponds to c öztürk et al 2017 recently floods have occurred in almost every part of turkey especially in the east black sea region in the mentioned region the sudden and heavy extreme rainfall events led to floods between july june and august these fatal and major flood events have occurred in the eastern black sea region for many years especially in the mentioned study area between the years 1955 2005 in total 51 flood incidents took place as a result of these events 258 people died and an approximate loss of 500 million us dollars occurred yüksek et al 2013 evaluating the recorded flood events of the study area in recent years shows that a flood event occurred on august 22 2020 in the district doğankent and tirebolu of giresun province due to this flood roads houses cars were damaged and remained under the flood which had led to many economic losses following this flood event 19 buildings were destroyed 361 buildings were damaged and 12 people died besides vehicles main roads and streets were also damaged furthermore due to the high speed and depth of the flow during the flood the flood debris was transported to the city center and covered the roads fig 2 2 2 data collection recently with the use of different resolution and sensitivity data that emerged due to the development of remote sensing technologies monitoring and analyzing disasters has been made much easier the 10 m resolution digital elevation model dem data were used in this study which is obtained from 1 25 000 scale topographic maps the 1 25000 scale topographic maps are the most used base maps which are especially used in earth sciences in mining forestry agricultural and archaeological studies in turkey these topographic maps are produced by the general directorate of mapping hgk using different methods and techniques the universal transverse mercator utm projection system is used in the production of this map because of the location of turkey while the horizontal accuracy precision of topographic maps is 5 m the vertical accuracy precision is around 2 5 m hgk 2008 bildirici et al 2008 generally these maps are obtained by analyzing stereo aerial photographs using photogrammetric methods field studies or visual interpretation of aerial photographs are used to correct erroneous or missing details canıberk et al 2015 all data sets were referenced based on the wgs84 37 n zone arcgis pro 2 5 spatial analyst tools were used to determine the basin and sub basins boundaries moreover dem data was the main data set that used in the calculation of the morphometric parameters of the sub basins as mentioned before the 10 m resolution of digital elevation model data was used for the determination of these morphometric parameters of the harşit river basin 2 3 methodology linear areal and relief parameters such as bifurcation ratio rb stream length ratio rl rho coefficient rho length of overland flow lo texture ratio t shape index bs drainage density dd stream frequency fs form factor rf elongation ratio re channel constant maintenance ccm compactness coefficient cc circularity ratio rc basin relief bh relief ratio rh relative relief ratio rr ruggedness number rn melton ruggedness number mrn hypsometric integral hi and gradient ratio rg indices were used in this study table 1 shows the formula of basic morphometric parameters and their explanations in addition to arcgis pro 2 5 software excel and spss soft wares were used for statistical calculations in order to analyze and calculate the parameters of the study prioritization rating of sub basins of the harşit river was performed through ranking the computed morphological parameters sharma et al 2015 farhan et al 2017 malik et al 2019 waiyasusri and chotpantarat 2020 the sub basin with the lowest ranking is given the highest priority in terms of flood potential three different methods were used for priority ranking consist of principal component analysis pca morphometric analysis ma and redvan s priority ranking method rprm separately morphometric analysis is one of the methods used to estimate the prioritization for understanding the flood outputs in the drainage watershed scale memon et al 2020 each basin was evaluated in terms of flood priority depending on the used indices the compound value was calculated by taking the average of the total values in each basin choudhari et al 2018 mundetia et al 2018 the calculated compound value of watersheds was evaluated based on each score finally flood prioritization was determined based on compound values while the low values represent high flood priority the high compound values show low flood priority ranks waiyasusri and chotpantarat 2020 in the pca method the input information is assumed to be an n p matrix n is the number of observations which is defined as the number of sub basins in this research p represents the variables to be analyzed which are the criteria or the morphometric characteristics of the sub basins briefly pca is used to determine the priority of the watershed based on the flood scale farhan et al 2017 redvan s priority ranking method rprm was derived in order to reduce the effect of parameters with the inverse relationship on flood risk and ranking of high risk basins these priority ranks were calculated according to eq 1 1 rprm 1 rep i 1 rrp j rep i a n d rrp j 0 where rrps are the risk reducer parameters and reps are the risk enhancer parameters reps are the parameters in which increasing in the value led to increasing the risk while the rrp parameters decrease the risk with increasing in their values thus the influence of the parameters is also used correctly in risk identification the lowest value of calculated rprm is in the first rank of flood risk while the sub basin with the highest calculated rprm value will be in the last rank the important issue that should be addressed in using the rprm method is that the parameters should not have a zero value also in this method all data needs to be standardized scaled in other words by finding the maximum value of each parameter in all sub basins dividing the value of that parameter belonging to each sub basin by its maximum value thus all parameters will vary between 0 and 1 according to used methods the general flowchart of the study is given in fig 3 3 results and discussion the results obtained from 20 different indices including linear areal and relief morphometric parameters for 26 sub basins of the harşit river basin are given in fig 4 3 1 linear parameters a bifurcation ratio rb based on the method of strahler 1952 it is the ratio of the total number of a particular series in the basin to the total number of the upper series while the probability of flooding is high in basins with high rb values this rate is even lower in basins with low rb rates mahala 2020 rb value in sub basins of the study area varies between 2 80 and 9 19 sub basins 3 and 25 have high rb values of 9 19 and 5 35 respectively and as a result they show high flood potential in other sub basins the flooding possibility is lower compared to these two sub basins b stream length ratio rl it expresses the ratio of the total length of a certain sequence to the total length of the next sequence based on the strahler method a high rl value denotes a high runoff rate and flood probability vittala et al 2004 mishra and rai 2020 in the sub basins of the chosen study area the rl value varies between 1 51 and 2 80 sub basins 3 4 8 and 23 have low rl values equal to 1 51 1 56 1 62 and 1 66 while sub basins 14 20 and 12 have high runoff rates and flood probabilities with rl values of 2 8 2 79 and 2 64 respectively c length of overland flow lo this parameter has a mutual relationship with the drainage densities dd of the sub basins the length of overland flow is effective in revealing the relationship between factors controlling surface erosion depending on the drainage density of the sub basins higher lo values correspond to the presence of a higher steep slope and more surface flow mishra and rai 2020 the sub basin 3 has the highest value of lo equal to 0 13 while other sub basins show quite low values high lo value in sub basin 3 indicates more surface flow and a lower permeability rate d texture ratio t the texture ratio value varies depending on the geological features of the sub basins the permeability of the surface and the aspect of the basin arabameri et al 2020 while the t has a higher value in circular basins it shows lower values in longitudinal basins the texture ratio varies from 3 41 to 21 29 in the sub basins of the selected study area in which the sub basins 22 and 21 are the sub basins with the highest values equal to 21 29 and 19 77 respectively evaluating the texture ratio of other sub basins of the study area shows that sub basins 3 4 and 25 have the lowest values of 3 41 3 55 and 3 67 e rho coefficient rho it refers to the ratio between stream length and bifurcation rho is known as an important index that provides information about the storage or carrying capacity of the drainage network and the development of the drainage network horton 1945 low values of this parameter give information about the storage of water which leads to having a higher flooding potential waiyasusri chotpantarat 2020 minimum and maximum values of the rho parameter are equal to 0 16 and 0 85 in the study sub basins respectively where the sub basins 20 12 and 14 have the highest rho values of 0 85 0 84 and 0 82 on the other hand sub basin 3 has the lowest value for rho in the study area which is equal to 0 16 3 2 areal parameters a drainage density dd a high dd value means high runoff high flood potential and low permeability rate farhan et al 2017 the dd value for the considered sub basins varies between 3 82 and 8 65 from the available data related to the study area sub basin 3 has the lowest value with 3 82 while sub basin 21 has the highest value of 8 65 dd ratio varies between 6 51 and 8 20 in other sub basins which have quite high densities high dd ratio corresponds to high flood potential low permeability rate sparse vegetation and low relief characteristics in the basin b stream frequency fs it depends on features such as basin infiltration capacity relief features runoff vegetation density high fs ratio indicates low permeability ground condition sparse vegetation and high runoff in contrast low fs rate represents high permeability low runoff state rajasekhar et al 2020 in the study area the lowest and highest fs values are 3 19 and 7 45 for sub basins 3 and 8 respectively c form factor rf it expresses whether the shape of the basin is longitudinal or circular horton 1932 rf ratio varies between 0 and 1 whereas 0 represents an elongated basin and 1 indicates a circular basin telore 2020 basins with low rf ratios have lower runoff and low flood peaks while circular basins with higher ratios have high flood peak runoff rai et al 2020 the rf value varies between 0 24 and 0 72 whereas the sub basin 11 with an rf value of 0 24 has a longitudinal basin shape while the sub basins 14 and 9 have an rf value of 0 72 and 0 61 respectively which indicates a more circular shape d shape index b s while relatively young river basins especially in tectonically active areas have a longitudinal geometry river basins that are tectonically more stable have a circular geometry this parameter expresses the ratio of the basin s maximum length to the basin width high and low values of this parameter refer to the longitudinal and the circular basins respectively while the sub basin 14 has a circular geometry with a bs parameter of 1 39 sub basin 26 has a more elongated geometry with the bs parameter value equal to 5 88 sub basin 14 has a circular geometry with 1 39 while sub basin 9 is less circular than sub basin 14 however both of these sub basins are vulnerable to flood potential e elongation ratio re it expresses whether the shape of the basin is longitudinal or oval schumm 1956 the elongation ratio re value ranges from 0 60 to 1 00 where the re value of 0 90 corresponds to circular 0 80 0 90 to oval and 0 70 to less elongated geometry sharma et al 2015 re values of the sub basins vary between 0 56 and 0 96 sub basins with elongated geometry feature high permeability and low runoff on the other hand in circular basins the permeability rate is low and the runoff value is high telore 2020 in this respect a high re value creates high flood peaks sub basin 14 has a circular shape with an elongation ratio of 0 96 sub basins 6 and 9 have oval shapes with elongation ratios of 0 80 and 0 88 respectively the other sub basins of the study area are less elongated f circulatory ratio rc it was defined by melton 1957 climate land use and cover structural lithological and geomorphological features affect the rc value sreedevi et al 2009 kim et al 2011 kudnar and rajasekhar 2020 a high rc value shows high flood peak characteristics and produces short term sudden current values ajibade et al 2010 in the study area the rc varies between 0 13 and 0 40 while the sub basin 26 with the rc value of 0 13 has an elongated structure the sub basin 24 with an rc value of 0 40 has a more circular basin feature and has a more sensitive geometry to floods g constant of channel maintenance ccm the ccm is affected by drainage basin relief climate and lithology properties schumm 1956 high values correspond to low runoff and high permeability ratio on the other hand low values of ccm correspond to high surface runoff and low permeability singh et al 2020 examining the sub basins in the study area shows that the ccm varies between 0 116 and 0 262 sub basin 23 with a ccm value of 0 116 has a high flood potential while sub basin 3 has the highest ccm with the value of 0 262 which shows the low flood potential h compactness coefficient cc it expresses whether the basins are longitudinal or circular the approach of the value to 1 indicates a more circular shape that is more sensitive to flood and the distance from the value 1 indicates a longitudinal basin islam and deb barman 2020 the minimum and the maximum values of this parameter are 1 58 and 2 7 in the sub basins of the study area respectively the sub basin 24 with a cc value equal to 1 58 shows that it has a more circular structure while the sub basin 26 has a more elongated basin shape with a cc value of 2 7 3 3 relief parameters a basin relief bh it expresses the difference between the highest point and the lowest point of the basin increased relief values cause steeper slopes and higher creek bed slopes decrease in flow collection time and consequently increase in flood peak basin relief plays an important role in drainage development in basins surface and groundwater flows permeability development of land surfaces and erosive activities the sub basins 22 18 19 and 26 are the basins with the highest bh values of 2698 5 2333 8 2395 8 and 2468 1 respectively with the possibility of the formation of flood peaks with sudden runoff b relief ratio rh it expresses the ratio of the maximum basin relief to the maximum basin length parallel to the mainstream and is an important index used in determining the flood probability patton and baker 1976 islam and deb barman 2020 the rh ratio changes between 0 05 and 0 29 while sub basins 24 and 15 with the rh ratio of 0 29 and 0 05 have the highest and lowest values of the study area respectively high values indicate high surface flow short lag time high peak currents high erosion and carrying capacity thus high values correspond to high flood potential depending on these features mahala 2020 c relative relief rr it provides information about the basin relief slope and erosion status a high rr value indicates the high rate of steep slopes and high erosion strahler 1957 kaur et al 2014 abdelkarim et al 2020 in the sub basins of this study the rr value varies between 1 17 and 8 09 sub basins 25 24 22 and 2 have the highest rr values of 8 09 7 56 6 73 and 6 42 respectively and as a result these sub basins have a high slope and high relief in addition in these sub basins with high slopes and relief there is a high rate of runoff the lowest values belong to the 15 and 14 sub basins with the rr values of 1 17 and 1 24 respectively d ruggedness number rn it is one of the most important indicators of the flash flood potential of streams and is the ratio of basin relief rate to drainage density rai et al 2018 as the roughness of the drainage basin increases the peak flows increase islam and deb barman 2020 the rn values of the current sub basins change from 6 40 to 22 98 while the basins 22 18 19 and 25 have the highest values of rn with 22 98 17 78 19 13 and 18 74 they have the highest flood peak probability sub basins 4 and 3 with ruggedness number values of 6 40 and 6 65 are the basins with the lowest values in the study area e melton ruggedness number mrn it is the slope index and gives information in terms of the roughness of the basin the high values correspond to high roughness while low values correspond to low relief characteristics and tectonic stability valkanou et al 2020 the mrn values are in the range of 0 20 and 1 45 sub basin 22 corresponds to the highest value with 1 45 which shows high relief and slope characteristics while sub basin 1 has the lowest value of melton ruggedness number equal to 0 20 which corresponds to slope and head relief features f gradient ratio rg it is an index for determining the slope of the channel and is generally used for the evaluation of flow volume sreedevi et al 2005 kumar rai et al 2017 rai et al 2017 rai et al 2018 the rg parameter in the study sub basins varies between 0 07 and 0 29 low values of rg show the characteristics of flat and near flat riverbeds the sub basin 24 with the rg value equal to 0 29 which has a relatively higher value has higher sediment carrying capacity kumar and chaudhary 2016 g hypsometric integral hi it is one of the most important parameters used in explaining the development process of basins high hi values correspond to young river basins while low values refer to maturity basins strahler 1952 bajracharya and jain 2021 the lowest and highest hi values are 0 33 and 0 70 in the study sub basins respectively sub basins 26 and 7 have the highest hi value with 0 70 and 0 66 whereas the sub basin 1 has the lowest hi value equal to 0 33 3 4 descriptive statistic of morphometric parameters table 2 presents the descriptive statistics analysis for mentioned morphometric parameters of all selected sub basins the range minimum maximum standard deviation variance skewness and kurtosis were calculated based on the given table 2 it is obvious that the rho dd fs rc hi and mrn parameters have left skewed distribution while rb rl lo t si rf re ccm cc h rn rh rrr and rg parameters have right skewed distribution with evaluating the kurtosis values of morphometric parameters it is clear that only three parameters including rh rrr and rg have platykurtic distributions it means that the calculated kurtosis values were flat and have thin tails and as a result they have negative kurtosis values the kurtosis values of other morphometric parameters have positive values and it indicates that the distributions for these groups of parameters are peaked and possess thick tails and therefore these parameters are located in the leptokurtic distribution class evaluating variances shows that the data have small values of variance except for t h rn and rrr which indicates that the morphometric data points tend to be close to the calculated means fig 5 shows the whiskers box plots which are prepared for the mentioned parameters 3 5 correlation analysis correlation analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss to determine the relationship of each morphometric parameter with others according to these analyses it was clear that the rg strongly and positively correlated with rh and rrr similarly a high and positive correlation was recorded for ccm and lo the correlation between rrr and rh is 0 98 it was also observed that the parameter mrn has a more strong and positive correlation with h and rn evaluating the given correlogram indicates that the si has a very weak correlation with rb and lo the very weak correlation also was seen between cc and rb rho and fs between rrr and dd rf and si between rc and rb rho and re between hi and rl ccm rb t dd and rf between dd and si between rg and rl lo dd fs rf and ccm in the given correlogram red and blue cells with a value of 1 0 and 1 0 show the positive and negative strongest correlation between two parameters respectively fig 6 3 6 results 3 6 1 results obtained from morphometric analysis principal component analysis and redvan s priority ranking method the selected three methods were applied for the sub basins of the study area using prepared data table 3 a presents the total variance explained of morphometric indices in the pca method from this table it is obvious that only 5 components in the initial solution have eigenvalues higher than 1 these 5 components account for almost 91 5 of the variability in the original variables in the given table 3 a the rotation sums of squared loading section shows the variance explained by the extracted components after rotation the rotated component model makes some adjustments to components 1 2 3 and 4 but by evaluating component 5 in this column it is seen that this component is left virtually unchanged by examining the values of parameters for all the 26 sub basins and according to given equation 1 length of overland flow lo rho coefficient shape index si constant of channel maintenance ccm and compactness coefficient cc are used as the rrp parameters for redvan s priority ranking method rprm for this study as mentioned before in redvan s priority ranking method rprm all data should be standardized standardizing scaling data was done by dividing each parameter by its maximum value of all sub basins therefore all parameters were ranged between 0 and 1 fig 7 shows the standardized data of sub basins after standardization of data a rank was calculated using equation 1 and a priority was determined for each sub basin the values obtained by the used mentioned three different methods were evaluated based on the natural break algorithm technique costache et al 2019 this method realizes the existing values between the maximum and the minimum based on the natural groups in the desired class huan et al 2012 papaioannou et al 2015 stefanidis and stathis 2013 this algorithm which is actively used in flood studies has determined flood priorities in 3 groups as high medium and low in this study to generate the flood priority map using gis the total score values for the 26 sub basins were grouped into three categories for all three methods as table 4 with respect to the 26 sub basins of the harşit river and according to the morphometric priority method and results obtained from this method 8 sub basins have low flood priority 13 basins have medium flood priority and 5 basins have high flood priority by examining the results obtained from the pca priority method and the classification table 7 sub basins have low flood priority 12 sub basins have medium flood priority while 7 sub basins have high flood priority finally according to redvan s priority ranking method and its classification 11 sub basins are located in the low priority class 6 sub basins have medium flood priority the number of sub basins with high priority is 9 according to the rprm method fig 8 presents the priorities obtained from the mentioned three methods these results revealed that different prioritization methods gave almost similar results 3 6 1 1 common sub basins based on the pca morphometry and rprm as the result of the evaluation of the results which is presented in fig 9 it was found that common basins are 8 in low priority 5 in medium priority and 5 in high priority from this figure it can be concluded that sub basins 1 12 15 16 and 17 have a high risk in terms of flooding potential and should be given special attention to taking the necessary measures to reduce possible damages such as equipping these sub basins with early warning systems ews etc in comparison with observed flood events in the studied sub basins which was prepared by the ministry of interior disaster and emergency management presidency of turkey afad and based on the map of field studies presented in fig 10 it is obvious that all used three analysis methods gave the suitable results for sub basins 15 and 1 as sub basins with a high risk of flooding by investigation of sub basins with medium risk of flooding from obtained results it is seen that sub basins 7 10 and 16 are compatible with the sub basins in recorded flood maps however by increasing the number of recorded flood events in the sub basins it will allow for a more accurate comparison for the accuracy of the results 3 6 1 2 evaluation of the results in order to evaluate the effects of the used three methods six indicators were calculated in terms of representing the ability of the methods to identify sub basins with flood risks akay 2021 these parameters were precision p recall or sensitivity tpr f score f specificity tnr accuracy and matthews correlation coefficient mcc which were obtained using eqs 2 7 respectively 2 p tp tp f p 3 tpr tp tp f n 4 f 2 p t p r p r 5 tnr tn tn f p 6 acuuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n 7 mcc t p t n f p f n t p f p t p f n t n f p t n f n where the tp tn fp and fn are the number of true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives respectively the term positive in the mentioned parameters shows the sub basins with high flood risk while the term negative is used for the sub basins with low flood risk the terms true and false are used for presenting the correct and incorrect conditions obtained by the three methods these six indicators were calculated and presented in table 5 from the presented table 5 it is obvious that the accuracy value for the rprm and pca methods is higher than the ma method but as it is known this criterion cannot give an accurate assessment for the accuracy of the results of the used methods so it is necessary that the other calculated parameters be evaluated on the other hand the rprm method has the highest tn value which is equal to 7 sub basins in comparison with the other used methods which shows the correct prediction of sub basins with the low flood risk this method also predicted the lower fp value in rprm in comparison with other methods which shows the number of the sub basins that were incorrectly determined as the high risk of flood category evaluation in the parameter of mcc indicates that the pca and rprm methods have better results than ma with the calculated mcc values equal to 0 21 and 0 17 respectively as it is known this parameter varies between 1 and 1 a value of 1 indicates an accurate prediction and 1 indicates a complete mismatch between methods predictions and observations 4 conclusion in recent years increasing in the frequency and severity of flood events over the world which has increased with global climate change and human influence led to an increase in major economic and social problems in addition it seriously threatens structures and human life in many ways for this reason drainage basin morphometry studies are carried out depending on morphometric indices in order to understand the flood events that are actively worked by many researchers these morphometric indices used in different frameworks depending on the linear areal and relief morphometry of the drainage basins provide important information about the conditions such as relief permeability vegetation density stream frequency etc 26 sub basins greater than the area of 10 km2 were evaluated using 20 different morphometric indices in terms of flood risk priority in particular these morphometric indices allow having an idea in case of understanding of the flood potential by comparing sub basins or mainstream basin morphometry thus by preventing floods or making the necessary land use planning the existing flood potential can be avoided or the hydrodynamic flood modeling of these areas with flood potential should be made and the flood inundation depth and velocity characteristics should be determined in this study three different methods including morphometric priority pca priority and redvan s priority ranking techniques were used for determining the flood potential prioritization in sub basins flood priority of sub basins obtained by using more than one method instead of a single method gives more accurate and highly consistent results a number of positive results were obtained from the evaluation of the results according to different techniques according to these results while the number of sub basins with high flood priority was equal to 5 this value for medium and low priority of sub basins was 5 and 8 respectively the accuracy and validity evaluations of the flood priority of sub basins were validated based on observed and inventory data sets using sensitivity specificity accuracy matthews correlation coefficient based on the obtained results it was seen that pca and rprm methods gave good results while the morphometric analysis gave poor results hence it confirmed that according to statistical calculations pca and rprm techniques gave more acceptable results than the morphometric analysis method in this respect it is of great importance to evaluate the results of flood priorities that will emerge with the use of different methods and techniques with different statistical calculations in terms of the accuracy of the results besides several parameters could be used for the aim of evaluating results its reason is the using of only one parameter in evaluating the obtained results could give incorrect decisions this subject was clear in this study where the correct estimated flooding risk sub basins had equal importance with the correct estimated non flooding sub basins this is what the pca and rprm techniques did although the results of studies and models related to natural disasters such as floods are not certain but according to the results obtained the necessary measures can be taken to prevent the occurrence and reduce possible damages which helps policymakers having a true decision of the feature land use planning therefore the results of this study are of great help in identifying and determining basins with high flood potential declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3989,flood events in the harşit river basin which is located in the eastern black sea region and actively experienced one of the most flood events in turkey were discussed based on drainage basin morphometry using three different methods in this study 26 sub basins over 10 km2 are taken into account and flood dynamics of sub basins are evaluated depending on morphometric properties the results obtained according to the morphometric parameters are evaluated based on statistical techniques and the flood priority is determined a total of 20 different indices were used in this study the obtained morphometry results were evaluated according to the probability of occurrence of floods according to three different methods including morphometric priority flood priority according to principal component analysis method and redvan s priority ranking method each method is evaluated within itself and flood priorities of sub basins have been determined with respect to the 26 sub basins of the harşit river and according to the morphometric priority method and results obtained from this method 8 sub basins have low flood priority 12 basins have medium flood priority and 7 basins have high flood priority by examining the results obtained from the pca priority method 11 sub basins have low flood priority 6 sub basins have medium flood priority while 9 basins have high flood priority finally according to the redvan s priority method and its classification 11 sub basins are located in the low priority class 6 sub basins have medium flood priority according to this method the number of sub basins with high priority is 9 priorities obtained using three different techniques were checked for accuracy with 6 different statistical parameters based on predicted and inventory datasets accordingly the accuracy value for the rprm and pca methods are higher than the ma method on the other hand the rprm method has the highest tn value which is equal to 7 sub basins which shows the correct prediction of sub basins with the low flood risk based on the results it was seen that the obtained values have a high consistency in basin morphometry the rprm which is a new suggested technique in determining basin flood priority shows that common basins give very similar results with the results obtained according to morphometry and pca method sub basins with common flood risk due to outputs of used methods were compared with recorded floods map of turkey keywords principal component analysis method redvan s priority method morphometric priority method flood priorities basin morphometry 1 introduction floods are one of the natural disasters that occur in almost every country around the world affecting people in many economic and social aspects and also causing deaths bathrellos et al 2016 ceos 2003 yüksek et al 2013 the areas where flood events occur in more than 30 of the world also correspond to the areas where 82 of the world s population lives rivers sea coasts flood plains and their surroundings where approximately 2 billion people live are problematic areas on a global scale in terms of flood hazard and risk dilley et al 2005 jonkman 2005 tockner and stanford 2002 zhao and shao 2015 the global climate change hirabayashi et al 2013 and the anthropogenic factors alifujiang et al 2021 are considered to be some of the main reasons for the occurrence of floods hens et al 2018 luu et al 2021 thanh et al 2017 because climate change on a global scale especially changes in precipitation and temperature intensity frequency and pattern causes differences in global and regional scales alifujiang et al 2021 arnell and gosling 2016 besides the rapidly increasing world population and opening flood plains to settlements with wrong engineering practices on river banks destruction of vegetation and forest cover and unplanned land use are among the most important factors in the occurrence of floods aydin and raja 2020 milly et al 2002 tayanç et al 2009 youssef et al 2011 turkey is also one of the countries that experienced the most frequent flood events especially since 1960 bodur 2018 ergünay 2007 koç et al 2020 özcan 2006 zeybek 1998 frequently occurrence and increasing in the number of floods in different regions and periods throughout turkey proves that experienced world climate change occurs in this country zeybek 1998 ergünay 2007 bodur 2018 kömüşçü et al 1998 kotroni et al 2006 kömüşcü and çelik 2013 önol and unal 2014 baltaci 2017 baltacı 2018 aydin and raja 2020 as a result of these climate changes as mentioned before the frequency intensity duration and pattern of precipitation have also changed in turkey significantly which has led to the emergence of climate related disasters kömüşçü et al 1998 kotroni et al 2006 kömüşcü and çelik 2013 önol and unal 2014 baltaci 2017 baltacı 2018 aydin and raja 2020 also the review of natural disasters statistics confirms that following the earthquakes floods cause the most damages and losses which correspond to a rate of 12 2 in total in turkey this accounts for an average of 18 flood events each year yüksek et al 2013 according to a database of the tabb turkey disaster information bank 6069 flood events occurred between 1900 and 2018 as a result of these flood events 62 400 buildings were damaged and 507 buildings were demolished tabb 2018 öcal 2019 not only population rapid growth uncontrolled urbanization plans with the high density population but also geological climate topographical geographical characteristics etc led to an increase in the occurrence of the disaster in turkey in recent years ercüment beyhun et al 2005 özcan 2006 yüksek et al 2013 koç and thieken 2018 kocaman et al 2020 these mentioned factors rise the surface runoff and lead to flood events tahsimcioğlu et al 2006 as a result of turkey s geographical position it is featured as a peninsula in turkey floods mostly occur on the aegean and the black sea coasts mostly in river basins due to heavy rainfall usul and turan 2006 karabulut et al 2007 kundzewicz et al 2010 turgut and turgut 2012 gürer 1996 1998 yüksek et al 2013 in recent years the development of gis geographical information system and rs remote sensing technology has led to the emergence of many methods in order to understand and prevent flood events depending on this development models or statistical methods such as flood hazard and risk studies flood hydraulic and hydrological models drainage basin morphometry based flood susceptibility and priority have emerged to understand flood dynamics archer et al 2018 costache et al 2019 el fakharany and mansour 2021 farhan et al 2017 luu et al 2021 morphometry is the measurement of the world surface quantitatively which helps to understand different aspects such as drainage basin geomorphology mass movements natural hazards erosion development etc pidwirny 2006 mahmood and gloaguen 2012 so it is crucial to solving and understanding the drainage basin characteristics singh and singh 2017 the geomorphometric approach is one of the ways to understanding the hydrological situation or flood potential in the drainage basin which plays crucial roles in terms of using different indices including linear areal and relief morphometry biswas et al 2014 diakakis 2011 many studies are carried out in different main rivers and sub basins to understanding the flooding potential using morphometric analysis thomas and prasannakumar 2015 farhan et al 2017 bhat et al 2019 abdeta et al 2020 utlu and ghasemlonia 2020 for instance patel et al 2015 focused on determining the water harvesting structure by reaching the best and most suitable result by morphometric analysis in 13 sub basins in the hatmati basin el tahan and elhanafy 2016 also used morphometric analysis for the purpose of determining morphometric and hydrologic situation of the wadi hadramut drainage basin using statistical methods and principal component analysis pca abdelkarim et al 2020 focused on specifying the flood hazard of the drainage basin area using morphometric indices that calculated the degree of hazard for each basin based on the geomorphological ranking model gunjan et al 2020 used the morphometric analysis in the nine sub basins of the mahanadi river basin which was prioritized based on linear areal and relief parameters they classified the erosion stage of each basin as high medium and low classes the major aim of the current study is to on the morphometric characterization of the harşit river basin which is one of the most humid and rainy regions in turkey in this respect the probability of flooding will be evaluated as a result of determining the morphometric properties of sub basins joining the mainstream in the harşit river basins therefore sub basins will be specified and morphometric properties will be calculated in terms of linear relief and areal morphometry thence the flood characteristics of each sub basin will be determined according to the morphometric features calculated in linear relief and areal aspects 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the harşit river basin located in the east black sea region and includes giresun and gümüşhane provinces of turkey is prone to mostly flood özcan 2006 fig 1 a the total drainage basin area of the harşit river basin covers 3308 82 km2 and is characterized by high hilly topography by the elevation ranges from 0 m to 3331 76 m from sea level in the east black sea mountains fig 1b this basin extends from the south to the north and its water drains into the black sea there are 26 sub basins with an area of more than 10 km2 on the harşit river basin these sub basins area ranges from 14 41 to 459 83 km2 fig 1c sb26 sub basin 26 has the minimum area while sb19 sub basin 19 has the maximum area fig 1d the study area is very young in terms of geomorphology settlements are generally located along river valleys and plains which have a very dense population with an impermeable surface in addition harşit river basin is characterized by dense vegetation forest cover and steep slopes up to 85 the study area and its immediate surroundings are generally composed of permeable and semi permeable volcanic rocks which are led to preventing the water to drain into the groundwater for this reason it increases the amount of surface runoff water and is extremely effective in increasing the flow rate of streams üçüncü et al 1994 yüksek et al 2013 according to the giresun meteorology station 38 m located in giresun city center the observed mean annual temperature and total precipitations are 14 5 c and 1270 5 mm respectively the region has a rainy and humid climate in all seasons the highest temperature is around 24 c which was observed in summer and in the period of july and september months sezer 2019 while the lowest temperature was about 7 c and was observed in winter between the months of september and february besides according to the koppen geiger classification the harşit river basin and its surroundings have a humid rainy climate in all seasons and corresponds to c öztürk et al 2017 recently floods have occurred in almost every part of turkey especially in the east black sea region in the mentioned region the sudden and heavy extreme rainfall events led to floods between july june and august these fatal and major flood events have occurred in the eastern black sea region for many years especially in the mentioned study area between the years 1955 2005 in total 51 flood incidents took place as a result of these events 258 people died and an approximate loss of 500 million us dollars occurred yüksek et al 2013 evaluating the recorded flood events of the study area in recent years shows that a flood event occurred on august 22 2020 in the district doğankent and tirebolu of giresun province due to this flood roads houses cars were damaged and remained under the flood which had led to many economic losses following this flood event 19 buildings were destroyed 361 buildings were damaged and 12 people died besides vehicles main roads and streets were also damaged furthermore due to the high speed and depth of the flow during the flood the flood debris was transported to the city center and covered the roads fig 2 2 2 data collection recently with the use of different resolution and sensitivity data that emerged due to the development of remote sensing technologies monitoring and analyzing disasters has been made much easier the 10 m resolution digital elevation model dem data were used in this study which is obtained from 1 25 000 scale topographic maps the 1 25000 scale topographic maps are the most used base maps which are especially used in earth sciences in mining forestry agricultural and archaeological studies in turkey these topographic maps are produced by the general directorate of mapping hgk using different methods and techniques the universal transverse mercator utm projection system is used in the production of this map because of the location of turkey while the horizontal accuracy precision of topographic maps is 5 m the vertical accuracy precision is around 2 5 m hgk 2008 bildirici et al 2008 generally these maps are obtained by analyzing stereo aerial photographs using photogrammetric methods field studies or visual interpretation of aerial photographs are used to correct erroneous or missing details canıberk et al 2015 all data sets were referenced based on the wgs84 37 n zone arcgis pro 2 5 spatial analyst tools were used to determine the basin and sub basins boundaries moreover dem data was the main data set that used in the calculation of the morphometric parameters of the sub basins as mentioned before the 10 m resolution of digital elevation model data was used for the determination of these morphometric parameters of the harşit river basin 2 3 methodology linear areal and relief parameters such as bifurcation ratio rb stream length ratio rl rho coefficient rho length of overland flow lo texture ratio t shape index bs drainage density dd stream frequency fs form factor rf elongation ratio re channel constant maintenance ccm compactness coefficient cc circularity ratio rc basin relief bh relief ratio rh relative relief ratio rr ruggedness number rn melton ruggedness number mrn hypsometric integral hi and gradient ratio rg indices were used in this study table 1 shows the formula of basic morphometric parameters and their explanations in addition to arcgis pro 2 5 software excel and spss soft wares were used for statistical calculations in order to analyze and calculate the parameters of the study prioritization rating of sub basins of the harşit river was performed through ranking the computed morphological parameters sharma et al 2015 farhan et al 2017 malik et al 2019 waiyasusri and chotpantarat 2020 the sub basin with the lowest ranking is given the highest priority in terms of flood potential three different methods were used for priority ranking consist of principal component analysis pca morphometric analysis ma and redvan s priority ranking method rprm separately morphometric analysis is one of the methods used to estimate the prioritization for understanding the flood outputs in the drainage watershed scale memon et al 2020 each basin was evaluated in terms of flood priority depending on the used indices the compound value was calculated by taking the average of the total values in each basin choudhari et al 2018 mundetia et al 2018 the calculated compound value of watersheds was evaluated based on each score finally flood prioritization was determined based on compound values while the low values represent high flood priority the high compound values show low flood priority ranks waiyasusri and chotpantarat 2020 in the pca method the input information is assumed to be an n p matrix n is the number of observations which is defined as the number of sub basins in this research p represents the variables to be analyzed which are the criteria or the morphometric characteristics of the sub basins briefly pca is used to determine the priority of the watershed based on the flood scale farhan et al 2017 redvan s priority ranking method rprm was derived in order to reduce the effect of parameters with the inverse relationship on flood risk and ranking of high risk basins these priority ranks were calculated according to eq 1 1 rprm 1 rep i 1 rrp j rep i a n d rrp j 0 where rrps are the risk reducer parameters and reps are the risk enhancer parameters reps are the parameters in which increasing in the value led to increasing the risk while the rrp parameters decrease the risk with increasing in their values thus the influence of the parameters is also used correctly in risk identification the lowest value of calculated rprm is in the first rank of flood risk while the sub basin with the highest calculated rprm value will be in the last rank the important issue that should be addressed in using the rprm method is that the parameters should not have a zero value also in this method all data needs to be standardized scaled in other words by finding the maximum value of each parameter in all sub basins dividing the value of that parameter belonging to each sub basin by its maximum value thus all parameters will vary between 0 and 1 according to used methods the general flowchart of the study is given in fig 3 3 results and discussion the results obtained from 20 different indices including linear areal and relief morphometric parameters for 26 sub basins of the harşit river basin are given in fig 4 3 1 linear parameters a bifurcation ratio rb based on the method of strahler 1952 it is the ratio of the total number of a particular series in the basin to the total number of the upper series while the probability of flooding is high in basins with high rb values this rate is even lower in basins with low rb rates mahala 2020 rb value in sub basins of the study area varies between 2 80 and 9 19 sub basins 3 and 25 have high rb values of 9 19 and 5 35 respectively and as a result they show high flood potential in other sub basins the flooding possibility is lower compared to these two sub basins b stream length ratio rl it expresses the ratio of the total length of a certain sequence to the total length of the next sequence based on the strahler method a high rl value denotes a high runoff rate and flood probability vittala et al 2004 mishra and rai 2020 in the sub basins of the chosen study area the rl value varies between 1 51 and 2 80 sub basins 3 4 8 and 23 have low rl values equal to 1 51 1 56 1 62 and 1 66 while sub basins 14 20 and 12 have high runoff rates and flood probabilities with rl values of 2 8 2 79 and 2 64 respectively c length of overland flow lo this parameter has a mutual relationship with the drainage densities dd of the sub basins the length of overland flow is effective in revealing the relationship between factors controlling surface erosion depending on the drainage density of the sub basins higher lo values correspond to the presence of a higher steep slope and more surface flow mishra and rai 2020 the sub basin 3 has the highest value of lo equal to 0 13 while other sub basins show quite low values high lo value in sub basin 3 indicates more surface flow and a lower permeability rate d texture ratio t the texture ratio value varies depending on the geological features of the sub basins the permeability of the surface and the aspect of the basin arabameri et al 2020 while the t has a higher value in circular basins it shows lower values in longitudinal basins the texture ratio varies from 3 41 to 21 29 in the sub basins of the selected study area in which the sub basins 22 and 21 are the sub basins with the highest values equal to 21 29 and 19 77 respectively evaluating the texture ratio of other sub basins of the study area shows that sub basins 3 4 and 25 have the lowest values of 3 41 3 55 and 3 67 e rho coefficient rho it refers to the ratio between stream length and bifurcation rho is known as an important index that provides information about the storage or carrying capacity of the drainage network and the development of the drainage network horton 1945 low values of this parameter give information about the storage of water which leads to having a higher flooding potential waiyasusri chotpantarat 2020 minimum and maximum values of the rho parameter are equal to 0 16 and 0 85 in the study sub basins respectively where the sub basins 20 12 and 14 have the highest rho values of 0 85 0 84 and 0 82 on the other hand sub basin 3 has the lowest value for rho in the study area which is equal to 0 16 3 2 areal parameters a drainage density dd a high dd value means high runoff high flood potential and low permeability rate farhan et al 2017 the dd value for the considered sub basins varies between 3 82 and 8 65 from the available data related to the study area sub basin 3 has the lowest value with 3 82 while sub basin 21 has the highest value of 8 65 dd ratio varies between 6 51 and 8 20 in other sub basins which have quite high densities high dd ratio corresponds to high flood potential low permeability rate sparse vegetation and low relief characteristics in the basin b stream frequency fs it depends on features such as basin infiltration capacity relief features runoff vegetation density high fs ratio indicates low permeability ground condition sparse vegetation and high runoff in contrast low fs rate represents high permeability low runoff state rajasekhar et al 2020 in the study area the lowest and highest fs values are 3 19 and 7 45 for sub basins 3 and 8 respectively c form factor rf it expresses whether the shape of the basin is longitudinal or circular horton 1932 rf ratio varies between 0 and 1 whereas 0 represents an elongated basin and 1 indicates a circular basin telore 2020 basins with low rf ratios have lower runoff and low flood peaks while circular basins with higher ratios have high flood peak runoff rai et al 2020 the rf value varies between 0 24 and 0 72 whereas the sub basin 11 with an rf value of 0 24 has a longitudinal basin shape while the sub basins 14 and 9 have an rf value of 0 72 and 0 61 respectively which indicates a more circular shape d shape index b s while relatively young river basins especially in tectonically active areas have a longitudinal geometry river basins that are tectonically more stable have a circular geometry this parameter expresses the ratio of the basin s maximum length to the basin width high and low values of this parameter refer to the longitudinal and the circular basins respectively while the sub basin 14 has a circular geometry with a bs parameter of 1 39 sub basin 26 has a more elongated geometry with the bs parameter value equal to 5 88 sub basin 14 has a circular geometry with 1 39 while sub basin 9 is less circular than sub basin 14 however both of these sub basins are vulnerable to flood potential e elongation ratio re it expresses whether the shape of the basin is longitudinal or oval schumm 1956 the elongation ratio re value ranges from 0 60 to 1 00 where the re value of 0 90 corresponds to circular 0 80 0 90 to oval and 0 70 to less elongated geometry sharma et al 2015 re values of the sub basins vary between 0 56 and 0 96 sub basins with elongated geometry feature high permeability and low runoff on the other hand in circular basins the permeability rate is low and the runoff value is high telore 2020 in this respect a high re value creates high flood peaks sub basin 14 has a circular shape with an elongation ratio of 0 96 sub basins 6 and 9 have oval shapes with elongation ratios of 0 80 and 0 88 respectively the other sub basins of the study area are less elongated f circulatory ratio rc it was defined by melton 1957 climate land use and cover structural lithological and geomorphological features affect the rc value sreedevi et al 2009 kim et al 2011 kudnar and rajasekhar 2020 a high rc value shows high flood peak characteristics and produces short term sudden current values ajibade et al 2010 in the study area the rc varies between 0 13 and 0 40 while the sub basin 26 with the rc value of 0 13 has an elongated structure the sub basin 24 with an rc value of 0 40 has a more circular basin feature and has a more sensitive geometry to floods g constant of channel maintenance ccm the ccm is affected by drainage basin relief climate and lithology properties schumm 1956 high values correspond to low runoff and high permeability ratio on the other hand low values of ccm correspond to high surface runoff and low permeability singh et al 2020 examining the sub basins in the study area shows that the ccm varies between 0 116 and 0 262 sub basin 23 with a ccm value of 0 116 has a high flood potential while sub basin 3 has the highest ccm with the value of 0 262 which shows the low flood potential h compactness coefficient cc it expresses whether the basins are longitudinal or circular the approach of the value to 1 indicates a more circular shape that is more sensitive to flood and the distance from the value 1 indicates a longitudinal basin islam and deb barman 2020 the minimum and the maximum values of this parameter are 1 58 and 2 7 in the sub basins of the study area respectively the sub basin 24 with a cc value equal to 1 58 shows that it has a more circular structure while the sub basin 26 has a more elongated basin shape with a cc value of 2 7 3 3 relief parameters a basin relief bh it expresses the difference between the highest point and the lowest point of the basin increased relief values cause steeper slopes and higher creek bed slopes decrease in flow collection time and consequently increase in flood peak basin relief plays an important role in drainage development in basins surface and groundwater flows permeability development of land surfaces and erosive activities the sub basins 22 18 19 and 26 are the basins with the highest bh values of 2698 5 2333 8 2395 8 and 2468 1 respectively with the possibility of the formation of flood peaks with sudden runoff b relief ratio rh it expresses the ratio of the maximum basin relief to the maximum basin length parallel to the mainstream and is an important index used in determining the flood probability patton and baker 1976 islam and deb barman 2020 the rh ratio changes between 0 05 and 0 29 while sub basins 24 and 15 with the rh ratio of 0 29 and 0 05 have the highest and lowest values of the study area respectively high values indicate high surface flow short lag time high peak currents high erosion and carrying capacity thus high values correspond to high flood potential depending on these features mahala 2020 c relative relief rr it provides information about the basin relief slope and erosion status a high rr value indicates the high rate of steep slopes and high erosion strahler 1957 kaur et al 2014 abdelkarim et al 2020 in the sub basins of this study the rr value varies between 1 17 and 8 09 sub basins 25 24 22 and 2 have the highest rr values of 8 09 7 56 6 73 and 6 42 respectively and as a result these sub basins have a high slope and high relief in addition in these sub basins with high slopes and relief there is a high rate of runoff the lowest values belong to the 15 and 14 sub basins with the rr values of 1 17 and 1 24 respectively d ruggedness number rn it is one of the most important indicators of the flash flood potential of streams and is the ratio of basin relief rate to drainage density rai et al 2018 as the roughness of the drainage basin increases the peak flows increase islam and deb barman 2020 the rn values of the current sub basins change from 6 40 to 22 98 while the basins 22 18 19 and 25 have the highest values of rn with 22 98 17 78 19 13 and 18 74 they have the highest flood peak probability sub basins 4 and 3 with ruggedness number values of 6 40 and 6 65 are the basins with the lowest values in the study area e melton ruggedness number mrn it is the slope index and gives information in terms of the roughness of the basin the high values correspond to high roughness while low values correspond to low relief characteristics and tectonic stability valkanou et al 2020 the mrn values are in the range of 0 20 and 1 45 sub basin 22 corresponds to the highest value with 1 45 which shows high relief and slope characteristics while sub basin 1 has the lowest value of melton ruggedness number equal to 0 20 which corresponds to slope and head relief features f gradient ratio rg it is an index for determining the slope of the channel and is generally used for the evaluation of flow volume sreedevi et al 2005 kumar rai et al 2017 rai et al 2017 rai et al 2018 the rg parameter in the study sub basins varies between 0 07 and 0 29 low values of rg show the characteristics of flat and near flat riverbeds the sub basin 24 with the rg value equal to 0 29 which has a relatively higher value has higher sediment carrying capacity kumar and chaudhary 2016 g hypsometric integral hi it is one of the most important parameters used in explaining the development process of basins high hi values correspond to young river basins while low values refer to maturity basins strahler 1952 bajracharya and jain 2021 the lowest and highest hi values are 0 33 and 0 70 in the study sub basins respectively sub basins 26 and 7 have the highest hi value with 0 70 and 0 66 whereas the sub basin 1 has the lowest hi value equal to 0 33 3 4 descriptive statistic of morphometric parameters table 2 presents the descriptive statistics analysis for mentioned morphometric parameters of all selected sub basins the range minimum maximum standard deviation variance skewness and kurtosis were calculated based on the given table 2 it is obvious that the rho dd fs rc hi and mrn parameters have left skewed distribution while rb rl lo t si rf re ccm cc h rn rh rrr and rg parameters have right skewed distribution with evaluating the kurtosis values of morphometric parameters it is clear that only three parameters including rh rrr and rg have platykurtic distributions it means that the calculated kurtosis values were flat and have thin tails and as a result they have negative kurtosis values the kurtosis values of other morphometric parameters have positive values and it indicates that the distributions for these groups of parameters are peaked and possess thick tails and therefore these parameters are located in the leptokurtic distribution class evaluating variances shows that the data have small values of variance except for t h rn and rrr which indicates that the morphometric data points tend to be close to the calculated means fig 5 shows the whiskers box plots which are prepared for the mentioned parameters 3 5 correlation analysis correlation analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss to determine the relationship of each morphometric parameter with others according to these analyses it was clear that the rg strongly and positively correlated with rh and rrr similarly a high and positive correlation was recorded for ccm and lo the correlation between rrr and rh is 0 98 it was also observed that the parameter mrn has a more strong and positive correlation with h and rn evaluating the given correlogram indicates that the si has a very weak correlation with rb and lo the very weak correlation also was seen between cc and rb rho and fs between rrr and dd rf and si between rc and rb rho and re between hi and rl ccm rb t dd and rf between dd and si between rg and rl lo dd fs rf and ccm in the given correlogram red and blue cells with a value of 1 0 and 1 0 show the positive and negative strongest correlation between two parameters respectively fig 6 3 6 results 3 6 1 results obtained from morphometric analysis principal component analysis and redvan s priority ranking method the selected three methods were applied for the sub basins of the study area using prepared data table 3 a presents the total variance explained of morphometric indices in the pca method from this table it is obvious that only 5 components in the initial solution have eigenvalues higher than 1 these 5 components account for almost 91 5 of the variability in the original variables in the given table 3 a the rotation sums of squared loading section shows the variance explained by the extracted components after rotation the rotated component model makes some adjustments to components 1 2 3 and 4 but by evaluating component 5 in this column it is seen that this component is left virtually unchanged by examining the values of parameters for all the 26 sub basins and according to given equation 1 length of overland flow lo rho coefficient shape index si constant of channel maintenance ccm and compactness coefficient cc are used as the rrp parameters for redvan s priority ranking method rprm for this study as mentioned before in redvan s priority ranking method rprm all data should be standardized standardizing scaling data was done by dividing each parameter by its maximum value of all sub basins therefore all parameters were ranged between 0 and 1 fig 7 shows the standardized data of sub basins after standardization of data a rank was calculated using equation 1 and a priority was determined for each sub basin the values obtained by the used mentioned three different methods were evaluated based on the natural break algorithm technique costache et al 2019 this method realizes the existing values between the maximum and the minimum based on the natural groups in the desired class huan et al 2012 papaioannou et al 2015 stefanidis and stathis 2013 this algorithm which is actively used in flood studies has determined flood priorities in 3 groups as high medium and low in this study to generate the flood priority map using gis the total score values for the 26 sub basins were grouped into three categories for all three methods as table 4 with respect to the 26 sub basins of the harşit river and according to the morphometric priority method and results obtained from this method 8 sub basins have low flood priority 13 basins have medium flood priority and 5 basins have high flood priority by examining the results obtained from the pca priority method and the classification table 7 sub basins have low flood priority 12 sub basins have medium flood priority while 7 sub basins have high flood priority finally according to redvan s priority ranking method and its classification 11 sub basins are located in the low priority class 6 sub basins have medium flood priority the number of sub basins with high priority is 9 according to the rprm method fig 8 presents the priorities obtained from the mentioned three methods these results revealed that different prioritization methods gave almost similar results 3 6 1 1 common sub basins based on the pca morphometry and rprm as the result of the evaluation of the results which is presented in fig 9 it was found that common basins are 8 in low priority 5 in medium priority and 5 in high priority from this figure it can be concluded that sub basins 1 12 15 16 and 17 have a high risk in terms of flooding potential and should be given special attention to taking the necessary measures to reduce possible damages such as equipping these sub basins with early warning systems ews etc in comparison with observed flood events in the studied sub basins which was prepared by the ministry of interior disaster and emergency management presidency of turkey afad and based on the map of field studies presented in fig 10 it is obvious that all used three analysis methods gave the suitable results for sub basins 15 and 1 as sub basins with a high risk of flooding by investigation of sub basins with medium risk of flooding from obtained results it is seen that sub basins 7 10 and 16 are compatible with the sub basins in recorded flood maps however by increasing the number of recorded flood events in the sub basins it will allow for a more accurate comparison for the accuracy of the results 3 6 1 2 evaluation of the results in order to evaluate the effects of the used three methods six indicators were calculated in terms of representing the ability of the methods to identify sub basins with flood risks akay 2021 these parameters were precision p recall or sensitivity tpr f score f specificity tnr accuracy and matthews correlation coefficient mcc which were obtained using eqs 2 7 respectively 2 p tp tp f p 3 tpr tp tp f n 4 f 2 p t p r p r 5 tnr tn tn f p 6 acuuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n 7 mcc t p t n f p f n t p f p t p f n t n f p t n f n where the tp tn fp and fn are the number of true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives respectively the term positive in the mentioned parameters shows the sub basins with high flood risk while the term negative is used for the sub basins with low flood risk the terms true and false are used for presenting the correct and incorrect conditions obtained by the three methods these six indicators were calculated and presented in table 5 from the presented table 5 it is obvious that the accuracy value for the rprm and pca methods is higher than the ma method but as it is known this criterion cannot give an accurate assessment for the accuracy of the results of the used methods so it is necessary that the other calculated parameters be evaluated on the other hand the rprm method has the highest tn value which is equal to 7 sub basins in comparison with the other used methods which shows the correct prediction of sub basins with the low flood risk this method also predicted the lower fp value in rprm in comparison with other methods which shows the number of the sub basins that were incorrectly determined as the high risk of flood category evaluation in the parameter of mcc indicates that the pca and rprm methods have better results than ma with the calculated mcc values equal to 0 21 and 0 17 respectively as it is known this parameter varies between 1 and 1 a value of 1 indicates an accurate prediction and 1 indicates a complete mismatch between methods predictions and observations 4 conclusion in recent years increasing in the frequency and severity of flood events over the world which has increased with global climate change and human influence led to an increase in major economic and social problems in addition it seriously threatens structures and human life in many ways for this reason drainage basin morphometry studies are carried out depending on morphometric indices in order to understand the flood events that are actively worked by many researchers these morphometric indices used in different frameworks depending on the linear areal and relief morphometry of the drainage basins provide important information about the conditions such as relief permeability vegetation density stream frequency etc 26 sub basins greater than the area of 10 km2 were evaluated using 20 different morphometric indices in terms of flood risk priority in particular these morphometric indices allow having an idea in case of understanding of the flood potential by comparing sub basins or mainstream basin morphometry thus by preventing floods or making the necessary land use planning the existing flood potential can be avoided or the hydrodynamic flood modeling of these areas with flood potential should be made and the flood inundation depth and velocity characteristics should be determined in this study three different methods including morphometric priority pca priority and redvan s priority ranking techniques were used for determining the flood potential prioritization in sub basins flood priority of sub basins obtained by using more than one method instead of a single method gives more accurate and highly consistent results a number of positive results were obtained from the evaluation of the results according to different techniques according to these results while the number of sub basins with high flood priority was equal to 5 this value for medium and low priority of sub basins was 5 and 8 respectively the accuracy and validity evaluations of the flood priority of sub basins were validated based on observed and inventory data sets using sensitivity specificity accuracy matthews correlation coefficient based on the obtained results it was seen that pca and rprm methods gave good results while the morphometric analysis gave poor results hence it confirmed that according to statistical calculations pca and rprm techniques gave more acceptable results than the morphometric analysis method in this respect it is of great importance to evaluate the results of flood priorities that will emerge with the use of different methods and techniques with different statistical calculations in terms of the accuracy of the results besides several parameters could be used for the aim of evaluating results its reason is the using of only one parameter in evaluating the obtained results could give incorrect decisions this subject was clear in this study where the correct estimated flooding risk sub basins had equal importance with the correct estimated non flooding sub basins this is what the pca and rprm techniques did although the results of studies and models related to natural disasters such as floods are not certain but according to the results obtained the necessary measures can be taken to prevent the occurrence and reduce possible damages which helps policymakers having a true decision of the feature land use planning therefore the results of this study are of great help in identifying and determining basins with high flood potential declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
