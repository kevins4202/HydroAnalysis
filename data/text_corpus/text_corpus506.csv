2530,intensive agriculture industrial activities as well as natural processes result in pollution in river water and groundwater however how riverbank groundwater responds to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river remains unclear in this study the surface water and riparian groundwater quality at the laonanguan lng and hongqierzha hqez stations of the gusong river china were jointly investigated via hydrochemical monitoring and water quality analyses and the main pollution sources i e anthropogenic activities and mineral weathering were identified by principal component analysis pca the absolute principal component score multiple linear regression apcs mlr revealed that anthropogenic inputs only accounted for 11 4 of the total pollution sources for riparian groundwater which was much lower than that for river water 24 8 the riverbank hence acted as the primary sink for the components e g nh4 n and tp from non point pollution and could degrade 13 7 of the pollutants from the river water caused by anthropogenic input conversely riverbank played a source role for the species e g so4 2 and cl from mineral weathering and contributed additional 19 3 for the groundwater based on river water input eventually the combination of physical based numerical model i e using an advection dispersion filtration transport equation and data driven model was proposed to directly simulate and predict groundwater quality in response to the variation of river water quality the results showed that both models could predict the status of riparian groundwater quality and the physical based model could better interpret the results compared to the data driven black box model this study promotes our understanding of the importance of riverbank in improving groundwater quality in the areas with intensive agriculture practices and riverbank restoration strategies should be carefully designed to maximize their potential to degrade non point pollutions

request 1 introduction rivers are the primary sources of freshwater for domestic use industrial production and agricultural irrigation nhiwatiwa et al 2017 stets et al 2018 nowadays the deterioration of river water and groundwater quality because of anthropogenic activities has become an issue of global concern burri et al 2019 liao et al 2018 the china s state of ecology and environment report in 2020 states that surface water quality is being improved with the implementation of effective control measures but more efforts are needed to improve groundwater quality ecology and china 2021 therefore it is essential to evaluate both river water and groundwater quality in order to develop better measures for water resources management giri 2021 the water quality index wqi provides a single dimensionless number to express the overall water quality at a specific location or time nong et al 2020 wu et al 2018 and it is derived from a number of water quality parameters e g ph and temperature measured at monitoring campaigns varol 2020 xiao et al 2019 although this index has been widely used to evaluate the quality of surface water misaghi et al 2017 ustaoğlu et al 2020 and groundwater liu et al 2003 mohebbi et al 2013 that are two interconnected components of a river system little is known about the use of wqi in the study of the relationship between river water and groundwater quality furthermore a minimum wqi wqimin model driven by datasets is vital in light of simplification efficiency and economy in surface water quality assessment based on key environmental parameters especially in developing countries pesce 2000 sun et al 2016 however the use of a data driven model i e wqimin model to describe the surface groundwater quality interactions in the riverbank remains to be elucidated there is also lack of physical based model to predict the wqi interactions between river and riparian groundwater the riverbank connecting surface water and groundwater ecosystems plays a crucial role in improving groundwater quality masse dufresne et al 2021 munz et al 2019 bank filtration systems benefit from the capacity of the aquifer to attenuate pollutants through a series of biogeochemical and adsorption processes but the rates are strongly influenced by hydrological connectivity hu et al 2016 there is ample evidence demonstrating the transport and removal of pollutants from river water meng et al 2020 trauth et al 2018 however how the infiltration of surface water into the aquifer alters the geochemical conditions biehler et al 2020 and the response of riverbank to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river remains unclear in this work the hydrological and water quality data on the river aquifer interfaces at the laonanguan lng and hongqierzha hqez stations of the gusong river china fig 1 were collected and the spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater quality possible pollution sources and its apportionment were determined by multiple statistical methods including pca ca and apcs mlr the wqimin and physical based models were put forward to predict groundwater quality variations therefore this study aims to elucidate the water quality and interactions between river water and groundwater we will pay attention to i the spatial and temporal distribution of river water and groundwater quality as well as their responses to hydrologic conditions ii possible pollution sources and source apportionment iii the responses of riverbank to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river water and iv the performance of data driven and physical model established for river water and groundwater quality interactions this study enhances our understanding of the interactions between river and riparian groundwater quality under complex hydrological conditions and provides a practical model to predict the groundwater quality in responses to different pollution sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the gusong river is located in shangqiu city in the eastern part of henan province china with a total length of 73 2 km and a drainage area of approximately 412 km2 fig 1a the area is characterized by a warm temperate monsoon climate and the annual average temperature varies between 13 9 c and 14 3 c the rainfall is uneven between wet and dry seasons and the average annual rainfall is 723 2 mm 67 2 of which occurs in the wet season the gusong river is a typical dam type river and it is severely polluted because of the urban sewage from the suiyang district upstream of the laonanguan lng section fig 1 water samples were collected at the laonanguan lng 115 61 e 34 36 n and hongqierzha hqez 115 60 e 34 33 n sections fig 1a the overlying vegetation at the study site was removed and the land surface was covered with bare soil the sediment samples collected in the riparian zone were mainly composed of sand and silt the water flowed from the river to the aquifer in the two study sites as the water table of the river was higher than the groundwater during the sampling period figure s1 2 2 monitoring collection and measurement of water samples 2 2 1 monitoring methods rainfall was monitored at hourly intervals at a meteorological station in the suiyang district shangqiu city river stage was manually measured once a day at 8 00 am at the downstream of lng and hqez and an additional measurement was made before each water sampling field observations were conducted at 5 groundwater wells l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 at lng h1 h2 h3 h4 and h5 at hqez located 4 9 15 0 61 0 93 3 and 114 6 m away from the river fig 1b each well was equipped with a 152 mm hand auger and five 75 mm polyvinyl chloride pvc standpipes installed in the borehole at a depth of 14 2 14 1 10 5 13 9 and 13 5 m below the ground surface respectively wells were screened 50 cm over the bottom by drilling a total of 15 holes with a diameter of 0 5 mm and wrapped with 0 15 mm mesh nylon for groundwater percolation the bottom of pvc pipes was sealed with a lid to collect groundwater 2 2 2 collection of water samples groundwater table was measured at the five wells once a week on wednesday using water level loggers and more measurements would be made in case of heavy rainfall and flood river water and groundwater were collected 15 times one or two times per month from july to november of 2019 groundwater was collected from the piezometers using a peristaltic pump with a low flow rate 0 5 0 7 l min 1 river water was also collected using the peristaltic pump for consistency with groundwater sampling to ensure the collection of fresh groundwater the stagnant water in the piezometer was removed by a peristaltic pump prior to sampling well water was slowly pumped into an enclosed sample cup to minimize exposure to the atmosphere a total of 10 groundwater samples were collected each time at each site 2 2 3 measurements and analyses of water chemistry about 750 water samples were collected from the river and each groundwater well during the sampling period fourteen physiochemical parameters ph th so4 2 cl fe mn zn no3 n no2 n nh4 n tp codmn f and as in river water and groundwater were measured all analyses were performed in accredited laboratories on a monthly basis following the instructions outlined in the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and waste water hj t 91 2002 published by the ministry of ecology and environment of china statistical analyses text s1 including water quality index wqi principal component analysis pca correlation analysis ca and absolute principal component score multiple linear regression apcs mlr were conducted to investigate i the spatial and seasonal variation of water quality and ii possible pollution sources and source apportionment after that a simplified data driven and numerical model was proposed to directly simulate and predict groundwater quality in response to the river water quality variations using an advection dispersion filtration transport equation 2 3 data driven and physical based models 2 3 1 data driven model the wqi value indicates the general water quality status by integrating numerous physical chemical and biological parameters of the water varol 2020 it is widely used to characterize the availability of water resources for drinking and domestic purposes in this study wqi is calculated following the suggestion of debels et al 2005 1 wqi i 1 n c i w i i 1 n w i where ci is the standardized score of water quality factor i wi is the weight of water quality factor i which is assigned between 1 and 4 depending on its effect on water quality and its importance for aquatic life preservation debels et al 2005 pesce 2000 fourteen parameters ph th so4 2 cl fe mn zn no3 n no2 n nh4 n tp codmn f and as are included in the calculation of wqi in this study table s1 to evaluate the quality of river water and groundwater of the gusong river more conveniently and economically the data driven model was constructed by using a few critical parameters selected by principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis ca both non weighted wqimin nw and weighted wqimin w are considered the wqimin w model considering the weights of selected parameters and the wqimin nw model without considering the weights of selected parameters are calculated according to formula 1 and formula 2 respectively 2 wq i min i 1 n c i n where n is the total number of water quality parameters and ci is the standardized score of water quality factor i according to the wqi score the water quality can be divided into 5 levels excellent 90 100 good 70 90 medium 50 70 poor 25 50 very poor 0 25 2 3 2 groundwater flow model to study the transport characteristics of water quality in the riverbank a simplified 2d physically based model was developed based on the riverbank vertical profile from the floodplain to the middle of the river channel surveyed with a total station at the lng and hqez site figure s2 the model domain was a vertical cross section of 135 m wide and 30 5 m deep through the floodplain between the half river channel left and the hi section right figure s2 the vertical conceptual model considered a two layered clogging layer and sand sediment homogeneous aquifer partially penetrating river sloping bank unsaturated zone and clogging layer that covered the entire river aquifer interface a two dimensional variably saturated model was developed by using comsol multiphysics to simulate water exchange across the riverbank by solving the two dimensional richard s equation jiang et al 2022 3 ρ c m ρ g s e s p t ρ k s μ k r p ρ g z 0 where p mt 2l 1 is

saturated hydraulic permeability k r is the relative permeability μ ml 1 t 1 is the fluid dynamic viscosity and z l is the elevation head the soil hydraulic properties were described by the equations of van genuchten 1980 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 5 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 6 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 where θ is the water content θ s is the saturated water content θ r is

are schematically shown in figure s2 a time variable boundary condition with a variable hydraulic head was applied to the water flow at fg and hi to indicate the temporal hydrological conditions of river and groundwater a no flow boundary condition was applied at ef and ei the upper atmospheric boundary gh accounted for evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge a no flow boundary condition was applied to the water influx from rainfall as a variable hydraulic head of groundwater triggered by rainfall recharge was assumed at hi 2 3 3 water quality transport model for transport by advection dispersion and the filtration of the riverbank in a constant density fluid the concentration satisfies 7 θ c t d c q c θ k 1 c where k 1 t 1 is the decay constant θ is the water content and d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor which can be calculated following previous study jiang et al 2022 to describe the water quality interactions between the river water and groundwater we assumed that the water quality as reflected by the wqi value text s1 1 also fulfill the advection dispersion transport since the wqi value is inversely proportional to the concentration table s1 we use the new index wqi 100 wqi to keep consistent with the concentration transport in eq 7 for a given mass of water with a mean water quality wqi can be assumed to be characterized by its water quality mass the product of the mean water quality and the water mass wqi ρ v where ρ is water density and v is unit water volume replacing the concentration c by the water quality mass a governing equation for water quality transport can be derived 8 θ ρ w q i t d ρ w q i q ρ w q i θ k 1 ρ w q i for water quality transport a time variable boundary condition of river water and groundwater quality was applied at fg and hi and a no flux boundary condition was applied at ef ei and gh figure s2 the following assumptions were made i a two dimensional model ii simplified geometry without considering microtopography iii isotropic and homogeneous aquifer and clogging layer and iv same unsaturated parameters for the entire model domain 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and seasonal variation of water quality the wqi based on hydrochemical monitoring table s1 was used to evaluate the river water and groundwater quality at the lng and hqez sections of the gusong river fig 2 the wqi values of river water were in the range of 46 63 at the lng section and 47 62 at the hqez section suggesting poor to medium water quality fig 2a this also implied that the water quality between lng and hqez located approximately 5 km apart was not profoundly changed and the wqi seemed to be spatially homogeneous along the flow direction during the sampling period the wqi values of groundwater were also assessed at the two sections fig 2a at lng the wqi values of the five wells l1 to l5 varied from 56 to 73 indicating medium to good water quality fig 2a however considerable differences were observed among the five wells for example the wqi values ranged from 56 to 62 medium water quality in l4 but from 70 to 73 good water quality in l2 located 100 m apart fig 1b at hqez the mean wqi values of the five wells ranged from 61 7 to 65 7 indicating medium water quality fig 2 the highest wqi value was observed in l1 71 9 at lng and h1 65 7 at hqez both of which were closest to the river fig 1b in summary the spatial distribution of groundwater quality was more complex and heterogeneous than that of surface water which was attributed to the sediment heterogeneity and the complex biogeochemical processes in sediments the quality of groundwater at lng and hqez was better than that of river water fig 2a indicating that riverbank played an important role in the transfer and degradation of pollutants and acted as a net sink of pollutants from the river however it remained unclear which components were degraded the influence of hydrological conditions on river water and groundwater quality was evaluated fig 2b overall the surface water quality at both lng and hqez was improved in august and september as evident by the wqi values in the wet and dry seasons fig 2b the high frequency of rainfall events in august and september led to an increase in river discharge and stage as a result the advection and diffusion were enhanced which favored the dilution of major pollutants in river water the improvement of water quality due to rainfall was more evident at lng at the downstream than that at hqez at the upstream in contrast the groundwater quality responded differently to hydrological conditions and it was slightly better at lng in the wet season l1 to l5 and worse at hqez h1 to h5 in fig 2b 3 2 possible pollution sources and source apportionment 3 2 1 main factors and possible pollution sources of surface water and groundwater although the groundwater quality was improved compared with the surface water the response of riverbank to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river should be further identified in order to identify key elements responsible for river water quality and their origins pca text s1 1 was performed to reduce the dataset to several principal components fig 3 tables s2 and s3 the kmo value for river water was 0 64 and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test was close to 0 indicating that the dataset was suitable for pca four principal components pcs were extracted from the 14 variables by combining the sampling datasets at lng and hqez fig 3a the factors in fig 3 were classified as strong moderate and weak loadings based on their absolute values of 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 respectively liu et al 2003 wang et al 2017 the first component pcw1 in river water accounted for 38 9 of the total variance and had strong positive loadings of so4 2 0 93 th 0 84 and cl 0 75 fig 3a table s2 so4 2 and cl are associated with the ionic groups of dissolved salts alberto et al 2001 liu et al 2003 varol and şen 2009 varol 2020 the total hardness th of water is dependent on the concentrations of major elements especially ca and mg which are related to the dissolution of soil constituents such as calcium carbonates varol and şen 2009 the highest so4 2 cl and th levels in river water were recorded 192 mg l 1 173 mg l 1 and 352 mg l 1 at lng the 1st row in fig 4 this was in line with china s surface water environmental quality standards standardization administration of china 2017 which stated that the concentration of cl so4 2 and th should be 250 250 and 450 mg l 1 respectively the orange dashed line in fig 4 the results of pcw1 in river water indicated that multiple processes including saline soil silicate and carbonate weathering were the dominant sources of these ions fadel et al 2021 ustaoğlu et al 2020 varol 2020 alberto et al 2001 they were eventually transported through surface runoff in the gusong river though the first component pcw1 in river water had a strong negative loading of as 0 86 the results also showed that it has a strong correlations with the positive loading of so4 2 cl and th figure s3 to avoid the repeated effects between the positive and negative loadings induced by the dissolution of soil constituents we only considered the positive loadings and neglected the positive loadings of pcw1 when as was considered as the main component of pcw1 the conclusion that the dissolution and weathering of soil constituents was the main pollution sources that attributed to pcw1 was still valid previous studies have suggested that the as present in water bodies was generally originated from the recent deposition of as bearing sediments fendorf et al 2010 wallis et al 2020 the reductive dissolution of as bearing iron oxides has been widely accepted as the main cause of as contamination stahl et al 2016 the key elements responsible for groundwater quality at hqez and lng were also identified following the same method fig 3b tables s3 the kmo value was 0 78 and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test was close to 0 indicating the dataset was suitable for pca three pcs were extracted pcg1 and pcg2 together accounted for 72 of the total variance and pcg3 accounted for 6 5 of the total variance fig 3b the first component pcg1 accounted for 50 2 of the total variance and had strong positive loadings of f 0 94 cl 0 91 and fe 0 90 all of which were important components of calcite and chlorite and represented major cations and anions resulting from mineral weathering e g fluorite dissolution similar pcs pcw1 and pcg1 were extracted for surface water and groundwater indicating that they had similar pollution sources the concentration of cl so4 2 and th in groundwater was much higher than that in river water fig 4 and a significant portion of them could be derived from river water because of frequent hyporheic exchange gao et al 2020 hu et al 2013 the elements involved in pcw1 and pcg1 were weakly degraded by riverbank filtration it should be noted that the levels of f in groundwater at hqez exceeded the permissible limit of 1 5 mg l 1 and easy accessibility of circulating water to the weathered products during irrigation dissolved and leached the minerals including fluorine contributing f to the groundwater the pcw2 of river water explained 24 9 of the total variance with strong positive loadings of nh4 n 0 87 tp 0 84 and codmn 0 78 fig 3a nh4 n and tp were found to be important parameters characterizing river phytoplankton dynamics and eutrophication matzinger et al 2007 york et al 2007 codmn reflected the degree of organic pollution in water which could be produced by the photosynthesis of planktonic algae wu et al 2021 these factors represented the contribution of nutrient and organic matter inputs from untreated domestic sewage and agricultural runoff the concentrations of nh4 n tp and codmn in river water exceeded the class v standard for drinking water in china the 2nd row in fig 4 both lng and hqez sections were polluted by non point sources as evident from the mean values of the same elements the 2nd row in fig 4 the second component pcg2 explained 21 9 of the total variance with high loadings of nh4 n 0 80 zn 0 72 and codmn 0 63 in the groundwater which represented anthropogenic inputs such as industry effluent and non point pollution similar pollution sources were identified for surface water and groundwater by comparing pcw2 and pcg2 however the concentration of nh4 n tp and codmn in groundwater was much lower than that in river water fig 4 and a significant portion of them could be removed through riverbank filtration the comparison of the two main components between river water pcw1 pcw2 and groundwater pcg1 and pcg2 revealed that the pollutants in surface water could be transported into river bank through different porewater flow paths and the riverbank acted either as a source or as a sink depending on the pollution sources from the river water for instance it acted as a main source of cl and so4 2 from mineral weathering but as a main sink of nh4 n and codmn from non point pollution the pcw3 and pcw4 of river water explained 9 and 8 of the total variance with a strong positive loading of zn 0 75 and a moderate loading of ph 0 55 respectively table s2 the pcg3 of groundwater explained 6 5 of the total variance with a moderate positive loading of tp 0 54 although zn is an essential trace element for life it is highly toxic at concentrations above the limit ma et al 2016 the concentration of zn is controlled by natural and anthropogenic inputs zeng and han 2020 anthropogenic activities such as sewage discharge and exhaust emissions play an important role in the variation of heavy metal concentrations micó et al 2006 the ph values of surface water were all 8 0 indicating that the water in the gusong river remained alkaline throughout the monitoring period the ph could affect the survival of organisms and thus played a vital role in modifying the chemical and biological processes sun et al 2016 3 2 2 source apportionment for river water and groundwater the number of possible pollution sources was identified by pca and the contribution of each source was apportioned to the variables of river and groundwater quality by apcs mlr method fig 5 which was described in text s1 2 in detail the apcs mlr results for river water and groundwater were shown in tables s4 and s5 respectively the accuracy of apcs mlr modeling was assessed by the r 2 values in this study the r 2 values were in the range of 0 61 0 93 for river water and 0 45 0 97 for groundwater indicating certain accuracy and credibility of apcs mlr modeling according to the pca results fig 3a the pcw1 indicated that multiple processes including saline soil silicate and carbonate weathering occurred in the surface water the pcw1 accounted for 58 1 of pollution sources fig 5a and was related to soil constituents and the contribution rate on so4 2 th and cl was 81 2 88 8 and 50 1 respectively the pcg1 of groundwater accounted for 77 4 of pollution sources fig 5b and was related to weathering fig 3b and the contribution rate on cl fe and f was 50 8 44 7 and 38 5 respectively the contribution difference between pcw1 and pcg1 implied that riverbank could contribute additional 19 3 pollutants derived from weathering the pcw2 24 8 of pollution sources fig 5a indicated the nutrients from non point and organic matter inputs and the contribution rate on tp nh4 n and codmn was 81 5 72 7 and 59 4 respectively the pcg2 of groundwater 11 4 of total pollution sources fig 5b was related to anthropogenic inputs such as industry effluent and non point pollution fig 3b and table s3 and the contribution rate was much lower than that of pcw2 specifically the contribution rate of pcg2 on nh4 n zn and codmn was 73 7 62 8 and 73 1 respectively the contribution difference between pcw2 and pcg2 which were calculated by the apcs mlr method text s1 2 implied that riverbank could degrade 13 7 pollutants from the river water caused by anthropogenic inputs 3 3 combined data driven and physically based models 3 3 1 the wqimin model for surface water and groundwater the calculation of wqi described in section 3 1 involves 14 physical and chemical parameters table s1 these inter correlated variables allow the model to explain a larger proportion of variance but also makes the model less robust therefore it is necessary to screen key variables that can explain most of the variance in the water quality data for subsequent calculation of wqi the wqimin value was also calculated for river water and groundwater in order to develop a simple and cost effective approach for evaluation of water quality with as few parameters as possible based on the pca results of river water in table s2 the so4 2 th and cl in pcw1 were considered as important indicators of water quality and so4 2 contributed more significantly to the variation of wqi fig 3a however the strongest positive correlation 0 9 could be observed between so4 2 th and cl which suggested that th and cl had a significant effect on the measurement of so4 2 figure s3 thus the inclusion of these two variables in the calculation of wqimin would lead to over or under estimation of wqi for this reason th and cl were not considered in the calculation of wqimin the tp and nh4 n were found to be the main contributors to non point pollution of river water as shown in section 3 2 the presence of tp and nh4 n indicated the potential eutrophic risk of the river water and thus had an impact on aquatic life and human health matzinger et al 2007 york et al 2007 the nh4 n was highly correlated 0 9 with tp figure s3 and thus either nh4 n or tp was selected to represent agricultural pollution zn was introduced into the wqimin model to indicate the potential effect of heavy metals on water quality and human health zeng and han 2020 because zn represented the industry effluent in pcw3 and was weakly correlated with so4 2 and tp figure s3 the effects of anthropogenic activities on the spatial and temporal patterns of ph and f could be easily determined the dynamic variation of ph could affect the survival of organisms present in the river and consequently the chemical and biological processes thus both ph and f were selected overall the variables to be determined experimentally included ph so4 2 tp zn and f ph could be easily detected in situ at the sampling site the pca results showed that the selected environmental variables were taken into account and thus could be used to calculate wqimin the stepwise linear regression results table s6 which were taken from the results of pca and ca showed that tp made the largest contribution to wqi r 2 0 59 p 0 05 the zn and f entered the model in sequence and f markedly increased the r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean percentage error mape values of the model r 2 0 91 rmse 2 91 mape 7 61 therefore so4 2 tp zn and f model 4 fig 7 were selected as the parameters of the wqimin model to assess the surface water quality of the gusong river table s6 figure s4 as described in sections 3 2 1 nh4 n tp and codmn were identified as the main contributors to non point pollution of river water however sensitive analysis showed that the inclusion of nh4 n model 5 reduced the predictive ability and accuracy of the model although the pcw2 explained 24 9 of the total variance with the highest loading of nh4 n table s2 similar results were found for codmn model 6 table 1 this was one main reason for the selection of tp as the critical parameter of pcw2 in the wqimin model in section 3 3 1 the effect of ph models 7 and 8 fig 6 was also evaluated table 1 the addition of ph into model 4 marginally decreased the rsme and mape values but had no significant impact on the r 2 value table 1 therefore the best wqimin model proposed in this study consisted of 5 river water quality parameters including ph so4 2 tp zn and f model 8 these parameters could adequately describe the quality of river water and allow for effective evaluation of water quality with low measurement cost the inclusion of cl model 9 led to a slight increase in the r 2 value but a significant decrease in the mape and rsme values table 1 three key parameters nh4 n f ph were also selected to test the applicability of the wqimin model to groundwater and the regression results for the wqimin and wqi models were shown in table 2 the wqimin model was less applicable to groundwater at lng l1 l5 and hqez h1 h5 than surface water as evident in table 2 and fig 7 model 3 and model 2 worked better than model 1 with the same dataset the problems of overestimation and underestimation were encountered in all models intuitively the predicted value was higher than the centerline when the wqi was low but lower than the centerline when the wqi was high in fig 7 the wqi values predicted using model 3 were in good agreement with the measurements but the wqimin wqi plot for groundwater was quite different from that for surface water fig 7 specifically a give wqimin nw value in fig 7 often corresponded to numerous wqi values the wqi values for groundwater were distributed in a very narrow range making it difficult to find a suitable wqimin model to replace the wqi model as expected no significant difference in groundwater conditions was found due to the short distance between adjacent sampling wells at each site and the small spatial scale of the two sites another important cause was that all water quality indicators were normalized table s1 and the difference of measured concentration could not be well represented in the wqimin wqi plot the wqimin models considering weights wqimin w and not considering weights wqimin nw were also compared to determine the effects of weights based on the results using the same key parameters tables 1 2 text s2 and figure s5 3 3 2 the physically based model 3 3 2 1 model calibration of hydrological monitoring as described in sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 the proposed physical model considered the riparian groundwater flow and water quality the model was sequentially calibrated against measurements water stage and water quality in l1 l4 and h1 h4 collected from july to november in 2019 the stage of river water and groundwater well l5 h5 at lng and hqez were used as the left and right input for the riverbank figure s2 the initial hydraulic head distribution in the riverbank was obtained by solving the steady state richard s equation under the losing conditions jiang et al 2022 to estimate the improvement of the fit between modeled and observed hydraulic head the regression coefficient r 2 nash sutcliffe index ns and root mean square error rmse were calculated at each calibration run the parameters shown in table s7 were modified the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer k1 and clogging layer k2 were based on the measured data whereas the vg model parameters s α and n were based on the measured data of clay and sand from the soil types the sequential calibration using groundwater flow model led to a slight overestimation of the hydraulic head at lng and an underestimation at hqez this was because the same parameters were used for different geological conditions at lng and hqez similar results about the uncertainties of groundwater flow model have been reported in previous studies siergieiev et al 2015 these results indicated that the input hydraulic parameters were appropriate for the simulation of riparian groundwater flow under the losing conditions i e river water stage always higher than groundwater the r 2 ns and rmse for the best fit flow model at lng were 0 77 0 82 and 0 11 m and the model accuracy was slightly improved at hqez using the same parameters with the r 2 ns and rmse being 0 77 0 82 and 0 11 m respectively fig 8 3 3 2 2 calibration of water quality model the physical behavior of the groundwater quality transport was coupled with the groundwater flow and the calculated wqi for the sampling wells at lng and hqez were also simulated fig 9 as the range of wqi values in section 3 1 indicated the water quality status this model was intended to rapidly forecast the groundwater quality status when the surface water quality was known rather than the wqi values in detail the water quality as a result of all the components contributed from agriculture industrial activities and natural processes followed the advection dispersion filtration patterns in the riverbank the model results in fig 9 showed a good agreement between predicted and measured values orange frame in fig 9a it was slightly more accurate in the middle groundwater wells gw l2 l3 gw h2 h3 in comparison to close l1 h1 and faraway riverbank l4 h4 by applying reasonable simplifications the proposed water quality transport model with an input of hydrograph and river wqi enabled us not only to disentangle the interactions between groundwater flow and riverbank morphologies but also to predict riparian groundwater quality status previous studies have proposed single liu et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 and multiple species transport model knabe et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 i e advection and dispersion equation to predict the fate of specific biochemical components within the riverbank the physically based model in this study further indicated that the wqi concept integrated with multiple biochemical parameters followed the same physical pattern with the single species therefore the proposed model could be used to directly predict the groundwater quality status resulting from the components carried by a considerable number of pollution sources in river 3 4 implications for surface water and groundwater quality management and limitations water quality assessment is important for pollution control and water resources management however the use of wqi for assessment of groundwater mohebbi et al 2013 wu et al 2020a and surface water akkoyunlu and akiner 2012 nong et al 2020 separately may provide limited insights into the overall water quality of the river to our knowledge this is one of the first studies to investigate the surface water and groundwater interactions in the riverbank system by integrating hydrochemical monitoring water quality analyses data driven and physically based models the river water and groundwater in hydrologic continuity within a river corridor interact in a complex and dynamic domain i e hyporheic zone which has a great impact on the quality of the two water bodies through a series of physical and geochemical processes zachara et al 2016 our study reveals that the riverbank responds differently to different pollutant sources from natural weathering and anthropogenic input it acts as the primary sink for the components e g nh4 n and tp from non point pollution and could degrade 13 7 of the pollutants from the river water therefore this enhancement has implications for agriculturally impacted river with excess nitrate and tp loadings lemke et al 2011 mian et al 2010 in contrast the role of riverbank in promoting water quality can be ignored for the river dominated by the chemical weathering wu et al 2020b zhu et al 2012 the results provide some insights into the assessment of water quality and local management agencies this study combines the data driven and physically based modeling to predict the riparian groundwater quality the data driven model based on pca and ca methods is firstly applied to the groundwater and the model results show a good agreement with the measurement trend this provides a useful and low cost means i e selected key parameters which represent the groundwater quality for periodic monitoring of groundwater additionally a physics based model is introduced to capture the response mechanisms between river water and groundwater quality in this model the distribution of groundwater quality could be described by the solute transport equation the proposed model allows general simulation of riparian groundwater quality without solute specific geochemical modeling by incorporating the physical effects of advection dispersion and bank filtration on water quality these methods can be incorporated easily in existing models of transport in aquifer however this study has focused only on the overall evaluation of river water and groundwater quality of the gusong river to better understand their spatial and temporal trends more compounds should be monitored for a longer period of time under different land use and hydrogeological conditions on a catchment in addition some important physicochemical parameters such ascod do toc and total nitrogen are not considered in this study due to unavailability of equipment these parameters may provide important and further insights into the relationship between groundwater and surface water quality and the responses of riverbank to different pollutants from the river 4 conclusions the surface water and groundwater of a river system are interconnected with frequent hyporheic exchange and the evaluation of either surface water or groundwater quality provides limited insights into the overall water quality of the system in this study the surface water and groundwater quality at the lng and hqez sections of the gusong river was jointly evaluated via hydrochemical measurements the main conclusions can be summarized as follows different response patterns were found between river water groundwater quality and hydrologic conditions the river water quality at both lng and hqez was improved in the wet season in which there was a higher frequency of rainfall events however the groundwater quality in the riverbank responded irregularly to hydrological variation which was attributed to the complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions at the sediment mineral weathering and anthropogenic activities were identified as the main pollution sources for surface water and groundwater however anthropogenic inputs only accounted for 11 4 of the total pollution sources for groundwater which was much lower than that for river water 24 8 riverbank responded differently to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river it acted as the main sink of components e g nh4 n and tp from non point pollution leading to the degradation of 13 7 pollutants from the river water caused by anthropogenic input however it contributed additional 19 3 pollutants derived from weathering the proposed wqimin model consisting of 3 key parameters nh4 n f ph could provide reasonable qualitative agreement with the measurements for riparian groundwater although its application was poorer than surface water which involved 5 key parameters the physically based model was also developed to directly simulate the riparian groundwater quality by incorporating the physical effects of advection dispersion and bank filtration these methods can be incorporated easily in existing models of transport in aquifer it is believed that useful knowledge could be gained for the sustainable development of the huaihe river basin particularly for the integration of water pollution control and water resources management however the aim of this study is to determine how riverbank responds to different pollution sources rather than the water quality evaluating the generality of the results of this study requires further studies in catchments of contrasting climate geology and land use in order to test and better characterize the general performance of the proposed data physically driven model intensive monitoring and large hydrochemical datasets are required

2530,intensive agriculture industrial activities as well as natural processes result in pollution in river water and groundwater however how riverbank groundwater responds to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river remains unclear in this study the surface water and riparian groundwater quality at the laonanguan lng and hongqierzha hqez stations of the gusong river china were jointly investigated via hydrochemical monitoring and water quality analyses and the main pollution sources i e anthropogenic activities and mineral weathering were identified by principal component analysis pca the absolute principal component score multiple linear regression apcs mlr revealed that anthropogenic inputs only accounted for 11 4 of the total pollution sources for riparian groundwater which was much lower than that for river water 24 8 the riverbank hence acted as the primary sink for the components e g nh4 n and tp from non point pollution and could degrade 13 7 of the pollutants from the river water caused by anthropogenic input conversely riverbank played a source role for the species e g so4 2 and cl from mineral weathering and contributed additional 19 3 for the groundwater based on river water input eventually the combination of physical based numerical model i e using an advection dispersion filtration transport equation and data driven model was proposed to directly simulate and predict groundwater quality in response to the variation of river water quality the results showed that both models could predict the status of riparian groundwater quality and the physical based model could better interpret the results compared to the data driven black box model this study promotes our understanding of the importance of riverbank in improving groundwater quality in the areas with intensive agriculture practices and riverbank restoration strategies should be carefully designed to maximize their potential to degrade non point pollutions

request 1 introduction rivers are the primary sources of freshwater for domestic use industrial production and agricultural irrigation nhiwatiwa et al 2017 stets et al 2018 nowadays the deterioration of river water and groundwater quality because of anthropogenic activities has become an issue of global concern burri et al 2019 liao et al 2018 the china s state of ecology and environment report in 2020 states that surface water quality is being improved with the implementation of effective control measures but more efforts are needed to improve groundwater quality ecology and china 2021 therefore it is essential to evaluate both river water and groundwater quality in order to develop better measures for water resources management giri 2021 the water quality index wqi provides a single dimensionless number to express the overall water quality at a specific location or time nong et al 2020 wu et al 2018 and it is derived from a number of water quality parameters e g ph and temperature measured at monitoring campaigns varol 2020 xiao et al 2019 although this index has been widely used to evaluate the quality of surface water misaghi et al 2017 ustaoğlu et al 2020 and groundwater liu et al 2003 mohebbi et al 2013 that are two interconnected components of a river system little is known about the use of wqi in the study of the relationship between river water and groundwater quality furthermore a minimum wqi wqimin model driven by datasets is vital in light of simplification efficiency and economy in surface water quality assessment based on key environmental parameters especially in developing countries pesce 2000 sun et al 2016 however the use of a data driven model i e wqimin model to describe the surface groundwater quality interactions in the riverbank remains to be elucidated there is also lack of physical based model to predict the wqi interactions between river and riparian groundwater the riverbank connecting surface water and groundwater ecosystems plays a crucial role in improving groundwater quality masse dufresne et al 2021 munz et al 2019 bank filtration systems benefit from the capacity of the aquifer to attenuate pollutants through a series of biogeochemical and adsorption processes but the rates are strongly influenced by hydrological connectivity hu et al 2016 there is ample evidence demonstrating the transport and removal of pollutants from river water meng et al 2020 trauth et al 2018 however how the infiltration of surface water into the aquifer alters the geochemical conditions biehler et al 2020 and the response of riverbank to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river remains unclear in this work the hydrological and water quality data on the river aquifer interfaces at the laonanguan lng and hongqierzha hqez stations of the gusong river china fig 1 were collected and the spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater quality possible pollution sources and its apportionment were determined by multiple statistical methods including pca ca and apcs mlr the wqimin and physical based models were put forward to predict groundwater quality variations therefore this study aims to elucidate the water quality and interactions between river water and groundwater we will pay attention to i the spatial and temporal distribution of river water and groundwater quality as well as their responses to hydrologic conditions ii possible pollution sources and source apportionment iii the responses of riverbank to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river water and iv the performance of data driven and physical model established for river water and groundwater quality interactions this study enhances our understanding of the interactions between river and riparian groundwater quality under complex hydrological conditions and provides a practical model to predict the groundwater quality in responses to different pollution sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the gusong river is located in shangqiu city in the eastern part of henan province china with a total length of 73 2 km and a drainage area of approximately 412 km2 fig 1a the area is characterized by a warm temperate monsoon climate and the annual average temperature varies between 13 9 c and 14 3 c the rainfall is uneven between wet and dry seasons and the average annual rainfall is 723 2 mm 67 2 of which occurs in the wet season the gusong river is a typical dam type river and it is severely polluted because of the urban sewage from the suiyang district upstream of the laonanguan lng section fig 1 water samples were collected at the laonanguan lng 115 61 e 34 36 n and hongqierzha hqez 115 60 e 34 33 n sections fig 1a the overlying vegetation at the study site was removed and the land surface was covered with bare soil the sediment samples collected in the riparian zone were mainly composed of sand and silt the water flowed from the river to the aquifer in the two study sites as the water table of the river was higher than the groundwater during the sampling period figure s1 2 2 monitoring collection and measurement of water samples 2 2 1 monitoring methods rainfall was monitored at hourly intervals at a meteorological station in the suiyang district shangqiu city river stage was manually measured once a day at 8 00 am at the downstream of lng and hqez and an additional measurement was made before each water sampling field observations were conducted at 5 groundwater wells l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 at lng h1 h2 h3 h4 and h5 at hqez located 4 9 15 0 61 0 93 3 and 114 6 m away from the river fig 1b each well was equipped with a 152 mm hand auger and five 75 mm polyvinyl chloride pvc standpipes installed in the borehole at a depth of 14 2 14 1 10 5 13 9 and 13 5 m below the ground surface respectively wells were screened 50 cm over the bottom by drilling a total of 15 holes with a diameter of 0 5 mm and wrapped with 0 15 mm mesh nylon for groundwater percolation the bottom of pvc pipes was sealed with a lid to collect groundwater 2 2 2 collection of water samples groundwater table was measured at the five wells once a week on wednesday using water level loggers and more measurements would be made in case of heavy rainfall and flood river water and groundwater were collected 15 times one or two times per month from july to november of 2019 groundwater was collected from the piezometers using a peristaltic pump with a low flow rate 0 5 0 7 l min 1 river water was also collected using the peristaltic pump for consistency with groundwater sampling to ensure the collection of fresh groundwater the stagnant water in the piezometer was removed by a peristaltic pump prior to sampling well water was slowly pumped into an enclosed sample cup to minimize exposure to the atmosphere a total of 10 groundwater samples were collected each time at each site 2 2 3 measurements and analyses of water chemistry about 750 water samples were collected from the river and each groundwater well during the sampling period fourteen physiochemical parameters ph th so4 2 cl fe mn zn no3 n no2 n nh4 n tp codmn f and as in river water and groundwater were measured all analyses were performed in accredited laboratories on a monthly basis following the instructions outlined in the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and waste water hj t 91 2002 published by the ministry of ecology and environment of china statistical analyses text s1 including water quality index wqi principal component analysis pca correlation analysis ca and absolute principal component score multiple linear regression apcs mlr were conducted to investigate i the spatial and seasonal variation of water quality and ii possible pollution sources and source apportionment after that a simplified data driven and numerical model was proposed to directly simulate and predict groundwater quality in response to the river water quality variations using an advection dispersion filtration transport equation 2 3 data driven and physical based models 2 3 1 data driven model the wqi value indicates the general water quality status by integrating numerous physical chemical and biological parameters of the water varol 2020 it is widely used to characterize the availability of water resources for drinking and domestic purposes in this study wqi is calculated following the suggestion of debels et al 2005 1 wqi i 1 n c i w i i 1 n w i where ci is the standardized score of water quality factor i wi is the weight of water quality factor i which is assigned between 1 and 4 depending on its effect on water quality and its importance for aquatic life preservation debels et al 2005 pesce 2000 fourteen parameters ph th so4 2 cl fe mn zn no3 n no2 n nh4 n tp codmn f and as are included in the calculation of wqi in this study table s1 to evaluate the quality of river water and groundwater of the gusong river more conveniently and economically the data driven model was constructed by using a few critical parameters selected by principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis ca both non weighted wqimin nw and weighted wqimin w are considered the wqimin w model considering the weights of selected parameters and the wqimin nw model without considering the weights of selected parameters are calculated according to formula 1 and formula 2 respectively 2 wq i min i 1 n c i n where n is the total number of water quality parameters and ci is the standardized score of water quality factor i according to the wqi score the water quality can be divided into 5 levels excellent 90 100 good 70 90 medium 50 70 poor 25 50 very poor 0 25 2 3 2 groundwater flow model to study the transport characteristics of water quality in the riverbank a simplified 2d physically based model was developed based on the riverbank vertical profile from the floodplain to the middle of the river channel surveyed with a total station at the lng and hqez site figure s2 the model domain was a vertical cross section of 135 m wide and 30 5 m deep through the floodplain between the half river channel left and the hi section right figure s2 the vertical conceptual model considered a two layered clogging layer and sand sediment homogeneous aquifer partially penetrating river sloping bank unsaturated zone and clogging layer that covered the entire river aquifer interface a two dimensional variably saturated model was developed by using comsol multiphysics to simulate water exchange across the riverbank by solving the two dimensional richard s equation jiang et al 2022 3 ρ c m ρ g s e s p t ρ k s μ k r p ρ g z 0 where p mt 2l 1 is the pressure ρ ml 3 is the fluid density cm l 1 is the specific moisture capacity g lt 2 is the acceleration of gravity s e is the effective saturation s is the storage coefficient k s l2 is the saturated hydraulic permeability k r is the relative permeability μ ml 1 t 1 is the fluid dynamic viscosity and z l is the elevation head the soil hydraulic properties were described by the equations of van genuchten 1980 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 5 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 6 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 where θ is the water content θ s is the saturated water content θ r is the residual water content k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and α n and m are fitting parameters note that m is a function of n i e m 1 1 n the soil domain and its boundary conditions are schematically shown in figure s2 a time variable boundary condition with a variable hydraulic head was applied to the water flow at fg and hi to indicate the temporal hydrological conditions of river and groundwater a no flow boundary condition was applied at ef and ei the upper atmospheric boundary gh accounted for evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge a no flow boundary condition was applied to the water influx from rainfall as a variable hydraulic head of groundwater triggered by rainfall recharge was assumed at hi 2 3 3 water quality transport model for transport by advection dispersion and the filtration of the riverbank in a constant density fluid the concentration satisfies 7 θ c t d c q c θ k 1 c where k 1 t 1 is the decay constant θ is the water content and d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor which can be calculated following previous study jiang et al 2022 to describe the water quality interactions between the river water and groundwater we assumed that the water quality as reflected by the wqi value text s1 1 also fulfill the advection dispersion transport since the wqi value is inversely proportional to the concentration table s1 we use the new index wqi 100 wqi to keep consistent with the concentration transport in eq 7 for a given mass of water with a mean water quality wqi can be assumed to be characterized by its water quality mass the product of the mean water quality and the water mass wqi ρ v where ρ is water density and v is unit water volume replacing the concentration c by the water quality mass a governing equation for water quality transport can be derived 8 θ ρ w q i t d ρ w q i q ρ w q i θ k 1 ρ w q i for water quality transport a time variable boundary condition of river water and groundwater quality was applied at fg and hi and a no flux boundary condition was applied at ef ei and gh figure s2 the following assumptions were made i a two dimensional model ii simplified geometry without considering microtopography iii isotropic and homogeneous aquifer and clogging layer and iv same unsaturated parameters for the entire model domain 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and seasonal variation of water quality the wqi based on hydrochemical monitoring table s1 was used to evaluate the river water and groundwater quality at the lng and hqez sections of the gusong river fig 2 the wqi values of river water were in the range of 46 63 at the lng section and 47 62 at the hqez section suggesting poor to medium water quality fig 2a this also implied that the water quality between lng and hqez located approximately 5 km apart was not profoundly changed and the wqi seemed to be spatially homogeneous along the flow direction during the sampling period the wqi values of groundwater were also assessed at the two sections fig 2a at lng the wqi values of the five wells l1 to l5 varied from 56 to 73 indicating medium to good water quality fig 2a however considerable differences were observed among the five wells for example the wqi values ranged from 56 to 62 medium water quality in l4 but from 70 to 73 good water quality in l2 located 100 m apart fig 1b at hqez the mean wqi values of the five wells ranged from 61 7 to 65 7 indicating medium water quality fig 2 the highest wqi value was observed in l1 71 9 at lng and h1 65 7 at hqez both of which were closest to the river fig 1b in summary the spatial distribution of groundwater quality was more complex and heterogeneous than that of surface water which was attributed to the sediment heterogeneity and the complex biogeochemical processes in sediments the quality of groundwater at lng and hqez was better than that of river water fig 2a indicating that riverbank played an important role in the transfer and degradation of pollutants and acted as a net sink of pollutants from the river however it remained unclear which components were degraded the influence of hydrological conditions on river water and groundwater quality was evaluated fig 2b overall the surface water quality at both lng and hqez was improved in august and september as evident by the wqi values in the wet and dry seasons fig 2b the high frequency of rainfall events in august and september led to an increase in river discharge and stage as a result the advection and diffusion were enhanced which favored the dilution of major pollutants in river water the improvement of water quality due to rainfall was more evident at lng at the downstream than that at hqez at the upstream in contrast the groundwater quality responded differently to hydrological conditions and it was slightly better at lng in the wet season l1 to l5 and worse at hqez h1 to h5 in fig 2b 3 2 possible pollution sources and source apportionment 3 2 1 main factors and possible pollution sources of surface water and groundwater although the groundwater quality was improved compared with the surface water the response of riverbank to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river should be further identified in order to identify key elements responsible for river water quality and their origins pca text s1 1 was performed to reduce the dataset to several principal components fig 3 tables s2 and s3 the kmo value for river water was 0 64 and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test was close to 0 indicating that the dataset was suitable for pca four principal components pcs were extracted from the 14 variables by combining the sampling datasets at lng and hqez fig 3a the factors in fig 3 were classified as strong moderate and weak loadings based on their absolute values of 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 respectively liu et al 2003 wang et al 2017 the first component pcw1 in river water accounted for 38 9 of the total variance and had strong positive loadings of so4 2 0 93 th 0 84 and cl 0 75 fig 3a table s2 so4 2 and cl are associated with the ionic groups of dissolved salts alberto et al 2001 liu et al 2003 varol and şen 2009 varol 2020 the total hardness th of water is dependent on the concentrations of major elements especially ca and mg which are related to the dissolution of soil constituents such as calcium carbonates varol and şen 2009 the highest so4 2 cl and th levels in river water were recorded 192 mg l 1 173 mg l 1 and 352 mg l 1 at lng the 1st row in fig 4 this was in line with china s surface water environmental quality standards standardization administration of china 2017 which stated that the concentration of cl so4 2 and th should be 250 250 and 450 mg l 1 respectively the orange dashed line in fig 4 the results of pcw1 in river water indicated that multiple processes including saline soil silicate and carbonate weathering were the dominant sources of these ions fadel et al 2021 ustaoğlu et al 2020 varol 2020 alberto et al 2001 they were eventually transported through surface runoff in the gusong river though the first component pcw1 in river water had a strong negative loading of as 0 86 the results also showed that it has a strong correlations with the positive loading of so4 2 cl and th figure s3 to avoid the repeated effects between the positive and negative loadings induced by the dissolution of soil constituents we only considered the positive loadings and neglected the positive loadings of pcw1 when as was considered as the main component of pcw1 the conclusion that the dissolution and weathering of soil constituents was the main pollution sources that attributed to pcw1 was still valid previous studies have suggested that the as present in water bodies was generally originated from the recent deposition of as bearing sediments fendorf et al 2010 wallis et al 2020 the reductive dissolution of as bearing iron oxides has been widely accepted as the main cause of as contamination stahl et al 2016 the key elements responsible for groundwater quality at hqez and lng were also identified following the same method fig 3b tables s3 the kmo value was 0 78 and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test was close to 0 indicating the dataset was suitable for pca three pcs were extracted pcg1 and pcg2 together accounted for 72 of the total variance and pcg3 accounted for 6 5 of the total variance fig 3b the first component pcg1 accounted for 50 2 of the total variance and had strong positive loadings of f 0 94 cl 0 91 and fe 0 90 all of which were important components of calcite and chlorite and represented major cations and anions resulting from mineral weathering e g fluorite dissolution similar pcs pcw1 and pcg1 were extracted for surface water and groundwater indicating that they had similar pollution sources the concentration of cl so4 2 and th in groundwater was much higher than that in river water fig 4 and a significant portion of them could be derived from river water because of frequent hyporheic exchange gao et al 2020 hu et al 2013 the elements involved in pcw1 and pcg1 were weakly degraded by riverbank filtration it should be noted that the levels of f in groundwater at hqez exceeded the permissible limit of 1 5 mg l 1 and easy accessibility of circulating water to the weathered products during irrigation dissolved and leached the minerals including fluorine contributing f to the groundwater the pcw2 of river water explained 24 9 of the total variance with strong positive loadings of nh4 n 0 87 tp 0 84 and codmn 0 78 fig 3a nh4 n and tp were found to be important parameters characterizing river phytoplankton dynamics and eutrophication matzinger et al 2007 york et al 2007 codmn reflected the degree of organic pollution in water which could be produced by the photosynthesis of planktonic algae wu et al 2021 these factors represented the contribution of nutrient and organic matter inputs from untreated domestic sewage and agricultural runoff the concentrations of nh4 n tp and codmn in river water exceeded the class v standard for drinking water in china the 2nd row in fig 4 both lng and hqez sections were polluted by non point sources as evident from the mean values of the same elements the 2nd row in fig 4 the second component pcg2 explained 21 9 of the total variance with high loadings of nh4 n 0 80 zn 0 72 and codmn 0 63 in the groundwater which represented anthropogenic inputs such as industry effluent and non point pollution similar pollution sources were identified for surface water and groundwater by comparing pcw2 and pcg2 however the concentration of nh4 n tp and codmn in groundwater was much lower than that in river water fig 4 and a significant portion of them could be removed through riverbank filtration the comparison of the two main components between river water pcw1 pcw2 and groundwater pcg1 and pcg2 revealed that the pollutants in surface water could be transported into river bank through different porewater flow paths and the riverbank acted either as a source or as a sink depending on the pollution sources from the river water for instance it acted as a main source of cl and so4 2 from mineral weathering but as a main sink of nh4 n and codmn from non point pollution the pcw3 and pcw4 of river water explained 9 and 8 of the total variance with a strong positive loading of zn 0 75 and a moderate loading of ph 0 55 respectively table s2 the pcg3 of groundwater explained 6 5 of the total variance with a moderate positive loading of tp 0 54 although zn is an essential trace element for life it is highly toxic at concentrations above the limit ma et al 2016 the concentration of zn is controlled by natural and anthropogenic inputs zeng and han 2020 anthropogenic activities such as sewage discharge and exhaust emissions play an important role in the variation of heavy metal concentrations micó et al 2006 the ph values of surface water were all 8 0 indicating that the water in the gusong river remained alkaline throughout the monitoring period the ph could affect the survival of organisms and thus played a vital role in modifying the chemical and biological processes sun et al 2016 3 2 2 source apportionment for river water and groundwater the number of possible pollution sources was identified by pca and the contribution of each source was apportioned to the variables of river and groundwater quality by apcs mlr method fig 5 which was described in text s1 2 in detail the apcs mlr results for river water and groundwater were shown in tables s4 and s5 respectively the accuracy of apcs mlr modeling was assessed by the r 2 values in this study the r 2 values were in the range of 0 61 0 93 for river water and 0 45 0 97 for groundwater indicating certain accuracy and credibility of apcs mlr modeling according to the pca results fig 3a the pcw1 indicated that multiple processes including saline soil silicate and carbonate weathering occurred in the surface water the pcw1 accounted for 58 1 of pollution sources fig 5a and was related to soil constituents and the contribution rate on so4 2 th and cl was 81 2 88 8 and 50 1 respectively the pcg1 of groundwater accounted for 77 4 of pollution sources fig 5b and was related to weathering fig 3b and the contribution rate on cl fe and f was 50 8 44 7 and 38 5 respectively the contribution difference between pcw1 and pcg1 implied that riverbank could contribute additional 19 3 pollutants derived from weathering the pcw2 24 8 of pollution sources fig 5a indicated the nutrients from non point and organic matter inputs and the contribution rate on tp nh4 n and codmn was 81 5 72 7 and 59 4 respectively the pcg2 of groundwater 11 4 of total pollution sources fig 5b was related to anthropogenic inputs such as industry effluent and non point pollution fig 3b and table s3 and the contribution rate was much lower than that of pcw2 specifically the contribution rate of pcg2 on nh4 n zn and codmn was 73 7 62 8 and 73 1 respectively the contribution difference between pcw2 and pcg2 which were calculated by the apcs mlr method text s1 2 implied that riverbank could degrade 13 7 pollutants from the river water caused by anthropogenic inputs 3 3 combined data driven and physically based models 3 3 1 the wqimin model for surface water and groundwater the calculation of wqi described in section 3 1 involves 14 physical and chemical parameters table s1 these inter correlated variables allow the model to explain a larger proportion of variance but also makes the model less robust therefore it is necessary to screen key variables that can explain most of the variance in the water quality data for subsequent calculation of wqi the wqimin value was also calculated for river water and groundwater in order to develop a simple and cost effective approach for evaluation of water quality with as few parameters as possible based on the pca results of river water in table s2 the so4 2 th and cl in pcw1 were considered as important indicators of water quality and so4 2 contributed more significantly to the variation of wqi fig 3a however the strongest positive correlation 0 9 could be observed between so4 2 th and cl which suggested that th and cl had a significant effect on the measurement of so4 2 figure s3 thus the inclusion of these two variables in the calculation of wqimin would lead to over or under estimation of wqi for this reason th and cl were not considered in the calculation of wqimin the tp and nh4 n were found to be the main contributors to non point pollution of river water as shown in section 3 2 the presence of tp and nh4 n indicated the potential eutrophic risk of the river water and thus had an impact on aquatic life and human health matzinger et al 2007 york et al 2007 the nh4 n was highly correlated 0 9 with tp figure s3 and thus either nh4 n or tp was selected to represent agricultural pollution zn was introduced into the wqimin model to indicate the potential effect of heavy metals on water quality and human health zeng and han 2020 because zn represented the industry effluent in pcw3 and was weakly correlated with so4 2 and tp figure s3 the effects of anthropogenic activities on the spatial and temporal patterns of ph and f could be easily determined the dynamic variation of ph could affect the survival of organisms present in the river and consequently the chemical and biological processes thus both ph and f were selected overall the variables to be determined experimentally included ph so4 2 tp zn and f ph could be easily detected in situ at the sampling site the pca results showed that the selected environmental variables were taken into account and thus could be used to calculate wqimin the stepwise linear regression results table s6 which were taken from the results of pca and ca showed that tp made the largest contribution to wqi r 2 0 59 p 0 05 the zn and f entered the model in sequence and f markedly increased the r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean percentage error mape values of the model r 2 0 91 rmse 2 91 mape 7 61 therefore so4 2 tp zn and f model 4 fig 7 were selected as the parameters of the wqimin model to assess the surface water quality of the gusong river table s6 figure s4 as described in sections 3 2 1 nh4 n tp and codmn were identified as the main contributors to non point pollution of river water however sensitive analysis showed that the inclusion of nh4 n model 5 reduced the predictive ability and accuracy of the model although the pcw2 explained 24 9 of the total variance with the highest loading of nh4 n table s2 similar results were found for codmn model 6 table 1 this was one main reason for the selection of tp as the critical parameter of pcw2 in the wqimin model in section 3 3 1 the effect of ph models 7 and 8 fig 6 was also evaluated table 1 the addition of ph into model 4 marginally decreased the rsme and mape values but had no significant impact on the r 2 value table 1 therefore the best wqimin model proposed in this study consisted of 5 river water quality parameters including ph so4 2 tp zn and f model 8 these parameters could adequately describe the quality of river water and allow for effective evaluation of water quality with low measurement cost the inclusion of cl model 9 led to a slight increase in the r 2 value but a significant decrease in the mape and rsme values table 1 three key parameters nh4 n f ph were also selected to test the applicability of the wqimin model to groundwater and the regression results for the wqimin and wqi models were shown in table 2 the wqimin model was less applicable to groundwater at lng l1 l5 and hqez h1 h5 than surface water as evident in table 2 and fig 7 model 3 and model 2 worked better than model 1 with the same dataset the problems of overestimation and underestimation were encountered in all models intuitively the predicted value was higher than the centerline when the wqi was low but lower than the centerline when the wqi was high in fig 7 the wqi values predicted using model 3 were in good agreement with the measurements but the wqimin wqi plot for groundwater was quite different from that for surface water fig 7 specifically a give wqimin nw value in fig 7 often corresponded to numerous wqi values the wqi values for groundwater were distributed in a very narrow range making it difficult to find a suitable wqimin model to replace the wqi model as expected no significant difference in groundwater conditions was found due to the short distance between adjacent sampling wells at each site and the small spatial scale of the two sites another important cause was that all water quality indicators were normalized table s1 and the difference of measured concentration could not be well represented in the wqimin wqi plot the wqimin models considering weights wqimin w and not considering weights wqimin nw were also compared to determine the effects of weights based on the results using the same key parameters tables 1 2 text s2 and figure s5 3 3 2 the physically based model 3 3 2 1 model calibration of hydrological monitoring as described in sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 the proposed physical model considered the riparian groundwater flow and water quality the model was sequentially calibrated against measurements water stage and water quality in l1 l4 and h1 h4 collected from july to november in 2019 the stage of river water and groundwater well l5 h5 at lng and hqez were used as the left and right input for the riverbank figure s2 the initial hydraulic head distribution in the riverbank was obtained by solving the steady state richard s equation under the losing conditions jiang et al 2022 to estimate the improvement of the fit between modeled and observed hydraulic head the regression coefficient r 2 nash sutcliffe index ns and root mean square error rmse were calculated at each calibration run the parameters shown in table s7 were modified the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer k1 and clogging layer k2 were based on the measured data whereas the vg model parameters s α and n were based on the measured data of clay and sand from the soil types the sequential calibration using groundwater flow model led to a slight overestimation of the hydraulic head at lng and an underestimation at hqez this was because the same parameters were used for different geological conditions at lng and hqez similar results about the uncertainties of groundwater flow model have been reported in previous studies siergieiev et al 2015 these results indicated that the input hydraulic parameters were appropriate for the simulation of riparian groundwater flow under the losing conditions i e river water stage always higher than groundwater the r 2 ns and rmse for the best fit flow model at lng were 0 77 0 82 and 0 11 m and the model accuracy was slightly improved at hqez using the same parameters with the r 2 ns and rmse being 0 77 0 82 and 0 11 m respectively fig 8 3 3 2 2 calibration of water quality model the physical behavior of the groundwater quality transport was coupled with the groundwater flow and the calculated wqi for the sampling wells at lng and hqez were also simulated fig 9 as the range of wqi values in section 3 1 indicated the water quality status this model was intended to rapidly forecast the groundwater quality status when the surface water quality was known rather than the wqi values in detail the water quality as a result of all the components contributed from agriculture industrial activities and natural processes followed the advection dispersion filtration patterns in the riverbank the model results in fig 9 showed a good agreement between predicted and measured values orange frame in fig 9a it was slightly more accurate in the middle groundwater wells gw l2 l3 gw h2 h3 in comparison to close l1 h1 and faraway riverbank l4 h4 by applying reasonable simplifications the proposed water quality transport model with an input of hydrograph and river wqi enabled us not only to disentangle the interactions between groundwater flow and riverbank morphologies but also to predict riparian groundwater quality status previous studies have proposed single liu et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 and multiple species transport model knabe et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 i e advection and dispersion equation to predict the fate of specific biochemical components within the riverbank the physically based model in this study further indicated that the wqi concept integrated with multiple biochemical parameters followed the same physical pattern with the single species therefore the proposed model could be used to directly predict the groundwater quality status resulting from the components carried by a considerable number of pollution sources in river 3 4 implications for surface water and groundwater quality management and limitations water quality assessment is important for pollution control and water resources management however the use of wqi for assessment of groundwater mohebbi et al 2013 wu et al 2020a and surface water akkoyunlu and akiner 2012 nong et al 2020 separately may provide limited insights into the overall water quality of the river to our knowledge this is one of the first studies to investigate the surface water and groundwater interactions in the riverbank system by integrating hydrochemical monitoring water quality analyses data driven and physically based models the river water and groundwater in hydrologic continuity within a river corridor interact in a complex and dynamic domain i e hyporheic zone which has a great impact on the quality of the two water bodies through a series of physical and geochemical processes zachara et al 2016 our study reveals that the riverbank responds differently to different pollutant sources from natural weathering and anthropogenic input it acts as the primary sink for the components e g nh4 n and tp from non point pollution and could degrade 13 7 of the pollutants from the river water therefore this enhancement has implications for agriculturally impacted river with excess nitrate and tp loadings lemke et al 2011 mian et al 2010 in contrast the role of riverbank in promoting water quality can be ignored for the river dominated by the chemical weathering wu et al 2020b zhu et al 2012 the results provide some insights into the assessment of water quality and local management agencies this study combines the data driven and physically based modeling to predict the riparian groundwater quality the data driven model based on pca and ca methods is firstly applied to the groundwater and the model results show a good agreement with the measurement trend this provides a useful and low cost means i e selected key parameters which represent the groundwater quality for periodic monitoring of groundwater additionally a physics based model is introduced to capture the response mechanisms between river water and groundwater quality in this model the distribution of groundwater quality could be described by the solute transport equation the proposed model allows general simulation of riparian groundwater quality without solute specific geochemical modeling by incorporating the physical effects of advection dispersion and bank filtration on water quality these methods can be incorporated easily in existing models of transport in aquifer however this study has focused only on the overall evaluation of river water and groundwater quality of the gusong river to better understand their spatial and temporal trends more compounds should be monitored for a longer period of time under different land use and hydrogeological conditions on a catchment in addition some important physicochemical parameters such ascod do toc and total nitrogen are not considered in this study due to unavailability of equipment these parameters may provide important and further insights into the relationship between groundwater and surface water quality and the responses of riverbank to different pollutants from the river 4 conclusions the surface water and groundwater of a river system are interconnected with frequent hyporheic exchange and the evaluation of either surface water or groundwater quality provides limited insights into the overall water quality of the system in this study the surface water and groundwater quality at the lng and hqez sections of the gusong river was jointly evaluated via hydrochemical measurements the main conclusions can be summarized as follows different response patterns were found between river water groundwater quality and hydrologic conditions the river water quality at both lng and hqez was improved in the wet season in which there was a higher frequency of rainfall events however the groundwater quality in the riverbank responded irregularly to hydrological variation which was attributed to the complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions at the sediment mineral weathering and anthropogenic activities were identified as the main pollution sources for surface water and groundwater however anthropogenic inputs only accounted for 11 4 of the total pollution sources for groundwater which was much lower than that for river water 24 8 riverbank responded differently to the components carried by different pollution sources in the river it acted as the main sink of components e g nh4 n and tp from non point pollution leading to the degradation of 13 7 pollutants from the river water caused by anthropogenic input however it contributed additional 19 3 pollutants derived from weathering the proposed wqimin model consisting of 3 key parameters nh4 n f ph could provide reasonable qualitative agreement with the measurements for riparian groundwater although its application was poorer than surface water which involved 5 key parameters the physically based model was also developed to directly simulate the riparian groundwater quality by incorporating the physical effects of advection dispersion and bank filtration these methods can be incorporated easily in existing models of transport in aquifer it is believed that useful knowledge could be gained for the sustainable development of the huaihe river basin particularly for the integration of water pollution control and water resources management however the aim of this study is to determine how riverbank responds to different pollution sources rather than the water quality evaluating the generality of the results of this study requires further studies in catchments of contrasting climate geology and land use in order to test and better characterize the general performance of the proposed data physically driven model intensive monitoring and large hydrochemical datasets are required

2531,poyang lake basin has drought prone pattern and floods in recent decades posing a serious threat to water security and human life in this research the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to investigate hydrological parameters characteristics simulating uncertainties as well as spatial and temporal patterns of both blue and green water resources for the whole basin the results revealed a strong correlation between the observed and simulated streamflow at six hydrological stations the overall hydrological water balance analysis showed that 58 1 of annual water yield is contributed by surface runoff while groundwater flow contributes 38 8 of annual water yield the annual average blue water resource was higher accounting for 65 1 of the total water resources green water coefficient was 34 9 for the entire basin varying from 26 to 50 the spatial distribution of blue water resource was uneven in the basin with higher value in parts of the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe subbasins while distribution of green water resource was more homogeneous blue water resource decreased significantly in raohe subbasin with 37 1 mm a whereas having no significant variability in other river basins from 1992 to 2010 the change of green water resource is caused mainly by the increase of green water flow in most subbasins the results provide insights into prediction uncertainty reduction of simulation as well as green and blue water endowments this research is of great significance to improve water resources management in poyang lake basin keywords poyang lake

et al 2019 water resources management is an item of high priority to address water security hydrological models are important tools applied to water resources management to meet various demands abbaspour et al 2009 water resources management and hydrologic modelling research are intrinsically linked to hydrologic cycle processes which have been embedded in hydrologic systems with computer technology as a widely used semi distributed parameter hydrologic model swat arnold et al 1998 which generally subdivides watershed into smaller subbasins has a growing number of applications for addressing water resources management ranging from basins to continental scales some researchers reported successful application of swat for streamflow simulation and water balance assessment takele et al 2021 used swat to analyze the correlation between the observed and simulated streamflow and water balance components of the upper blue nile basin li et al 2017 simulated the annually average runoff in datong lake polder and combined swat with function analysis method to calculate its minimum ecological water supplement for sustaining the ecological environment the simulation of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution load in bali lake basin was performed with swat to propel water environmental protection planning chen et al 2019 chang 2014 and sun et al 2015 used swat to simulate hydrology of dongting lake basin which has four subbasins at monthly time intervals zhou et al 2021 inputted various rainfall scenarios to swat to simulate runoff quantity for multiple watershed scales liang et al 2021 used three optimization algorithms based on swat to identify sensitivity parameters and analyze model uncertainty in yalong river basin of southwestern china li et al 2021 constructed swat to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of ecological flow of hanjiang river with the future land use and climate change scenario besides a number of works on the evaluation of blue water and green water emerged in 2010 s given that the spatial occurrences of water resources within most watersheds are not properly known gull and shah 2020 the swat was constructed to simulate the hydrology cycle process and evaluate spatio temporal variation of blue and green water resources xie et al 2019 gao et al 2021 some also model the entire basin to assess the impact of climate change on blue green water resources jiang et al 2021 mengistu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the application of swat to the simulation of streamflow and distribution of blue and green water resources has been studied extensively lake basin water balance analysis is an important research topic in the hydrological study as well however the majority of cases have focused on a single river basin and few studies have been conducted on large lake basin with multiple river systems in recent years extreme floods or drought has occurred in poyang lake basin which can lead to significant socioeconomic losses and environmental stress cai et al 2011 legesse et al 2004 shankman et al 2012 and threaten the life of ten million residents in surrounding region li and zhang 2015 additionally the shifts between drying and wetting of this basin are associated with water storage and then affects lake hydrological behavior and the security and ecology in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the 1990 s poyang lake basin shows frequent severe floods and droughts occurred frequently after 2003 guo et al 2012 shankman et al 2012 from 2006 to 2007 a water shortage occurred due to continuous decline in water level causing great threat to water use of large numbers of people increasingly severe shortage of water resources occurred especially in dry season lai et al 2013 in the past couple of years poyang lake routinely fluctuates in size the water level of poyang lake reached 22 6 m in july 2020 surpassing the previous record of 22 52 m reached in 1998 however the lake reached the other extreme in september 2022 its water level fell to 7 10 m and was the lowest since records began in 1951 the lake which supposed to be in wet period has set the earliest record for entering an extremely dry season evaluation of water balance and hydrological characteristics in poyang lake basin could help predict water quantity and flooding and water shortages xu et al 2014 dessie et al 2015 ye et al 2016 previous studies have developed simulation models to access water quantity in poyang lake such as mike 21 li et al 2017 xin anjiang lv et al 2014 and efdc li et al 2016 reasonable matches to observation data were established with certain calibration effort and the models collectively revealed valuable insights into the lake s characteristic however no previous attempts have been made to screen the whole of poyang lake basin using swat due to its immense size frequent occurrence of drought and flood coupled with the impact of climate change brings great challenges to poyang lake basin the variability and uncertainty in water quantity will have a great impact on the allocation and management of water resources in this basin in order to predict the amount of water resources and address water management issues this study constructs a swat model of poyang lake basin to simulate main hydrological parameters characteristics and spatial distributions of blue and green water resources in the whole basin the model was calibrated and validated using sufi 2 in swap cup there are two innovative points in this study 1 determining a sensitivity parameter set adapted to the whole basin and its five rivers parts 2 analyzing the water balance and spatial temporal distribution of blue and green water resources across the whole basin at sub basin level and its five rivers parts the results obtained in this paper are expected to provide theoretical support for water resources decision makers and improve water resources management of poyang lake basin 2 study area the poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china located at the middle reaches and southern bank of yangtze river the geographical extent of whole basin is from 113 35 e to 118 29 e and from 24 29 n to 30 05 n as shown in fig 1 a the total drainage area of the water systems of the poyang lake basin is 1 63 105 km2 accounting for 9 of the drainage area of the yangtze river basin the boundary of the basin is almost identifical to the jiangxi province and its area accounts for nearly 96 85 of the land area of jiangxi the basin is bounded by hubei and anhui from the north fujian from the east guangdong from the south and hunan from the west fig 1a the headwaters of the poyang lake basin are located in surrounding mountains with high local relief with peaks 2000 m elevation the whole basin is divided into five rivers parts i e the raohe xinjiang ganjiang xiushui and fuhe subbasins each with an area of 14218 km2 15535 km2 80948 km2 13462 km2 15811 km2 respectively the five rivers flow into poyang lake within the basin and discharge to the yangtze river this basin situated in a typical subtropical monsoon climate has highly seasonal temperatures the average annual temperature is 17 2 c with june august average of 27 3 c and december february average of 7 1 c the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1049 mm year with the highest rates occurring during may to september poyang lake basin is the richest area of precipitation in the yangtze river basin the amount of areal average annual precipitation is 1654 mm of which 55 in march to june the rainfall in the basin was distributed unevenly among the seasons long term average seasonal rainfall was 640 19 mm in spring march to may 564 52 mm in summer june to august 226 15 mm in autumn september to november and 227 81 mm in winter december to february accounting for 38 59 34 03 13 63 and 13 73 of the total annual respectively 70 of the rainfall occurred in spring and summer streamflow demonstrates a distinct seasonal variation in the basin with mean monthly runoff varying between 0 34 107 and 16 4 108 m3 d according to the average values for the period 1953 to 2010 zhang et al 2014 monthly total precipitation of poyang lake basin increases from april to june leading to an increase in discharge from the upstream rivers with high water level 8 8 m on average subsequently discharge gradually decreases and the lowest water level in poyang lake basin usually occurs in january land cover within the basin is dominated by forest 62 3 followed by agriculture 26 4 and grassland 4 5 while the remaining 2 8 of the study area is covered with other land cover classes fig 2a depicts the spatial variations of landuse classes in the study basin the soil type in the area is dominated by haplic acrisols 66 1 followed by cumulic anthrosols 21 9 the remaining soil groups include haplic alisols 3 1 haplic luvisols 1 7 and a very small amount of other 11 soil groups 7 2 the spatial distribution of the soil groups is shown in fig 2b 3 methods 3 1 the swat model swat is a semi distributed dynamic and physically based tool that can be used to perform long term continuous simulation of watershed hydrology arnold et al 1998 gassman and reyes 2007 it is a basin scale simulation model that operates on daily and hourly time step which has been widely used to access the impact of land management practices on water movement sediment movement crop growth and nutrient cycling in large complex watersheds zhang et al 2012 characteristics of this flow model contains several hydrologic components such as surface runoff stream flow non empirical recharge estimates snow cover and snow melt interception storage infiltration evaporation and reservoir water balance and shallow and deep aquifers swat uses a typical setup with two phases equation 1 describes a rainfall runoff phase based on a water balance for each subbasin neitsch et al 2011 a routing phase connects all subbasins to produce spatially explicit outputs at the subbasin outlet sw t sw t δt rday t qsurf t ea t wseep t qlat t qgw t 1 where sw t is the final soil water content in mm on day t sw t δt is the initial soil water content in mm on day t δt rday qsurf ea wseep qlat and qgw represent the amount of precipitation mm surface runoff mm evapotranspiration mm percolation mm lateral flow from soil to channel and groundwater flow mm respectively hydrologic routines accounts for water balance including vadose zone processes and basin wide management assessments with a multi component basin water budget equation 1 determines the change in the soil water content for each day based on a daily calculation of the hydrological processes in the hru the hydrological processes in the soil include lateral flow return flow tile drainage shallow aquifer recharge moisture redistribution and so on soil conservation service curve number scs cn method can estimate surface runoff volume and penman monteith equation can estimate potential evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2011 shi et al 2011 a kinematic storage model is used to predict lateral flow form the soil whereas return flow simulated by creating a shallow aquifersis arnold et al 1998 the variable storage routing method is used for channel water routing outflow from a channel is adjusted for transmission losses evaporation diversions and return flow each soil type is divided into different soil layers and the soil water content is calculated for each soil layer separately and subsequently summed swat uses readily available input data such as climate data soil properties topography and landuse within the watershed this model has been developed and validated at larger scales xu et al 2020 the swat model was used to quantify the blue and green water resources falkenmark first proposed new conceptualization of blue water resource and green water resource to distinguish liquid water and moisture in the unsaturated zone falkenmark 1995 the blue and green water concept has been extended for better water planning and management falkenmark and rockström 2006 according to the hydrological processes and storage type involved blue and green water are two kinds of freshwater cycle blue water flow streams through either on or below the land surface in this study blue water flow refers to the water in rivers lakes wetlands and shallow aquifers green water is the portion of precipitation stored in unsaturated soil or remains temporarily on top of the soil or vegetation and later returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration falkenmark and rockström 2006 differentiate between two components of green water which are green water storage and green water flow green water storage equals soil moisture and green water flow equals the actual evapotranspiration blue water flow can be qualified by the sum of water yield and deep aquifer recharge expressed as wyld and da rchg respectively in model output green water storage and green water flow actual evapotranspiration constitute green water green water coefficient gwc is defined as the ratio of green water resource to total water flow which can be used to access the distribution of blue and green water resources in the basin liu et al 2009 the temporal heterogeneity of blue and green water resources is qualified by using simple linear regression model which is represented by 2 y β 0 β 1 x where x is the value of the independent variable y is the value of the dependent variable β 0 is a constant and β 1 is the regression coefficient 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sufi 2 is a combined optimization approach abbaspour et al 2007 in the swat cup software package developed by swiss federal research institute of water science and technology sufi 2 can conduct a sensitivity analysis to categorise main parameters by using latin hypercube random sampling technique abbaspour et al 2007 unlike one at a time method sufi 2 uses a global search method to calculate the objective function by solving multiple regressions which is considered as equation abbaspour et al 2015 3 e α i 1 n β i b i where e is the objective function value α is a constant of regression analysis and β is the coefficient of each parameter b the significance of parameter b was identified using the t test a larger absolute value of the t test and a smaller p value 0 05 indicated more sensitive parameters swat contains 210 hydrological parameters identifying the most sensitive input parameters and their ranges is important considering not all of them significantly contribute to streamflow simulation 3 3 model performance evaluation in general the model uncertainties are due to conceptual simplifications boundary conditions parameters model structures input data quality and so on in this study poyang lake basin is a large watershed so it is expected to map all these forms of uncertainties sufi 2 can evaluate swat by performing calibration and uncertainty analysis it runs as the following steps initially it generates multiple sets of parameters according to the initial parameter range the parameter range gets updated every iteration by calculating the sensitivity matrix and new parameter ranges are recommended for another iteration it modifies each parameter range one by one while keeping all other parameters fixed the sensitivity of the changes of objective function is examined we expect to access to the best parameter set and ranges over multiple iterations in this process parameter uncertainty was assumed accompanied by measured data falling into the uncertainty range 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and correlation matrix are calculated after avoiding 5 of poor simulation from the cumulative distribution of the model output in the way of latin hypercube sampling abbaspour et al 2017 the performance of model calibration and validation is expressed as p factor and r factor the p factor accounts for all uncertainties associated with swat model reflected as the observed data falling into 95 ppu range the value of p factor varies from 0 to 1 a higher value of p factor represents less uncertainty of model output and most of measured data captured by 95 ppu a value 1 indicates that all of measured data comes under 95 ppu getting a perfect model simulation considering the uncertainty the r factor is the average width of the 95 ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured variable a low value suggests the band width of the 95 ppu smaller and less uncertainty in the output the width of the 95 ppu should be smaller than the standard deviation of the measured data abbaspour et al 2015 the value of p factor increases at the expense of a larger r factor so the two factors have to be balanced to bracket most of the observed data within the 95 ppu the best simulation can be determined when both the two indices have ideal value and the current parameter ranges can be regarded as the calibrated process for discharge a value of 0 7 or 0 75 for p factor is adequate and a value of 1 5 for r factor would be desirable abbaspour et al 2007 the value of r factor is calculated as follows 4 d 1 n t 1 n y t i 97 5 m y t i 92 5 m 5 r f a c t o r d σ o where n is the observed sample numbers y t i 97 5 m and y t i 92 5 m mean 97 5 upper and 92 5 lower level of the cumulative distribution of simulations and σ o is the standard deviation of observations sufi 2 allows the usage of r2 nse and pbias as objective functions r2 the coefficient of determination is a measure to denote the linear relationship between model outcomes and the observed data krause et al 2005 nse measures the predictive skill of hydrological models by relating the goodness of fit of the model to the variance of the measured data gupta et al 1999 krause et al 2005 paul and negahban azar 2018 in this study we used the above three indices for discharge 6 r 2 i 1 11 o i p 0 p i p 0 i 1 n o i p 0 2 i 1 n p i p 0 2 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i i 2 i 1 n o i p o 2 8 pbias t 1 t p i t p o t t 1 t p o t 100 where o i is the observed discharges p i is the simulated discharges p o is the mean of discharges and t is the observed time the range of r2 lies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 represents the desperation of the prediction can be explained totally by that of the observation whereas 0 zero means no correlation between modeled output and the observed data the value of nse varies from to 1 nse equals 1 suggests a perfect model with an estimation error variance equal to zero an efficiency 0 when a modeled time series with an estimation error variance is significantly larger than that of the observations values of the r2 and nse nearer to 1 indicates a model with more predictive skill the lower absolute pbias values are preferred and the optimal value of it is 0 positive values indicate overestimation bias while negative values indicate model underestimation bias gupta et al 1999 table 1 shows the model evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 model setup for this study a swat model was developed to simulate monthly streamflow in the poyang lake basin table 2 summarizes the data used for the model development digital elevation model is an important data to set up the swat model since all the topographic attributes of the basin would affect the hydrological response units hrus these hrus are the product of overlaying of slope soils and land use and similar hrus would have similar hydrologic characteristics arnold et al 2011 neitsch et al 2011 winchell et al 2013 for this study a 30 metre spatial resolution aster gdem dem was used as an input dataset the area threshold value was set to 65000 this basin is delineated into 143 subbasins based on the topography which include total 1567 hrus in the model fig 2 the land use soil slope combination defined in hrus was allocated by land use 20 soil 10 and slope 10 thresholds to produce each response unit successful execution of terrain processing module and actual river network of arcswat interface led to generation of appropriate database for the subbasin parameters and a detailed topographic report of the watershed land use and land cover lulc and soil also have major influence in basin hydrology lulc and soil map along with their respective lookup tables prepared earlier were supplied to the model for reclassification according to swat coding convention michael mamo and jain 2013 the original lulc data has 19 types being reclassified into 6 swat categories subsequently the soil map was taken from the soil databases that was produced by the nanjing institute of soil science the properties of each soil type were determined based on fao 90 and 72 soil forms were identified in the study basin then the soil forms were grouped into 15 soil groups and mapped for the area the spatial variations of the major lulc and soil groups of the basin are depicted in fig 3 the values of available water capacity sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and moist bulk density sol bd were calculated by using the soil plant atmosphere water spaw software all the required climatic variables were fed to the model such as daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation average wind speed and relative humidity data the weather generator tool in the swat software was assigned to fill in missing data for certain periods of time from a long term daily precipitation rate and maximum and minimum temperature neitsch et al 2011 this study relies on meteorological stations inside the basin as seen in fig 1b the long term daily meteorological data covering a 21 year observation period from the year 1990 to the year 2010 are available from 83 meteorological stations along the poyang lake basin after all the above processes were completed the swat simulation could be activated we divide the time scale into the warmup period from the year 1990 to the year 1991 and model simulation period from the year 1992 to the year 2010 the streamflow data from six hydrological stations were divided into two one for calibration and the other for validation six hydrological stations covered different rivers parts of poyang lake basin and can therefore suitably represent the flow of water resources through the whole basin the description of hydrological stations can be seen in table 3 the framework showing major procedures in the simulation process is summarized in fig 4 4 2 model evaluation a total of 1000 model simulations were run to conduct parameter sensitivity analysis in this study thirteen parameters were selected to cover different hydrological processes in the poyang lake basin see table 4 the final sensitivities of thirteen parameters applied for monthly predictions are ranked in table 5 with the most sensitive parameter given rank 1 and the least one given rank 13 the four parameters cn2 slsubbsn sol k and ch k2 have low p values p 0 05 and large t stat values indicating the top sensitive parameters to streamflow output fig 5 li 2018 analyzed different parameter sets for several subbasins of poyang lake basin which was more complicated and less practical than this study as mentioned in 3 1 cn2 a key parameter in the scs method in swat could represent the permeability of the land surface and the potential maximum soil moisture retention capacity and was supposed as the most sensitive parameter as expected cn2 was the most sensitive parameter with much higher t stat values in this study the generation of surface runoff is extremely crucial for streamflow in the poyang lake basin we can see a clear trend that as the value of cn2 increased nse value increased slsubbsn which represents the average slope length of subbasin ranked second in all of parameters as an indicator of effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 showed stream groundwater relationships sol k is related to groundwater seepage to streamflow the remaining parameters caused no significant changes in streamflow output with p 0 05 and had no significant effect on model simulations the canmx was found to have the least significant effect on streamflow with a large p value the last iteration of sufi 2 was set to 200 times and scatter plots were created during simulations fig 6 the x axis represents the range of values for key parameters the y axis is the value of nse the four parameters mentioned above were more distinguishable indicating more variant and sensitive than the others the remaining parameters were found to be the primary source of model uncertainties in the poyang lake basin for this study daily streamflow of six hydrological stations was collected for calibration and validation purposes all these stations have data for same years we used fourteen years of the data for calibration and seven years for validation the first 2 years were excluded from the analysis as equilibration period to mitigate the initial conditions due to the large amount of data the daily streamflow is converted into monthly streamflow more than 500 simulations in four iterations were run to achieve the best model performance between the observed and simulated data the best parameter sets selected in the sensitivity analysis in subsection 4 1 were evaluated by model prediction uncertainty and model performance evaluation the graphical comparisons of measured streamflow at the outlets of different basins and its simulated values are shown in fig 7 for the calibration and validation processes the prediction uncertainty in sufi 2 is expressed by the 95 ppu which is represented by the yellow colored region the r factors are all 1 5 and p factors of five outlets are 0 7 this means that 70 of the observed streamflow in outlets is enveloped by the 95 ppu during the calibration 1992 2003 and validation periods 2004 2010 the p factor of dufengkeng station is 0 69 closed to 0 7 which we think is also reasonable therefore all outlets fall in desirable regions of p factor and r factor which could evaluate the model uncertainty during flood periods such as april to july 1995 july to august 1996 july to august 1996 june to august 1998 july to august 1999 and june to july 2010 runoff peaked in poyang lake basin which can be well reproduced by the simulation fig 7 similarly regarding the model performance evaluation the model performance indicators are given in table 6 compared with existing hydrologic modelling in big basin using swat abbaspour et al 2015 the results showed good agreement between simulated and observed data in this study the overall performance of the model in terms of r2 and nse for the monthly time steps has quite satisfactory results for the poyang lake basin for the calibration period r2 at six stations ranged from 0 89 to 0 96 fig 8 which means the model was able to capture runoff very well nse values ranged from 0 82 to 0 94 the final validation values were simulated reasonably with regression slope of 0 81 0 95 fig 9 nse values ranged from 0 77 to 0 92 swat model can capture the basin s hydrologic characteristics well and reproduce acceptable monthly runoff simulations the simulation results show that all the performance indicators in hushan station and wanjiabu station for both the calibration and validation periods are in very good ranges r2 0 7 nse 0 75 pbias 10 the negative values of pbias for dufengkeng station and lijiadu station represent the model underestimation bias while positive values in the remaining stations indicate model overestimation bias we can see the output results of 95 ppu and the best fit through the simulation run with the best parameters values and objective function value at each station this study has better simulation effects with higher values of r2 and nse than the model simulations in ma and wang 2015 it should be kept in mind that all six discharge outlets were parameterized and optimized simultaneously and there is a good agreement between the measured and simulated discharge this results in an overall good simulation and better provides support for the study of the entire basin 4 3 quantification of water resources and water balance based on the simulated total discharge evapotranspiration precipitation and water yield of the swat model the water balance of the poyang lake basin was analyzed the results indicated that the contribution of surface runoff sur q lateral flow lat q and groundwater flow gw q for the annual water yield wyld was 58 1 1 0 and 38 8 respectively this illustrates that the surface runoff contributes more to the basin than other components the lateral flow is a relatively minor component of the hydrological budget which is consistent with the review of the australian literature ticehurst 2004 land cover within the basin is dominated by forest and the soil type is dominated by acrisols the incorporation of the activity of roots in forest coverage area and abundant organic matter in acrisols could result in a relatively high permeability to promote lateral flow formation however the proportion of lateral flow in water yield was relatively small within the basin compared with that in other areas luo and tao 2018 zhou et al 2011 this may be related to the high slopes 15 25 of forest within the basin chen et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 the spatial distribution of blue green water and total water flow sum of green and blue flows in the poyang lake basin are mapped in fig 10 the results showed a wide range of spatial variation of blue water resources blue water flow were larger in the east and north regions of ganjiang subbasin the west regions of xinjiang subbasin and the east regions of raohe subbasin fig 10a which was consistent with the findings of cui 2020 at the basin scale the annual blue water varied from approximately 1000 to 2147 mm green water resource was distributed homogeneously among different subbasins fig 10c the coefficients of variations cv in standard deviation divided by mean for blue water resource fig 10b were higher than that for green water resource across fig 10d the whole basin precipitation greatly affects the temporal variation of blue water while green water is affected by land cover and soil type yin et al 2022 the values of field capacity in most areas of poyang lake basin are relatively high 0 39 m3 m 3 in china wu et al 2018 indicates that the green water is stable hence the change of green water resource is relatively stable than that of blue water resource in this basin the higher cv of blue water was observed in the upper reaches which can be attributed to catchment size ning et al 2018 the higher cv of green water was observed in the agriculture coverage area which indicated the agriculture had a lower ecosystem resistance and higher irrigation demand than forest coverage the total water resources were higher in poyang lake east and northwest of ganjiang subbasin and west of xinjiang subbasin whereas the north regions of xiushui subbasin and northwest of poyang lake area suffered water scarcities fig 10e the annual average green water was estimated to be 700 800 mm a 1 for the period 1992 2010 accounting for 34 9 of the total water flow this is close to the estimate of 39 reported by lv et al 2017 the green water coefficient varied between 26 and 50 for the entire basin fig 10f high green water proportion are mainly found in poyang lake and the southern part of ganjiang subbasin there is clear consistent of coefficients of variations in blue and green water resources in ganjiang subbasin fig 11 further reveals the blue and green water resources across five subbasins from 1992 to 2010 fig 12 shows the trends of the blue and green water resources in five subbasins within poyang lake basin with respect to time at the annual scales from 1992 to 2010 for the raohe subbasin fig 12a the annual average blue water resource was 1542 mm a which accounted for 68 1 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 721 mm a which accounted for 31 9 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that blue water resources decreased significantly from 1992 to 2010 p 0 05 with a change rate of 37 1 mm a the green water flow and green water resources increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 34 1 mm 10a and 23 8 mm 10a respectively green water storage showed no significant variability trend therefore the change of green water resources of raohe subbasin is mainly caused by the increase of green water flow for the xiushui subbasin fig 12b the annual average blue water resource was 1321 mm a which accounted for 64 3 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 735 mm a which accounted for 35 7 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that the blue water resources and green water storage have no significant variability trend whereas the green water flow and green water resources increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 23 8 mm 10a and 34 1 mm 10a respectively the increase of green water flow leads to an increase of green water resources for the xinjiang subbasin fig 12c the annual average blue water resource was 1539 8 mm a which accounted for 66 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 792 mm a which accounted for 34 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that only the green water storage increased significantly from 1992 to 2010 p 0 05 with a change rate of 11 2 mm 10a the blue water resources green water storage and green water resources all showed no significant variability trend for the ganjiang subbasin fig 12d the annual average blue water resource was 1507 6 mm a which accounted for 63 2 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 899 mm a which accounted for 36 8 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that the blue water resources and green water storage have no significant variability trend whereas the green water flow and green water resources increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 56 4 mm 10a and 63 1 mm 10a respectively therefore the change of green water resources of ganjiang subbasin in recent years is mainly caused by the increase of green water flow for the fuhe subbasin fig 12e the annual average blue water resource was 1188 6 mm a which accounted for 60 5 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resource was 775 5 mm a which accounted for 39 5 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that the blue water resource and green water storage have no significant variability trend whereas the green water flow and green water resource increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 54 8 mm 10a and 64 4 mm 10a respectively the increase of green water flow leads to an increase of green water resources the most severe floods in the poyang lake occurred in 1998 1999 and 2010 whereas extreme drought occurred in 2004 2007 2008 and 2009 the changes of the blue water resource with respect to time were relatively similar to the annual events of severe floods or droughts in these five subbasins 5 conclusion in this study a hydrologic model of poyang lake basin was built using the well established swat model the model was calibrated for six hydrological stations the program sufi 2 in swat cup package was used for parameter sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis calibration and validation only readily available daily streamflow data were used for model setup as well as model calibration and validation the final model results for the freshwater availability components blue water flow green water resources and green water coefficient are presented the sensitivity analysis indicated that the cn2 slsubbsn sol k and ch k2 were the important parameters for the swat model particular attention was paid to clearly quantify and illustrate the 95 prediction uncertainty of the model output which turned out to be fairly small in some cases the results showed good agreement between the simulated and observed monthly streamflow in this study compared with existing hydrologic modelling in big basin it is obvious that sufi 2 has high efficiency to yield a reasonable prediction uncertainty calibration and uncertainty analysis are linked intimately and calibration results are presented with a quantification of model prediction uncertainty this study obtains better simulation effects with higher values of r2 and nse the spatial temporal heterogeneity of blue and green water resources was presented for the entire river basin at sub basin level and five river subbasins the annual average blue water resource was higher than green water resource accounting for 65 1 of the total blue and green water resources the blue water flow and total water resources were higher in ganjiang and xinjiang subbasins green water resource was distributed more homogeneously than blue water resource among different subbasins from 1992 to 2010 the blue water resources decreased significantly in raohe subbasin whereas having no significant variability in other river basins the change of green water resources is mainly caused by the increase of green water flow in most river subbasins during this period except that the green water flow and green water resources in the xinjiang subbasin had no significant variability trend overall this study provides significant insights into streamflow simulation and water availability at a large basin level with a monthly time step this information is extremely important for developing an overview of current water resources condition and identifying regions that demand an in depth analysis many possible applications of this swat model could be predicted including using the model for climate or landuse change research evaluating spatial distribution of blue and green water resources and conducting policy and impact studies it is demonstrated that given current technology for model building and calibration tools and the availability of openly available data a large basin model with high spatial resolution can be built of course increased data availability would aid in making model predictions more accurate and reducing uncertainty the deficiency of this study is that we did not simulate the hydrological cycle processes in nearest years due to data limitations the future research direction is the simulated years can be extended and water resources changes can be predicted under changing circumstances credit

2531,poyang lake basin has drought prone pattern and floods in recent decades posing a serious threat to water security and human life in this research the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to investigate hydrological parameters characteristics simulating uncertainties as well as spatial and temporal patterns of both blue and green water resources for the whole basin the results revealed a strong correlation between the observed and simulated streamflow at six hydrological stations the overall hydrological water balance analysis showed that 58 1 of annual water yield is contributed by surface runoff while groundwater flow contributes 38 8 of annual water yield the annual average blue water resource was higher accounting for 65 1 of the total water resources green water coefficient was 34 9 for the entire basin varying from 26 to 50 the spatial distribution of blue water resource was uneven in the basin with higher value in parts of the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe subbasins while distribution of green water resource was more homogeneous blue water resource decreased significantly in raohe subbasin with 37 1 mm a whereas having no significant variability in other river basins from 1992 to 2010 the change of green water resource is caused mainly by the increase of green water flow in most subbasins the results provide insights into prediction uncertainty reduction of simulation as well as green and blue water endowments this research is of great significance to improve water resources management in poyang lake basin keywords poyang lake

et al 2019 water resources management is an item of high priority to address water security hydrological models are important tools applied to water resources management to meet various demands abbaspour et al 2009 water resources management and hydrologic modelling research are intrinsically linked to hydrologic cycle processes which have been embedded in hydrologic systems with computer technology as a widely used semi distributed parameter hydrologic model swat arnold et al 1998 which generally subdivides watershed into smaller subbasins has a growing number of applications for addressing water resources management ranging from basins to continental scales some researchers reported successful application of swat for streamflow simulation and water balance assessment takele et al 2021 used swat to analyze the correlation between the observed and simulated streamflow and water balance components of the upper blue nile basin li et al 2017 simulated the annually average runoff in datong lake polder and combined swat with function analysis method to calculate its minimum ecological water supplement for sustaining the ecological environment the simulation of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution load in bali lake basin was performed with swat to propel water environmental protection planning chen et al 2019 chang 2014 and sun et al 2015 used swat to simulate hydrology of dongting lake basin which has four subbasins at monthly time intervals zhou et al 2021 inputted various rainfall scenarios to swat to simulate runoff quantity for multiple watershed scales liang et al 2021 used three optimization algorithms based on swat to identify sensitivity parameters and analyze model uncertainty in yalong river basin of southwestern china li et al 2021 constructed swat to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of ecological flow of hanjiang river with the future land use and climate change scenario besides a number of works on the evaluation of blue water and green water emerged in 2010 s given that the spatial occurrences of water resources within most watersheds are not properly known gull and shah 2020 the swat was constructed to simulate the hydrology cycle process and evaluate spatio temporal variation of blue and green water resources xie et al 2019 gao et al 2021 some also model the entire basin to assess the impact of climate change on blue green water resources jiang et al 2021 mengistu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the application of swat to the simulation of streamflow and distribution of blue and green water resources has been studied extensively lake basin water balance analysis is an important research topic in the hydrological study as well however the majority of cases have focused on a single river basin and few studies have been conducted on large lake basin with multiple river systems in recent years extreme floods or drought has occurred in poyang lake basin which can lead to significant socioeconomic losses and environmental stress cai et al 2011 legesse et al 2004 shankman et al 2012 and threaten the life of ten million residents in surrounding region li and zhang 2015 additionally the shifts between drying and wetting of this basin are associated with water storage and then affects lake hydrological behavior and the security and ecology in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the 1990 s poyang lake basin shows frequent severe floods and droughts occurred frequently after 2003 guo et al 2012 shankman et al 2012 from 2006 to 2007 a water shortage occurred due to continuous decline in water level causing great threat to water use of large numbers of people increasingly severe shortage of water resources occurred especially in dry season lai et al 2013 in the past couple of years poyang lake routinely fluctuates in size the water level of poyang lake reached 22 6 m in july 2020 surpassing the previous record of 22 52 m reached in 1998 however the lake reached the other extreme in september 2022 its water level fell to 7 10 m and was the lowest since records began in 1951 the lake which supposed to be in wet period has set the earliest record for entering an extremely dry season evaluation of water balance and hydrological characteristics in poyang lake basin could help predict water quantity and flooding and water shortages xu et al 2014 dessie et al 2015 ye et al 2016 previous studies have developed simulation models to access water quantity in poyang lake such as mike 21 li et al 2017 xin anjiang lv et al 2014 and efdc li et al 2016 reasonable matches to observation data were established with certain calibration effort and the models collectively revealed valuable insights into the lake s characteristic however no previous attempts have been made to screen the whole of poyang lake basin using swat due to its immense size frequent occurrence of drought and flood coupled with the impact of climate change brings great challenges to poyang lake basin the variability and uncertainty in water quantity will have a great impact on the allocation and management of water resources in this basin in order to predict the amount of water resources and address water management issues this study constructs a swat model of poyang lake basin to simulate main hydrological parameters characteristics and spatial distributions of blue and green water resources in the whole basin the model was calibrated and validated using sufi 2 in swap cup there are two innovative points in this study 1 determining a sensitivity parameter set adapted to the whole basin and its five rivers parts 2 analyzing the water balance and spatial temporal distribution of blue and green water resources across the whole basin at sub basin level and its five rivers parts the results obtained in this paper are expected to provide theoretical support for water resources decision makers and improve water resources management of poyang lake basin 2 study area the poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china located at the middle reaches and southern bank of yangtze river the geographical extent of whole basin is from 113 35 e to 118 29 e and from 24 29 n to 30 05 n as shown in fig 1 a the total drainage area of the water systems of the poyang lake basin is 1 63 105 km2 accounting for 9 of the drainage area of the yangtze river basin the boundary of the basin is almost identifical to the jiangxi province and its area accounts for nearly 96 85 of the land area of jiangxi the basin is bounded by hubei and anhui from the north fujian from the east guangdong from the south and hunan from the west fig 1a the headwaters of the poyang lake basin are located in surrounding mountains with high local relief with peaks 2000 m elevation the whole basin is divided into five rivers parts i e the raohe xinjiang ganjiang xiushui and fuhe subbasins each with an area of 14218 km2 15535 km2 80948 km2 13462 km2 15811 km2 respectively the five rivers flow into poyang lake within the basin and discharge to the yangtze river this basin situated in a typical subtropical monsoon climate has highly seasonal temperatures the average annual temperature is 17 2 c with june august average of 27 3 c and december february average of 7 1 c the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1049 mm year with the highest rates occurring during may to september poyang lake basin is the richest area of precipitation in the yangtze river basin the amount of areal average annual precipitation is 1654 mm of which 55 in march to june the rainfall in the basin was distributed unevenly among the seasons long term average seasonal rainfall was 640 19 mm in spring march to may 564 52 mm in summer june to august 226 15 mm in autumn september to november and 227 81 mm in winter december to february accounting for 38 59 34 03 13 63 and 13 73 of the total annual respectively 70 of the rainfall occurred in spring and summer streamflow demonstrates a distinct seasonal variation in the basin with mean monthly runoff varying between 0 34 107 and 16 4 108 m3 d according to the average values for the period 1953 to 2010 zhang et al 2014 monthly total precipitation of poyang lake basin increases from april to june leading to an increase in discharge from the upstream rivers with high water level 8 8 m on average subsequently discharge gradually decreases and the lowest water level in poyang lake basin usually occurs in january land cover within the basin is dominated by forest 62 3 followed by agriculture 26 4 and grassland 4 5 while the remaining 2 8 of the study area is covered with other land cover classes fig 2a depicts the spatial variations of landuse classes in the study basin the soil type in the area is dominated by haplic acrisols 66 1 followed by cumulic anthrosols 21 9 the remaining soil groups include haplic alisols 3 1 haplic luvisols 1 7 and a very small amount of other 11 soil groups 7 2 the spatial distribution of the soil groups is shown in fig 2b 3 methods 3 1 the swat model swat is a semi distributed dynamic and physically based tool that can be used to perform long term continuous simulation of watershed hydrology arnold et al 1998 gassman and reyes 2007 it is a basin scale simulation model that operates on daily and hourly time step which has been widely used to access the impact of land management practices on water movement sediment movement crop growth and nutrient cycling in large complex watersheds zhang et al 2012 characteristics of this flow model contains several hydrologic components such as surface runoff stream flow non empirical recharge estimates snow cover and snow melt interception storage infiltration evaporation and reservoir water balance and shallow and deep aquifers swat uses a typical setup with two phases equation 1 describes a rainfall runoff phase based on a water balance for each subbasin neitsch et al 2011 a routing phase connects all subbasins to produce spatially explicit outputs at the subbasin outlet sw t sw t δt rday t qsurf t ea t wseep t qlat t qgw t 1 where sw t is the final soil water content in mm on day t sw t δt is the initial soil water content in mm on day t δt rday qsurf ea wseep qlat and qgw represent the amount of precipitation mm surface runoff mm evapotranspiration mm percolation mm lateral flow from soil to channel and groundwater flow mm respectively hydrologic routines accounts for water balance including vadose zone processes and basin wide management assessments with a multi component basin water budget equation 1 determines the change in the soil water content for each day based on a daily calculation of the hydrological processes in the hru the hydrological processes in the soil include lateral flow return flow tile drainage shallow aquifer recharge moisture redistribution and so on soil conservation service curve number scs cn method can estimate surface runoff volume and penman monteith equation can estimate potential evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2011 shi et al 2011 a kinematic storage model is used to predict lateral flow form the soil whereas return flow simulated by creating a shallow aquifersis arnold et al 1998 the variable storage routing method is used for channel water routing outflow from a channel is adjusted for transmission losses evaporation diversions and return flow each soil type is divided into different soil layers and the soil water content is calculated for each soil layer separately and subsequently summed swat uses readily available input data such as climate data soil properties topography and landuse within the watershed this model has been developed and validated at larger scales xu et al 2020 the swat model was used to quantify the blue and green water resources falkenmark first proposed new conceptualization of blue water resource and green water resource to distinguish liquid water and moisture in the unsaturated zone falkenmark 1995 the blue and green water concept has been extended for better water planning and management falkenmark and rockström 2006 according to the hydrological processes and storage type involved blue and green water are two kinds of freshwater cycle blue water flow streams through either on or below the land surface in this study blue water flow refers to the water in rivers lakes wetlands and shallow aquifers green water is the portion of precipitation stored in unsaturated soil or remains temporarily on top of the soil or vegetation and later returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration falkenmark and rockström 2006 differentiate between two components of green water which are green water storage and green water flow green water storage equals soil moisture and green water flow equals the actual evapotranspiration blue water flow can be qualified by the sum of water yield and deep aquifer recharge expressed as wyld and da rchg respectively in model output green water storage and green water flow actual evapotranspiration constitute green water green water coefficient gwc is defined as the ratio of green water resource to total water flow which can be used to access the distribution of blue and green water resources in the basin liu et al 2009 the temporal heterogeneity of blue and green water resources is qualified by using simple linear regression model which is represented by 2 y β 0 β 1 x where x is the value of the independent variable y is the value of the dependent variable β 0 is a constant and β 1 is the regression coefficient 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sufi 2 is a combined optimization approach abbaspour et al 2007 in the swat cup software package developed by swiss federal research institute of water science and technology sufi 2 can conduct a sensitivity analysis to categorise main parameters by using latin hypercube random sampling technique abbaspour et al 2007 unlike one at a time method sufi 2 uses a global search method to calculate the objective function by solving multiple regressions which is considered as equation abbaspour et al 2015 3 e α i 1 n β i b i where e is the objective function value α is a constant of regression analysis and β is the coefficient of each parameter b the significance of parameter b was identified using the t test a larger absolute value of the t test and a smaller p value 0 05 indicated more sensitive parameters swat contains 210 hydrological parameters identifying the most sensitive input parameters and their ranges is important considering not all of them significantly contribute to streamflow simulation 3 3 model performance evaluation in general the model uncertainties are due to conceptual simplifications boundary conditions parameters model structures input data quality and so on in this study poyang lake basin is a large watershed so it is expected to map all these forms of uncertainties sufi 2 can evaluate swat by performing calibration and uncertainty analysis it runs as the following steps initially it generates multiple sets of parameters according to the initial parameter range the parameter range gets updated every iteration by calculating the sensitivity matrix and new parameter ranges are recommended for another iteration it modifies each parameter range one by one while keeping all other parameters fixed the sensitivity of the changes of objective function is examined we expect to access to the best parameter set and ranges over multiple iterations in this process parameter uncertainty was assumed accompanied by measured data falling into the uncertainty range 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and correlation matrix are calculated after avoiding 5 of poor simulation from the cumulative distribution of the model output in the way of latin hypercube sampling abbaspour et al 2017 the performance of model calibration and validation is expressed as p factor and r factor the p factor accounts for all uncertainties associated with swat model reflected as the observed data falling into 95 ppu range the value of p factor varies from 0 to 1 a higher value of p factor represents less uncertainty of model output and most of measured data captured by 95 ppu a value 1 indicates that all of measured data comes under 95 ppu getting a perfect model simulation considering the uncertainty the r factor is the average width of the 95 ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured variable a low value suggests the band width of the 95 ppu smaller and less uncertainty in the output the width of the 95 ppu should be smaller than the standard deviation of the measured data abbaspour et al 2015 the value of p factor increases at the expense of a larger r factor so the two factors have to be balanced to bracket most of the observed data within the 95 ppu the best simulation can be determined when both the two indices have ideal value and the current parameter ranges can be regarded as the calibrated process for discharge a value of 0 7 or 0 75 for p factor is adequate and a value of 1 5 for r factor would be desirable abbaspour et al 2007 the value of r factor is calculated as follows 4 d 1 n t 1 n y t i 97 5 m y t i 92 5 m 5 r f a c t o r d σ o where n is the observed sample numbers y t i 97 5 m and y t i 92 5 m mean 97 5 upper and 92 5 lower level of the cumulative distribution of simulations and σ o is the standard deviation of observations sufi 2 allows the usage of r2 nse and pbias as objective functions r2 the coefficient of determination is a measure to denote the linear relationship between model outcomes and the observed data krause et al 2005 nse measures the predictive skill of hydrological models by relating the goodness of fit of the model to the variance of the measured data gupta et al 1999 krause et al 2005 paul and negahban azar 2018 in this study we used the above three indices for discharge 6 r 2 i 1 11 o i p 0 p i p 0 i 1 n o i p 0 2 i 1 n p i p 0 2 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i i 2 i 1 n o i p o 2 8 pbias t 1 t p i t p o t t 1 t p o t 100 where o i is the observed discharges p i is the simulated discharges p o is the mean of discharges and t is the observed time the range of r2 lies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 represents the desperation of the prediction can be explained totally by that of the observation whereas 0 zero means no correlation between modeled output and the observed data the value of nse varies from to 1 nse equals 1 suggests a perfect model with an estimation error variance equal to zero an efficiency 0 when a modeled time series with an estimation error variance is significantly larger than that of the observations values of the r2 and nse nearer to 1 indicates a model with more predictive skill the lower absolute pbias values are preferred and the optimal value of it is 0 positive values indicate overestimation bias while negative values indicate model underestimation bias gupta et al 1999 table 1 shows the model evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 model setup for this study a swat model was developed to simulate monthly streamflow in the poyang lake basin table 2 summarizes the data used for the model development digital elevation model is an important data to set up the swat model since all the topographic attributes of the basin would affect the hydrological response units hrus these hrus are the product of overlaying of slope soils and land use and similar hrus would have similar hydrologic characteristics arnold et al 2011 neitsch et al 2011 winchell et al 2013 for this study a 30 metre spatial resolution aster gdem dem was used as an input dataset the area threshold value was set to 65000 this basin is delineated into 143 subbasins based on the topography which include total 1567 hrus in the model fig 2 the land use soil slope combination defined in hrus was allocated by land use 20 soil 10 and slope 10 thresholds to produce each response unit successful execution of terrain processing module and actual river network of arcswat interface led to generation of appropriate database for the subbasin parameters and a detailed topographic report of the watershed land use and land cover lulc and soil also have major influence in basin hydrology lulc and soil map along with their respective lookup tables prepared earlier were supplied to the model for reclassification according to swat coding convention michael mamo and jain 2013 the original lulc data has 19 types being reclassified into 6 swat categories subsequently the soil map was taken from the soil databases that was produced by the nanjing institute of soil science the properties of each soil type were determined based on fao 90 and 72 soil forms were identified in the study basin then the soil forms were grouped into 15 soil groups and mapped for the area the spatial variations of the major lulc and soil groups of the basin are depicted in fig 3 the values of available water capacity sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and moist bulk density sol bd were calculated by using the soil plant atmosphere water spaw software all the required climatic variables were fed to the model such as daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation average wind speed and relative humidity data the weather generator tool in the swat software was assigned to fill in missing data for certain periods of time from a long term daily precipitation rate and maximum and minimum temperature neitsch et al 2011 this study relies on meteorological stations inside the basin as seen in fig 1b the long term daily meteorological data covering a 21 year observation period from the year 1990 to the year 2010 are available from 83 meteorological stations along the poyang lake basin after all the above processes were completed the swat simulation could be activated we divide the time scale into the warmup period from the year 1990 to the year 1991 and model simulation period from the year 1992 to the year 2010 the streamflow data from six hydrological stations were divided into two one for calibration and the other for validation six hydrological stations covered different rivers parts of poyang lake basin and can therefore suitably represent the flow of water resources through the whole basin the description of hydrological stations can be seen in table 3 the framework showing major procedures in the simulation process is summarized in fig 4 4 2 model evaluation a total of 1000 model simulations were run to conduct parameter sensitivity analysis in this study thirteen parameters were selected to cover different hydrological processes in the poyang lake basin see table 4 the final sensitivities of thirteen parameters applied for monthly predictions are ranked in table 5 with the most sensitive parameter given rank 1 and the least one given rank 13 the four parameters cn2 slsubbsn sol k and ch k2 have low p values p 0 05 and large t stat values indicating the top sensitive parameters to streamflow output fig 5 li 2018 analyzed different parameter sets for several subbasins of poyang lake basin which was more complicated and less practical than this study as mentioned in 3 1 cn2 a key parameter in the scs method in swat could represent the permeability of the land surface and the potential maximum soil moisture retention capacity and was supposed as the most sensitive parameter as expected cn2 was the most sensitive parameter with much higher t stat values in this study the generation of surface runoff is extremely crucial for streamflow in the poyang lake basin we can see a clear trend that as the value of cn2 increased nse value increased slsubbsn which represents the average slope length of subbasin ranked second in all of parameters as an indicator of effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 showed stream groundwater relationships sol k is related to groundwater seepage to streamflow the remaining parameters caused no significant changes in streamflow output with p 0 05 and had no significant effect on model simulations the canmx was found to have the least significant effect on streamflow with a large p value the last iteration of sufi 2 was set to 200 times and scatter plots were created during simulations fig 6 the x axis represents the range of values for key parameters the y axis is the value of nse the four parameters mentioned above were more distinguishable indicating more variant and sensitive than the others the remaining parameters were found to be the primary source of model uncertainties in the poyang lake basin for this study daily streamflow of six hydrological stations was collected for calibration and validation purposes all these stations have data for same years we used fourteen years of the data for calibration and seven years for validation the first 2 years were excluded from the analysis as equilibration period to mitigate the initial conditions due to the large amount of data the daily streamflow is converted into monthly streamflow more than 500 simulations in four iterations were run to achieve the best model performance between the observed and simulated data the best parameter sets selected in the sensitivity analysis in subsection 4 1 were evaluated by model prediction uncertainty and model performance evaluation the graphical comparisons of measured streamflow at the outlets of different basins and its simulated values are shown in fig 7 for the calibration and validation processes the prediction uncertainty in sufi 2 is expressed by the 95 ppu which is represented by the yellow colored region the r factors are all 1 5 and p factors of five outlets are 0 7 this means that 70 of the observed streamflow in outlets is enveloped by the 95 ppu during the calibration 1992 2003 and validation periods 2004 2010 the p factor of dufengkeng station is 0 69 closed to 0 7 which we think is also reasonable therefore all outlets fall in desirable regions of p factor and r factor which could evaluate the model uncertainty during flood periods such as april to july 1995 july to august 1996 july to august 1996 june to august 1998 july to august 1999 and june to july 2010 runoff peaked in poyang lake basin which can be well reproduced by the simulation fig 7 similarly regarding the model performance evaluation the model performance indicators are given in table 6 compared with existing hydrologic modelling in big basin using swat abbaspour et al 2015 the results showed good agreement between simulated and observed data in this study the overall performance of the model in terms of r2 and nse for the monthly time steps has quite satisfactory results for the poyang lake basin for the calibration period r2 at six stations ranged from 0 89 to 0 96 fig 8 which means the model was able to capture runoff very well nse values ranged from 0 82 to 0 94 the final validation values were simulated reasonably with regression slope of 0 81 0 95 fig 9 nse values ranged from 0 77 to 0 92 swat model can capture the basin s hydrologic characteristics well and reproduce acceptable monthly runoff simulations the simulation results show that all the performance indicators in hushan station and wanjiabu station for both the calibration and validation periods are in very good ranges r2 0 7 nse 0 75 pbias 10 the negative values of pbias for dufengkeng station and lijiadu station represent the model underestimation bias while positive values in the remaining stations indicate model overestimation bias we can see the output results of 95 ppu and the best fit through the simulation run with the best parameters values and objective function value at each station this study has better simulation effects with higher values of r2 and nse than the model simulations in ma and wang 2015 it should be kept in mind that all six discharge outlets were parameterized and optimized simultaneously and there is a good agreement between the measured and simulated discharge this results in an overall good simulation and better provides support for the study of the entire basin 4 3 quantification of water resources and water balance based on the simulated total discharge evapotranspiration precipitation and water yield of the swat model the water balance of the poyang lake basin was analyzed the results indicated that the contribution of surface runoff sur q lateral flow lat q and groundwater flow gw q for the annual water yield wyld was 58 1 1 0 and 38 8 respectively this illustrates that the surface runoff contributes more to the basin than other components the lateral flow is a relatively minor component of the hydrological budget which is consistent with the review of the australian literature ticehurst 2004 land cover within the basin is dominated by forest and the soil type is dominated by acrisols the incorporation of the activity of roots in forest coverage area and abundant organic matter in acrisols could result in a relatively high permeability to promote lateral flow formation however the proportion of lateral flow in water yield was relatively small within the basin compared with that in other areas luo and tao 2018 zhou et al 2011 this may be related to the high slopes 15 25 of forest within the basin chen et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 the spatial distribution of blue green water and total water flow sum of green and blue flows in the poyang lake basin are mapped in fig 10 the results showed a wide range of spatial variation of blue water resources blue water flow were larger in the east and north regions of ganjiang subbasin the west regions of xinjiang subbasin and the east regions of raohe subbasin fig 10a which was consistent with the findings of cui 2020 at the basin scale the annual blue water varied from approximately 1000 to 2147 mm green water resource was distributed homogeneously among different subbasins fig 10c the coefficients of variations cv in standard deviation divided by mean for blue water resource fig 10b were higher than that for green water resource across fig 10d the whole basin precipitation greatly affects the temporal variation of blue water while green water is affected by land cover and soil type yin et al 2022 the values of field capacity in most areas of poyang lake basin are relatively high 0 39 m3 m 3 in china wu et al 2018 indicates that the green water is stable hence the change of green water resource is relatively stable than that of blue water resource in this basin the higher cv of blue water was observed in the upper reaches which can be attributed to catchment size ning et al 2018 the higher cv of green water was observed in the agriculture coverage area which indicated the agriculture had a lower ecosystem resistance and higher irrigation demand than forest coverage the total water resources were higher in poyang lake east and northwest of ganjiang subbasin and west of xinjiang subbasin whereas the north regions of xiushui subbasin and northwest of poyang lake area suffered water scarcities fig 10e the annual average green water was estimated to be 700 800 mm a 1 for the period 1992 2010 accounting for 34 9 of the total water flow this is close to the estimate of 39 reported by lv et al 2017 the green water coefficient varied between 26 and 50 for the entire basin fig 10f high green water proportion are mainly found in poyang lake and the southern part of ganjiang subbasin there is clear consistent of coefficients of variations in blue and green water resources in ganjiang subbasin fig 11 further reveals the blue and green water resources across five subbasins from 1992 to 2010 fig 12 shows the trends of the blue and green water resources in five subbasins within poyang lake basin with respect to time at the annual scales from 1992 to 2010 for the raohe subbasin fig 12a the annual average blue water resource was 1542 mm a which accounted for 68 1 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 721 mm a which accounted for 31 9 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that blue water resources decreased significantly from 1992 to 2010 p 0 05 with a change rate of 37 1 mm a the green water flow and green water resources increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 34 1 mm 10a and 23 8 mm 10a respectively green water storage showed no significant variability trend therefore the change of green water resources of raohe subbasin is mainly caused by the increase of green water flow for the xiushui subbasin fig 12b the annual average blue water resource was 1321 mm a which accounted for 64 3 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 735 mm a which accounted for 35 7 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that the blue water resources and green water storage have no significant variability trend whereas the green water flow and green water resources increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 23 8 mm 10a and 34 1 mm 10a respectively the increase of green water flow leads to an increase of green water resources for the xinjiang subbasin fig 12c the annual average blue water resource was 1539 8 mm a which accounted for 66 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 792 mm a which accounted for 34 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that only the green water storage increased significantly from 1992 to 2010 p 0 05 with a change rate of 11 2 mm 10a the blue water resources green water storage and green water resources all showed no significant variability trend for the ganjiang subbasin fig 12d the annual average blue water resource was 1507 6 mm a which accounted for 63 2 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resources was 899 mm a which accounted for 36 8 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that the blue water resources and green water storage have no significant variability trend whereas the green water flow and green water resources increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 56 4 mm 10a and 63 1 mm 10a respectively therefore the change of green water resources of ganjiang subbasin in recent years is mainly caused by the increase of green water flow for the fuhe subbasin fig 12e the annual average blue water resource was 1188 6 mm a which accounted for 60 5 of the annual average total water resources and the annual average green water resource was 775 5 mm a which accounted for 39 5 of the annual average total water resources simple linear regression equation showed that the blue water resource and green water storage have no significant variability trend whereas the green water flow and green water resource increased significantly p 0 05 with a change rate of 54 8 mm 10a and 64 4 mm 10a respectively the increase of green water flow leads to an increase of green water resources the most severe floods in the poyang lake occurred in 1998 1999 and 2010 whereas extreme drought occurred in 2004 2007 2008 and 2009 the changes of the blue water resource with respect to time were relatively similar to the annual events of severe floods or droughts in these five subbasins 5 conclusion in this study a hydrologic model of poyang lake basin was built using the well established swat model the model was calibrated for six hydrological stations the program sufi 2 in swat cup package was used for parameter sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis calibration and validation only readily available daily streamflow data were used for model setup as well as model calibration and validation the final model results for the freshwater availability components blue water flow green water resources and green water coefficient are presented the sensitivity analysis indicated that the cn2 slsubbsn sol k and ch k2 were the important parameters for the swat model particular attention was paid to clearly quantify and illustrate the 95 prediction uncertainty of the model output which turned out to be fairly small in some cases the results showed good agreement between the simulated and observed monthly streamflow in this study compared with existing hydrologic modelling in big basin it is obvious that sufi 2 has high efficiency to yield a reasonable prediction uncertainty calibration and uncertainty analysis are linked intimately and calibration results are presented with a quantification of model prediction uncertainty this study obtains better simulation effects with higher values of r2 and nse the spatial temporal heterogeneity of blue and green water resources was presented for the entire river basin at sub basin level and five river subbasins the annual average blue water resource was higher than green water resource accounting for 65 1 of the total blue and green water resources the blue water flow and total water resources were higher in ganjiang and xinjiang subbasins green water resource was distributed more homogeneously than blue water resource among different subbasins from 1992 to 2010 the blue water resources decreased significantly in raohe subbasin whereas having no significant variability in other river basins the change of green water resources is mainly caused by the increase of green water flow in most river subbasins during this period except that the green water flow and green water resources in the xinjiang subbasin had no significant variability trend overall this study provides significant insights into streamflow simulation and water availability at a large basin level with a monthly time step this information is extremely important for developing an overview of current water resources condition and identifying regions that demand an in depth analysis many possible applications of this swat model could be predicted including using the model for climate or landuse change research evaluating spatial distribution of blue and green water resources and conducting policy and impact studies it is demonstrated that given current technology for model building and calibration tools and the availability of openly available data a large basin model with high spatial resolution can be built of course increased data availability would aid in making model predictions more accurate and reducing uncertainty the deficiency of this study is that we did not simulate the hydrological cycle processes in nearest years due to data limitations the future research direction is the simulated years can be extended and water resources changes can be predicted under changing circumstances credit

2532,identifying groundwater flow directions and the locations of recharge and discharge areas is critical for effective groundwater management groundwater flow directions the concavity and the locations of extrema i e minima and maxima can be assessed using the first and second derivatives of the hydraulic head surface we developed a geostatistical method to jointly simulate hydraulic head and its first and second derivatives using sequential gaussian simulation the derivative values were used to identify regional groundwater flow directions and the second derivative test was used to probabilistically map the concavity and the locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface by comparing the mapped concavity and extrema to known features it was possible to attribute areas of recharge and discharge to physical features of the system such as rivers lakes and geological outcrops this was applied to triassic aquifers in the galilee basin queensland australia to delineate the likely recharge and discharge areas this provided an objective assessment of likely recharge and discharge zones and their uncertainty which is an important addition to a region where the hydrogeology has been the subject of much conjecture keywords kriging hydrogeology sequential gaussian simulation galilee basin hydraulic gradient data availability data included in supporting information code available as an online resource 1 introduction hydraulic head gradients are important in hydrogeological studies as they are proportional to the rate of groundwater flow and control the flow directions which provides critical information for understanding groundwater systems pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 however hydraulic head measurements are typically sparsely distributed point measurements rau et al 2019 which can make interpretation of hydraulic gradients challenging to address these challenges philip and kitanidis 1989 provided a modified form of ordinary kriging that allowed for the direct estimation of hydraulic head gradients from sparse hydraulic head observations they applied their approach to estimate the regional groundwater flow directions in the wolfcamp aquifer in northern texas usa pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 further developed this approach using universal kriging to account for a systematic trend in the mean the benefits of geostatistical approaches over other techniques for mapping hydraulic head gradients e g numerical modelling include that they are generalisable do not require specification of boundary conditions or geological properties and can provide quantitative estimates of uncertainty however the results are dependent on the semi variogram model and fitting a representative model can be challenging when working with small datasets goovaerts 1997 additionally the grid resolution and number of realisations influence model run times as can be the case with numerical modelling developing conceptual models of groundwater systems including by mapping groundwater flow directions and locations of recharge and discharge areas is critical for effective groundwater management enemark et al 2019 thomann et al 2020 the concavity i e concave up or concave down and the locations of extrema i e minima maxima or inflection points in the hydraulic head surface see fig 1 can be identified using information from the first and second derivatives of the inferred hydraulic head surface although previous work has used kriging to estimate the first derivatives of hydraulic head surface e g philip and kitanidis 1989 pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 no studies have used geostatistics to calculate higher order derivatives and use these to map concavity and extrema in the hydraulic head surface herein we extend the work of philip and kitanidis 1989 and pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 to simulate realisations of the first and second derivatives of the hydraulic head surface using sequential gaussian simulation we show how realisations of the derivatives of hydraulic heads can be used to probabilistically map the locations of extrema and concavity of the hydraulic head surface which can subsequently be compared with known surface features e g rivers lakes geological outcrops to identify plausible recharge and discharge areas we apply the technique to sparsely distributed hydraulic head data from the triassic aquifers of the galilee basin in queensland australia this provides an objective assessment of the likely recharge and discharge areas for the triassic aquifers of the galilee basin which is vital to inform the ongoing debate regarding the hydrogeology of the region currell et al 2020 the approaches presented here represent a significant advancement in the use of hydraulic head data to map recharge and discharge areas 2 methods 2 1 hydraulic head and derivative simulation consider the random function z u observed at a set of coordinates u e g u 1 x 1 y 1 of shape n 2 a single realisation of plausible values z u k at a set of m unobserved locations u can be found using sequential gaussian simulation goovaerts 1997 sequential gaussian simulation is an iterative process where first a coordinate u i is randomly selected from the set u next simple kriging is used to estimate the mean cressie 1990 goovaerts 1997 1 z u i λ t z u 1 n λ t 1 n μ where λ c u u i c u u i σ 2 1 c u u i is the covariance between u and u i c u u is the covariance between u 1 n is a vector of ones of length n σ 2 is a vector of the variance associated with each observation and μ is a constant known mean the σ 2 term regularises the model to prioritise fitting higher quality measurements i e low variance measurements over those of lesser quality i e high variance measurements the variance of the hydraulic head timeseries available for each well can be assigned based on the measurement metadata e g elevation survey method water level measurement method see rau et al 2019 and post and von asmuth 2013 and the temporal variability in the hydrograph see keegan treloar et al 2021 alternately σ 2 can be set to a constant value if all measurements have comparable error or to 0 if the value is known exactly e g from a computer simulation μ can be chosen based on known values e g if the function is known to converge towards a constant value the arithmetic mean of the observation values or the best linear unbiased estimate cressie 1990 goovaerts 1997 the best linear unbiased estimate is defined as cressie 1990 2 μ 1 n c u u i σ 2 1 t z u 1 n c u u i σ 2 1 t 1 n the variance associated with estimates from eq 1 is calculated as cressie 1990 goovaerts 1997 3 σ 2 u i c u i u i λ t c u u i once z u i and σ 2 u i have been estimated a value z u i is randomly drawn from a normal distribution 4 z u i n z u i σ 2 u i z u i is then treated as an observed value by appending z u i to z u u i to u and 0 to σ 2 eq 1 3 and 4 are repeated until z u i has been simulated for the m locations in u note eq 2 is only applied on the first iteration to estimate a stationary value of μ from z u the term kriging is a synonym for what is known as gaussian processes in the machine learning community rasmussen and williams 2006 the derivative of a gaussian process is itself a gaussian process and consequently gaussian processes can be used to estimate the derivatives of a function solak et al 2003 rasmussen and williams 2006 duvenaud 2014 estimates of partial derivatives can be obtained by differentiating the covariance and mean functions and kriging as usual philip and kitanidis 1989 pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 duvenaud 2014 as μ is assumed to be constant in eq 1 and the derivative of a constant value is 0 eq 1 simplifies to 5 z u λ t z u where a realisation of the partial derivatives is given by z u z u x z u y 2 z u x 2 2 z u y 2 2 z u x y and 6 λ c u u i σ 2 1 c u u x c u u y 2 c u u x 2 2 c u u y 2 2 c u u x y where c u u x is the derivative of the covariance function with respect to x c u u y is the derivative of the covariance function with respect to y 2 c u u x 2 is the second derivative of the covariance function with respect to the x 2 c u u y 2 is the second derivative of the covariance function with respect to y and 2 c u u x y is the partial derivative of the covariance function with respect x and y note that as the partial derivatives are conditioned solely on z u the kriging can be applied independently for each partial derivative e g using λ c u u i σ 1 c u u x to estimate z u x with eq 5 which may be necessary to preserve computer memory when working with large matrices any covariance function that is at least twice differentiable can be used in this paper we provide the derivatives for the gaussian covariance function see supporting text s1 2 2 locating minima and maxima once a realisation of z u is generated extrema i e minima and maxima in the hydraulic head surface can be identified using the second derivative test stewart 2010 the locations of critical points are identified by finding where z u x and z u y are equal to 0 as z u x and z u y are simulated at nodes and the zero values may be located between nodes contouring using linear interpolation can be used to approximate the coordinates where z u x and z u y are equal to zero this allows for the coordinates of the critical points to be approximated by finding the intersections of the zero contours for z u x and z u y once these points are identified the hessian determinant h can be used to determine the concavity of the critical points and to classify these as minima concave up maxima concave down or inflection points a change of the concavity from concave up to concave down or vice versa h is calculated as 7 h 2 z u x 2 2 z u y 2 2 z u x y 2 if h 0 then the location can be classified as a minimum if 2 z u x 2 0 or as a maximum if 2 z u x 2 0 if h 0 the location is an inflection point values of h 0 indicate that there is insufficient information to classify the location as a minimum maximum or inflection point 2 3 identifying boundary effects the hydraulic head gradient perpendicular to the aquifer boundary can be indicative of flow into or out of the aquifer the hydraulic head gradient perpendicular to an aquifer boundary can be assessed at nodes in u closest to the boundary using z u x z u y and the angle θ projected perpendicular to the boundary the resultant r of the vectors z u x and z u y can be found using 8 r z u x c o s θ z u y s i n θ where r 0 represents flow towards the boundary and out of the aquifer r 0 represents inflow into the aquifer from the boundary and r 0 represents no flow across the boundary where the hydraulic head gradient across the boundary is steep this may be indicative of either high groundwater inflow outflow or low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material according to darcy s law values of θ can be identified using geometrically from a polygon of the aquifer boundary first all nodes within a specified buffer distance are selected leading to k nodes denoted here as u b next each node of u b given by u b i x i y i recalling i 1 k is projected orthogonally onto the nearest segment of the boundary polygon the orthogonal projections onto each boundary segment are x p x 1 x 2 x 1 t and y p y 1 y 2 y 1 t where t is given by 9 t x i x 1 x 2 x 1 y i y 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 2 y 2 y 1 2 where the coordinates x 1 y 1 x 2 and y 2 are the vertices of each face of the boundary polygon the nearest boundary segment s to each node can be identified using the condition h min h where h x i x p 2 y i y p 2 and the resulting projections x p and y p are calculated with the equations x p x i x p x i and y p y i y p y i the angle of u b i projected on the boundary is obtained as θ i a t a n 2 y p y i x p x i where a t a n 2 is a modified version of a r c t a n which handles special cases to ensure the resulting vector is oriented correctly with respect to the unit circle this process is repeated for all nodes in u b yielding θ θ 1 θ k 3 case study of the galilee basin australia 3 1 study site and data description we applied the method described above in the galilee basin queensland australia which is part of the great artesian basin the galilee basin outcrops to the east and is overlain by the eromanga basin to the west moya et al 2016 the stratigraphy of the galilee basin is composed of triassic aged formations that overlie deeper permian aged formations the aquifers of the triassic and permian aged formations are composed mostly of sandstones separated by aquitards of siltstones and mudstones moya et al 2016 the permian aged formations contain coal seams and are the target of proposed open cut and underground mining including the carmichael coal mine fig 2 currell et al 2020 and keegan treloar et al 2021 provide further details of the mine and surrounding hydrogeology the shallower triassic aged formations have been hypothesised to provide a source of water to the culturally and ecologically significant doongmabulla springs complex currell et al 2020 amongst alternative possible source aquifers given the potential impacts of mining developments in the area characterising the regional hydrogeology including the groundwater flow directions and the locations of likely recharge and discharge areas is of critical importance the triassic formations have a good spatial distribution of hydraulic head data to the east where landholders target the upper formations for water supply primarily for stock and domestic use fig 2 however fewer measurements are available to the west where the galilee basin is overlain by the eromanga basin and the triassic formations are at substantial depth in this study hydraulic head data were collated from the queensland groundwater database https qldspatial information qld gov au catalogue the queensland department of state development 2018 and aecom 2021 hydrographs were plotted and a single value was selected as the representative steady state water level for each well following the approach used by keegan treloar et al 2021 see figures s1 s9 the steady state assumption was assumed to be reasonable as there was limited groundwater extraction mainly just stock and domestic use and at mine site dewatering had not yet impacted the triassic formations in total there were 81 hydraulic head observations in the triassic formations ranging from 227 23 m to 352 66 m above the australian height datum see table s1 3 2 hydraulic head and derivative simulation the hydraulic head and derivative simulations of the galilee basin were run using python using libraries that come with a standard anaconda installation in the simulations a regular grid u was defined with 1000 m intervals in the and y directions the 1000 m interval was selected to ensure reasonable model run times given the large extent of the study area see fig 2 the global mean was calculated using the best linear unbiased estimate eq 2 and 100 realisations of hydraulic head and partial derivatives were generated the minima maxima and the concavity of the hydraulic head surface were mapped using the hydraulic head and partial derivatives realisations and a polygon of the aquifer boundary was determined as per the methods described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 preliminary geostatistical data analysis the d agostino and pearson 1973 test was applied to the null hypothesis of the hydraulic head data being normally distributed and the null hypothesis could not be rejected using a significance level of 0 05 p 0 89 k 0 23 the experimental semi variance of the hydraulic head data was estimated using the gstat library pebesma 2004 in r a gaussian semi variogram model was then fitted to the experimental semi variance by minimising the sum of the squared differences following philip and kitanidis 1989 and pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 the semi variogram model was separated into a continuous model the gaussian semi variogram model and a discontinuous model the nugget effect semi variogram model this was necessary as the spatial variability must be continuous including at the origin for the derivatives to be calculated philip and kitanidis 1989 the continuous semi variogram model was converted to a covariance model using the relationship that the semi variogram is equal to the sill minus the covariance the sill of the discontinuous model was used to parameterise σ 2 which regularises the kriging model to avoid overfitting uncertain observations see eq 1 and essentially filters out the measurement error see philip and kitanidis 1989 the resulting semi variogram models shown in fig 3 were composed of a nugget model with a sill of 32 m2 and gaussian model with a range of 27 072 m and a sill of 506 m2 4 2 hydraulic head predictions following the preliminary geostatistical analysis 100 realisations of hydraulic head and partial derivatives of hydraulic head were generated using sequential gaussian simulation the variability between realisations can be attributed to the values at model nodes being simulated sequentially by drawing from a normal distribution parametrised by the estimated mean and variance for a randomly selected node this was followed by treating the simulated value as an observation that was included in the simulation of subsequent nodes as described in section 2 1 fig 4 a and fig 4b show contours of hydraulic head for realisations 1 and 2 respectively as shown the realisations have the largest differences in the areas where there are few hydraulic observations and small differences near hydraulic head observations this is expected as the model is conditioned on the hydraulic head observations such that predictions made close to observed data will closely match the observed values alternatively the prediction uncertainty will increase further away from observations leading to a larger range of plausible values fig 4c shows the average hydraulic head of all realisations contoured over a heat map of the standard deviation of all realisations as shown the standard deviation is low e g 0 5 m close to observations and higher up to 25 m further away from the observations i e in the north west and south west of the study area we elected to hash out areas where the standard deviation was greater or equal to 15 m as predictions and inferences of extrema or concavity in these areas were highly uncertain the contour where the standard deviation in the hydraulic head equals 10 m is also shown with a dotted line the average hydraulic head is higher to the north east and south east and lower in the central eastern area near the aquifer boundary fig 4c as water flows from high to low hydraulic head it appears that recharge areas are in the north eastern and south eastern areas while discharge occurs mainly in the central eastern area coinciding with the doongmabulla springs complex and the carmichael river and the proposed site of the carmichael coal mine fig 2 there is also indication of boundary inflows in the south west and outflows to the north west although these areas are highly uncertain σ 10 m note that the individual realisations i e fig 4a and b show substantial variability in flow direction inferred as flow perpendicular to the hydraulic head contours near and through the boundary relative to that shown in the averaged results fig 4c similarly the locations of likely recharge and discharge areas are variable between realisations e g the recharge area in fig 4a is further east in fig 4b as there is significant variability between realisations and it is unfeasible to examine all realisations in detail an alternative approach is required to interpret the regional flow directions and likely recharge and discharge zones 4 3 minima and maxima in the hydraulic head surface extrema minima maxima and inflection points in the hydraulic head surface were identified see section 2 2 and assigned to nodes within a 5000 m radius this approach allows a comparison between realisations by counting the frequency of each grid node being proximal to an extremum the buffer size of 5000 m was chosen after testing a wide range of values such that it created visible zones where extrema in hydraulics heads were obtained additionally the component of flow orthogonal to the boundary was used to classify boundary nodes as minima flow out of the boundary maxima flow in through the boundary or neither flow is parallel to the boundary as described in section 2 3 these were discrete classifications i e minima maxima or neither and did not consider the magnitude of the gradient both in and out of the boundary or the steepness of the surface around the minima or maxima fig 5 b and c show realisations of hydraulic head with the locations of minima red areas and maxima blue areas the arrows are shown every 10 nodes along the boundary to indicate if flow is in maxima or out minima some extrema occur frequently between realisations e g r2 and d4 in fig 5b and fig 5c while other extrema occur less frequently e g r3 r4 r5 and d3 in fig 5c are not present in fig 5b the flow directions orthogonal to the boundary suggest flow is out through most of the eastern boundary red pixels and arrows fig 5a c however areas to the south in fig 5b and fig 5c and two areas to the north in fig 5c suggest inwards flows blue pixels and arrows all 100 realisations annotated with minima and maxima are provided online https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 20225571 v1 the summary of results represented in fig 5a shows the relative percentage of realisations i e total minimum total maximum total realisations 100 where each node is a minimum red or maximum blue from the 100 realisations the relative percentage for each node is a continuous index shown with the colour gradation between blue and red ranging from 100 all realisations are minimum to 100 all realisations are maximum with an intermediate value of 0 as shown in fig 5a seven maxima r1 to r7 and four minima d1 to d4 were identified from the analysis of the ensemble the lighter shades of red or blue suggest zones are less common between analyses e g r3 and d3 than those zones with darker shades of red or blue e g d4 of these areas r1 and r7 are likely recharge areas where the triassic formation outcrops along the eastern margin of the basin and where groundwater recharge has been hypothesised to occur evans et al 2018 there is also evidence of flow into the basin along the eastern edge to the north and south near r1 and r7 as shown by the blue arrows the maxima r2 r4 r5 and r6 lie beneath the eromanga basin fig 2 and could represent areas of inter aquifer connectivity where the triassic formations obtain water from the permian formations this interpretation is in agreement with moya et al 2015 who found hydrochemical evidence of mixing between the triassic and permian aged units to the west where the rewan formation an aquitard separating the triassic and permian aquifers is thin the minima d4 may be a discharge area that forms a groundwater divide between flow from the hypothesised recharge areas to the south west r5 and r6 and the south east r7 this hypothesised discharge area d4 is also located over a river indicating the river may be gaining in this region the geological and topographical causes of the r3 recharge area are less apparent it is plausible that there may be unmapped outcrops of the triassic units in the region of r3 as it is at a topographic high point see fig 2 the minimum d3 is located between r3 and r4 suggesting that it could be a sink for water from these hypothesised recharge areas as d3 is located near lake galilee i e see fig 2 it is plausible that this could represent surface discharge occurring from the triassic units given the hypersaline condition of the lake similarly the minimum d4 is located between recharge areas to the south west r5 and r6 and a recharge area to the south east r7 overlies a river this suggests that the river may receive groundwater from the triassic units in this area the discharge area d2 is located over the carmichael river and in a region that coincides with the doongmabulla springs complex this observation indicates that the triassic units may be contributing groundwater to the river and or springs in this area fig 5a shows that there is also discharge along most of the eastern margin of the basin red arrows this suggests that discharge may be occurring along the edges of the basin possibly to geological formations beyond the galilee basin or to surface features the cause of the minimum d1 is less apparent as the triassic formations are at significant depth beneath the eromanga basin in this area 4 4 concavity of the hydraulic head surface from a flow perspective concave up areas can be interpreted as flow converging towards a low point while concave down areas can be interpreted as flow dispersing away from a high point in some cases the concavity may be more informative than minima or maxima for identifying potential recharge or discharge areas or groundwater extraction for example if recharge is occurring over a large area the concavity may be more informative of the recharge areas than the peak maxima fig 6 b and c show two realisations of hydraulic head with the concave up and concave down areas marked in red and blue respectively as shown the concave down areas are generally associated with high hydraulic head values while the concave up areas are generally located near low hydraulic head values as expected see fig 1 all 100 realisations annotated with concavity are provided online https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 20225796 v1 fig 6a displays the relative percentage of realisations where each node was concave up or concave down i e total concave up total concave down total realisations 100 as shown there are five concave up areas d1 d5 and seven concave down areas r1 r7 the concave down areas r1 r3 and r7 are located near the edge of the basin where the triassic formations outcrop it is plausible that these areas may be associated with inflow at the edge of outcrop areas that was identified by evans et al 2018 the concave down areas r4 r5 and r6 may reflect flow from the permian formations due to a thinning of the rewan formation aquitard in the area moya et al 2015 the concave up area d4 likely represents discharge to a river which may act as a groundwater divide between the hypothesised recharge areas r5 r6 and r7 the concave up areas d2 and d5 along the eastern margin of the basin likely represent discharge out of the basin in the case of d2 the concave up area could be representative of discharge to the carmichael river and or the doongmabulla springs complex the concave up area d3 is located near lake galilee and a river edie creek suggesting that the triassic units may be contributing water to these surface features the cause of the concave up area d1 is less obvious as the triassic formations are located at substantial depth beneath the eromanga basin in this area 4 5 combined analysis of minima maxima and concavity expert knowledge of a study area can help to determine whether a hypothesised recharge or discharge area is likely to be discrete or diffuse in areas where there are discrete surface features e g rivers creeks wells or springs the use of extrema may be most informative of recharge or discharge areas because these more likely coincide with easily recognisable recharge discharge features within the landscape alternately in areas where there are diffuse surface features e g stands of vegetation wetlands exposed outcrop areas etc then the use of concavity may be more informative to identify zones of recharge or discharge this is notwithstanding that both localised and diffuse recharge discharge are likely to create both extrema and concavity in the hydraulic head surface nevertheless we suggest that concavity and extrema are interpreted in conjunction with knowledge of surface features to decide which is most appropriate to identify the causes and spatial extent of recharge and discharge the combined use of extrema and concavity were used to develop a recharge discharge area map fig 7 recharge near the edge of the basin is expected to be diffuse infiltration from rainfall events where the triassic formations are thin weathered and exposed evans et al 2018 in these regions the concavity was selected as being representative of recharge areas r1 and r7 similarly area r2 is located near lake buchanan suggesting that the lake may act as a diffuse source of recharge to the underlying aquifers the remaining hypothesised recharge areas are located at substantial depth beneath the eromanga basin far from known outcrop areas or lakes the maxima were selected to represent these areas as these may represent isolated areas of connectivity between the triassic and permian formations moya et al 2015 as d2 d3 and d4 are proximal to surface features i e rivers springs and lakes the extrema approach was selected as representative of the discharge areas the cause of d1 was less apparent as the triassic formations were located at significant depth beneath the eromanga basin in this area therefore it was assumed that d1 may be best represented using the concavity as it could represent discharge to other aquifers such as the hutton sandstone moya et al 2015 needless to say these interpretations are preliminary and require further work to validate the nature of groundwater inflow outflow within the regions of interest described above from a regional flow perspective recharge appears to occur in the outcrop areas to the north east and south east r1 and r7 and in the vicinity of lake buchanan r2 there are also other plausible recharge areas r3 r4 r5 and r6 although further investigation is required to determine the characteristics of these areas e g inter aquifer leakage unmapped outcrops etc there are plausible discharge areas near the alice river to the south d4 lake galilee d3 and the doongmabulla springs complex and the carmichael river d2 the area near the carmichael mine see fig 2 appears to be a regional discharge point see fig 7 and dewatering as part of the mining operation needs to account for influxes from both the triassic and permian units there are important implications for the potential for mine induced impacts to the doongmabulla springs complex from this interpretation if the triassic system is the source of water to the springs and is connected to the mine area as suggested here then there is an elevated risk of drawdown propagating to the springs this hypothesis warrants further analysis 4 6 uncertainties and future directions a common criticism of kriging techniques is that the resulting estimates are often unnaturally smooth and not globally accurate honouring neither the semi variogram nor the measurement histogram caers 2000 yamamoto 2005 so while kriging estimation may be locally accurate i e provide the best estimates at individual prediction locations the smoothness will result in an overestimation of lower values and an underestimation of higher values conditional simulations such as sequential gaussian simulation honour both the semi variogram model and the measurement histogram guaranteeing global accuracy albeit with a trade off of decreased local accuracy caers 2000 thus sequential gaussian methods can better capture the spatial transitions between extreme values although simulated values at individual prediction locations may be less optimum than those produced by kriging goovaerts 1997 in this study gaussian simulation was used in preference to kriging as global accuracy i e an accurate transition between extreme values was more important than local accuracy i e the best estimates at each prediction location the trade off between poorer local accuracy and better global accuracy means that simulated hydraulic head and hydraulic gradients may have been less optimal than those produced using kriging at individual prediction sites future studies should consider whether local or global accuracy is most important to the phenomenon of interest and choose a simulation or kriging method accordingly choosing between concavity and extrema for the identification of recharge discharge areas is challenging when the data are sparse data sparsity issues were demonstrated in this study by different realisations inferring recharge and discharge at the same location secondary sources of information such as the locations of surface features e g rivers lakes springs swamps can provide critical information on whether a recharge discharge feature is likely diffuse or discrete thus this secondary information can assist the selection of the appropriate method extrema vs concavity however this is a binary solution i e either choosing the concavity or extrema for recharge discharge locations and rather there may be a spectrum between the two instead the recharge source may encompass an area around the maximum that does not cover the entirety of the concave down area thus in future studies there may be a need to delineate an area encompassing the extrema to represent the likely recharge discharge areas this could be aided by considering additional datasets such as hydrochemistry or age tracers the analyses conducted here categorised features in the hydraulic head surface as recharge discharge or neither without consideration of the magnitude of the recharge discharge rates the impacts of this approach are that a small feature e g mild concavity received the same weighting as a larger feature e g steep concavity in the analysis this simple categorisation of features was selected to make it straightforward to compare a single variable i e recharge discharge or neither rather than two variables i e recharge discharge or neither and the varying magnitude of each it may be possible to infer the magnitude of recharge discharge features at least within individual realisations for example by assessing the magnitude of the second derivatives for concavity extrema and or of the first derivatives along the boundaries however the interplay between hydraulic conductivity and recharge in creating head gradients would need to be considered therefore future studies could extend the method proposed here to include the magnitude of recharge discharge features for individual realisations the coefficient of variation i e standard deviation mean of all realisations was lowest for the hydraulic head values increased with the first derivative and was highest for the second derivative see figure s10 this was expected given that a small change in the hydraulic head values may result in large changes in the first derivatives and possibly even the reversal of flow directions leading to large coefficients of variability between realisations similarly as the second derivative captures the change in the first derivative the second derivative will have a higher coefficient of variability between realisations than the first derivative this leads to a pattern where the coefficient of variation is lowest for the function values and increases with the order of the derivative this emphasises the potential benefits of including derivative information within the modelling process hydraulic gradient observations can be included as a secondary variable in co kriging and as the simulated first derivatives are more uncertain than the hydraulic head values themselves the information value of gradient observations are higher than that of regular hydraulic head observations expert knowledge of the locations of recharge or discharge features could be encoded by adding nodes at the feature locations setting the first derivatives at these locations to zero as the first derivative equals 0 for minima and maxima and co kriging these data with available hydraulic head observations for example if a river is known to be losing or gaining along a reach nodes could be added with a first derivative value of zero and this could be co kriged with hydraulic head observations to reduce the uncertainty supporting text s2 provides details on how the kriging equations can be modified to include first derivative observations 5 conclusions we developed a geostatistical method to model the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface the new method extends previous work by using sequential gaussian simulation to jointly simulate hydraulic head and the partial derivatives of the hydraulic head surface to identify the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface the resultant maps of extrema and concavity can be interpreted with maps of known surface features to attribute the variation in the hydraulic head surface to recharge or discharge from known features such as geological outcrops rivers and lakes this was applied to the galilee basin to map the regional flow directions and the concavity and extrema of the hydraulic head surface likely recharge and discharge areas were identified by comparing maps of concavity and extrema with known features to attribute variations in the hydraulic head surface to recharge or discharge processes these findings have important implications for the galilee basin as they provide evidence suggesting recharge is likely to occur predominantly in the north east and south east where the triassic formations outcrop while discharge is apparent near several rivers lakes and the doongmabulla springs complex notably this indicates that the triassic formations may provide a source of water to the carmichael river and the doongmabulla springs complex which has important implications given the potential for dewatering at the nearby carmichael coal mine to impact hydraulic head in the triassic formations and potentially discharge from the doongmabulla springs complex the sequential gaussian approach presented here is easy to apply computationally efficient and requires only commonly available hydraulic head data we facilitate the application of the technique through a worked example available online https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6655359 the approach can be extended to include derivative observations which due to the higher uncertainty in derivative values relative to hydraulic head values are of higher information value than hydraulic head observations the inclusion of first derivative observations is particularly attractive as expert knowledge of recharge discharge features e g rivers springs can be encoded by setting the first derivative values to zero at the feature locations and co kriging to constrain the analysis simulating the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface represents a substantial advancement in the geostatistical analysis of hydraulic head data sets

2532,identifying groundwater flow directions and the locations of recharge and discharge areas is critical for effective groundwater management groundwater flow directions the concavity and the locations of extrema i e minima and maxima can be assessed using the first and second derivatives of the hydraulic head surface we developed a geostatistical method to jointly simulate hydraulic head and its first and second derivatives using sequential gaussian simulation the derivative values were used to identify regional groundwater flow directions and the second derivative test was used to probabilistically map the concavity and the locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface by comparing the mapped concavity and extrema to known features it was possible to attribute areas of recharge and discharge to physical features of the system such as rivers lakes and geological outcrops this was applied to triassic aquifers in the galilee basin queensland australia to delineate the likely recharge and discharge areas this provided an objective assessment of likely recharge and discharge zones and their uncertainty which is an important addition to a region where the hydrogeology has been the subject of much conjecture keywords kriging hydrogeology sequential gaussian simulation galilee basin hydraulic gradient data availability data included in supporting information code available as an online resource 1 introduction hydraulic head gradients are important in hydrogeological studies as they are proportional to the rate of groundwater flow and control the flow directions which provides critical information for understanding groundwater systems pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 however hydraulic head measurements are typically sparsely distributed point measurements rau et al 2019 which can make interpretation of hydraulic gradients challenging to address these challenges philip and kitanidis 1989 provided a modified form of ordinary kriging that allowed for the direct estimation of hydraulic head gradients from sparse hydraulic head observations they applied their approach to estimate the regional groundwater flow directions in the wolfcamp aquifer in northern texas usa pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 further developed this approach using universal kriging to account for a systematic trend in the mean the benefits of geostatistical approaches over other techniques for mapping hydraulic head gradients e g numerical modelling include that they are generalisable do not require specification of boundary conditions or geological properties and can provide quantitative estimates of uncertainty however the results are dependent on the semi variogram model and fitting a representative model can be challenging when working with small datasets goovaerts 1997 additionally the grid resolution and number of realisations influence model run times as can be the case with numerical modelling developing conceptual models of groundwater systems including by mapping groundwater flow directions and locations of recharge and discharge areas is critical for effective groundwater management enemark et al 2019 thomann et al 2020 the concavity i e concave up or concave down and the locations of extrema i e minima maxima or inflection points in the hydraulic head surface see fig 1 can be identified using information from the first and second derivatives of the inferred hydraulic head surface although previous work has used kriging to estimate the first derivatives of hydraulic head surface e g philip and kitanidis 1989 pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 no studies have used geostatistics to calculate higher order derivatives and use these to map concavity and extrema in the hydraulic head surface herein we extend the work of philip and kitanidis 1989 and pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 to simulate realisations of the first and second derivatives of the hydraulic head surface using sequential gaussian simulation we show how realisations of the derivatives of hydraulic heads can be used to probabilistically map the locations of extrema and concavity of the hydraulic head surface which can subsequently be compared with known surface features e g rivers lakes geological outcrops to identify plausible recharge and discharge areas we apply the technique to sparsely distributed hydraulic head data from the triassic aquifers of the galilee basin in queensland australia this provides an objective assessment of the likely recharge and discharge areas for the triassic aquifers of the galilee basin which is vital to inform the ongoing debate regarding the hydrogeology of the region currell et al 2020 the approaches presented here represent a significant advancement in the use of hydraulic head data to map recharge and discharge areas 2 methods 2 1 hydraulic head and derivative simulation consider the random function z u observed at a set of coordinates u e g u 1 x 1 y 1 of shape n 2 a single realisation of plausible values z u k at a set of m unobserved locations u can be found using sequential gaussian simulation goovaerts 1997 sequential gaussian simulation is an iterative process where first a coordinate u i is randomly selected from the set u next simple kriging is used to estimate the mean cressie 1990 goovaerts 1997 1 z u i λ t z u 1 n λ t 1 n μ where λ c

et al 2019 and post and von asmuth 2013 and the temporal variability in the hydrograph see keegan treloar et al 2021 alternately σ 2 can be set to a constant value if all measurements have comparable error or to 0 if the value is known exactly e g from a computer simulation μ can be chosen based on known values e g if the function is known to converge towards a constant value the arithmetic mean

simulated for the m locations in u note eq 2 is only applied on the first iteration to estimate a stationary value of μ from z u the term kriging is a synonym for what is known as gaussian processes in the machine learning community rasmussen and williams 2006 the derivative of a gaussian process is itself a gaussian process and consequently gaussian processes can be used to estimate the derivatives of a function solak et al 2003 rasmussen and williams 2006 duvenaud 2014 estimates of partial derivatives can be obtained by differentiating the covariance and mean functions and kriging as usual philip and kitanidis 1989 pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 duvenaud 2014 as μ is assumed to be constant in eq 1 and the derivative of a constant value is 0 eq 1 simplifies to 5 z u λ t z u

respect to the x 2 c u u y 2 is the second derivative of the covariance function with respect to y and 2 c u u x y is the partial derivative of the covariance function with respect x and y note that as the partial derivatives are conditioned solely on z u the kriging can be applied independently for each partial derivative e g using λ c u u i σ 1 c u u x to estimate z u x with eq 5 which may be necessary to preserve computer memory when working with large matrices any covariance function that is at least twice differentiable can be used in this paper we provide the derivatives for the gaussian covariance function see supporting text s1 2 2 locating minima and maxima once a realisation of z u is generated extrema i e minima and maxima in the hydraulic head surface can be identified using the second derivative test stewart 2010 the locations of critical points are identified by finding where z u x and z u y are equal to 0 as z u x and z u y are simulated at nodes and the zero values may be located between nodes contouring using linear interpolation can be used to approximate the coordinates where z u x and z u y are equal to zero this allows for the coordinates of the critical points to be approximated by finding the intersections of the zero contours for z u x and z u y once these points are identified the hessian determinant h can be used to determine the concavity of the critical points and to classify these as minima concave up maxima concave down or inflection points a change of the concavity from concave up to concave down or vice versa h is calculated as 7 h 2 z u x 2 2 z u y 2 2 z u x y 2 if h 0 then the location can be classified as a minimum if 2 z u x 2 0 or as a maximum if 2 z u x 2 0 if h 0 the location is an inflection point values of h 0 indicate that there is insufficient information to classify the location as a minimum maximum or inflection point 2 3 identifying boundary effects the hydraulic head gradient perpendicular to the aquifer boundary can be indicative of flow into or out of the aquifer the hydraulic head gradient perpendicular to an aquifer boundary can be assessed at nodes in u closest to the boundary using z u x z u y and the angle θ projected perpendicular to the boundary the resultant r of the vectors z u x and z u y can be found using 8 r z u x c o s θ z u y s i n θ where r 0 represents flow towards the boundary and out of the aquifer r 0 represents inflow into the aquifer from the boundary and r 0 represents no flow across the boundary where the hydraulic head gradient across the boundary is steep this may be indicative of either high groundwater inflow outflow or low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material according to darcy s law values of θ can be identified using geometrically from a polygon of the aquifer boundary first all nodes within a specified buffer distance are selected leading to k nodes denoted here as u b next each node of u b given by u b i x i y i recalling i 1 k is projected orthogonally onto the nearest segment of the boundary polygon the orthogonal projections onto each boundary segment are x p x 1 x 2 x 1 t and y p y 1 y 2 y 1 t where t is given by 9 t x i x 1 x 2 x 1 y i y 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 2 y 2 y 1 2 where the coordinates x 1 y 1 x 2 and y 2 are the vertices of each face of the boundary polygon the nearest boundary segment s to each node can be identified using the condition h min h where h x i x p 2 y i y p 2 and the resulting projections x p and y p are calculated with the equations x p x i x p x i and y p y i y p y i the angle of u b i projected on the boundary is obtained as θ i a t a n 2 y p y i x p x i where a t a n 2 is a modified version of a r c t a n which handles special cases to ensure the resulting vector is oriented correctly with respect to the unit circle this process is repeated for all nodes in u b yielding θ θ 1 θ k 3 case study of the galilee basin australia 3 1 study site and data description we applied the method described above in the galilee basin queensland australia which is part of the great artesian basin the galilee basin outcrops to the east and is overlain by the eromanga basin to the west moya et al 2016 the stratigraphy of the galilee basin is composed of triassic aged formations that overlie deeper permian aged formations the aquifers of the triassic and permian aged formations are composed mostly of sandstones separated by aquitards of siltstones and mudstones moya et al 2016 the permian aged formations contain coal seams and are the target of proposed open cut and underground mining including the carmichael coal mine fig 2 currell et al 2020 and keegan treloar et al 2021 provide further details of the mine and surrounding hydrogeology the shallower triassic aged formations have been hypothesised to provide a source of water to the culturally and ecologically significant doongmabulla springs complex currell et al 2020 amongst alternative possible source aquifers given the potential impacts of mining developments in the area characterising the regional hydrogeology including the groundwater flow directions and the locations of likely recharge and discharge areas is of critical importance the triassic formations have a good spatial distribution of hydraulic head data to the east where landholders target the upper formations for water supply primarily for stock and domestic use fig 2 however fewer measurements are available to the west where the galilee basin is overlain by the eromanga basin and the triassic formations are at substantial depth in this study hydraulic head data were collated from the queensland groundwater database https qldspatial information qld gov au catalogue the queensland department of state development 2018 and aecom 2021 hydrographs were plotted and a single value was selected as the representative steady state water level for each well following the approach used by keegan treloar et al 2021 see figures s1 s9 the steady state assumption was assumed to be reasonable as there was limited groundwater extraction mainly just stock and domestic use and at mine site dewatering had not yet impacted the triassic formations in total there were 81 hydraulic head observations in the triassic formations ranging from 227 23 m to 352 66 m above the australian height datum see table s1 3 2 hydraulic head and derivative simulation the hydraulic head and derivative simulations of the galilee basin were run using python using libraries that come with a standard anaconda installation in the simulations a regular grid u was defined with 1000 m intervals in the and y directions the 1000 m interval was selected to ensure reasonable model run times given the large extent of the study area see fig 2 the global mean was calculated using the best linear unbiased estimate eq 2 and 100 realisations of hydraulic head and partial derivatives were generated the minima maxima and the concavity of the hydraulic head surface were mapped using the hydraulic head and partial derivatives realisations and a polygon of the aquifer boundary was determined as per the methods described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 preliminary geostatistical data analysis the d agostino and pearson 1973 test was applied to the null hypothesis of the hydraulic head data being normally distributed and the null hypothesis could not be rejected using a significance level of 0 05 p 0 89 k 0 23 the experimental semi variance of the hydraulic head data was estimated using the gstat library pebesma 2004 in r a gaussian semi variogram model was then fitted to the experimental semi variance by minimising the sum of the squared differences following philip and kitanidis 1989 and pardo igúzquiza and chica olmo 2004 the semi variogram model was separated into a continuous model the gaussian semi variogram model and a discontinuous model the nugget effect semi variogram model this was necessary as the spatial variability must be continuous including at the origin for the derivatives to be calculated philip and kitanidis 1989 the continuous semi variogram model was converted to a covariance model using the relationship that the semi variogram is equal to the sill minus the covariance the sill of the discontinuous model was used to parameterise σ 2 which regularises the kriging model to avoid overfitting uncertain observations see eq 1 and essentially filters out the measurement error see philip and kitanidis 1989 the resulting semi variogram models shown in fig 3 were composed of a nugget model with a sill of 32 m2 and gaussian model with a range of 27 072 m and a sill of 506 m2 4 2 hydraulic head predictions following the preliminary geostatistical analysis 100 realisations of hydraulic head and partial derivatives of hydraulic head were generated using sequential gaussian simulation the variability between realisations can be attributed to the values at model nodes being simulated sequentially by drawing from a normal distribution parametrised by the estimated mean and variance for a randomly selected node this was followed by treating the simulated value as an observation that was included in the simulation of subsequent nodes as described in section 2 1 fig 4 a and fig 4b show contours of hydraulic head for realisations 1 and 2 respectively as shown the realisations have the largest differences in the areas where there are few hydraulic observations and small differences near hydraulic head observations this is expected as the model is conditioned on the hydraulic head observations such that predictions made close to observed data will closely match the observed values alternatively the prediction uncertainty will increase further away from observations leading to a larger range of plausible values fig 4c shows the average hydraulic head of all realisations contoured over a heat map of the standard deviation of all realisations as shown the standard deviation is low e g 0 5 m close to observations and higher up to 25 m further away from the observations i e in the north west and south west of the study area we elected to hash out areas where the standard deviation was greater or equal to 15 m as predictions and inferences of extrema or concavity in these areas were highly uncertain the contour where the standard deviation in the hydraulic head equals 10 m is also shown with a dotted line the average hydraulic head is higher to the north east and south east and lower in the central eastern area near the aquifer boundary fig 4c as water flows from high to low hydraulic head it appears that recharge areas are in the north eastern and south eastern areas while discharge occurs mainly in the central eastern area coinciding with the doongmabulla springs complex and the carmichael river and the proposed site of the carmichael coal mine fig 2 there is also indication of boundary inflows in the south west and outflows to the north west although these areas are highly uncertain σ 10 m note that the individual realisations i e fig 4a and b show substantial variability in flow direction inferred as flow perpendicular to the hydraulic head contours near and through the boundary relative to that shown in the averaged results fig 4c similarly the locations of likely recharge and discharge areas are variable between realisations e g the recharge area in fig 4a is further east in fig 4b as there is significant variability between realisations and it is unfeasible to examine all realisations in detail an alternative approach is required to interpret the regional flow directions and likely recharge and discharge zones 4 3 minima and maxima in the hydraulic head surface extrema minima maxima and inflection points in the hydraulic head surface were identified see section 2 2 and assigned to nodes within a 5000 m radius this approach allows a comparison between realisations by counting the frequency of each grid node being proximal to an extremum the buffer size of 5000 m was chosen after testing a wide range of values such that it created visible zones where extrema in hydraulics heads were obtained additionally the component of flow orthogonal to the boundary was used to classify boundary nodes as minima flow out of the boundary maxima flow in through the boundary or neither flow is parallel to the boundary as described in section 2 3 these were discrete classifications i e minima maxima or neither and did not consider the magnitude of the gradient both in and out of the boundary or the steepness of the surface around the minima or maxima fig 5 b and c show realisations of hydraulic head with the locations of minima red areas and maxima blue areas the arrows are shown every 10 nodes along the boundary to indicate if flow is in maxima or out minima some extrema occur frequently between realisations e g r2 and d4 in fig 5b and fig 5c while other extrema occur less frequently e g r3 r4 r5 and d3 in fig 5c are not present in fig 5b the flow directions orthogonal to the boundary suggest flow is out through most of the eastern boundary red pixels and arrows fig 5a c however areas to the south in fig 5b and fig 5c and two areas to the north in fig 5c suggest inwards flows blue pixels and arrows all 100 realisations annotated with minima and maxima are provided online https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 20225571 v1 the summary of results represented in fig 5a shows the relative percentage of realisations i e total minimum total maximum total realisations 100 where each node is a minimum red or maximum blue from the 100 realisations the relative percentage for each node is a continuous index shown with the colour gradation between blue and red ranging from 100 all realisations are minimum to 100 all realisations are maximum with an intermediate value of 0 as shown in fig 5a seven maxima r1 to r7 and four minima d1 to d4 were identified from the analysis of the ensemble the lighter shades of red or blue suggest zones are less common between analyses e g r3 and d3 than those zones with darker shades of red or blue e g d4 of these areas r1 and r7 are likely recharge areas where the triassic formation outcrops along the eastern margin of the basin and where groundwater recharge has been hypothesised to occur evans et al 2018 there is also evidence of flow into the basin along the eastern edge to the north and south near r1 and r7 as shown by the blue arrows the maxima r2 r4 r5 and r6 lie beneath the eromanga basin fig 2 and could represent areas of inter aquifer connectivity where the triassic formations obtain water from the permian formations this interpretation is in agreement with moya et al 2015 who found hydrochemical evidence of mixing between the triassic and permian aged units to the west where the rewan formation an aquitard separating the triassic and permian aquifers is thin the minima d4 may be a discharge area that forms a groundwater divide between flow from the hypothesised recharge areas to the south west r5 and r6 and the south east r7 this hypothesised discharge area d4 is also located over a river indicating the river may be gaining in this region the geological and topographical causes of the r3 recharge area are less apparent it is plausible that there may be unmapped outcrops of the triassic units in the region of r3 as it is at a topographic high point see fig 2 the minimum d3 is located between r3 and r4 suggesting that it could be a sink for water from these hypothesised recharge areas as d3 is located near lake galilee i e see fig 2 it is plausible that this could represent surface discharge occurring from the triassic units given the hypersaline condition of the lake similarly the minimum d4 is located between recharge areas to the south west r5 and r6 and a recharge area to the south east r7 overlies a river this suggests that the river may receive groundwater from the triassic units in this area the discharge area d2 is located over the carmichael river and in a region that coincides with the doongmabulla springs complex this observation indicates that the triassic units may be contributing groundwater to the river and or springs in this area fig 5a shows that there is also discharge along most of the eastern margin of the basin red arrows this suggests that discharge may be occurring along the edges of the basin possibly to geological formations beyond the galilee basin or to surface features the cause of the minimum d1 is less apparent as the triassic formations are at significant depth beneath the eromanga basin in this area 4 4 concavity of the hydraulic head surface from a flow perspective concave up areas can be interpreted as flow converging towards a low point while concave down areas can be interpreted as flow dispersing away from a high point in some cases the concavity may be more informative than minima or maxima for identifying potential recharge or discharge areas or groundwater extraction for example if recharge is occurring over a large area the concavity may be more informative of the recharge areas than the peak maxima fig 6 b and c show two realisations of hydraulic head with the concave up and concave down areas marked in red and blue respectively as shown the concave down areas are generally associated with high hydraulic head values while the concave up areas are generally located near low hydraulic head values as expected see fig 1 all 100 realisations annotated with concavity are provided online https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 20225796 v1 fig 6a displays the relative percentage of realisations where each node was concave up or concave down i e total concave up total concave down total realisations 100 as shown there are five concave up areas d1 d5 and seven concave down areas r1 r7 the concave down areas r1 r3 and r7 are located near the edge of the basin where the triassic formations outcrop it is plausible that these areas may be associated with inflow at the edge of outcrop areas that was identified by evans et al 2018 the concave down areas r4 r5 and r6 may reflect flow from the permian formations due to a thinning of the rewan formation aquitard in the area moya et al 2015 the concave up area d4 likely represents discharge to a river which may act as a groundwater divide between the hypothesised recharge areas r5 r6 and r7 the concave up areas d2 and d5 along the eastern margin of the basin likely represent discharge out of the basin in the case of d2 the concave up area could be representative of discharge to the carmichael river and or the doongmabulla springs complex the concave up area d3 is located near lake galilee and a river edie creek suggesting that the triassic units may be contributing water to these surface features the cause of the concave up area d1 is less obvious as the triassic formations are located at substantial depth beneath the eromanga basin in this area 4 5 combined analysis of minima maxima and concavity expert knowledge of a study area can help to determine whether a hypothesised recharge or discharge area is likely to be discrete or diffuse in areas where there are discrete surface features e g rivers creeks wells or springs the use of extrema may be most informative of recharge or discharge areas because these more likely coincide with easily recognisable recharge discharge features within the landscape alternately in areas where there are diffuse surface features e g stands of vegetation wetlands exposed outcrop areas etc then the use of concavity may be more informative to identify zones of recharge or discharge this is notwithstanding that both localised and diffuse recharge discharge are likely to create both extrema and concavity in the hydraulic head surface nevertheless we suggest that concavity and extrema are interpreted in conjunction with knowledge of surface features to decide which is most appropriate to identify the causes and spatial extent of recharge and discharge the combined use of extrema and concavity were used to develop a recharge discharge area map fig 7 recharge near the edge of the basin is expected to be diffuse infiltration from rainfall events where the triassic formations are thin weathered and exposed evans et al 2018 in these regions the concavity was selected as being representative of recharge areas r1 and r7 similarly area r2 is located near lake buchanan suggesting that the lake may act as a diffuse source of recharge to the underlying aquifers the remaining hypothesised recharge areas are located at substantial depth beneath the eromanga basin far from known outcrop areas or lakes the maxima were selected to represent these areas as these may represent isolated areas of connectivity between the triassic and permian formations moya et al 2015 as d2 d3 and d4 are proximal to surface features i e rivers springs and lakes the extrema approach was selected as representative of the discharge areas the cause of d1 was less apparent as the triassic formations were located at significant depth beneath the eromanga basin in this area therefore it was assumed that d1 may be best represented using the concavity as it could represent discharge to other aquifers such as the hutton sandstone moya et al 2015 needless to say these interpretations are preliminary and require further work to validate the nature of groundwater inflow outflow within the regions of interest described above from a regional flow perspective recharge appears to occur in the outcrop areas to the north east and south east r1 and r7 and in the vicinity of lake buchanan r2 there are also other plausible recharge areas r3 r4 r5 and r6 although further investigation is required to determine the characteristics of these areas e g inter aquifer leakage unmapped outcrops etc there are plausible discharge areas near the alice river to the south d4 lake galilee d3 and the doongmabulla springs complex and the carmichael river d2 the area near the carmichael mine see fig 2 appears to be a regional discharge point see fig 7 and dewatering as part of the mining operation needs to account for influxes from both the triassic and permian units there are important implications for the potential for mine induced impacts to the doongmabulla springs complex from this interpretation if the triassic system is the source of water to the springs and is connected to the mine area as suggested here then there is an elevated risk of drawdown propagating to the springs this hypothesis warrants further analysis 4 6 uncertainties and future directions a common criticism of kriging techniques is that the resulting estimates are often unnaturally smooth and not globally accurate honouring neither the semi variogram nor the measurement histogram caers 2000 yamamoto 2005 so while kriging estimation may be locally accurate i e provide the best estimates at individual prediction locations the smoothness will result in an overestimation of lower values and an underestimation of higher values conditional simulations such as sequential gaussian simulation honour both the semi variogram model and the measurement histogram guaranteeing global accuracy albeit with a trade off of decreased local accuracy caers 2000 thus sequential gaussian methods can better capture the spatial transitions between extreme values although simulated values at individual prediction locations may be less optimum than those produced by kriging goovaerts 1997 in this study gaussian simulation was used in preference to kriging as global accuracy i e an accurate transition between extreme values was more important than local accuracy i e the best estimates at each prediction location the trade off between poorer local accuracy and better global accuracy means that simulated hydraulic head and hydraulic gradients may have been less optimal than those produced using kriging at individual prediction sites future studies should consider whether local or global accuracy is most important to the phenomenon of interest and choose a simulation or kriging method accordingly choosing between concavity and extrema for the identification of recharge discharge areas is challenging when the data are sparse data sparsity issues were demonstrated in this study by different realisations inferring recharge and discharge at the same location secondary sources of information such as the locations of surface features e g rivers lakes springs swamps can provide critical information on whether a recharge discharge feature is likely diffuse or discrete thus this secondary information can assist the selection of the appropriate method extrema vs concavity however this is a binary solution i e either choosing the concavity or extrema for recharge discharge locations and rather there may be a spectrum between the two instead the recharge source may encompass an area around the maximum that does not cover the entirety of the concave down area thus in future studies there may be a need to delineate an area encompassing the extrema to represent the likely recharge discharge areas this could be aided by considering additional datasets such as hydrochemistry or age tracers the analyses conducted here categorised features in the hydraulic head surface as recharge discharge or neither without consideration of the magnitude of the recharge discharge rates the impacts of this approach are that a small feature e g mild concavity received the same weighting as a larger feature e g steep concavity in the analysis this simple categorisation of features was selected to make it straightforward to compare a single variable i e recharge discharge or neither rather than two variables i e recharge discharge or neither and the varying magnitude of each it may be possible to infer the magnitude of recharge discharge features at least within individual realisations for example by assessing the magnitude of the second derivatives for concavity extrema and or of the first derivatives along the boundaries however the interplay between hydraulic conductivity and recharge in creating head gradients would need to be considered therefore future studies could extend the method proposed here to include the magnitude of recharge discharge features for individual realisations the coefficient of variation i e standard deviation mean of all realisations was lowest for the hydraulic head values increased with the first derivative and was highest for the second derivative see figure s10 this was expected given that a small change in the hydraulic head values may result in large changes in the first derivatives and possibly even the reversal of flow directions leading to large coefficients of variability between realisations similarly as the second derivative captures the change in the first derivative the second derivative will have a higher coefficient of variability between realisations than the first derivative this leads to a pattern where the coefficient of variation is lowest for the function values and increases with the order of the derivative this emphasises the potential benefits of including derivative information within the modelling process hydraulic gradient observations can be included as a secondary variable in co kriging and as the simulated first derivatives are more uncertain than the hydraulic head values themselves the information value of gradient observations are higher than that of regular hydraulic head observations expert knowledge of the locations of recharge or discharge features could be encoded by adding nodes at the feature locations setting the first derivatives at these locations to zero as the first derivative equals 0 for minima and maxima and co kriging these data with available hydraulic head observations for example if a river is known to be losing or gaining along a reach nodes could be added with a first derivative value of zero and this could be co kriged with hydraulic head observations to reduce the uncertainty supporting text s2 provides details on how the kriging equations can be modified to include first derivative observations 5 conclusions we developed a geostatistical method to model the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface the new method extends previous work by using sequential gaussian simulation to jointly simulate hydraulic head and the partial derivatives of the hydraulic head surface to identify the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface the resultant maps of extrema and concavity can be interpreted with maps of known surface features to attribute the variation in the hydraulic head surface to recharge or discharge from known features such as geological outcrops rivers and lakes this was applied to the galilee basin to map the regional flow directions and the concavity and extrema of the hydraulic head surface likely recharge and discharge areas were identified by comparing maps of concavity and extrema with known features to attribute variations in the hydraulic head surface to recharge or discharge processes these findings have important implications for the galilee basin as they provide evidence suggesting recharge is likely to occur predominantly in the north east and south east where the triassic formations outcrop while discharge is apparent near several rivers lakes and the doongmabulla springs complex notably this indicates that the triassic formations may provide a source of water to the carmichael river and the doongmabulla springs complex which has important implications given the potential for dewatering at the nearby carmichael coal mine to impact hydraulic head in the triassic formations and potentially discharge from the doongmabulla springs complex the sequential gaussian approach presented here is easy to apply computationally efficient and requires only commonly available hydraulic head data we facilitate the application of the technique through a worked example available online https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6655359 the approach can be extended to include derivative observations which due to the higher uncertainty in derivative values relative to hydraulic head values are of higher information value than hydraulic head observations the inclusion of first derivative observations is particularly attractive as expert knowledge of recharge discharge features e g rivers springs can be encoded by setting the first derivative values to zero at the feature locations and co kriging to constrain the analysis simulating the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface represents a substantial advancement in the geostatistical analysis of hydraulic head data sets

2533,the most severe urban flooding in cold maritime climates is due to the co action of long duration rainfall snowmelt and soil frost increasing winter air temperature due to climate change is projected to change the magnitude and frequency of rain on snow ros events and increase the number of freeze thaw cycles and midwinter snowmelt while daily rainfall records are readily available less is known about the infiltration and frost formation within urban soils thus there is uncertainty on how warming winter conditions may affect urban flood risk and the climate resilience of cities the aim of this study was therefore to assess soil frost formation in the past 70 years in the maritime city of reykjavík iceland 64 n 21 w and its co action with runoff generation and the potential implications on urban flood risk to that end the daily thermal and hydraulic conditions of the soil were simulated using the simultaneous heat and water shaw model dating back to 1949 calibrated based on hourly observations from 2007 model simulations indicated that the minimum soil temperature at 10 cm depth has been warming at a rate of 0 015 c year in the past seven decades climate warming is also noted in a steady decline in frost depth and the duration of soil frost each winter p value 0 05 however the freezing season has shortened so that the timing of maximum frost coincides more with the timing of maximum ros and snowmelt events furthermore ros events during frost have the capacity to produce larger runoff volumes than rainfall or snowmelt alone based on the joint frequency analysis of winter events using the copula method this combined with increasing volume during ros events suggests that winter floods may intensify in the next decades which urges re thinking urban

phenomenon affecting about 35 of the earth s surface williams and smith 1989 soil frost significantly alters the hydrological cycle and surface and subsurface exchanges of water and energy shanley and chalmers 1999 wang et al 2009 infiltration into frozen and partially frozen soils is reduced due to the presence of ice lenses granger et al 2011 khan et al 2012 slater et al 1998 wang et al 2009 soil frost paired with rain on snow ros generated the greatest number of flooded properties in a cold maritime climate andradóttir et al 2021 additionally frost formation is a key performance indicator for the hydrological performance of sustainable urban drainage systems suds which are increasingly adopted to integrate separate stormwater systems and increase cities resilience to climate change zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 water infiltration into frozen soil is essential for understanding and managing the biological activity and nutrients in soils watanabe et al 2013 severe frost action can impair the development and even the existence of plants and as such is known to severely contribute to soil erosion and compromise land restoration efforts arnalds 2015 benninghoff 1952 the atmospheric soil exchanges of heat and water and hence soil frost formation are governed by the surface conditions snow and vegetation and the physical properties of the underlying soil plant foliage influences the albedo and wind velocity profile near the soil surface and hence the shortwave and turbulent heat exchanges plant roots affect the soil porosity and stability flerchinger and pierson 1991 zaqout et al 2022 snow is an effective insulator and the absence or the late development of snowpacks leads to deeper and more persistent soil frost shanley and chalmers 1999 stadler et al 2000 the conductance of heat and water through the soil is affected by the grain size distribution porosity organic content the presence of macropores and cracks and the water content of the soil at the onset of freezing stähli et al 1999 specifically dry soils have been found to maintain infiltration even when frozen while saturated soils promote concrete frost formation granger et al 2011 kane 1980 coastal cold regions are subjected to intermittent midwinter snowmelt ros events and freeze thaw cycles andradóttir et al 2021 muthanna et al 2008 the repeated supply of near freezing meltwater together with the lack of the thermal insulation provided by a continuous snow cover results in an excessive wetting of the soil rendering it susceptible to frequent freezing and thawing zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 frequent freeze thaw cycles ftcs negatively affect soil ecosystem diversity and productivity because they cause changes in soil physical properties lead to soil deformation and affect water movement fouli et al 2013 liquid solid phase changes alter the soil s hydraulic and thermal properties significantly lundin 1990 watanabe and kugisaki 2017 zheng et al 2021 thus to fully understand frost formation in a cold maritime climate undergoing frequent freeze thaw requires the monitoring of both water content and soil temperature alternatively coupled modeling of heat and water transfer through the snow vegetation and soil profiles can be used several numerical models of soil freezing and thawing have been developed for agricultural forestry

however most studies on soil freezing and thawing used data from laboratory experiments to calibrate and validate the models he et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 which may not be representative of the temporal and spatial variations in atmospheric forcing soil layering vegetation covers in the field zheng et al 2021 assessing flood risks in urban areas is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of urban catchments and the complex interactions between rain snow and soil frost andradóttir et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 in recent years joint probability theories have been adopted to analyze flood risk resulting from two or more hydrologic variables lian et al 2013 sörensen and bengtsson 2014 zellou and rahali 2019 the most famous of which is the copula probability model chen 2019 nelsen 2007 introduced by sklar 1959 the method involves expressing a multivariate joint cumulative distribution function in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and describing the dependence between the variables with copula functions salvadori and de michele 2007 with more wet and warm winters precipitation falls more in liquid form midwinter melt and ros events have been found to become more frequent garvelmann et al 2015 surfleet and tullos 2013 wever et al 2014 würzer and jonas 2018 and ros events more voluminous andradóttir et al 2021 moreover the number of freeze thaw cycles has been increasing in mountainous regions garvelmann et al 2015 würzer et al 2016 frequent ros snowmelt frost formation and infiltration in frozen ground are highly interlinked processes and less understood than during continuous snow cover wever et al 2014 while soil frost is a key indicator of urban flooding it is rarely considered when planning urban drainage systems bengtsson and westerström 1992 caraco and claytor 1997 maksimovic et al 2000 the lack of routine monitoring of soil is also a limiting factor for understanding urban flood risk and how the urban flood risk may change with climate change therefore the goal of this research was on the one hand to improve the understanding of soil frost formation in an area undergoing frequent freeze thaw cycles and ros events by means of numerical modeling on the other hand the study aims to assess the impacts of climate change on winter flood risk by analyzing the joint probability and timing of winter flood indicators i e rainfall snowmelt and ros events in the presence of soil frost lastly the implications of the research findings on urban flood risk and stormwater management are discussed in the context of the need for more climate resilient cities as stipulated by the united nations sustainable development goal no 11 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection the capital region of reykjavík 230 000 1000 km2 includes six municipalities sited within a few kilometers from the coastline in the southwestern corner of iceland fig 1 the local climate is heavily influenced by the gulf stream with cool summers and mild winters with temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point einarsson 1984 soil frost rarely extends beyond 20 cm depth petersen 2018 precipitation tends to be frequent and mild 213 rainy days totaling approx 1000 mm per annum ólafsson et al 2007 precipitation falls mostly at high winds with the forward passage of cyclones from the southwest which prevail especially in winter einarsson 1984 the most severe urban flood events in reykjavík were associated with the co action of rain snow and soil frost andradóttir et al 2021 data from two sites located 6 km apart were obtained for the purpose of the study fig 1 both sites were located in open grassed covered areas 40 50 m a s l and at 3 km distance from the ocean table 1 2 1 1 urriðaholt site hourly weather and soil temperature data were compiled from the high resolution 10 min monitoring program in the residential neighborhood urriðaholt in garðabær iceland 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w as described in zaqout et al 2022 the neighborhood was built with a large network of sustainable urban drainage systems suds to safeguard the quantity and quality of water entering urriðavatn pond soil temperature and water content were monitored at 5 15 25 35 and 45 cm depths within a grass swale for the period of november 2018 until 2022 table 1 soil physical characteristics at different horizons such as particle size distribution and bulk density were measured in the laboratory using collected samples from the study swale the soil was classified as sandy loam with 15 20 gravel 75 82 sand and 2 5 4 fines clay and silt saturated soil water content and field capacity were estimated from observed soil water content measured using water content reflectometers saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated based on

available from the reykjavík station for the period of 2007 2019 table 1 2 2 numerical modeling 2 2 1 shaw model description the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger and saxton 1989a flerchinger and saxton 1989b is an open source model which has been widely used to simulate soil temperature and frost kahimba et al 2009 the model is a physically based finite difference coupled heat water and solute transfer it consists of a vertical one dimensional profile extending from the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface the vegetation canopy the snow cover if present and to a certain depth within the soil fig 2 while several models assume soil freezing has the same effect as drying soil the shaw model takes into account the reduction in soil porosity in subzero conditions due to the presence of ice filled pores at which hydraulic conductivity is reduced linearly with ice content kahimba et al 2009 flerchinger 2000 the water balance is expressed as

conditions at the urriðaholt study site the hourly averages of weather conditions constructed from the 10 minute observations at the study site were used as inputs for the model and soil temperature and moisture content were used as initial values table 1 hourly incoming shortwave radiation was used from the reykjavík station no 1 for the same period imo 2022a the dataset was split into two a calibration period from november 2018 to august 2020 and a validation period from august 2020 to may 2022 the soil physical properties determined from the soil samples were used for the initial runs and adjusted to calibrate the model table 2 in reykjavík the model was first calibrated and tested using the available hourly soil temperature data from 2007 until 2019 table 1 soil physical and hydraulic characteristics were manually adjusted by trial and error starting with measured soil properties in urriðaholt as a basis table 2 the model was then run using the daily weather observations i e air temperature relative humidity precipitation and wind speed measured from midnight to midnight for the targeted period of 1949 to 2018 imo 2020b historical solar radiation was estimated based on the potential extraterrestrial solar radiation so w m 2 based on latitude and day of year following the approach outlined in bras 1990 the clear sky solar radiation sc was estimated as 9 s c s o e x p n α 1 m where a turbidity factor of n 3 was chosen to represent the clean urban area α1 is the molecular scattering coefficient and the optical air mass m approximated by the cosecant 1 sinα of the solar altitude α the net radiation incoming radiation was estimated as 10 s s s c 1 0 65 n 2 where n is measured diurnal cloud cover converted from oktas to a ratio from 0 to 1 the reconstructed daily shortwave radiation agreed well with observations from 2007 to 2018 r2 0 9 rmse 33 w m2 fig a 1 2 2 3 model performance evaluation the model prediction ability was primarily assessed based on soil temperature and secondarily on the basis of soil water content two performance metrics were used the linear correlation coefficient r2 was calculated to test how well seasonal and synoptic changes were represented in the model in addition the root mean square error rmse was calculated to assess the average deviation between the observed and simulated value at each time step 2 3 data analyses 2 3 1 soil frost statistics and trends the most relevant model outputs to soil frost were soil frost depth soil temperature and ice content for each soil layer m3 m 3 shaw model calculates frost depth via linear interpolation of ice content in the deepest layer with frost a soil layer can have a sub freezing temperature but will not be considered frozen unless ice is present for each calendar year the number of frost days and days with continuous frost were determined a freeze thaw cycle ftc was determined based on the presence of frost in the form of ice content the model resolved frost in the top centimeters of the soil and predicted more ftcs than observed at selected depths e g at 10 cm see andradóttir et al 2021 trends were assessed using the mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 and the significance of the slope using the theil sen method sen 1968 theil 1950 these methods were chosen due to their simplicity because they are non parametric the data does not need to conform with any particular distribution they allow for missing data and can be used for small datasets n 40 gilbert 1987 a significant trend is considered for a 95 confidence level α 0 05 2 3 2 co probability of liquid water and frost the approach to understanding the co action of hydrological inputs and soil frost was to estimate the joint probability of occurrence of two winter hydrological events the combined daily precipitation and snow depth measurements at 9 a m annual maximum rainfall snowmelt and rain on snow in the presence of soil frost were calculated rainfall was distinguished from snowfall based on a temperature threshold trh c that incorporated relative humidity rh following the method presented by feiccabrino et al 2015 11 t rh 0 75 0 085 100 r h with this definition daily precipitation was classified either as dry or wet when in some instances it can take both forms snowmelt was defined based on the reduction of snow depth δsd converted to snow water equivalent assuming a snow density ρs of 200 kg m 3 in relation to a water density ρw of 1000 kg m 3 if precipitation was recorded together with a reduction in snow depth it was assumed to be rainfall the magnitude of ros was taken as the sum of the rain and liquid snowmelt volume mm estimated from measured snow depth in cm as presented in andradóttir et al 2021 12 ros p s n o w m e l t p ρ s ρ w δ s d 10 each of the annual daily maximum datasets was fitted to a distribution using the maximum likelihood method and the goodness of fit was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov cramer von mises and anderson darling tests then the distribution with the lowest akaike aic and bayesian information criteria bic was chosen as such maximum snowmelt during frost was fitted to the lognormal distribution maximum frost during snowmelt to the weibull distribution maximum rainfall during frost to the lognormal distribution and maximum frost during rainfall to the weibull distribution maximum ros during frost and maximum frost during ros were both fitted to the weibull distribution table a 2 the return periods were then derived for each of the co acting hydrological variables chow et al 1988 the copula method was used to estimate the joint distribution c fx x fy y c u1 u2 of two dependent variables based on their marginal distributions of the annual maximum values fitted to a theoretical distribution fx x u1 and fy y u2 chen 2019 lian et al 2013 zellou and rahali 2019 the four archimedean copulas most widely used for hydrological analyses due to their simplicity nelsen 2007 were tested table 3 the three pairs of winter flood inducing hydrological variables i e maximum snowmelt during frost rainfall during frost and ros during frost were then fitted to one of the bivariate archimedean copulas i e joe clayton gumbel and frank using the maximum likelihood method the bivariate copula family that best fits the pair was chosen based on the highest log likelihood and lowest aic and bic zellou and rahali 2019 two sets were modeled using the clayton copula and ros during frost was fitted using the frank copula table a 1 the probabilities of the joint occurrence of annual maxima for the period of 1949 2018 were estimated based on the joint cumulative distribution function cdf furthermore the bivariate joint return periods for the annual maxima were derived as the inverse of the probability of both events occurring simultaneously defined as the and operator the joint probability of exceedance for two hydrological events was calculated following lian et al 2013 and zellou and rahali 2019 as 13 p x x y y 1 f x f y f x y where p x x y y is the probability of both x and y exceeding a certain threshold 3 results 3 1 model simulation performance 3 1 1 soil temperature the shaw model accurately predicted the hourly daily and seasonal changes in soil temperature at various depths within the top 1 m of soil at both sites during all seasons as reflected in r2 0 91 and rmse 0 66 1 64 c table 4 the model performed slightly better at urriðaholt where soil properties were tested in the laboratory and the field than at the reykjavík site where the soil properties were not measured in the urriðaholt site the model performed equally well during the calibration period until august 3 2020 and validation period starting august 4 2020 while the model performance dropped during winters at both sites lower r2 and rmse table 4 the timing of frost formation and thawing was well captured within the top 25 cm of the soil that is most susceptible to frost fig 3 a c hence for urban hydrology applications the model predicts very well repeated freeze thaw in the top 25 cm of soil the model performance was slightly lower in the bottom layers lastly the model was less reliable in capturing temperature peaks during the winter of 2019 2020 when synthetic runoff experiments were conducted in the grass swales zaqout and andradóttir 2021 not shown in fig 3 3 1 2 soil liquid moisture content and frost depth the simulated moisture content deviated considerably from observed values at urriðaholt table 4 for the entire monitoring period the model s performance was relatively more accurate for the validation period than the calibration r2 0 1 0 43 vs 0 2 0 44 the simulated values were worse during winter when the model failed to capture sharp increases during rainfall it did however capture relatively well the reduction in liquid moisture content resulting from soil freezing most importantly the model accurately predicted soil frost formation and frost depth during four winters with very different frost conditions fig 4 during the first winter 2018 2019 frost was only observed at the topsoil horizon 5 cm represented by negative soil temperature and a reduction in the liquid moisture content due to the phase change heavy horizontal line in fig 4 the model however predicted the frost depth to have reached down to a 12 cm depth this was also shown in the simulated ice content by the model as ice developed at the 5 cm simulation depth θi 0 24 and slightly at 15 cm depth θi 0 07 during the second winter more occurrences of soil frost compared to the first winter were predicted and frost persisted longer fig 4 still the maximum frost depth similarly did not extend beyond the 15 cm soil horizon which was also consistent with field observations zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 however the simulated ice content was almost double of that during the preceding winter θi 0 41 at 5 cm depth this indicated that the topsoil horizon was almost completely frozen with few soil pores available for infiltration θmax 0 54 at 5 cm depth the most severe freezing reaching down to 31 cm depth was predicted during the third winter consistent with frost observed at 25 cm depth the maximum ice content at 5 cm was similar to the one during the preceding winter θi 0 43 all the layers except the one at 45 cm developed frost represented in the predicted ice content θi 0 26 0 15 and 0 02 for the second third and fourth layers respectively during the fourth and last winter the soil was frozen down to a maximum of 20 cm and the maximum ice content was 0 22 at 5 cm depth as well as 15 cm consistent with maximum frost depth observed at the 15 cm horizon overall the model gave considerable novel insights beyond the observations at finer intervals 3 2 daily soil frost predictions 1949 2018 3 2 1 summary statistics daily soil temperature and moisture content at 10 20 and 50 cm depths frost and snow depth were simulated using the calibrated shaw model and historical weather data at reykjavík dating back to 1949 selected time series are presented in fig 5 and top level statistics are summarized in table 5 the model predicted some increase in winter soil temperature fig 5a the lowest soil temperature at the surface 3 7 c and 10 cm 2 6 c was simulated for the winter of 1949 however the model overestimated the measured soil temperature in the last three winters 2015 2018 rmse 0 82 2 5 r2 0 3 0 94 while correctly identifying the timing of frost frost depth and ice content was seen to decrease in the past 70 years fig 5b the maximum number of days with soil frost in any given calendar year was 153 days table 5 which was in 1951 meanwhile the minimum number of frost days was 26 days in 1987 and the shortest period of continuous frost lasted for only 4 days also in 1987 the average number of freeze thaw cycles in a year is 3 65 and the maximum was 8 cycles occurring both in 1965 and 1971 3 2 2 sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis was conducted using several selected parameters both at the surface and within the soil profile as well as selected meteorological inputs table 6 common soil textural classes according to the usda 1987 and saturated hydraulic conductivity were tested uncertainty regarding precipitation depth in dry form snowfall was also tested using the wind correction method presented by crochet et al 2007 the model predictions were consistent in terms of maximum predicted frost depth no of frost days and ftcs as well as soil temperature rmse 1 51 2 11 r2 0 91 0 93 the model was most sensitive to changes in vegetation cover specifically if the ground was considered bare the rmse increased substantially 2 11 c the model was somewhat sensitive to soil texture class reflected in a slightly lower rmse and number of frost days if the soil was considered to contain more fines the model was not sensitive to hydraulic conductivity or precipitation in dry form snowfall 3 2 3 trends the mann kendall and sen s slope tests suggest that soil frost depth decreased significantly p value 0 05 in the 70 years analyzed in this study fig 6 a and table 7 similarly the total number of days with soil frost near the surface has almost halved during these seven decades from 108 to 62 days fig 6b this trend is even greater when considering the number of soil frost days at 15 cm depth table 7 projecting the simulations forward soil frost may rarely reach 15 cm in another two decades soil frost has also become less persistent as the number of days with continuous soil frost decreased significantly p value 0 05 fig 6c and table 7 this suggests that the instances of intermittent formation of soil frost have increased during winter which was reflected in the increase however insignificantly in the number of freeze thaw cycles over the studied 70 years the increase in the frequency of intermittent frost can also be seen in the significant increase in the minimum soil temperature at 10 cm depth in reykjavík for the simulation period of 1949 to 2018 fig 6d 3 3 co probability of soil frost and runoff generation the maximum ros volume during frost and maximum frost during ros were both found to fit the weibull distribution the univariate return period and event depth i e ros in mm and frost in cm were derived table 8 the joint cumulative distribution function of ros and frost was then calculated using the frank copula table 3 the probability of simultaneous occurrence was obtained using eq 13 the probability of two hydrological events occurring simultaneously is considerably lower than the probability of only one occurring at a time but the severity of such events is higher for instance a 5 year ros event 30 mm occurring simultaneously with a 2 year frost depth 11 cm has a bivariate return period of approximately 9 years table 8 a 30 mm event if taken into consideration separately it might be classified as moderate event however if it occurred simultaneously with soil frost it could lead to substantial runoff and flooding furthermore a 2 year ros event 20 mm and a 2 year frost depth 11 cm have a probability of co occurring with a return period of 4 years 27 such event can be considered frequent and is known to produce substantial water related insurance claims in reykjavík andradóttir et al 2021 among the three tested sets i e snowmelt frost rainfall frost and ros frost the ros volume during frost was found to be the highest fig 7 extreme snowmelt events resulting in 40 50 mm of meltwater release t 50 100 years when the soil is frozen at least at the surface t 1 2 years have a probability of only 1 2 fig 7 table a 3 that said the probability of a 2 year frost depth 10 cm co occurring with a 2 year snowmelt event 10 mm d or a 5 year snowmelt event 20 mm d is relatively high joint probability of 28 and 12 in contrast rainfall during frost was found to have slightly larger event depths than those for snowmelt during frost as well as marginally higher joint probabilities joint probability of 30 for a 2 year vs 2 year events fig 7 table a 3 3 4 timing of worst soil frost and runoff generation soil frost was most frequently simulated during peak winter months from december to march fig 8 a the 24 hour maximum frost depth in january and february was significantly higher than in the rest of the winter months p value 0 05 with an average of 12 6 and 12 3 cm respectively fig 8b this timing of maximum frost coincides very well with the largest ros volume averaging at 8 5 9 and 11 mm in january february and march fig 8c the largest snowmelt depths also occurred in january and february an average of 9 7 and 9 5 mm respectively fig 8d total precipitation and rainfall depth were highest during october november and december not shown the shaw model predicts that the soil frost season has shortened significantly in the past 70 years both with a delayed start p value 0 05 and earlier end p value 0 05 fig 9 a and b respectively so while the frost season is shortening it is not affecting the likelihood of maximum frost co occurring with maximum ros the fact that the last day of frost is no longer occurring as late as april and may suggests that the likelihood of maximum frost and maximum ros or snowmelt occurring simultaneously may increase in the next few decades under continuous climate warming 4 discussion this study focused on resolving the trends in soil frost and co action with rain and snowmelt in a maritime climate undergoing frequent freeze thaw cycles with the help of a numerical physically based model frost depth was found to decrease over the last 70 years under maritime climatic conditions consistent with previous research e g nygren et al 2021 the total number of frost days and duration of continuous frost decreased suggesting shorter frost cycles consistent with more intermittent frost the number of freeze thaw cycles also increased but not at a significant level this study also confirms previous research e g moghadas et al 2018 surfleet and tullos 2013 about the importance of ros in generating urban floods 24 hour ros events were found to be on the order of 5 and 10 mm more voluminous than maximum rainfall and snowmelt events with the same return period fig 7 however the research adds to previous knowledge by highlighting that ros induced flood risk is connected to a high co occurrence with soil frost mild rainfall and snowmelt events are known to result in significant damages if combined with deep frost formation which can render the normally pervious areas during summer not conductive in winter bengtsson and westerström 1992 westerström 1984 at the studied site even frost as shallow as 5 cm reduced the infiltration to a third of its summer rate in grassed surfaces and more in sparsely and non vegetated areas zaqout et al 2022 the results from this study also alleviated the uncertainties regarding the presence of soil frost in all major flooding events in reykjavík during winter andradóttir et al 2021 while soil frost depth and duration were found to decrease in this study which may ultimately suggest it is becoming a less relevant driver for urban flooding there are no clear indications that winter floods will become more benign in the next decades conversely the timing of maximum soil frost was found to shift so that it coincides more with the largest ros and snowmelt events in the months of january march this combined with a greater ros volume suggests that winter floods may intensify at least in the next decades while frost is still present urban areas transitioning from seasonal to intermittent snow covers may be particularly vulnerable to an increased risk of winter flooding the repeated snowmelt during winter in conjunction with frequent freeze thaw cycles are known to reduce soil insulation provided by an intact snow cover hardy et al 2001 moghadas et al 2018 consequently deep frost formation that might be impervious until the thawing process is completed is expected to increase moghadas et al 2018 winter conditions are often overlooked when designing drainage systems butler et al 2018 thorolfsson 2012 as high intensity short duration heavy summer rainfall is usually considered the largest cause of urban flooding bengtsson and westerström 1992 hammond et al 2015 additionally freeze thaw cycles are often not taken into account in hydrological modeling qi et al 2019 leading to an underestimation of runoff prediction since previous studies e g garvelmann et al 2015 surfleet and tullos 2013 wever et al 2014 würzer and jonas 2018 dong and menzel 2020 ford et al 2020 indicated that winter floods may become more voluminous and affect more regions with climate change infiltration inhibiting frost is still very relevant as found in this study in light of these results many urban areas may need to re think their stormwater management practices placing more emphasis on mitigating runoff augmentation because of infiltration inhibiting frost formation during frequent freeze thaw infiltration based sustainable urban drainage systems suds increase resilience to intensifying floods due to climate change as well as provide amenity air quality and biodiversity benefits which is in line with the united nation s sustainable development goal no 11 https sdgs un org however the risk of infiltration inhibiting frost could be mitigated with the careful selection of soil local vegetation and the incorporation of underdrains caraco and claytor 1997 lefevre et al 2009 roseen et al 2009 zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 this research highlights the importance of soil frost in winter urban hydrology and the role of numerical models in overcoming the lack of soil observations the limitations in input data to the model were addressed systematically and comprehensively the shaw model was first tested on a site urriðaholt with four years of detailed soil data then the calibrated model was applied to a nearby site with limited data reykjavík a selection of input parameters i e the hydraulic conductivity the saturated water content and pore size index were subsequently fine tuned to increase the accuracy of simulations rmse 1 64 c for the calibration period 2007 2018 lastly a sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uncertainties in the input parameters and their influence on the key model outputs i e maximum frost depth number of frost days and freeze thaw cycles table 6 soil texture and thermal properties influenced the accuracy of the model minimally consistent with the results of kahimba et al 2009 this is because of counteracting mechanisms on the one hand fine textured soils have a lower hydraulic conductivity compared to coarse textured soils which contributes to more frost formation during repeated freeze thaw cycles zheng et al 2021 and more surface runoff teng et al 2020 on the other hand fine soils have high thermal conductivity so that they respond faster yet more moderately to changes in atmospheric heating and cooling because of their higher heat capacity as compared to their coarse counterparts lundin 1990 the model simulations were somewhat sensitive to the type of vegetation cover both the height of the grass canopy and density previous research also suggests that the root system can play an important role a thick and dense root system has been shown to reduce the thermal conductivity of the underlying soil yang et al 2005 consistent with grass cover being less susceptible to frost formation soil deformation and freeze thaw cycles than less vegetated or barren areas zaqout et al 2022 in this study the model overestimated the soil temperature and underestimated frost formation during winter in reykjavík which could reflect a less extensive vegetation cover than assumed in general the model results agreed well with the measured hourly observations at both tested sites and the simulated soil temperature was not negatively affected by the inaccuracies in soil moisture prediction table 4 this was specifically true for the urriðaholt site with deviations of 1 0 c at all simulation depths which indicates good agreement with measured values eitzinger et al 2000 the model showed little sensitivity to variations in calibration parameters in the reykjavík study site as r2 ranged between 0 91 and 0 93 for all tested parameters lastly the historical predictions were conducted on daily time step basis and as such precipitation was classified as either in liquid or dry form based on air temperature and relative humidity for each day eq 11 this simplification does not affect the major results of the study which focused either on long term averages or annual maximum hydrological events 5 conclusions in this paper soil temperature liquid and ice moisture content and frost depth were simulated for two study areas in the greater capital region of iceland using the simultaneous heat and water shaw model a good agreement between the simulated and observed data was found at the two tested sites r2 0 91 which provided valuable insights into the freezing and thawing processes the numerical model proved particularly helpful in overcoming the lack of the long term soil observations needed for frequency and trend analyses and resolving very shallow frost that is difficult to measure within the top 5 cm the results show that the rise in air temperatures and liquid precipitation in winter due to climate change resulted in a significant reduction in frost depth over the last 70 years however a shift in the timing of maximum frost depth occurred and started to coincide with the largest winter events which might pose a higher urban flood risk in the future if the trend continues this study highlights the importance of analyzing the co acting hydrologic variables which is specifically needed in a cold climate as severe events can result from two mundane events happening simultaneously especially in the presence of soil frost that is often overlooked in the design of urban drainage systems in particular rain on snow events during frost were found to pose the greatest flood risk being more voluminous than rainfall or snowmelt alone the changing winter patterns and hydrological processes require a reconsideration of the planning and design of urban drainage systems specifically due to the increase in the number frequency and magnitude of rain on snow events in the last decades therefore a shift towards more sustainable approaches for stormwater management and re thinking urban runoff generation and drainage systems from a single variate single purpose approach to a multipurpose approach is urged declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2533,the most severe urban flooding in cold maritime climates is due to the co action of long duration rainfall snowmelt and soil frost increasing winter air temperature due to climate change is projected to change the magnitude and frequency of rain on snow ros events and increase the number of freeze thaw cycles and midwinter snowmelt while daily rainfall records are readily available less is known about the infiltration and frost formation within urban soils thus there is uncertainty on how warming winter conditions may affect urban flood risk and the climate resilience of cities the aim of this study was therefore to assess soil frost formation in the past 70 years in the maritime city of reykjavík iceland 64 n 21 w and its co action with runoff generation and the potential implications on urban flood risk to that end the daily thermal and hydraulic conditions of the soil were simulated using the simultaneous heat and water shaw model dating back to 1949 calibrated based on hourly observations from 2007 model simulations indicated that the minimum soil temperature at 10 cm depth has been warming at a rate of 0 015 c year in the past seven decades climate warming is also noted in a steady decline in frost depth and the duration of soil frost each winter p value 0 05 however the freezing season has shortened so that the timing of maximum frost coincides more with the timing of maximum ros and snowmelt events furthermore ros events during frost have the capacity to produce larger runoff volumes than rainfall or snowmelt alone based on the joint frequency analysis of winter events using the copula method this combined with increasing volume during ros events suggests that winter floods may intensify in the next decades which urges re thinking urban stormwater management in cold climates keywords climate change flooding rain on snow snowmelt frost shaw model data availability the data used in this study were collected from the field by the researchers and acquired from the icelandic meteorological office imo any additional data is available upon request from the aforementioned rightful owners 1 introduction soil frost is a widespread phenomenon affecting about 35 of the earth s surface williams and smith 1989 soil frost significantly alters the hydrological cycle and surface and subsurface exchanges of water and energy shanley and chalmers 1999 wang et al 2009 infiltration into frozen and partially frozen soils is reduced due to the presence of ice lenses granger et al 2011 khan et al 2012 slater et al 1998 wang et al 2009 soil frost paired with rain on snow ros generated the greatest number of flooded properties in a cold maritime climate andradóttir et al 2021 additionally frost formation is a key performance indicator for the hydrological performance of sustainable urban drainage systems suds which are increasingly adopted to integrate separate stormwater systems and increase cities resilience to climate change zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 water infiltration into frozen soil is essential for understanding and managing the biological activity and nutrients in soils watanabe et al 2013 severe frost action can impair the development and even the existence of plants and as such is known to severely contribute to soil erosion and compromise land restoration efforts arnalds 2015 benninghoff 1952 the atmospheric soil exchanges of heat and water and hence soil frost formation are governed by the surface conditions snow and vegetation and the physical properties of the underlying soil plant foliage influences the albedo and wind velocity profile near the soil surface and hence the shortwave and turbulent heat exchanges plant roots affect the soil porosity and stability flerchinger and pierson 1991 zaqout et al 2022 snow is an effective insulator and the absence or the late development of snowpacks leads to deeper and more persistent soil frost shanley and chalmers 1999 stadler et al 2000 the conductance of heat and water through the soil is affected by the grain size distribution porosity organic content the presence of macropores and cracks and the water content of the soil at the onset of freezing stähli et al 1999 specifically dry soils have been found to maintain infiltration even when frozen while saturated soils promote concrete frost formation granger et al 2011 kane 1980 coastal cold regions are subjected to intermittent midwinter snowmelt ros events and freeze thaw cycles andradóttir et al 2021 muthanna et al 2008 the repeated supply of near freezing meltwater together with the lack of the thermal insulation provided by a continuous snow cover results in an excessive wetting of the soil rendering it susceptible to frequent freezing and thawing zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 frequent freeze thaw cycles ftcs negatively affect soil ecosystem diversity and productivity because they cause changes in soil physical properties lead to soil deformation and affect water movement fouli et al 2013 liquid solid phase changes alter the soil s hydraulic and thermal properties significantly lundin 1990 watanabe and kugisaki 2017 zheng et al 2021 thus to fully understand frost formation in a cold maritime climate undergoing frequent freeze thaw requires the monitoring of both water content and soil temperature alternatively coupled modeling of heat and water transfer through the snow vegetation and soil profiles can be used several numerical models of soil freezing and thawing have been developed for agricultural forestry ecological and civil engineering applications e g flerchinger and saxton 1989a flerchinger and saxton 1989b guymon and luthin 1974 hansson et al 2004 jansson and karlberg 2004 šimůnek et al 2016 however most studies on soil freezing and thawing used data from laboratory experiments to calibrate and validate the models he et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 which may not be representative of the temporal and spatial variations in atmospheric forcing soil layering vegetation covers in the field zheng et al 2021 assessing flood risks in urban areas is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of urban catchments and the complex interactions between rain snow and soil frost andradóttir et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 in recent years joint probability theories have been adopted to analyze flood risk resulting from two or more hydrologic variables lian et al 2013 sörensen and bengtsson 2014 zellou and rahali 2019 the most famous of which is the copula probability model chen 2019 nelsen 2007 introduced by sklar 1959 the method involves expressing a multivariate joint cumulative distribution function in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and describing the dependence between the variables with copula functions salvadori and de michele 2007 with more wet and warm winters precipitation falls more in liquid form midwinter melt and ros events have been found to become more frequent garvelmann et al 2015 surfleet and tullos 2013 wever et al 2014 würzer and jonas 2018 and ros events more voluminous andradóttir et al 2021 moreover the number of freeze thaw cycles has been increasing in mountainous regions garvelmann et al 2015 würzer et al 2016 frequent ros snowmelt frost formation and infiltration in frozen ground are highly interlinked processes and less understood than during continuous snow cover wever et al 2014 while soil frost is a key indicator of urban flooding it is rarely considered when planning urban drainage systems bengtsson and westerström 1992 caraco and claytor 1997 maksimovic et al 2000 the lack of routine monitoring of soil is also a limiting factor for understanding urban flood risk and how the urban flood risk may change with climate change therefore the goal of this research was on the one hand to improve the understanding of soil frost formation in an area undergoing frequent freeze thaw cycles and ros events by means of numerical modeling on the other hand the study aims to assess the impacts of climate change on winter flood risk by analyzing the joint probability and timing of winter flood indicators i e rainfall snowmelt and ros events in the presence of soil frost lastly the implications of the research findings on urban flood risk and stormwater management are discussed in the context of the need for more climate resilient cities as stipulated by the united nations sustainable development goal no 11 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection the capital region of reykjavík 230 000 1000 km2 includes six municipalities sited within a few kilometers from the coastline in the southwestern corner of iceland fig 1 the local climate is heavily influenced by the gulf stream with cool summers and mild winters with temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point einarsson 1984 soil frost rarely extends beyond 20 cm depth petersen 2018 precipitation tends to be frequent and mild 213 rainy days totaling approx 1000 mm per annum ólafsson et al 2007 precipitation falls mostly at high winds with the forward passage of cyclones from the southwest which prevail especially in winter einarsson 1984 the most severe urban flood events in reykjavík were associated with the co action of rain snow and soil frost andradóttir et al 2021 data from two sites located 6 km apart were obtained for the purpose of the study fig 1 both sites were located in open grassed covered areas 40 50 m a s l and at 3 km distance from the ocean table 1 2 1 1 urriðaholt site hourly weather and soil temperature data were compiled from the high resolution 10 min monitoring program in the residential neighborhood urriðaholt in garðabær iceland 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w as described in zaqout et al 2022 the neighborhood was built with a large network of sustainable urban drainage systems suds to safeguard the quantity and quality of water entering urriðavatn pond soil temperature and water content were monitored at 5 15 25 35 and 45 cm depths within a grass swale for the period of november 2018 until 2022 table 1 soil physical characteristics at different horizons such as particle size distribution and bulk density were measured in the laboratory using collected samples from the study swale the soil was classified as sandy loam with 15 20 gravel 75 82 sand and 2 5 4 fines clay and silt saturated soil water content and field capacity were estimated from observed soil water content measured using water content reflectometers saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated based on typical values for the corresponding soil textural class cross checked with single ring infiltration measurements at the study site more details on the soil monitoring program are available in zaqout

headquarters of the icelandic meteorological office imo located in bústaðavegur 7 reykjavík 64 07 39 1 n 21 54 08 5 w hourly soil temperature weather longwave and shortwave radiation data were also available from the reykjavík station for the period of 2007 2019 table 1 2 2 numerical modeling 2 2 1 shaw model description the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger and saxton 1989a flerchinger and saxton 1989b is an open source model which has been widely used to simulate soil temperature and frost kahimba et al 2009 the model is a physically based finite difference coupled heat water and solute transfer it consists of a vertical one dimensional profile extending from the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface the vegetation canopy the snow cover if present and to a certain depth within the soil fig 2 while several models assume soil freezing has the same effect as drying soil the shaw model takes into account the reduction in soil porosity in subzero conditions due to the presence of ice filled pores at which hydraulic conductivity is reduced linearly with ice content kahimba et al 2009 flerchinger 2000 the water balance is expressed as

conditions at the urriðaholt study site the hourly averages of weather conditions constructed from the 10 minute observations at the study site were used as inputs for the model and soil temperature and moisture content were used as initial values table 1 hourly incoming shortwave radiation was used from the reykjavík station no 1 for the same period imo 2022a the dataset was split into two a calibration period from november 2018 to august 2020 and a validation period from august 2020 to may 2022 the soil physical properties determined from the soil samples were used for the initial runs and adjusted to calibrate the model table 2 in reykjavík the model was first calibrated and tested using the available hourly soil temperature data from 2007 until 2019 table 1 soil physical and hydraulic characteristics were manually adjusted by trial and error starting with measured soil properties in urriðaholt as a basis table 2 the model was then run using the daily weather observations i e air temperature relative humidity precipitation and wind speed measured from midnight to midnight for the targeted period of 1949 to 2018 imo 2020b historical solar radiation was estimated based on the potential extraterrestrial solar radiation so w m 2 based on latitude and day of year following the approach outlined in bras 1990 the clear sky solar radiation sc was estimated as 9 s c s o e x p n α 1 m where a turbidity factor of n 3 was chosen to represent the clean urban area α1 is the molecular scattering coefficient and the optical air mass m approximated by the cosecant 1 sinα of the solar altitude α the net radiation incoming radiation was estimated as 10 s s s c 1 0 65 n 2 where n is measured diurnal cloud cover converted from oktas to a ratio from 0 to 1 the reconstructed daily shortwave radiation agreed well with observations from 2007 to 2018 r2 0 9 rmse 33 w m2 fig a 1 2 2 3 model performance evaluation the model prediction ability was primarily assessed based on soil temperature and secondarily on the basis of soil water content two performance metrics were used the linear correlation coefficient r2 was calculated to test how well seasonal and synoptic changes were represented in the model in addition the root mean square error rmse was calculated to assess the average deviation between the observed and simulated value at each time step 2 3 data analyses 2 3 1 soil frost statistics and trends the most relevant model outputs to soil frost were soil frost depth soil temperature and ice content for each soil layer m3 m 3 shaw model calculates frost depth via linear interpolation of ice content in the deepest layer with frost a soil layer can have a sub freezing temperature but will not be considered frozen unless ice is present for each calendar year the number of frost days and days with continuous frost were determined a freeze thaw cycle ftc was determined based on the presence of frost in the form of ice content the model resolved frost in the top centimeters of the soil and predicted more ftcs than observed at selected depths e g at 10 cm see andradóttir et al 2021 trends were assessed using the mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 and the significance of the slope using the theil sen method sen 1968 theil 1950 these methods were chosen due to their simplicity because they are non parametric the data does not need to conform with any particular distribution they allow for missing data and can be used for small datasets n 40 gilbert 1987 a significant trend is considered for a 95 confidence level α 0 05 2 3 2 co probability of liquid water and frost the approach to understanding the co action of hydrological inputs and soil frost was to estimate the joint probability of occurrence of two winter hydrological events the combined daily precipitation and snow depth measurements at 9 a m annual maximum rainfall snowmelt and rain on snow in the presence of soil frost were calculated rainfall was distinguished from snowfall based on a temperature threshold trh c that incorporated relative humidity rh following the method presented by feiccabrino et al 2015 11 t rh 0 75 0 085 100 r h with this definition daily precipitation was classified either as dry or wet when in some instances it can take both forms snowmelt was defined based on the reduction of snow depth δsd converted to snow water equivalent assuming a snow density ρs of 200 kg m 3 in relation to a water density ρw of 1000 kg m 3 if precipitation was recorded together with a reduction in snow depth it was assumed to be rainfall the magnitude of ros was taken as the sum of the rain and liquid snowmelt volume mm estimated from measured snow depth in cm as presented in andradóttir et al 2021 12 ros p s n o w m e l t p ρ s ρ w δ s d 10 each of the annual daily maximum datasets was fitted to a distribution using the maximum likelihood method and the goodness of fit was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov cramer von mises and anderson darling tests then the distribution with the lowest akaike aic and bayesian information criteria bic was chosen as such maximum snowmelt during frost was fitted to the lognormal distribution maximum frost during snowmelt to the weibull distribution maximum rainfall during frost to the lognormal distribution and maximum frost during rainfall to the weibull distribution maximum ros during frost and maximum frost during ros were both fitted to the weibull distribution table a 2 the return periods were then derived for each of the co acting hydrological variables chow et al 1988 the copula method was used to estimate the joint distribution c fx x fy y c u1 u2 of two dependent variables based on their marginal distributions of the annual maximum values fitted to a theoretical distribution fx x u1 and fy y u2 chen 2019 lian et al 2013 zellou and rahali 2019 the four archimedean copulas most widely used for hydrological analyses due to their simplicity nelsen 2007 were tested table 3 the three pairs of winter flood inducing hydrological variables i e maximum snowmelt during frost rainfall during frost and ros during frost were then fitted to one of the bivariate archimedean copulas i e joe clayton gumbel and frank using the maximum likelihood method the bivariate copula family that best fits the pair was chosen based on the highest log likelihood and lowest aic and bic zellou and rahali 2019 two sets were modeled using the clayton copula and ros during frost was fitted using the frank copula table a 1 the probabilities of the joint occurrence of annual maxima for the period of 1949 2018 were estimated based on the joint cumulative distribution function cdf furthermore the bivariate joint return periods for the annual maxima were derived as the inverse of the probability of both events occurring simultaneously defined as the and operator the joint probability of exceedance for two hydrological events was calculated following lian et al 2013 and zellou and rahali 2019 as 13 p x x y y 1 f x f y f x y where p x x y y is the probability of both x and y exceeding a certain threshold 3 results 3 1 model simulation performance 3 1 1 soil temperature the shaw model accurately predicted the hourly daily and seasonal changes in soil temperature at various depths within the top 1 m of soil at both sites during all seasons as reflected in r2 0 91 and rmse 0 66 1 64 c table 4 the model performed slightly better at urriðaholt where soil properties were tested in the laboratory and the field than at the reykjavík site where the soil properties were not measured in the urriðaholt site the model performed equally well during the calibration period until august 3 2020 and validation period starting august 4 2020 while the model performance dropped during winters at both sites lower r2 and rmse table 4 the timing of frost formation and thawing was well captured within the top 25 cm of the soil that is most susceptible to frost fig 3 a c hence for urban hydrology applications the model predicts very well repeated freeze thaw in the top 25 cm of soil the model performance was slightly lower in the bottom layers lastly the model was less reliable in capturing temperature peaks during the winter of 2019 2020 when synthetic runoff experiments were conducted in the grass swales zaqout and andradóttir 2021 not shown in fig 3 3 1 2 soil liquid moisture content and frost depth the simulated moisture content deviated considerably from observed values at urriðaholt table 4 for the entire monitoring period the model s performance was relatively more accurate for the validation period than the calibration r2 0 1 0 43 vs 0 2 0 44 the simulated values were worse during winter when the model failed to capture sharp increases during rainfall it did however capture relatively well the reduction in liquid moisture content resulting from soil freezing most importantly the model accurately predicted soil frost formation and frost depth during four winters with very different frost conditions fig 4 during the first winter 2018 2019 frost was only observed at the topsoil horizon 5 cm represented by negative soil temperature and a reduction in the liquid moisture content due to the phase change heavy horizontal line in fig 4 the model however predicted the frost depth to have reached down to a 12 cm depth this was also shown in the simulated ice content by the model as ice developed at the 5 cm simulation depth θi 0 24 and slightly at 15 cm depth θi 0 07 during the second winter more occurrences of soil frost compared to the first winter were predicted and frost persisted longer fig 4 still the maximum frost depth similarly did not extend beyond the 15 cm soil horizon which was also consistent with field observations zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 however the simulated ice content was almost double of that during the preceding winter θi 0 41 at 5 cm depth this indicated that the topsoil horizon was almost completely frozen with few soil pores available for infiltration θmax 0 54 at 5 cm depth the most severe freezing reaching down to 31 cm depth was predicted during the third winter consistent with frost observed at 25 cm depth the maximum ice content at 5 cm was similar to the one during the preceding winter θi 0 43 all the layers except the one at 45 cm developed frost represented in the predicted ice content θi 0 26 0 15 and 0 02 for the second third and fourth layers respectively during the fourth and last winter the soil was frozen down to a maximum of 20 cm and the maximum ice content was 0 22 at 5 cm depth as well as 15 cm consistent with maximum frost depth observed at the 15 cm horizon overall the model gave considerable novel insights beyond the observations at finer intervals 3 2 daily soil frost predictions 1949 2018 3 2 1 summary statistics daily soil temperature and moisture content at 10 20 and 50 cm depths frost and snow depth were simulated using the calibrated shaw model and historical weather data at reykjavík dating back to 1949 selected time series are presented in fig 5 and top level statistics are summarized in table 5 the model predicted some increase in winter soil temperature fig 5a the lowest soil temperature at the surface 3 7 c and 10 cm 2 6 c was simulated for the winter of 1949 however the model overestimated the measured soil temperature in the last three winters 2015 2018 rmse 0 82 2 5 r2 0 3 0 94 while correctly identifying the timing of frost frost depth and ice content was seen to decrease in the past 70 years fig 5b the maximum number of days with soil frost in any given calendar year was 153 days table 5 which was in 1951 meanwhile the minimum number of frost days was 26 days in 1987 and the shortest period of continuous frost lasted for only 4 days also in 1987 the average number of freeze thaw cycles in a year is 3 65 and the maximum was 8 cycles occurring both in 1965 and 1971 3 2 2 sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis was conducted using several selected parameters both at the surface and within the soil profile as well as selected meteorological inputs table 6 common soil textural classes according to the usda 1987 and saturated hydraulic conductivity were tested uncertainty regarding precipitation depth in dry form snowfall was also tested using the wind correction method presented by crochet et al 2007 the model predictions were consistent in terms of maximum predicted frost depth no of frost days and ftcs as well as soil temperature rmse 1 51 2 11 r2 0 91 0 93 the model was most sensitive to changes in vegetation cover specifically if the ground was considered bare the rmse increased substantially 2 11 c the model was somewhat sensitive to soil texture class reflected in a slightly lower rmse and number of frost days if the soil was considered to contain more fines the model was not sensitive to hydraulic conductivity or precipitation in dry form snowfall 3 2 3 trends the mann kendall and sen s slope tests suggest that soil frost depth decreased significantly p value 0 05 in the 70 years analyzed in this study fig 6 a and table 7 similarly the total number of days with soil frost near the surface has almost halved during these seven decades from 108 to 62 days fig 6b this trend is even greater when considering the number of soil frost days at 15 cm depth table 7 projecting the simulations forward soil frost may rarely reach 15 cm in another two decades soil frost has also become less persistent as the number of days with continuous soil frost decreased significantly p value 0 05 fig 6c and table 7 this suggests that the instances of intermittent formation of soil frost have increased during winter which was reflected in the increase however insignificantly in the number of freeze thaw cycles over the studied 70 years the increase in the frequency of intermittent frost can also be seen in the significant increase in the minimum soil temperature at 10 cm depth in reykjavík for the simulation period of 1949 to 2018 fig 6d 3 3 co probability of soil frost and runoff generation the maximum ros volume during frost and maximum frost during ros were both found to fit the weibull distribution the univariate return period and event depth i e ros in mm and frost in cm were derived table 8 the joint cumulative distribution function of ros and frost was then calculated using the frank copula table 3 the probability of simultaneous occurrence was obtained using eq 13 the probability of two hydrological events occurring simultaneously is considerably lower than the probability of only one occurring at a time but the severity of such events is higher for instance a 5 year ros event 30 mm occurring simultaneously with a 2 year frost depth 11 cm has a bivariate return period of approximately 9 years table 8 a 30 mm event if taken into consideration separately it might be classified as moderate event however if it occurred simultaneously with soil frost it could lead to substantial runoff and flooding furthermore a 2 year ros event 20 mm and a 2 year frost depth 11 cm have a probability of co occurring with a return period of 4 years 27 such event can be considered frequent and is known to produce substantial water related insurance claims in reykjavík andradóttir et al 2021 among the three tested sets i e snowmelt frost rainfall frost and ros frost the ros volume during frost was found to be the highest fig 7 extreme snowmelt events resulting in 40 50 mm of meltwater release t 50 100 years when the soil is frozen at least at the surface t 1 2 years have a probability of only 1 2 fig 7 table a 3 that said the probability of a 2 year frost depth 10 cm co occurring with a 2 year snowmelt event 10 mm d or a 5 year snowmelt event 20 mm d is relatively high joint probability of 28 and 12 in contrast rainfall during frost was found to have slightly larger event depths than those for snowmelt during frost as well as marginally higher joint probabilities joint probability of 30 for a 2 year vs 2 year events fig 7 table a 3 3 4 timing of worst soil frost and runoff generation soil frost was most frequently simulated during peak winter months from december to march fig 8 a the 24 hour maximum frost depth in january and february was significantly higher than in the rest of the winter months p value 0 05 with an average of 12 6 and 12 3 cm respectively fig 8b this timing of maximum frost coincides very well with the largest ros volume averaging at 8 5 9 and 11 mm in january february and march fig 8c the largest snowmelt depths also occurred in january and february an average of 9 7 and 9 5 mm respectively fig 8d total precipitation and rainfall depth were highest during october november and december not shown the shaw model predicts that the soil frost season has shortened significantly in the past 70 years both with a delayed start p value 0 05 and earlier end p value 0 05 fig 9 a and b respectively so while the frost season is shortening it is not affecting the likelihood of maximum frost co occurring with maximum ros the fact that the last day of frost is no longer occurring as late as april and may suggests that the likelihood of maximum frost and maximum ros or snowmelt occurring simultaneously may increase in the next few decades under continuous climate warming 4 discussion this study focused on resolving the trends in soil frost and co action with rain and snowmelt in a maritime climate undergoing frequent freeze thaw cycles with the help of a numerical physically based model frost depth was found to decrease over the last 70 years under maritime climatic conditions consistent with previous research e g nygren et al 2021 the total number of frost days and duration of continuous frost decreased suggesting shorter frost cycles consistent with more intermittent frost the number of freeze thaw cycles also increased but not at a significant level this study also confirms previous research e g moghadas et al 2018 surfleet and tullos 2013 about the importance of ros in generating urban floods 24 hour ros events were found to be on the order of 5 and 10 mm more voluminous than maximum rainfall and snowmelt events with the same return period fig 7 however the research adds to previous knowledge by highlighting that ros induced flood risk is connected to a high co occurrence with soil frost mild rainfall and snowmelt events are known to result in significant damages if combined with deep frost formation which can render the normally pervious areas during summer not conductive in winter bengtsson and westerström 1992 westerström 1984 at the studied site even frost as shallow as 5 cm reduced the infiltration to a third of its summer rate in grassed surfaces and more in sparsely and non vegetated areas zaqout et al 2022 the results from this study also alleviated the uncertainties regarding the presence of soil frost in all major flooding events in reykjavík during winter andradóttir et al 2021 while soil frost depth and duration were found to decrease in this study which may ultimately suggest it is becoming a less relevant driver for urban flooding there are no clear indications that winter floods will become more benign in the next decades conversely the timing of maximum soil frost was found to shift so that it coincides more with the largest ros and snowmelt events in the months of january march this combined with a greater ros volume suggests that winter floods may intensify at least in the next decades while frost is still present urban areas transitioning from seasonal to intermittent snow covers may be particularly vulnerable to an increased risk of winter flooding the repeated snowmelt during winter in conjunction with frequent freeze thaw cycles are known to reduce soil insulation provided by an intact snow cover hardy et al 2001 moghadas et al 2018 consequently deep frost formation that might be impervious until the thawing process is completed is expected to increase moghadas et al 2018 winter conditions are often overlooked when designing drainage systems butler et al 2018 thorolfsson 2012 as high intensity short duration heavy summer rainfall is usually considered the largest cause of urban flooding bengtsson and westerström 1992 hammond et al 2015 additionally freeze thaw cycles are often not taken into account in hydrological modeling qi et al 2019 leading to an underestimation of runoff prediction since previous studies e g garvelmann et al 2015 surfleet and tullos 2013 wever et al 2014 würzer and jonas 2018 dong and menzel 2020 ford et al 2020 indicated that winter floods may become more voluminous and affect more regions with climate change infiltration inhibiting frost is still very relevant as found in this study in light of these results many urban areas may need to re think their stormwater management practices placing more emphasis on mitigating runoff augmentation because of infiltration inhibiting frost formation during frequent freeze thaw infiltration based sustainable urban drainage systems suds increase resilience to intensifying floods due to climate change as well as provide amenity air quality and biodiversity benefits which is in line with the united nation s sustainable development goal no 11 https sdgs un org however the risk of infiltration inhibiting frost could be mitigated with the careful selection of soil local vegetation and the incorporation of underdrains caraco and claytor 1997 lefevre et al 2009 roseen et al 2009 zaqout et al 2022 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 this research highlights the importance of soil frost in winter urban hydrology and the role of numerical models in overcoming the lack of soil observations the limitations in input data to the model were addressed systematically and comprehensively the shaw model was first tested on a site urriðaholt with four years of detailed soil data then the calibrated model was applied to a nearby site with limited data reykjavík a selection of input parameters i e the hydraulic conductivity the saturated water content and pore size index were subsequently fine tuned to increase the accuracy of simulations rmse 1 64 c for the calibration period 2007 2018 lastly a sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uncertainties in the input parameters and their influence on the key model outputs i e maximum frost depth number of frost days and freeze thaw cycles table 6 soil texture and thermal properties influenced the accuracy of the model minimally consistent with the results of kahimba et al 2009 this is because of counteracting mechanisms on the one hand fine textured soils have a lower hydraulic conductivity compared to coarse textured soils which contributes to more frost formation during repeated freeze thaw cycles zheng et al 2021 and more surface runoff teng et al 2020 on the other hand fine soils have high thermal conductivity so that they respond faster yet more moderately to changes in atmospheric heating and cooling because of their higher heat capacity as compared to their coarse counterparts lundin 1990 the model simulations were somewhat sensitive to the type of vegetation cover both the height of the grass canopy and density previous research also suggests that the root system can play an important role a thick and dense root system has been shown to reduce the thermal conductivity of the underlying soil yang et al 2005 consistent with grass cover being less susceptible to frost formation soil deformation and freeze thaw cycles than less vegetated or barren areas zaqout et al 2022 in this study the model overestimated the soil temperature and underestimated frost formation during winter in reykjavík which could reflect a less extensive vegetation cover than assumed in general the model results agreed well with the measured hourly observations at both tested sites and the simulated soil temperature was not negatively affected by the inaccuracies in soil moisture prediction table 4 this was specifically true for the urriðaholt site with deviations of 1 0 c at all simulation depths which indicates good agreement with measured values eitzinger et al 2000 the model showed little sensitivity to variations in calibration parameters in the reykjavík study site as r2 ranged between 0 91 and 0 93 for all tested parameters lastly the historical predictions were conducted on daily time step basis and as such precipitation was classified as either in liquid or dry form based on air temperature and relative humidity for each day eq 11 this simplification does not affect the major results of the study which focused either on long term averages or annual maximum hydrological events 5 conclusions in this paper soil temperature liquid and ice moisture content and frost depth were simulated for two study areas in the greater capital region of iceland using the simultaneous heat and water shaw model a good agreement between the simulated and observed data was found at the two tested sites r2 0 91 which provided valuable insights into the freezing and thawing processes the numerical model proved particularly helpful in overcoming the lack of the long term soil observations needed for frequency and trend analyses and resolving very shallow frost that is difficult to measure within the top 5 cm the results show that the rise in air temperatures and liquid precipitation in winter due to climate change resulted in a significant reduction in frost depth over the last 70 years however a shift in the timing of maximum frost depth occurred and started to coincide with the largest winter events which might pose a higher urban flood risk in the future if the trend continues this study highlights the importance of analyzing the co acting hydrologic variables which is specifically needed in a cold climate as severe events can result from two mundane events happening simultaneously especially in the presence of soil frost that is often overlooked in the design of urban drainage systems in particular rain on snow events during frost were found to pose the greatest flood risk being more voluminous than rainfall or snowmelt alone the changing winter patterns and hydrological processes require a reconsideration of the planning and design of urban drainage systems specifically due to the increase in the number frequency and magnitude of rain on snow events in the last decades therefore a shift towards more sustainable approaches for stormwater management and re thinking urban runoff generation and drainage systems from a single variate single purpose

2534,three dimensional 3d high resolution and accurate characterization of the heterogeneity in an alluvial aquifer is critical to predicting the groundwater flow and contaminant transport in this study we extend the previous 2d conditional stochastic inversion method with respect to common offset ground penetrating radar gpr data to 3d for the estimation of 3d porosity distribution in a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer first 3d stochastic realizations of subsurface properties can be obtained using the fast fourier transform moving average fft ma method and the realizations are conditioned to borehole porosity measurements available in the 3d survey area as well as to the geostatistical parameters derived from the borehole logs and the processed 3d gpr data next the realizations are constantly modified and regenerated via a localized simulated annealing optimization strategy which ultimately makes their corresponding synthetic data offer an acceptable fit to the gpr data to accelerate the computational speed of 3d inversion we design and implement the multi gpus multi node parallelization of the 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm the proposed 3d inversion algorithm is positively verified through the application to field gpr data collected at the boise hydrogeophysical research site near boise idaho usa our results indicate that the proposed 3d inversion method has the potential to effectively recover the fine scale porosity distribution of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer keywords alluvial aquifer porosity distribution gpu 3d conditional stochastic inversion ground penetrating radar gpr fft ma data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of alluvial aquifers as a vital objective of many hydrogeological studies is of great importance to predict the subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant transport e g hu et al 2009 cardiff et al 2013 maliva 2016 vogelgesang et al 2020 however this goal is challenging because heterogeneity of hydraulic properties such as the permeability k and porosity distribution ϕ are intrinsic to aquifers worldwide e g rubin 2003 wu et al 2005 in this case traditional methods include kriging and stochastic simulation that utilize small scale measurements of cores slug and single hole tests and they can only characterize subsurface heterogeneity in a poor lateral resolution due to large spatial sampling intervals to this end a variety of methods including hydrogeological pressure based tracer based and geophysical methods have been suggested to help map this subsurface heterogeneity during the past two decades hydraulic tomography ht e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 has been developed as an effective hydrogeological technology to investigate the heterogeneous distributions of aquifer parameters they include synthetic experiments e g zhu and yeh 2005 liu and kitanidis 2011 mao et al 2013 laboratory sandbox experiments e g liu et al 2002 2007 illman et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 and field study e g berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2012 cardiff et al 2013 cardiff et al 2020 zhao and illman 2018 to interpret multiple pumping and observation data from ht tests yeh and liu 2000 propose the sequential successive linear estimator ssle based on the work of yeh et al 1996 for 3d steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis this method could jointly invert multiple pumping tests to map the k field and corresponding uncertainties then zhu and yeh 2005 extend the ssle analysis for transient ht analysis and gain well application effect in characterizing aquifer heterogeneity since then geostatistics based inverse methods have been widely used for synthetic and field ht data interpretation by several research groups e g liu et al 2007 castagna and bellin 2009 berg and illman 2011 cardiff and barrash 2011 cardiff et al 2012 2013 2020 lee and kitanidis 2014 hochstetler et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 for the majority of the above mentioned methods geostatistics based ht yields smoothed hydraulic parameter distributions when ht monitoring data are sparse e g yeh and liu 2000 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2017 this issue can be effectively alleviated by using as much data as possible however this also means a relatively higher time and financial costs for data collection as well as a potential higher computational demand as it is possible to collect more data for inverse analysis another way to improve this issue is to incorporate the perfect geological model in the ht inversion process e g schöniger et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 zhou et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 unfortunately it is rather difficult to obtain perfect knowledge of stratigraphy for the actual aquifers with current technology a range of geophysical measurements such as the ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity tomography ert and time domain electromagnetics tem methods have been widely used to map and characterize the aquifer heterogeneity with unprecedented resolution and coverage in the last several decades detail of such methods can be found in many literatures e g slater 2007 binley et al 2015 and references therein among these methods a particularly promising method with regard to the detailed characterization of alluvial aquifers is surface based ground penetrating radar gpr reflection profiling e g annan 2005 blindow 2006 and references therein the gpr reflection data can illustrate the structure of the probed subsurface region with high resolution but they do not readily provide detailed information on the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties since the high frequency electromagnetic wave propagation phenomena are largely governed by the dielectric permittivity which is highly sensitive to soil water content and thus to soil texture porosity above and below the water table respectively e g knight 2001 it is possible to estimate the porosity distribution of an alluvial aquifer by applying advanced processing or inversion techniques to gpr reflection data to this end a variety of approaches have been developed the vast majority of them rely upon the acquisition of multi offset data where multiple receiver antenna positions are considered for each transmitter antenna position in an analogous manner to seismic reflection survey the corresponding measurements can then be examined using a variety of techniques which include quantification of reflector moveout and reflection tomographic approaches e g greaves et al 1996 bradford et al 2009 mangel et al 2020 amplitude versus offset avo analysis e g bradford and deeds 2006 deparis and garambois 2009 and most recently waveform inversion e g lavoué et al 2014 babcock and bradford 2015 huai et al 2019 however one important drawback is that the acquisition of multi offset gpr data is time consuming and logistically cumbersome indeed such surveys become largely impractical in the context of long 2d profiles and particularly 3d acquisitions in practice most surface based gpr reflection surveys are performed using the common offset approach where a single transmitter receiver antenna pair separated by a small and fixed distance is incrementally moved along the survey line though the estimation of the subsurface property distribution from such data is substantially more difficult than for multi offset gpr surveys significant efforts have been made during the past decade because of the high potential rewards a common way to obtain the velocity information is the analysis of diffraction hyperbolas in common offset gpr data e g mount et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 liu et al 2022 but the results are strongly limited in terms of spatial resolution and the method inherently requires a high density of diffractions throughout the gpr profile to be reliable if suitable borehole measurements such as neutron neutron porosity logging are available for calibration along the gpr profile one promising alternative for the recovery of detailed dielectric property information from common offset gpr reflection data is impedance inversion in this regard schmelzbach et al 2012 present a workflow to recover the spatial structure of electromagnetic impedance which is closely related to soil dielectric permittivity and water content from gpr reflection data their approach involves sparse spike deconvolution of an amplitude corrected and migrated gpr image followed by band limited integration and scaling whereby the low frequency component of the impedance variability which is not possible to recover from the noisy gpr data alone is derived from borehole logs acquired along the profile zeng et al 2015 and liu et al 2018 use similar approaches to recover water content from common offset gpr profiles in complex environments and to characterize buried archaeological remains respectively xu et al 2021 propose a novel 2d conditional stochastic inversion method for surface based common offset gpr reflection data and show that the inversion approach could reliably recovering strongly 2d heterogeneous porosity structures of alluvial aquifers they assume a convolution model for the gpr traces but combine stochastic simulation with simulated annealing optimization in order to generate porosity realizations that honor the gpr measurements and borehole porosity log data along the profile although all of the aforementioned methods have the ability to estimate subsurface porosity from common offset gpr measurements they show its inherent limitations to describe the actual subsurface structure as the real world is 3d space to our knowledge the application of electromagnetic impedance inversion considering the 3d correlation structure of subsurface is still an open issue because it can be computationally highly expensive and extremely time consuming for a realistic hydrological model in this paper we propose a gpu accelerated scheme for extending the 2d stochastic type inversion method to 3d field work similar to the 2d case we consider the impedance based 3d conditional stochastic inversion of common offset gpr reflection data whereby we seek to match observed radargrams to spatial distributions of subsurface properties that honor a priori pertinent in situ information derived from borehole type measurements as well as prescribed geostatistical constraints this is done via 3d conditional geostatistical simulation within a stochastic optimization procedure the repeated application of which allows for the generation of multiple inverted conditional stochastic realizations in order to explore and quantify uncertainty xu et al 2021 to overcome the high computational cost the fast multi nodes multi gpus based 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm is further designed and implemented for the gpu server by using the cuda paralleled programing and the portable batch system pbs we demonstrate the viability of our method by considering a pertinent case study involving the use of 100 mhz gpr antenna centre frequencies at a well characterized hydrogeophysical test site the paper is thus structured as follows first we present the methodological foundations of our proposed 3d inversion approach then we apply the proposed method to 3d gpr field data acquired using 100 mhz antennas at the boise hydrogeophysical research site bhrs idaho usa compared with two extra borehole logs the inversion results are evaluated and validated we complete the paper with discussions and conclusions 2 methodology the proposed 3d conditional stochastic inversion method aims to generate 3d conditional stochastic subsurface property realizations which satisfy the gpr reflection and borehole data as well as the stochastic structure information the fft ma simulation method is used for generating the 3d conditional stochastic realization with the 3d stochastic structure information and boreholes logs of a certain property such as porosity gpr velocity etc and it is then further integrated into a simulated annealing sa optimization process in order to fit the recorded gpr reflection waveforms and borehole measurements the first premise to carry out the 3d conditional stochastic inversion method is that a certain number of boreholes with available borehole porosity logs or information closely related to another petrophysical property should be evenly distributed in the 3d gpr survey area regarding the second premise we assume full water saturation for simplicity and thus can link the gpr velocity and porosity via a suitable petrophysical transform relationship it should be pointed out that our inversion method still works with cases with partial water saturation as long as we know the corresponding petrophysical transform relationship a flowchart describing the general methodology of our 3d inversion procedure is schematically illustrated in fig 1 a set of 3d autocovariance parameters which can adequately capture the stochastic variability of subsurface porosity in the probed subsurface region are first estimated from the gpr data and borehole log data then a 3d stochastic porosity realization honoring these parameters and conditioned to the borehole or direct push porosity log measurements can be generated using the conditional fft ma simulated algorithm finally an improved sa optimization is applied to perturb the gaussian white noise vector to find a 3d porosity realization that honors the common offset gpr reflection data until the sa stopping criterion is satisfied to assess the uncertainty and examine the corresponding collection of realizations multiple inverted conditional realizations need to be generated and the parallelization strategy has been implemented to speed up the 3d inversion the above mentioned components are described in further detail in the following subsections 2 1 3d characterization of heterogeneous alluvial aquifer 2 1 1 von kármán autocorrelation in this study we assume that the subsurface porosity distribution ϕ x y z can be regarded as stochastic medium which is described as the sum of a smoothly varying or constant background porosity field ϕ 0 x y z and a small scale porosity fluctuation field δ ϕ x y z e g ikelle et al 1993 irving et al 2009 scholer et al 2010 jiang et al 2013 1 ϕ x y z ϕ 0 x y z δ ϕ x y z normally the small scale fluctuation field δ ϕ x y z is considered as a random process in space which can be characterized by different autocorrelation functions such as gaussian exponential and von kármán the stochastic medium models are widely used in geosciences to describe the subsurface heterogeneity e g goff and jordan 1988 ikelle et al 1993 savran and olsen 2016 here we consider the von kármán autocorrelation function which provides a fractal spatial description of a fabric over a wide scale range and is commonly used to characterize the statistical variation of alluvial aquifer e g tronicke and holliger 2005 dafflon et al 2009 in 3d case the von kármán autocorrelation equation is expressed as the following form e g goff and jordan 1988 2 r θ θ δ x δ y δ z r ν k ν r 2 ν 1 γ ν where r θ θ is the autocorrelation function δ x δ y and δ z are the spatial autocorrelation lags in the x y and z directions respectively k ν r is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order 0 ν 1 γ is the gamma function and 3 r δ x a x 2 δ y a y 2 δ z a z 2 is a normalized lag parameter with a x a y and a z denoting the spatial correlation lengths along x y and z respectively the hurst number ν in the expression for the von kármán autocorrelation equation determines the decay of the autocorrelation function at small lags i e the local variability of the associated heterogeneity values of ν close to 0 and 1 characterize locally highly complex and smooth fluctuations respectively in particular the von kármán autocorrelation function is identical to exponential autocorrelation function when ν 0 5 e g goff and jordan 1988 as mentioned above the 3d geostatistical porosity model can be parameterized by variables a x a y a z and ν which must be determined from available data following tronicke and holliger 2005 we can estimate parameters a z and ν as well as the porosity mean i e background porosity field and corresponding variance from the measured borehole porosity logs within the 3d gpr survey area xu et al 2020a relates the geostatistical properties of the 3d gpr backscattered wavefield to those of the underlying scattering medium and allows for inference of the structural aspect ratios a x a z and a y a z of the probed subsurface medium e g irving and holliger 2010 xu et al 2020a and it means that we can readily determine a x and a y once we know a z 2 1 2 fast fourier transform moving average fft ma to generate the stochastic medium models i e the unconditional stochastic realizations we adopt the fast fourier transform moving average fft ma method leravalec et al 2000 which is the simple and convenient implementation of the moving average ma method of oliver 1995 in the discrete wavenumber domain any permissible autocovariance model such as the von kármán autocorrelation function can be simulated exactly on the model grid the method clearly separates the random component from the deterministic component thus modifications can be brought to one or many random numbers within the model grid to create new realizations without altering the simulated autocovariance while this kind of modification cannot be achieved by using the standard power spectral simulation techniques e g ikelle 1993 the strength of its flexibility and fast calculation has led to the common application of fft ma for stochastic modeling and inversion e g le ravalec and mouche 2012 liang et al 2016 yang and zhu 2017 lauzon and marcotte 2019 generally the unconditional porosity simulations that are generated using the fft ma are effectively parameterized by a gaussian white noise vector in the spatial domain whose individual elements correspond to each location in the model grid e g le ravalec et al 2000 re simulating the values in this noise vector will produce different unconditional stochastic realizations all of which honor the underlying von kármán geostatistical model however the porosity values at the borehole locations do not honor the corresponding measured values as a key procedure in the 3d stochastic inversion method the generated unconditional stochastic realizations should be constrained to the hard data here the hard data is the measured borehole porosity and the common offset gpr reflection data 2 2 conditional stochastic simulation to produce realizations conditioned to the borehole measurements the corresponding equation of conditional stochastic porosity realization can be expressed as follows e g chilès and delfiner 2012 nussbaumer et al 2019 4 z c x y z z x y z z u x y z z u x y z where z c is the conditional stochastic realization z u is the unconditional stochastic realization generated using fft ma simulation method and z and z u the ordinary kriging based porosity estimates based on the log and unconditional simulation values at the borehole locations respectively to obtain the inverted conditional stochastic realizations in our previous 2d stochastic inversion method we start with a large number of cells to perturb and decrease this number regularly up to a small number of cell according to a decreasing schedule inspired from temperature cooling schedule here we exploit this strategy in our sa optimization procedure wherein 3d conditional stochastic realizations are perturbed by re simulating a certain percentage of elements in the gaussian white noise vector the number of re simulated points and their location in the model grid govern the magnitude and the local versus global nature of the corresponding model perturbation 2 3 improved sa optimization 2 3 1 forward model and objective function in this study the primary reflectivity section prs model e g gibson and levander 1990 holliger et al 1994 irving et al 2009 is used for obtaining the synthetic reflected gpr data corresponding to a conditional stochastic porosity realization specially an amplitude corrected and time migration data d x t can be expressed as the convolution of a source wavelet function w t with the underlying subsurface reflectivity distribution r x t 5 d x t w t r x t where t is the vertical two way travel time and denotes convolution operator when single scattering prevails and dispersion is absent from the data eq 5 is widely accepted as an adequate model for zero offset seismic or gpr reflection data e g yilmaz 2001 although the second assumption is only strictly valid for gpr data collected at those perfectly electrically resistive areas previous research has shown that this model is qualified for accommodating the limited dispersion effects related to low loss environments for which the gpr approach has been conceived e g irving et al 2009 xu et al 2020b xu et al 2021 in eq 5 reflection coefficients is regarded as a function of two way travel time they can be obtained from the conditional stochastic porosity realization by first transforming it to dielectric permittivity or gpr velocity it thus can be calculated in water saturated porous media through using the following mixture model e g schön 1998 6 ε r ε r s 1 ϕ ε r w ϕ where ε r is the relative dielectric permittivity ϕ is the porosity and ε r s and ε r w are the relative dielectric permittivities of the dry solid matrix and water respectively for which we assume values of 4 6 and 80 e g chan and knight 2001 for low loss media amenable to gpr wave propagation the electromagnetic wave velocity v and relative dielectric permittivity can be related using following relationship e g annan 2005 7 v c ε r where c 3 10 8 m s is the speed of light in free space this equation is used to transform depth into two way vertical travel time vertical incidence reflection coefficients in the traveltime domain are then obtained using 8 r ε r 1 ε r 2 ε r 1 ε r 2 where indices 1 and 2 refer to the materials above and below an interface respectively eq 8 is applied iteratively to each column of the subsurface dielectric permittivity model to yield r x t note that the gpr source wavelet w t which is needed for calculation of the synthetic gpr data is estimated from field gpr reflection data by employing the constant phase method cui and margrave 2014 to obtain conditional stochastic realizations of subsurface porosity whose corresponding synthetic gpr reflection data offer a good fit to the field gpr reflection data we follow previous work e g lauzon and marcotte 2019 xu et al 2020b xu et al 2021 and use an improved sa approach to iteratively perform the optimization we minimize the following objective function 9 φ 1 2 i 1 i j 1 j l 1 l d syn x i y j t l d obs x i y j t l 2 λ m 1 m k 1 k z ptdx m ptdy m z k z u ptdx m ptdy m z k 2 where d syn and d obs denote the synthetic and field reflection gpr data respectively and i j and l represent the number of points along the x y and traveltime directions in the data respectively z ptdx m ptdy m z and z u ptdx m ptdy m z denote the measured and unconditional simulated property values at borehole locations respectively while m represents the number of conditioned boreholes and k represents number of sample points in the depth direction λ is a trade off parameter that controls the desired balance between fitting the data and honoring the prescribed prior log information about the measured property values at borehole locations 2 3 2 sa optimization strategy in our implementation of sa optimization procedure we start with an initial conditional porosity realization using a fully random vector of fft ma uncorrelated gaussian white noise elements with an initial temperature t 0 in order to realize the temperature cooling schedule in sa in subsequent iterations a new conditional stochastic realization is created by re simulating a randomly chosen subset of elements in the gaussian white noise vector with the decrease of temperature after a few tests the schedule chosen for temperature and number of cells to perturb simultaneously are defined by a constant multiplicative reduction factor computed at each iteration 10 n iter n 0 γ iter 11 t iter t 0 α iter where iter denotes the sa iteration number n 0 is the total number of cell perturbed constant γ is the decrease rate of cell perturbation as the iterations proceed and constant α is the temperature reduction factor basically exploration of the model space is encouraged in the beginning of the sa algorithm whereas exploitation is encouraged towards the end note that the value of n iter in eq 10 is set to no less than 50 which means that a constant small number of vector elements re simulated in later period for the field example presented in the next section γ was set to an empirically determined value of 0 97 according to the arguments presented in johnson et al 1991 t 0 was set to a value of 2 104 and the parameter α was set equal to 0 95 in this study after the objective function for the perturbed porosity realization using eq 9 is evaluated the realization is either accepted or rejected based on the following probability of acceptance 12 p iter acc 1 if φ new φ cur exp φ new φ cur t iter o t h e r w i s e a typical sa algorithm usually contains two loops an outer one and an inner one in the outer loop t iter dwindles every time and the outer loop terminates when the optimization reaches a certain kind of stopping criterion in the inner loop the gaussian white noise vector is perturbed and the objective function of the new conditional stochastic realization based on the perturbed gaussian white noise vector is evaluated for simplicity sa iterations are continued in our inversion algorithm until a prescribed maximum number of iterations is reached for the field gpr data we found that it yield an acceptable fit to the observed gpr traces given the prescribed errors in the data when the maximum number of iterations and the number of iterations of the inner loop are set to 320 and 400 respectively 2 3 3 optimization by local perturbation normally choosing the perturbed cells in the sa optimization process can not only be conducted over the entire model space but also be concentrated in a particular subarea to leave unchanged areas already well calibrated e g yang et al 2017 lauzon et al 2019 our experiments suggest that the choice of the perturbed cells in a particular subarea is more time saving while it may lead to relative larger objective function values in addition the objective function value has a negative relationship with the number of subareas in a certain range this means that we can find a desired balance between fitting the data and determining the number of the subareas it should be noted that the aforementioned choosing perturbed cells is conducted in the model space while calculating the residual sum of squares is conducted in the traveltime domain thus there is not a one to one correspondence between perturbation of a cell and calculation of the objective function value at certain location for simplicity dividing subareas in this study is mainly limited in the two horizontal directions in view of the time cost and the horizontal correlation lengths the total model space is evenly divided into 3 parts and 2 parts along and y directions respectively then the next issue to be concerned is how to ascertain the exact subarea to perturb the cells to this end we can calculate the residual sum of squares between the observed gpr data and the synthetic data for each subarea and always perturb the cells within the subarea which has the largest residual value the inversion tests show that our strategy of optimization by local perturbation can save 70 of the computation time but lead to a slight incresement regarding objective function values when comparing with the strategy of optimization by entire perturbation 2 4 parallelization multi core central processing units cpus and graphics processing units gpus have been exploited to improve the calculation efficiency of 3d geostatistical modeling e g tahmasebi et al 2012 räss et al 2019 and geophysical inversion e g čuma and zhdanov 2014 yang and zhu 2017 fang et al 2020 in this study we need to generate 100 inverted conditional stochastic porosity realizations for analysis so that the parallelization strategy aimed at our stochastic inversion approach should be suitable for not only a single inverted conditional stochastic realization but also multiple ones to improve the calculation efficiency of a single invert realization we exploit the compute unified device architecture cuda sanders and kandrot 2010 which makes our 3d inversion algorithm possible to benefit from the ability of gpu in parallel computing with general purpose computation because the 3d inversion algorithm is written in matlab the fast fourier transform fft algorithm is one of the most computationally intensive and commonly used functions in the 3d inversion algorithm thus it can be implemented on an nvidia gpu and will be much faster than using the cpu based fft algorithm additionally calculation of synthetic gpr data using the convolution model squared residual computation and all the node based or trace based calculations can be executed in parallel as the solution for each node or trace is independent of any other several experiments indicate that use of the mentioned strategies related to gpu can dramatically reduce the computation time normally we can use the for loop to execute the above gpu based inversion algorithm to obtain 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations successively the inversion is a computationally intensive and time consuming task as it adopt a regular serial execution actually the 100 realizations are independent from each other which means no communication between the 100 realizations during the inversion in this case the for loop type inversion algorithm thus can be made into a parfor loop type algorithm which is able to assign the inversion task on multi gpus for example the server we used is a high performance server implemented with 4 nodes each of which has 4 available gpu cards nvidia tesla v100 we can replace for loop in former matlab code by parfor loop in order to deploy 4 gpus on a single node and it yields an approximate speedup factor of 4 further we can use the portable batch system pbs to exploit 4 nodes to run the parfor loop inversion algorithm simultaneously on the gpu server which can fulfill another 4 times of acceleration our related inversion results indicate that the use of the two parallelization strategies reduces the computation time by a factor of 16 overall the acceleration factor provided by the multi gpus multi node parallelization of the 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm is closely related to computing power of the gpu computing facilities such as the number of gpus and that of the server nodes 3 results 3 1 database to characterize the detailed porosity distribution of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer we now apply our 3d inversion approach to the common offset gpr data collected at the bhrs fig 2 near boise idaho usa the bhrs is originally designed to support a variety of geophysical hydrological tests to thoroughly characterize the 2d 3d distribution of hydrological parameters in heterogeneous alluvial barrash and knoll 1998 as shown in fig 2 the well designed experimental site contains a set of 13 boreholes white points in a central area and the central borehole a1 surrounded by two rings of six boreholes each b1 b6 and c1 c6 respectively the key information regarding the hydrogeological structure at the bhrs has been obtained from neutron porosity log data that were collected at 0 06 m depth intervals in this study the measured porosity logs at seven boreholes yellow circle located in the center a1 and the outside c1 c6 concentric rings were used for conditioning the 3d stochastic inversion procedure whereas the measured porosity logs at the two boreholes b2 and b5 yellow circle were selected for validation fig 3 shows the neutron neutron porosity logs used in this study barrash and clemo 2002 bradford et al 2009 the depth of the groundwater table at the site varies seasonally between 2 m and 4 m the underlying braided river type aquifer consists of late quaternary fluvial deposits dominated by coarse cobbles and sand these are followed by a layer of red clay which is situated at 20 m depth e g barrash and clemo 2002 the 3d gpr survey at the bhrs was performed in the summer of 1998 using a pulseekko pro 100 system sensors software inc with a nominal antenna center frequency of 100 mhz the data were collected in common offset mode using a transmitter receiver antenna spacing of 1 m and a time sampling interval of 0 8 ns the 3d gpr survey area had dimensions of 30 m in the in line x direction and 18 m in the cross line y direction fig 2 traces were recorded every 0 1 m along each survey line blue dotted line in fig 2 with a line spacing of 0 2 m to improve the signal to noise ratio 32 vertical stacks were performed for each recorded gpr trace 3 2 3d conditional stochastic inversion the considered 3d gpr reflection data were subjected to essentially the processing flow which included time zero and near offset corrections dewow filter smooth time varying gain based on the observed amplitude decay along each trace topography correction and 2d f k time migration using a constant velocity of 0 075 m ns the value of migration velocity was found to optimally focus diffraction events in the data below the water table and conforms to the average velocity of saturated sediments at the bhrs determined by bradford et al 2009 the processed gpr data cube along with the estimated source wavelet are shown in fig 4 given that the porosity measurements are only available below the groundwater table we limit our analysis to the saturated part of the probed subsurface region starting at 2 8 m depth to reduce the accumulative error of the inversion process which includes the transformation from porosity to velocity based on the crim equation we chose the velocity as the basic inversion parameter the first step in our 3d inversion process is conducting geostatistical analysis of the velocity which led to an estimated mean and standard deviation of 0 081 m ns and 0 008 m ns respectively a hurst number of ν 0 35 and a vertical correlation length of a z 0 75 m for the horizontal correlation lengths along the x and y direction the lateral correlation length values of a x 4 5 m and a y 9 m can be speculated based on the stochastic analysis of 3d gpr data from the bhrs of xu et al 2020a in which suggests that the two corresponding horizontal to vertical aspect ratios of 6 and 12 are most likely all of these parameters were used to generate conditional stochastic porosity realizations that were then optimized to fit the gpr reflection data we then performed the inversion procedure for the 3d gpr data and finally obtained 100 qualified conditional stochastic velocity porosity models and all the corresponding residual sum of squares between the observed 3d gpr data and the synthetic data as well as the objective function values have reduced to 10 of their original values after 320 sa iterations fig 5 fig 6 shows two example conditional stochastic realizations obtained with our inversion procedure along with the mean and standard deviation of an ensemble of 100 such realizations as observed in the figure the inverted stochastic realizations fig 6a and b are consistent with each other as well as with the ensemble mean fig 6c which is smooth and recovers the spatial porosity distribution except for small scale variability it is similar to the result of the deterministic inversion in some degree but their small scale heterogeneities exhibit different characteristics the standard deviation of the 100 output realizations fig 6d can show the uncertainty of inversion results regarding each node of the porosity model it can be observed that the vicinities of the locations of validated boreholes have the lowest standard deviation which means that our result is rather stable and plausible at other areas such as the northeast potion of the survey area x 20 m the uncertainty is relatively larger as there exists no conditional wells and the corresponding results are relatively untrustworthy to assess the quality of the reconstructed 3d gpr reflection data we select three 2d cross line sections y 1 2 9 and 16 m from the synthetic and observed 3d gpr data fig 7 apparently the 2d synthetic sections show laminations similar to those corresponding observed data in other words the major characteristics of the observed data can be well recovered however the synthetic amplitudes are distributed across a much narrower range than those observed ones due to utilization of the impedance inversion approach to test the actual accelerating efficiency we run several inversion tests with the parameters and high performance server as previously described the first inversion test is for the generation of a single inverted realization by using the 3d inversion algorithm directly modified from the previous 2d inversion algorithm xu et al 2021 and it takes 36 7 h to finish the inversion process our second inversion test is still to obtain a single inverted realization but using the 3d inversion algorithm with the utilization of gpu and cuda parallel programing it costs 30 s for one sa iteration and 2 7 h for the whole inversion process which results in a speed up factor of 13 6 when compared with the regular 3d conditional inversion algorithm the final inversion test is to obtain 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations using the multi gpus multi node parallelization of 3d inversion algorithm deploying 4 nodes and 4 gpus simultaneously overall it costs nearly 20 h to obtain 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations while it costs at least 270 h for the same purpose using the serial based 3d inversion algorithm therefore our inversion tests regarding the efficiency of the 3d inversion algorithm show that utilization of the aforementioned parallelization strategies in the 3d inversion algorithm can significantly speed up the process of generating a single inverted realization as well as 100 inverted realizations 3 3 validation of results in fig 8 we show the validation results at the location of borehole b2 before our conditional stochastic inversion the unconditional simulated porosity curves show large uncertainties and fail to recover the trend of true porosities fig 8a their corresponding gpr traces also suggest significant differences to the observed gpr data fig 8b after the inversion we see in fig 8c that the gpr derived and observed porosity curves are overall in good agreement not only in terms of the trend but also with regard to the absolute values there is a small misfit at the depth of 3 m which should be related to the patchy waveform at the top of observed gpr trace shown in fig 8d generally our method allows for a substantial reduction of uncertainty in porosity compared to the assumed prior distribution and allows us to adequately reproduce most parts of the porosity curve then we show in fig 9 the corresponding validation results at the location of validation borehole b5 similar to the results at borehole b2 the proposed inversion approach provides a relatively good fit to the observed gpr data and also allows for a substantial reduction of uncertainty in the porosity compared to the assumed prior distribution specially the inverted porosities approximate a running trend of neutron probe porosities but fail to match pretty well with upper 2 3 of the porosity profile also fig 9c shows that the lower part of this profile is similarly characterized by an unusually low standard deviation compared to the upper part we assume that the low deviation in the lower part of the 3d sections might be relate to the corresponding lower amplitude since the 3d inversion algorithm obtains the invert realizations based on decreasing the residual sum of squares which means that the areas with lower amplitude will be much easier to reach the so called corresponding optimal values to quantitatively assess the correspondence between the inverted and measured porosity values at the location of validation boreholes we compute the correlation coefficient r which can be expressed as the following form e g illman et al 2015 13 r 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ χ i μ χ 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 where n is the total number of porosity data to be computed i indicates the data number χ i and χ i represent the estimates from the inverted and measured porosity values at the well locations respectively and μ χ and μ χ are corresponding means of the inverted and measured porosity values respectively note that by mixing the boreholes b2 and b5 as a whole we further also compute the composite r values for quantitatively analysis fig 10 shows the results of the corresponding r values with regard to 100 initial and inverted conditional stochastic realizations in fig 10a we can find that r values blue line of inverted porosity at the location of borehole b2 are generally higher than those gray line of the initial porosity at the same location and it significantly provides a smaller standard deviation we would find this phenomenon to be even more pronounced in the fig 10c which corresponds the results of borehole b5 the difference between fig 10a and c again shows the strong subsurface heterogeneity at the bhrs site as observed from fig 10f we can find that most of the r values red line of the inverted porosity values at the location of the two boreholes are quite high r 0 8 and the inverted results blue line have been obviously improved on the basis of the corresponding initial results gray line to further test the reliability of the inversion results the inverted porosity values at the location of the two boreholes are compared with their corresponding measured values and the crossplots of inverted and measure porosity are shown in fig 10b d and f respectively as observed from these three subfigs the inverted porosity values generally fit well to the measured values except for some high or low prediction errors overall the 3d inversion method provides relatively acceptable and reasonable inversion results at the bhrs site 3 4 3d characterization of sand channel the stratigraphy at the bhrs is characterized with five distinct units based on stratigraphic position in the sediment column and differentiation by porosity lithology and gpr reflection data e g barrash and clemo 2002 barrash and reboulet 2004 clement et al 2006 note that since the penetration depth limit of the field gpr data is about 9 m unit 1 and unit 2 which mainly lie bellow 9 m depth are thus not shown in fig 11 a and 11b unit 5 the topmost and youngest unit is a coarse grained high porosity ϕ 0 4 sand channel that eroded into unit 4 fig 11a the sand channel is inferred to trend northwesterly across the well field and is roughly parallel to the boise river e g barrash and clemo 2002 bradford et al 2009 however the 2d lateral even 3d spatial continuity of the sand channel with a high degree of certainty from the borehole data alone cannot be established due to subtle differences between nearby logs and core samples therefore clement et al 2006 uses surface based gpr reflection data that has been calibrated at boreholes locations c4 b2 and b4 to map the sand channel at the bhrs and finds that channel thickens toward the boise river to the southwest and pinches out between boreholes b4 and b2 two porosity sections fig 11c and d extracted from the mean of 100 inverted conditional stochastic porosity realizations are shown in approximate cross river boreholes c5 a1 c2 and c4 a1 c1 orientations the high porosity wedge i e unit 5 with mean porosity of 0 425 and standard deviation of 0 02 thickens toward the southwest and pinches out near borehole a1 which conforms to the previous interpretation results e g bradford et al 2009 barrash and clemo 2002 our results also show the characteristics of spatial distribution of the sand channel along different directions in a high resolution manner furthermore it is important to point out that the laterally and vertically consistent transition to significantly lower porosities beyond 6 6 8 m depth predicted by our inversion results fig 11c and d is consistent with barrash and clemo s 2002 interpretation of a transition from a cobble dominated section unit 4 mean porosity of 0 22 standard deviation of 0 05 to a relatively low porosity sediments unit 3 mean porosity of 0 17 standard deviation of 0 02 these in turn indicate that while the 3d conditional stochastic inversion method is unable to account for local statistical non stationarity such as the unusually high porosity in the upper part of profile between 6 2 m and 7 4 m depth in fig 8c therefore it is quite robust with regard to laterally and vertically consistent changes in the stochastic porosity properties to obtain the 3d spatial distribution of the sand channel we use the function isosurface in matlab to plot the 3d isosurface with equal values ϕ 0 4 in the mean of 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations in fig 12 the 4 different perspective views of the sand channel unit 5 based on our inversion results illustrate directly and visually the characteristics of spatial distribution of the sand channel in 3d space the sand channel is depicted in a 3d wedge shaped object and dips toward from the center portion x 14 5 m to the southwest portion of the survey area fig 12a 12d its top is mainly located at the depth of 2 9 m while its bottom has a depth range of 3 2 m to 4 1 m the horizontal distribution of sand channel is uneven indicating a preferred distribution along our results is highly consistent with the 3d interpretation of sand channel of bradford et al 2009 and dafflon and barrash 2012 in which they use surface based gpr reflection tomography and high resolution 3d conditional simulations to map the 3d porosity distribution at the bhrs respectively however the spatial resolution of their results maybe not adequate for a deterministic and detailed numerical porosity model as they do not take the strong porosity heterogeneity at the site into consideration our 3d inversion method which integrates the 3d geostastical information gpr reflection and borehole data shows a huge advantage in recovering the spatial distribution of the sand channel at the bhrs when comparing with previous 2d 3d methods 4 discussion the main objective of this study was to implement and validate a 3d conditional stochastic inversion methodology for estimating the porosity distribution of an alluvial aquifer from surface based 3d gpr reflection data to this end we have presented a novel 3d gpu accelerated conditional stochastic inversion method for surface based common offset gpr reflection data 3d stochastic realizations of subsurface properties generated by the fft ma simulation method that offer an acceptable fit to gpr reflection data are generated via sa optimization the realizations are conditioned to borehole porosity measurements available within the 3d gpr survey area as well as to geostatistical parameters derived from the borehole logs and the processed gpr data the inverted porosity logs at the location of validation boreholes are largely verified by the measured values except for some local mismatches figs 8 10 and the reconstructed gpr reflection data based on the 100 inverted conditional stochastic porosity realizations are highly fit to the observed gpr reflection data fig 7 these results clearly show the validity of our proposed 3d inversion method moreover the 3d inversion method is able to generate numerous equally well inverted conditional stochastic realizations which reveal the trend of the subsurface porosity field in a highly heterogeneous 3d regional alluvial aquifer the numerous realizations can be used to assess the uncertainty about the porosity field at the bhrs and help us to obtain the porosity heterogeneity note that the reflection profiles used in this study were acquired using 100 mhz antennas which results in an inherent vertical resolution of 0 2 m e g annan 2005 the 3d inversion method is derived from the classical impedance inversion algorithm which could eliminate the effect of wavelet and improve the vertical resolution of the reflection profiles meanwhile the 3d inversion method uses the fft ma simulation algorithm and borehole measured porosity data to generate inverted conditional stochastic realizations and the measured borehole porosity data has an even higher vertical resolution 0 06 m therefore the 3d inversion method could provide images of shallow subsurface structure with a much higher vertical resolution when compared with the ht methods it is also worth mentioning that the lateral resolution of the 3d inversion method is also impressive due to the abundant gpr reflection data collected from the dense survey grid and the horizontal geostatistical constraint used for simulation this study demonstrates the ability of the 3d inversion method to give high quality estimates of porosity distribution in the upper part of the saturated zone over a wide range of conditions characterized by highly variable water content dynamics once the sa parameters are determined the computational time of our 3d inversion method is dominated by calculation of fft calculation of convolution and the number of inverted conditional stochastic realizations in our 3d inversion method the use of gpu with cuda parallel programing have significantly increased the efficiency of generation of single invert realization and the use of parallel computing toolbox and pbs system have further accelerated the process to obtain numerous inverted conditional stochastic realizations it is important to point out that acceleration speed resulting from the latter strategy depends on the number of gpus and gpu nodes as the 3d inversion method is able to reconstruct and visualize the 3d porosity distribution i e water content of alluvial aquifers in an orderly and efficient manner it can be easily applied to the long term gpr 4d monitoring of the evolution of alluvial aquifers the current application of the inversion methodology only considers full water saturation however generalization to partial water saturation is conceptually straightforward the gpu accelerated 3d conditional stochastic inversion method has greatly improved its practicability and can be also adapted for other geophysical hydrogeophysical surveys such as detection of non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminants or soil moisture mapping arguably the most important criterion for our inversion method is whether a convolution model can be used to describe the reflection data in section 2 3 we emphasize that our method relies on two important assumptions i e the recorded gpr wavefield is largely non dispersive and is dominated by single scattering the practical validity of the assumption of negligible dispersion is notably underscored by the success of numerous studies which rely upon an adequate estimation of the gpr source wavelet e g schmelzbach et al 2012 zeng et al 2015 liu et al 2018 2022 xu et al 2021 with regard to the multiple scattering effect the available empirical evidence suggests that it is also largely negligible in common offset gpr data collected in alluvial aquifer environments e g irving et al 2009 schmelzbach et al 2012 xu et al 2020b xu et al 2021 the latter is consistent with a previous study involving acoustic waves in strongly heterogeneous environments where it was found that multiple scattering only becomes important for strong local velocity fluctuations corresponding to standard deviations of the order of 10 or more in combination with long propagation paths in excess of 20 dominant wavelengths e g holliger 1997 these conditions are generally not fulfilled for surface based common offset gpr reflection data generally the parameters that might affect the accuracy of the 3d inversion method mainly include the quality of observed data borehole porosity and gpr reflection data borehole setting e g the number location estimated stochastic parameters and regularization parameter in the 3d inversion method the geophysical data is the basic source data to estimate wavelet and stochastic parameters and it also plays a very important role in the inversion process therefore the high quality observed data can lead to more accurate inversion results to investigate sensitivity of the borehole setting we thus design several inversion tests which used different numbers 7 9 11 of conditional boreholes for the inversion of bhrs data the inversion results indicate that using more conditional boreholes for inversion could improve the accuracy of inverted porosity to some extent at the cost of a relatively poor fitting to the gpr data as well as more inversion time moreover the 3d inversion method could perform much better in characterizing the subsurface heterogeity when conditional boreholes are evenly distributed in the survey grid the regularization parameter λ controls the trade off between fitting to observed gpr data and borehole porosity constraints in the inversion process another effect of λ is to promote the unconditional simulated porosity values at conditional borehole locations to be close to the measured values which could also recover the subsurface heterogeneity at some degree generally the inversion results might be unsatisfactory if we use improper values for regularization parameter λ in this study finally accurate estimation of stochastic parameters will lead to a more accurate description of the subsurface porosity distribution especially when it is clearly highly variable because the estimated stochastic parameters control the stochastic characteristics and smoothness of conditional stochastic realizations the manifestations of the local mismatch between the borehole porosity and inverted porosity at the location of validation boreholes figs 8 and 9 are either high and low prediction errors at different depths specifically the regions with low prediction errors regarding the porosity for borehole b5 is between 2 8 and 4 05 m depth and for borehole b2 is between 6 54 and 7 78 m depth meanwhile the regions with high prediction errors for the two boreholes at the middle depths b2 between 6 54 and 7 78 m depth b5 between 4 05 and 7 2 m depth careful analysis of the mismatch shows that the regions with low prediction errors always occur at the relatively high porosity regions and vice versa to our knowledge the mismatch might be related to 1 local variations in amplitude decay of the 3d observed gpr data that have not been adequately compensated 2 local violations of the inherent assumption of statistical stationarity to investigate the possibility of inadequate compensation we reprocessed the 3d gpr data presented in fig 4 using several alternative gain functions while in some cases this helped to raise the amplitudes in the lower part of the gpr data cube it did not allow us to remove the small mismatches in the inferred porosity distribution therefore the mismatch was more probably attributed to the local violations of the inherent assumption of statistical stationarity in this work the velocity of the shallow part of bhrs based on the geostatistical analysis of borehole velocity is assumed to be a normal distribution with a mean of 0 081 m ns corresponds to the porosity of 0 022 however the borehole porosity logs collected at the bhrs deviate from a normal distribution by having both a high porosity tail and also a low amplitude high porosity mode barrash and clemo 2002 normally the kriging based methods produce the best accuracy across different resolutions however there are cases where kriging methods do not perform well e g guo et al 2010 such as terrain with faults or spatial outliers with extremely high or low values the latter of which is quite consistent with the case in this study this again demonstrates that the actual porosity distribution at the bhrs should be more complex than the statistical stationarity condition that we assumed in our future work one important direction is to improve the inversion accuracy by adopting the hierarchical modeling strategy rather than the current holistic strategy 5 conclusions we have presented in this paper a novel gpu accelerated 3d conditional stochastic inversion method for surface based common offset gpr reflection data which can be for recovering the heterogeneity of 3d porosity distribution at fine scale in alluvial aquifers to speed up the 3d inversion we have designed and implemented a fast multi nodes multi gpu based 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm compared to the single gpu implemented inversion algorithm our gpu accelerated inversion algorithm can significantly speed up the computation and the related acceleration factor is closely related to computing power of the gpu computing facilities such as the number of gpus and that of the server nodes the application to bhrs field data show the viability of our method to characterize the heterogeneity in an alluvial aquifer the high porosity sand channel at the bhrs is successfully visualized based on our 3d inverted porosity model the results indicate that the proposed 3d inversion method has the potential to effectively recover the fine scale porosity distribution of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer declaration

2534,three dimensional 3d high resolution and accurate characterization of the heterogeneity in an alluvial aquifer is critical to predicting the groundwater flow and contaminant transport in this study we extend the previous 2d conditional stochastic inversion method with respect to common offset ground penetrating radar gpr data to 3d for the estimation of 3d porosity distribution in a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer first 3d stochastic realizations of subsurface properties can be obtained using the fast fourier transform moving average fft ma method and the realizations are conditioned to borehole porosity measurements available in the 3d survey area as well as to the geostatistical parameters derived from the borehole logs and the processed 3d gpr data next the realizations are constantly modified and regenerated via a localized simulated annealing optimization strategy which ultimately makes their corresponding synthetic data offer an acceptable fit to the gpr data to accelerate the computational speed of 3d inversion we design and implement the multi gpus multi node parallelization of the 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm the proposed 3d inversion algorithm is positively verified through the application to field gpr data collected at the boise hydrogeophysical research site near boise idaho usa our results indicate that the proposed 3d inversion method has the potential to effectively recover the fine scale porosity distribution of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer keywords alluvial aquifer porosity distribution gpu 3d conditional stochastic inversion ground penetrating radar gpr fft ma data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of alluvial aquifers as a vital objective of many hydrogeological studies is of great importance to predict the subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant transport e g hu et al 2009 cardiff et al 2013 maliva 2016 vogelgesang et al 2020 however this goal is challenging because heterogeneity of hydraulic properties such as the permeability k and porosity distribution ϕ are intrinsic to aquifers worldwide e g rubin 2003 wu et al 2005 in this case traditional methods include kriging and stochastic simulation that utilize small scale measurements of cores slug and single hole tests and they can only characterize subsurface heterogeneity in a poor lateral resolution due to large spatial sampling intervals to this end a variety of methods including hydrogeological pressure based tracer based and geophysical methods have been suggested to help map this subsurface heterogeneity during the past two decades hydraulic tomography ht e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 has been developed as an effective hydrogeological technology to investigate the heterogeneous distributions of aquifer parameters they include synthetic experiments e g zhu and yeh 2005 liu and kitanidis 2011 mao et al 2013 laboratory sandbox experiments e g liu et al 2002 2007 illman et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 and field study e g berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2012 cardiff et al 2013 cardiff et al 2020 zhao and illman 2018 to interpret multiple pumping and observation data from ht tests yeh and liu 2000 propose the sequential successive linear estimator ssle based on the work of yeh et al 1996 for 3d steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis this method could jointly invert multiple pumping tests to map the k field and corresponding uncertainties then zhu and yeh 2005 extend the ssle analysis for transient ht analysis and gain well application effect in characterizing aquifer heterogeneity since then geostatistics based inverse methods have been widely used for synthetic and field ht data interpretation by several research groups e g liu et al 2007 castagna and bellin 2009 berg and illman 2011 cardiff and barrash 2011 cardiff et al 2012 2013 2020 lee and kitanidis 2014 hochstetler et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 for the majority of the above mentioned methods geostatistics based ht yields smoothed hydraulic parameter distributions when ht monitoring data are sparse e g yeh and liu 2000 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2017 this issue can be effectively alleviated by using as much data as possible however this also means a relatively higher time and financial costs for data collection as well as a potential higher computational demand as it is possible to collect more data for inverse analysis another way to improve this issue is to incorporate the perfect geological model in the ht inversion process e g schöniger et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 zhou et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 unfortunately it is rather difficult to obtain perfect knowledge of stratigraphy for the actual aquifers with current technology a range of geophysical measurements such as the ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity tomography ert and time domain electromagnetics tem methods have been widely used to map and characterize the aquifer heterogeneity with unprecedented resolution and coverage in the last several decades detail of such methods can be found in many literatures e g slater 2007 binley et al 2015 and references therein among these methods a particularly promising method with regard to the detailed characterization of alluvial aquifers is surface based ground penetrating radar gpr reflection profiling e g annan 2005 blindow 2006 and references therein the gpr reflection data can illustrate the structure of the probed subsurface region with high resolution but they do not readily provide detailed information on the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties since the high frequency electromagnetic wave propagation phenomena are largely governed by the dielectric permittivity which is highly sensitive to soil water content and thus to soil texture porosity above and below the water table respectively e g knight 2001 it is possible to estimate the porosity distribution of an alluvial aquifer by applying advanced processing or inversion techniques to gpr reflection data to this end a variety of approaches have been developed the vast majority of them rely upon the acquisition of multi offset data where multiple receiver antenna positions are considered for each transmitter antenna position in an analogous manner to seismic reflection survey the corresponding measurements can then be examined using a variety of techniques which include quantification of reflector moveout and reflection tomographic approaches e g greaves et al 1996 bradford et al 2009 mangel et al 2020 amplitude versus offset avo analysis e g bradford and deeds 2006 deparis and garambois 2009 and most recently waveform inversion e g lavoué et al 2014 babcock and bradford 2015 huai et al 2019 however one important drawback is that the acquisition of multi offset gpr data is time consuming and logistically cumbersome indeed such surveys become largely impractical in the context of long 2d profiles and particularly 3d acquisitions in practice most surface based gpr reflection surveys are performed using the common offset approach where a single transmitter receiver antenna pair separated by a small and fixed distance is incrementally moved along the survey line though the estimation of the subsurface property distribution from such data is substantially more difficult than for multi offset gpr surveys significant efforts have been made during the past decade because of the high potential rewards a common way to obtain the velocity information is the analysis of diffraction hyperbolas in common offset gpr data e g mount et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 liu et al 2022 but the results are strongly limited in terms of spatial resolution and the method inherently requires a high density of diffractions throughout the gpr profile to be reliable if suitable borehole measurements such as neutron neutron porosity logging are available for calibration along the gpr profile one promising alternative for the recovery of detailed dielectric property information from common offset gpr reflection data is impedance inversion in this regard schmelzbach et al 2012 present a workflow to recover the spatial structure of electromagnetic impedance which is closely related to soil dielectric permittivity and water content from gpr reflection data their approach involves sparse spike deconvolution of an amplitude corrected and migrated gpr image followed by band limited integration and scaling whereby the low frequency component of the impedance variability which is not possible to recover from the noisy gpr data alone is derived from borehole logs acquired along the profile zeng et al 2015 and liu et al 2018 use similar approaches to recover water content from common offset gpr profiles in complex environments and to characterize buried archaeological remains respectively xu et al 2021 propose a novel 2d conditional stochastic inversion method for surface based common offset gpr reflection data and show that the inversion approach could reliably recovering strongly 2d heterogeneous porosity structures of alluvial aquifers they assume a convolution model for the gpr traces but combine stochastic simulation with simulated annealing optimization in order to generate porosity realizations that honor the gpr measurements and borehole porosity log data along the profile although all of the aforementioned methods have the ability to estimate subsurface porosity from common offset gpr measurements they show its inherent limitations to describe the actual subsurface structure as the real world is 3d space to our knowledge the application of electromagnetic impedance inversion considering the 3d correlation structure of subsurface is still an open issue because it can be computationally highly expensive and extremely time consuming for a realistic hydrological model in this paper we propose a gpu accelerated scheme for extending the 2d stochastic type inversion method to 3d field work similar to the 2d case we consider the impedance based 3d conditional stochastic inversion of common offset gpr reflection data whereby we seek to match observed radargrams to spatial distributions of subsurface properties that honor a priori pertinent in situ information derived from borehole type measurements as well as prescribed geostatistical constraints this is done via 3d conditional geostatistical simulation within a stochastic optimization procedure the repeated application of which allows for the generation of multiple inverted conditional stochastic realizations in order to explore and quantify uncertainty xu et al 2021 to overcome the high computational cost the fast multi nodes multi gpus based 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm is further designed and implemented for the gpu server by using the cuda paralleled programing and the portable batch system pbs we demonstrate the viability of our method by considering a pertinent case study involving the use of 100 mhz gpr antenna centre frequencies at a well characterized hydrogeophysical test site the paper is thus structured as follows first we present the methodological foundations of our proposed 3d inversion approach then we apply the proposed method to 3d gpr field data acquired using 100 mhz antennas at the boise hydrogeophysical research site bhrs idaho usa compared with two extra borehole logs the inversion results are evaluated and validated we complete the paper with discussions and conclusions 2 methodology the proposed 3d conditional stochastic inversion method aims to generate 3d conditional stochastic subsurface property realizations which satisfy the gpr reflection and borehole data as well as the stochastic structure information the fft ma simulation method is used for generating the 3d conditional stochastic realization with the 3d stochastic structure information and boreholes logs of a certain property such as porosity gpr velocity etc and it is then further integrated into a simulated annealing sa optimization process in order to fit the recorded gpr reflection waveforms and borehole measurements the first premise to carry out the 3d conditional stochastic inversion method is that a certain number of boreholes with available borehole porosity logs or information closely related to another petrophysical property should be evenly distributed in the 3d gpr survey area regarding the second premise we assume full water saturation for simplicity and thus can link the gpr velocity and porosity via a suitable petrophysical transform relationship it should be pointed out that our inversion method still works with cases with partial water saturation as long as we know the corresponding petrophysical transform relationship a flowchart describing the general methodology of our 3d inversion procedure is schematically illustrated in fig 1 a set of 3d autocovariance parameters which can adequately capture the stochastic variability of subsurface porosity in the probed subsurface region are first estimated from the gpr data and borehole log data then a 3d stochastic porosity realization honoring these parameters and conditioned to the borehole or direct push porosity log measurements can be generated using the conditional fft ma simulated algorithm finally an improved sa optimization is applied to perturb the gaussian white noise vector to find a 3d porosity realization that honors the common offset gpr reflection data until the sa stopping criterion is satisfied to assess the uncertainty and examine the corresponding collection of realizations multiple inverted conditional realizations need to be generated and the parallelization strategy has been implemented to speed up the 3d inversion the above mentioned components are described in further detail in the following subsections 2 1 3d characterization of heterogeneous alluvial aquifer 2 1 1 von kármán autocorrelation in this study we assume that the subsurface porosity distribution ϕ x y z can be regarded as stochastic medium which is described as the sum of a smoothly varying or constant background porosity field ϕ 0 x y z and a small scale porosity fluctuation field δ ϕ x y z e g ikelle et al 1993 irving et al 2009 scholer et al 2010 jiang et al 2013 1 ϕ x y z ϕ 0 x y z δ ϕ x y z normally the small scale fluctuation field δ ϕ x y z is considered as a random process in space which can be characterized by different autocorrelation functions such as gaussian exponential and von kármán the stochastic medium models are widely used in geosciences to describe the subsurface heterogeneity e g goff and jordan 1988 ikelle et al 1993 savran and olsen 2016 here we consider the von kármán autocorrelation function which provides a fractal spatial description of a fabric over a wide scale range and is commonly used to characterize the statistical variation of alluvial aquifer e g tronicke and holliger 2005 dafflon et al 2009 in 3d case the von kármán autocorrelation equation is expressed as the following form e g goff and jordan 1988 2 r θ θ δ x δ y δ z r ν k ν r 2 ν 1 γ ν where r θ θ is the autocorrelation function δ x δ y and δ z are the spatial autocorrelation lags in the x y and z directions respectively k ν r is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order 0 ν 1 γ is the gamma function and 3 r δ x a x 2 δ y a y 2 δ z a z 2 is a normalized lag parameter with a x a y and a z denoting the spatial correlation lengths along x y and z respectively the hurst number ν in the expression for the von kármán autocorrelation equation determines the decay of the autocorrelation function at small lags i e the local variability of the associated heterogeneity values of ν close to 0 and 1 characterize locally highly complex and smooth fluctuations respectively in particular the von kármán autocorrelation function is identical to exponential autocorrelation function when ν 0 5 e g goff and jordan 1988 as mentioned above the 3d geostatistical porosity model can be parameterized by variables a x a y a z and ν which must be determined from available data following tronicke and holliger 2005 we can estimate parameters a z and ν as well as the porosity mean i e background porosity field and corresponding variance from the measured borehole porosity logs within the 3d gpr survey area xu et al 2020a relates the geostatistical properties of the 3d gpr backscattered wavefield to those of the underlying scattering medium and allows for inference of the structural aspect ratios a x a z and a y a z of the probed subsurface medium e g irving and holliger 2010 xu et al 2020a and it means that we can readily determine a x and a y once we know a z 2 1 2 fast fourier transform moving average fft ma to generate the stochastic medium models i e the unconditional stochastic realizations we adopt the fast fourier transform moving average fft ma method leravalec et al 2000 which is the simple and convenient implementation of the moving average ma method of oliver 1995 in the discrete wavenumber domain any permissible autocovariance model such as the von kármán autocorrelation function can be simulated exactly on the model grid the method clearly separates the random component from the deterministic component thus modifications can be brought to one or many random numbers within the model grid to create new realizations without altering the simulated autocovariance while this kind of modification cannot be achieved by using the standard power spectral simulation techniques e g ikelle 1993 the strength of its flexibility and fast calculation has led to the common application of fft ma for stochastic modeling and inversion e g le ravalec and mouche 2012 liang et al 2016 yang and zhu 2017 lauzon and marcotte 2019 generally the unconditional porosity simulations that are generated using the fft ma are effectively parameterized by a gaussian white noise vector in the spatial domain whose individual elements correspond to each location in the model grid e g le ravalec et al 2000 re simulating the values in this noise vector will produce different unconditional stochastic realizations all of which honor the underlying von kármán geostatistical model however the porosity values at the borehole locations do not honor the corresponding measured values as a key procedure in the 3d stochastic inversion method the generated unconditional stochastic realizations should be constrained to the hard data here the hard data is the measured borehole porosity and the common offset gpr reflection data 2 2 conditional stochastic simulation to produce realizations conditioned to the borehole measurements the corresponding equation of conditional stochastic porosity realization can be expressed as follows e g chilès and delfiner 2012 nussbaumer et al 2019 4 z c x y z z x y z z u x y z z u x y z where z c is the conditional stochastic realization z u is the unconditional stochastic realization generated using fft ma simulation method and z and z u the ordinary kriging based porosity estimates based on the log and unconditional simulation values at the borehole locations respectively to obtain the inverted conditional stochastic realizations in our previous 2d stochastic inversion method we start with a large number of cells to perturb and decrease this number regularly up to a small number of cell according to a decreasing schedule inspired from temperature cooling schedule here we exploit this strategy in our sa optimization procedure wherein 3d conditional stochastic realizations are perturbed by re simulating a certain percentage of elements in the gaussian white noise vector the number of re simulated points and their location in the model grid govern the magnitude and the local versus global nature of the corresponding model perturbation 2 3 improved sa optimization 2 3 1 forward model and objective function in this study the primary reflectivity section prs model e g gibson and levander 1990 holliger et al 1994 irving et al 2009 is used for obtaining the synthetic reflected gpr data corresponding to a conditional stochastic porosity realization specially an amplitude corrected and time migration data d x t can be expressed as the convolution of a source wavelet function w t with the underlying subsurface reflectivity distribution r x t 5 d x t w t r x t where t is the vertical two way travel time and denotes convolution operator when single scattering prevails and dispersion is absent from the data eq 5 is widely accepted as an adequate model for zero offset seismic or gpr reflection data e g yilmaz 2001 although the second assumption is only strictly valid for gpr data collected at those perfectly electrically resistive areas previous research has shown that this model is qualified for accommodating the limited dispersion effects related to low loss environments for which the gpr approach has been conceived e g irving et al 2009 xu et al 2020b xu et al 2021 in eq 5 reflection coefficients is regarded as a function of two way travel time they can be obtained from the conditional stochastic porosity realization by first transforming it to dielectric permittivity or gpr velocity it thus can be calculated in water saturated porous media through using the following mixture model e g schön 1998 6 ε r ε r s 1 ϕ ε r w ϕ where ε r is the relative dielectric permittivity ϕ is the porosity and ε r s and ε r w are the relative dielectric permittivities of the dry solid matrix and water respectively for which we assume values of 4 6 and 80 e g chan and knight 2001 for low loss media amenable to gpr wave propagation the electromagnetic wave velocity v and relative dielectric permittivity can be related using following relationship e g annan 2005 7 v c ε r where c 3 10 8 m s is the speed of light in free space this equation is used to transform depth into two way vertical travel time vertical incidence reflection coefficients in the traveltime domain are then obtained using 8 r ε r 1 ε r 2 ε r 1 ε r 2 where indices 1 and 2 refer to the materials above and below an interface respectively eq 8 is applied iteratively to each column of the subsurface dielectric permittivity model to yield r x t note that the gpr source wavelet w t which is needed for calculation of the synthetic gpr data is estimated from field gpr reflection data by employing the constant phase method cui and margrave 2014 to obtain conditional stochastic realizations of subsurface porosity whose corresponding synthetic gpr reflection data offer a good fit to the field gpr reflection data we follow previous work e g lauzon and marcotte 2019 xu et al 2020b xu et al 2021 and use an improved sa approach to iteratively perform the optimization we minimize the following objective function 9 φ 1 2 i 1 i j 1 j l 1 l d syn x i y j t l d obs x i y j t l 2 λ m 1 m k 1 k z ptdx m ptdy m z k z u ptdx m ptdy m z k 2 where d syn and d obs denote the synthetic and field reflection gpr data respectively and i j and l represent the number of points along the x y and traveltime directions in the data respectively z ptdx m ptdy m z and z u ptdx m ptdy m z denote the measured and unconditional simulated property values at borehole locations respectively while m represents the number of conditioned boreholes and k represents number of sample points in the depth direction λ is a trade off parameter that controls the desired balance between fitting the data and honoring the prescribed prior log information about the measured property values at borehole locations 2 3 2 sa optimization strategy in our implementation of sa optimization procedure we start with an initial conditional porosity realization using a fully random vector of fft ma uncorrelated gaussian white noise elements with an initial temperature t 0 in order to realize the temperature cooling schedule in sa in subsequent iterations a new conditional stochastic realization is created by re simulating a randomly chosen subset of elements in the gaussian white noise vector with the decrease of temperature after a few tests the schedule chosen for temperature and number of cells to perturb simultaneously are defined by a constant multiplicative reduction factor computed at each iteration 10 n iter n 0 γ iter 11 t iter t 0 α iter where iter denotes the sa iteration number n 0 is the total number of cell perturbed constant γ is the decrease rate of cell perturbation as the iterations proceed and constant α is the temperature reduction factor basically exploration of the model space is encouraged in the beginning of the sa algorithm whereas exploitation is encouraged towards the end note that the value of n iter in eq 10 is set to no less than 50 which means that a constant small number of vector elements re simulated in later period for the field example presented in the next section γ was set to an empirically determined value of 0 97 according to the arguments presented in johnson et al 1991 t 0 was set to a value of 2 104 and the parameter α was set equal to 0 95 in this study after the objective function for the perturbed porosity realization using eq 9 is evaluated the realization is either accepted or rejected based on the following probability of acceptance 12 p iter acc 1 if φ new φ cur exp φ new φ cur t iter o t h e r w i s e a typical sa algorithm usually contains two loops an outer one and an inner one in the outer loop t iter dwindles every time and the outer loop terminates when the optimization reaches a certain kind of stopping criterion in the inner loop the gaussian white noise vector is perturbed and the objective function of the new conditional stochastic realization based on the perturbed gaussian white noise vector is evaluated for simplicity sa iterations are continued in our inversion algorithm until a prescribed maximum number of iterations is reached for the field gpr data we found that it yield an acceptable fit to the observed gpr traces given the prescribed errors in the data when the maximum number of iterations and the number of iterations of the inner loop are set to 320 and 400 respectively 2 3 3 optimization by local perturbation normally choosing the perturbed cells in the sa optimization process can not only be conducted over the entire model space but also be concentrated in a particular subarea to leave unchanged areas already well calibrated e g yang et al 2017 lauzon et al 2019 our experiments suggest that the choice of the perturbed cells in a particular subarea is more time saving while it may lead to relative larger objective function values in addition the objective function value has a negative relationship with the number of subareas in a certain range this means that we can find a desired balance between fitting the data and determining the number of the subareas it should be noted that the aforementioned choosing perturbed cells is conducted in the model space while calculating the residual sum of squares is conducted in the traveltime domain thus there is not a one to one correspondence between perturbation of a cell and calculation of the objective function value at certain location for simplicity dividing subareas in this study is mainly limited in the two horizontal directions in view of the time cost and the horizontal correlation lengths the total model space is evenly divided into 3 parts and 2 parts along and y directions respectively then the next issue to be concerned is how to ascertain the exact subarea to perturb the cells to this end we can calculate the residual sum of squares between the observed gpr data and the synthetic data for each subarea and always perturb the cells within the subarea which has the largest residual value the inversion tests show that our strategy of optimization by local perturbation can save 70 of the computation time but lead to a slight incresement regarding objective function values when comparing with the strategy of optimization by entire perturbation 2 4 parallelization multi core central processing units cpus and graphics processing units gpus have been exploited to improve the calculation efficiency of 3d geostatistical modeling e g tahmasebi et al 2012 räss et al 2019 and geophysical inversion e g čuma and zhdanov 2014 yang and zhu 2017 fang et al 2020 in this study we need to generate 100 inverted conditional stochastic porosity realizations for analysis so that the parallelization strategy aimed at our stochastic inversion approach should be suitable for not only a single inverted conditional stochastic realization but also multiple ones to improve the calculation efficiency of a single invert realization we exploit the compute unified device architecture cuda sanders and kandrot 2010 which makes our 3d inversion algorithm possible to benefit from the ability of gpu in parallel computing with general purpose computation because the 3d inversion algorithm is written in matlab the fast fourier transform fft algorithm is one of the most computationally intensive and commonly used functions in the 3d inversion algorithm thus it can be implemented on an nvidia gpu and will be much faster than using the cpu based fft algorithm additionally calculation of synthetic gpr data using the convolution model squared residual computation and all the node based or trace based calculations can be executed in parallel as the solution for each node or trace is independent of any other several experiments indicate that use of the mentioned strategies related to gpu can dramatically reduce the computation time normally we can use the for loop to execute the above gpu based inversion algorithm to obtain 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations successively the inversion is a computationally intensive and time consuming task as it adopt a regular serial execution actually the 100 realizations are independent from each other which means no communication between the 100 realizations during the inversion in this case the for loop type inversion algorithm thus can be made into a parfor loop type algorithm which is able to assign the inversion task on multi gpus for example the server we used is a high performance server implemented with 4 nodes each of which has 4 available gpu cards nvidia tesla v100 we can replace for loop in former matlab code by parfor loop in order to deploy 4 gpus on a single node and it yields an approximate speedup factor of 4 further we can use the portable batch system pbs to exploit 4 nodes to run the parfor loop inversion algorithm simultaneously on the gpu server which can fulfill another 4 times of acceleration our related inversion results indicate that the use of the two parallelization strategies reduces the computation time by a factor of 16 overall the acceleration factor provided by the multi gpus multi node parallelization of the 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm is closely related to computing power of the gpu computing facilities such as the number of gpus and that of the server nodes 3 results 3 1 database to characterize the detailed porosity distribution of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer we now apply our 3d inversion approach to the common offset gpr data collected at the bhrs fig 2 near boise idaho usa the bhrs is originally designed to support a variety of geophysical hydrological tests to thoroughly characterize the 2d 3d distribution of hydrological parameters in heterogeneous alluvial barrash and knoll 1998 as shown in fig 2 the well designed experimental site contains a set of 13 boreholes white points in a central area and the central borehole a1 surrounded by two rings of six boreholes each b1 b6 and c1 c6 respectively the key information regarding the hydrogeological structure at the bhrs has been obtained from neutron porosity log data that were collected at 0 06 m depth intervals in this study the measured porosity logs at seven boreholes yellow circle located in the center a1 and the outside c1 c6 concentric rings were used for conditioning the 3d stochastic inversion procedure whereas the measured porosity logs at the two boreholes b2 and b5 yellow circle were selected for validation fig 3 shows the neutron neutron porosity logs used in this study barrash and clemo 2002 bradford et al 2009 the depth of the groundwater table at the site varies seasonally between 2 m and 4 m the underlying braided river type aquifer consists of late quaternary fluvial deposits dominated by coarse cobbles and sand these are followed by a layer of red clay which is situated at 20 m depth e g barrash and clemo 2002 the 3d gpr survey at the bhrs was performed in the summer of 1998 using a pulseekko pro 100 system sensors software inc with a nominal antenna center frequency of 100 mhz the data were collected in common offset mode using a transmitter receiver antenna spacing of 1 m and a time sampling interval of 0 8 ns the 3d gpr survey area had dimensions of 30 m in the in line x direction and 18 m in the cross line y direction fig 2 traces were recorded every 0 1 m along each survey line blue dotted line in fig 2 with a line spacing of 0 2 m to improve the signal to noise ratio 32 vertical stacks were performed for each recorded gpr trace 3 2 3d conditional stochastic inversion the considered 3d gpr reflection data were subjected to essentially the processing flow which included time zero and near offset corrections dewow filter smooth time varying gain based on the observed amplitude decay along each trace topography correction and 2d f k time migration using a constant velocity of 0 075 m ns the value of migration velocity was found to optimally focus diffraction events in the data below the water table and conforms to the average velocity of saturated sediments at the bhrs determined by bradford et al 2009 the processed gpr data cube along with the estimated source wavelet are shown in fig 4 given that the porosity measurements are only available below the groundwater table we limit our analysis to the saturated part of the probed subsurface region starting at 2 8 m depth to reduce the accumulative error of the inversion process which includes the transformation from porosity to velocity based on the crim equation we chose the velocity as the basic inversion parameter the first step in our 3d inversion process is conducting geostatistical analysis of the velocity which led to an estimated mean and standard deviation of 0 081 m ns and 0 008 m ns respectively a hurst number of ν 0 35 and a vertical correlation length of a z 0 75 m for the horizontal correlation lengths along the x and y direction the lateral correlation length values of a x 4 5 m and a y 9 m can be speculated based on the stochastic analysis of 3d gpr data from the bhrs of xu et al 2020a in which suggests that the two corresponding horizontal to vertical aspect ratios of 6 and 12 are most likely all of these parameters were used to generate conditional stochastic porosity realizations that were then optimized to fit the gpr reflection data we then performed the inversion procedure for the 3d gpr data and finally obtained 100 qualified conditional stochastic velocity porosity models and all the corresponding residual sum of squares between the observed 3d gpr data and the synthetic data as well as the objective function values have reduced to 10 of their original values after 320 sa iterations fig 5 fig 6 shows two example conditional stochastic realizations obtained with our inversion procedure along with the mean and standard deviation of an ensemble of 100 such realizations as observed in the figure the inverted stochastic realizations fig 6a and b are consistent with each other as well as with the ensemble mean fig 6c which is smooth and recovers the spatial porosity distribution except for small scale variability it is similar to the result of the deterministic inversion in some degree but their small scale heterogeneities exhibit different characteristics the standard deviation of the 100 output realizations fig 6d can show the uncertainty of inversion results regarding each node of the porosity model it can be observed that the vicinities of the locations of validated boreholes have the lowest standard deviation which means that our result is rather stable and plausible at other areas such as the northeast potion of the survey area x 20 m the uncertainty is relatively larger as there exists no conditional wells and the corresponding results are relatively untrustworthy to assess the quality of the reconstructed 3d gpr reflection data we select three 2d cross line sections y 1 2 9 and 16 m from the synthetic and observed 3d gpr data fig 7 apparently the 2d synthetic sections show laminations similar to those corresponding observed data in other words the major characteristics of the observed data can be well recovered however the synthetic amplitudes are distributed across a much narrower range than those observed ones due to utilization of the impedance inversion approach to test the actual accelerating efficiency we run several inversion tests with the parameters and high performance server as previously described the first inversion test is for the generation of a single inverted realization by using the 3d inversion algorithm directly modified from the previous 2d inversion algorithm xu et al 2021 and it takes 36 7 h to finish the inversion process our second inversion test is still to obtain a single inverted realization but using the 3d inversion algorithm with the utilization of gpu and cuda parallel programing it costs 30 s for one sa iteration and 2 7 h for the whole inversion process which results in a speed up factor of 13 6 when compared with the regular 3d conditional inversion algorithm the final inversion test is to obtain 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations using the multi gpus multi node parallelization of 3d inversion algorithm deploying 4 nodes and 4 gpus simultaneously overall it costs nearly 20 h to obtain 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations while it costs at least 270 h for the same purpose using the serial based 3d inversion algorithm therefore our inversion tests regarding the efficiency of the 3d inversion algorithm show that utilization of the aforementioned parallelization strategies in the 3d inversion algorithm can significantly speed up the process of generating a single inverted realization as well as 100 inverted realizations 3 3 validation of results in fig 8 we show the validation results at the location of borehole b2 before our conditional stochastic inversion the unconditional simulated porosity curves show large uncertainties and fail to recover the trend of true porosities fig 8a their corresponding gpr traces also suggest significant differences to the observed gpr data fig 8b after the inversion we see in fig 8c that the gpr derived and observed porosity curves are overall in good agreement not only in terms of the trend but also with regard to the absolute values there is a small misfit at the depth of 3 m which should be related to the patchy waveform at the top of observed gpr trace shown in fig 8d generally our method allows for a substantial reduction of uncertainty in porosity compared to the assumed prior distribution and allows us to adequately reproduce most parts of the porosity curve then we show in fig 9 the corresponding validation results at the location of validation borehole b5 similar to the results at borehole b2 the proposed inversion approach provides a relatively good fit to the observed gpr data and also allows for a substantial reduction of uncertainty in the porosity compared to the assumed prior distribution specially the inverted porosities approximate a running trend of neutron probe porosities but fail to match pretty well with upper 2 3 of the porosity profile also fig 9c shows that the lower part of this profile is similarly characterized by an unusually low standard deviation compared to the upper part we assume that the low deviation in the lower part of the 3d sections might be relate to the corresponding lower amplitude since the 3d inversion algorithm obtains the invert realizations based on decreasing the residual sum of squares which means that the areas with lower amplitude will be much easier to reach the so called corresponding optimal values to quantitatively assess the correspondence between the inverted and measured porosity values at the location of validation boreholes we compute the correlation coefficient r which can be expressed as the following form e g illman et al 2015 13 r 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ χ i μ χ 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 where n is the total number of porosity data to be computed i indicates the data number χ i and χ i represent the estimates from the inverted and measured porosity values at the well locations respectively and μ χ and μ χ are corresponding means of the inverted and measured porosity values respectively note that by mixing the boreholes b2 and b5 as a whole we further also compute the composite r values for quantitatively analysis fig 10 shows the results of the corresponding r values with regard to 100 initial and inverted conditional stochastic realizations in fig 10a we can find that r values blue line of inverted porosity at the location of borehole b2 are generally higher than those gray line of the initial porosity at the same location and it significantly provides a smaller standard deviation we would find this phenomenon to be even more pronounced in the fig 10c which corresponds the results of borehole b5 the difference between fig 10a and c again shows the strong subsurface heterogeneity at the bhrs site as observed from fig 10f we can find that most of the r values red line of the inverted porosity values at the location of the two boreholes are quite high r 0 8 and the inverted results blue line have been obviously improved on the basis of the corresponding initial results gray line to further test the reliability of the inversion results the inverted porosity values at the location of the two boreholes are compared with their corresponding measured values and the crossplots of inverted and measure porosity are shown in fig 10b d and f respectively as observed from these three subfigs the inverted porosity values generally fit well to the measured values except for some high or low prediction errors overall the 3d inversion method provides relatively acceptable and reasonable inversion results at the bhrs site 3 4 3d characterization of sand channel the stratigraphy at the bhrs is characterized with five distinct units based on stratigraphic position in the sediment column and differentiation by porosity lithology and gpr reflection data e g barrash and clemo 2002 barrash and reboulet 2004 clement et al 2006 note that since the penetration depth limit of the field gpr data is about 9 m unit 1 and unit 2 which mainly lie bellow 9 m depth are thus not shown in fig 11 a and 11b unit 5 the topmost and youngest unit is a coarse grained high porosity ϕ 0 4 sand channel that eroded into unit 4 fig 11a the sand channel is inferred to trend northwesterly across the well field and is roughly parallel to the boise river e g barrash and clemo 2002 bradford et al 2009 however the 2d lateral even 3d spatial continuity of the sand channel with a high degree of certainty from the borehole data alone cannot be established due to subtle differences between nearby logs and core samples therefore clement et al 2006 uses surface based gpr reflection data that has been calibrated at boreholes locations c4 b2 and b4 to map the sand channel at the bhrs and finds that channel thickens toward the boise river to the southwest and pinches out between boreholes b4 and b2 two porosity sections fig 11c and d extracted from the mean of 100 inverted conditional stochastic porosity realizations are shown in approximate cross river boreholes c5 a1 c2 and c4 a1 c1 orientations the high porosity wedge i e unit 5 with mean porosity of 0 425 and standard deviation of 0 02 thickens toward the southwest and pinches out near borehole a1 which conforms to the previous interpretation results e g bradford et al 2009 barrash and clemo 2002 our results also show the characteristics of spatial distribution of the sand channel along different directions in a high resolution manner furthermore it is important to point out that the laterally and vertically consistent transition to significantly lower porosities beyond 6 6 8 m depth predicted by our inversion results fig 11c and d is consistent with barrash and clemo s 2002 interpretation of a transition from a cobble dominated section unit 4 mean porosity of 0 22 standard deviation of 0 05 to a relatively low porosity sediments unit 3 mean porosity of 0 17 standard deviation of 0 02 these in turn indicate that while the 3d conditional stochastic inversion method is unable to account for local statistical non stationarity such as the unusually high porosity in the upper part of profile between 6 2 m and 7 4 m depth in fig 8c therefore it is quite robust with regard to laterally and vertically consistent changes in the stochastic porosity properties to obtain the 3d spatial distribution of the sand channel we use the function isosurface in matlab to plot the 3d isosurface with equal values ϕ 0 4 in the mean of 100 inverted conditional stochastic realizations in fig 12 the 4 different perspective views of the sand channel unit 5 based on our inversion results illustrate directly and visually the characteristics of spatial distribution of the sand channel in 3d space the sand channel is depicted in a 3d wedge shaped object and dips toward from the center portion x 14 5 m to the southwest portion of the survey area fig 12a 12d its top is mainly located at the depth of 2 9 m while its bottom has a depth range of 3 2 m to 4 1 m the horizontal distribution of sand channel is uneven indicating a preferred distribution along our results is highly consistent with the 3d interpretation of sand channel of bradford et al 2009 and dafflon and barrash 2012 in which they use surface based gpr reflection tomography and high resolution 3d conditional simulations to map the 3d porosity distribution at the bhrs respectively however the spatial resolution of their results maybe not adequate for a deterministic and detailed numerical porosity model as they do not take the strong porosity heterogeneity at the site into consideration our 3d inversion method which integrates the 3d geostastical information gpr reflection and borehole data shows a huge advantage in recovering the spatial distribution of the sand channel at the bhrs when comparing with previous 2d 3d methods 4 discussion the main objective of this study was to implement and validate a 3d conditional stochastic inversion methodology for estimating the porosity distribution of an alluvial aquifer from surface based 3d gpr reflection data to this end we have presented a novel 3d gpu accelerated conditional stochastic inversion method for surface based common offset gpr reflection data 3d stochastic realizations of subsurface properties generated by the fft ma simulation method that offer an acceptable fit to gpr reflection data are generated via sa optimization the realizations are conditioned to borehole porosity measurements available within the 3d gpr survey area as well as to geostatistical parameters derived from the borehole logs and the processed gpr data the inverted porosity logs at the location of validation boreholes are largely verified by the measured values except for some local mismatches figs 8 10 and the reconstructed gpr reflection data based on the 100 inverted conditional stochastic porosity realizations are highly fit to the observed gpr reflection data fig 7 these results clearly show the validity of our proposed 3d inversion method moreover the 3d inversion method is able to generate numerous equally well inverted conditional stochastic realizations which reveal the trend of the subsurface porosity field in a highly heterogeneous 3d regional alluvial aquifer the numerous realizations can be used to assess the uncertainty about the porosity field at the bhrs and help us to obtain the porosity heterogeneity note that the reflection profiles used in this study were acquired using 100 mhz antennas which results in an inherent vertical resolution of 0 2 m e g annan 2005 the 3d inversion method is derived from the classical impedance inversion algorithm which could eliminate the effect of wavelet and improve the vertical resolution of the reflection profiles meanwhile the 3d inversion method uses the fft ma simulation algorithm and borehole measured porosity data to generate inverted conditional stochastic realizations and the measured borehole porosity data has an even higher vertical resolution 0 06 m therefore the 3d inversion method could provide images of shallow subsurface structure with a much higher vertical resolution when compared with the ht methods it is also worth mentioning that the lateral resolution of the 3d inversion method is also impressive due to the abundant gpr reflection data collected from the dense survey grid and the horizontal geostatistical constraint used for simulation this study demonstrates the ability of the 3d inversion method to give high quality estimates of porosity distribution in the upper part of the saturated zone over a wide range of conditions characterized by highly variable water content dynamics once the sa parameters are determined the computational time of our 3d inversion method is dominated by calculation of fft calculation of convolution and the number of inverted conditional stochastic realizations in our 3d inversion method the use of gpu with cuda parallel programing have significantly increased the efficiency of generation of single invert realization and the use of parallel computing toolbox and pbs system have further accelerated the process to obtain numerous inverted conditional stochastic realizations it is important to point out that acceleration speed resulting from the latter strategy depends on the number of gpus and gpu nodes as the 3d inversion method is able to reconstruct and visualize the 3d porosity distribution i e water content of alluvial aquifers in an orderly and efficient manner it can be easily applied to the long term gpr 4d monitoring of the evolution of alluvial aquifers the current application of the inversion methodology only considers full water saturation however generalization to partial water saturation is conceptually straightforward the gpu accelerated 3d conditional stochastic inversion method has greatly improved its practicability and can be also adapted for other geophysical hydrogeophysical surveys such as detection of non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminants or soil moisture mapping arguably the most important criterion for our inversion method is whether a convolution model can be used to describe the reflection data in section 2 3 we emphasize that our method relies on two important assumptions i e the recorded gpr wavefield is largely non dispersive and is dominated by single scattering the practical validity of the assumption of negligible dispersion is notably underscored by the success of numerous studies which rely upon an adequate estimation of the gpr source wavelet e g schmelzbach et al 2012 zeng et al 2015 liu et al 2018 2022 xu et al 2021 with regard to the multiple scattering effect the available empirical evidence suggests that it is also largely negligible in common offset gpr data collected in alluvial aquifer environments e g irving et al 2009 schmelzbach et al 2012 xu et al 2020b xu et al 2021 the latter is consistent with a previous study involving acoustic waves in strongly heterogeneous environments where it was found that multiple scattering only becomes important for strong local velocity fluctuations corresponding to standard deviations of the order of 10 or more in combination with long propagation paths in excess of 20 dominant wavelengths e g holliger 1997 these conditions are generally not fulfilled for surface based common offset gpr reflection data generally the parameters that might affect the accuracy of the 3d inversion method mainly include the quality of observed data borehole porosity and gpr reflection data borehole setting e g the number location estimated stochastic parameters and regularization parameter in the 3d inversion method the geophysical data is the basic source data to estimate wavelet and stochastic parameters and it also plays a very important role in the inversion process therefore the high quality observed data can lead to more accurate inversion results to investigate sensitivity of the borehole setting we thus design several inversion tests which used different numbers 7 9 11 of conditional boreholes for the inversion of bhrs data the inversion results indicate that using more conditional boreholes for inversion could improve the accuracy of inverted porosity to some extent at the cost of a relatively poor fitting to the gpr data as well as more inversion time moreover the 3d inversion method could perform much better in characterizing the subsurface heterogeity when conditional boreholes are evenly distributed in the survey grid the regularization parameter λ controls the trade off between fitting to observed gpr data and borehole porosity constraints in the inversion process another effect of λ is to promote the unconditional simulated porosity values at conditional borehole locations to be close to the measured values which could also recover the subsurface heterogeneity at some degree generally the inversion results might be unsatisfactory if we use improper values for regularization parameter λ in this study finally accurate estimation of stochastic parameters will lead to a more accurate description of the subsurface porosity distribution especially when it is clearly highly variable because the estimated stochastic parameters control the stochastic characteristics and smoothness of conditional stochastic realizations the manifestations of the local mismatch between the borehole porosity and inverted porosity at the location of validation boreholes figs 8 and 9 are either high and low prediction errors at different depths specifically the regions with low prediction errors regarding the porosity for borehole b5 is between 2 8 and 4 05 m depth and for borehole b2 is between 6 54 and 7 78 m depth meanwhile the regions with high prediction errors for the two boreholes at the middle depths b2 between 6 54 and 7 78 m depth b5 between 4 05 and 7 2 m depth careful analysis of the mismatch shows that the regions with low prediction errors always occur at the relatively high porosity regions and vice versa to our knowledge the mismatch might be related to 1 local variations in amplitude decay of the 3d observed gpr data that have not been adequately compensated 2 local violations of the inherent assumption of statistical stationarity to investigate the possibility of inadequate compensation we reprocessed the 3d gpr data presented in fig 4 using several alternative gain functions while in some cases this helped to raise the amplitudes in the lower part of the gpr data cube it did not allow us to remove the small mismatches in the inferred porosity distribution therefore the mismatch was more probably attributed to the local violations of the inherent assumption of statistical stationarity in this work the velocity of the shallow part of bhrs based on the geostatistical analysis of borehole velocity is assumed to be a normal distribution with a mean of 0 081 m ns corresponds to the porosity of 0 022 however the borehole porosity logs collected at the bhrs deviate from a normal distribution by having both a high porosity tail and also a low amplitude high porosity mode barrash and clemo 2002 normally the kriging based methods produce the best accuracy across different resolutions however there are cases where kriging methods do not perform well e g guo et al 2010 such as terrain with faults or spatial outliers with extremely high or low values the latter of which is quite consistent with the case in this study this again demonstrates that the actual porosity distribution at the bhrs should be more complex than the statistical stationarity condition that we assumed in our future work one important direction is to improve the inversion accuracy by adopting the hierarchical modeling strategy rather than the current holistic strategy 5 conclusions we have presented in this paper a novel gpu accelerated 3d conditional stochastic inversion method for surface based common offset gpr reflection data which can be for recovering the heterogeneity of 3d porosity distribution at fine scale in alluvial aquifers to speed up the 3d inversion we have designed and implemented a fast multi nodes multi gpu based 3d conditional stochastic inversion algorithm compared to the single gpu implemented inversion algorithm our gpu accelerated inversion algorithm can significantly speed up the computation and the related acceleration factor is closely related to computing power of the gpu computing facilities such as the number of gpus and that of the server nodes the application to bhrs field data show the viability of our method to characterize the heterogeneity in an alluvial aquifer the high porosity sand channel at the bhrs is successfully visualized based on our 3d inverted porosity model the results indicate that the proposed 3d inversion method has the potential to effectively recover the fine scale porosity distribution of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer declaration
