17830,by applying favorable oxic and oligotrophic conditions through subsequent aeration and an additional infiltration step the sequential managed aquifer recharge technology smart was proven to better remove trace organic chemicals torcs than conventional mar systems to minimize the physical footprint pumping costs and hydraulic retention times as well as to overcome limitations of site specific heterogeneities of such systems the smart concept was further upgraded by two main engineered technologies this smartplus bioreactor is comprised of an infiltration trench and highly homogenous porous media to provide high infiltration rates and plug flow conditions additionally an in situ oxygen delivery device in particular a self designed pdms gas liquid membrane contactor was designed to establish favorable subsurface oxic conditions this novel smartplus technology was investigated at pilot scale and is designed for advanced water treatment either in the context of water reuse or treatment of impaired surface water to determine the design specifications and to construct a pilot scale membrane contactor the mass transfer coefficients of the pdms membrane were investigated at lab scale for varying reynold numbers 0 2 2 with the help of the customized membrane contactor homogenous bubble free and passive oxygen delivery could be successfully demonstrated at pilot scale under laminar flow conditions and short contact times oxygen concentrations downstream of the membrane contactors met the design specifications 1 mg l as long as the required feed water quality was provided however high nh4 concentrations in the secondary effluent resulted in higher and unsteady oxygen demand than the target oxygen transfer rates could meet and suboxic conditions prevailed although a 20 50 enhancement in the removal of certain compounds 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole and citalopram was achieved demonstration of the full potential of enhanced torc removal by smartplus was hindered due to unsteady feed water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bubble less in situ oxygen delivery gas liquid membrane contactors managed aquifer recharge indirect potable reuse biofiltration trace organic chemicals 1 introduction the united nations have identified water as the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change un water 2020 to increase water availability and improve surface water quality the importance of innovations in advanced water treatment technologies has risen combinations of advanced oxidation adsorption and membrane filtration processes have proven to effectively remove chemical and microbial contaminants from wwtp effluents eggen et al 2014 rizzo et al 2020 however the potential of low energy nature based attenuation processes that do not produce residues or require the addition of chemicals have not been extensively studied for advanced water treatment many studies have focused on the attenuation of trace organic chemicals torcs in natural treatment systems such as bank filtration or managed aquifer recharge mar applications grünheid et al 2005 hamann et al 2016 hoppe jones et al 2010 2012 onesios et al 2009 onesios and bouwer 2012 enhanced biotransformation of some torcs was found to be dependent on the composition and the concentration range of the primary substrate due to co metabolism li et al 2012 2013 2014 rauch williams et al 2010 the prevalence of stable oxic conditions dissolved oxygen concentrations 1 mg l was identified as the key factor for the biotransformation of many torcs hellauer et al 2018b regnery et al 2015a schmidt et al 2017 based on those findings a sequential managed aquifer recharge technology smart for enhanced torc removal from impaired water sources was developed the smart concept improved the removal performance of conventional mar techniques where water is infiltrated into the subsurface through three distinct steps first infiltrated water is extracted from the subsurface after which it is aerated ex situ and then subsequently re infiltrated under favorable oxic and oligotrophic conditions regnery et al 2016 however some limitations such as the unpredictable effluent water quality due to subsurface heterogeneity regnery et al 2017 clogging problems associated with fe and mn precipitation high physical footprint due to the usage of two infiltration units increased costs caused by additional pumping and secondary contamination in the open infiltration basins have hindered the broad application and the technology transfer of conventional mar and smart systems consequently the smartplus concept combining all three aforementioned steps into one bioreactor was developed which is designed as an advanced water treatment technology for ipr applications the smartplus bioreactor in comparison to conventional mar systems has a smaller physical footprint reduced operational costs and avoids disturbances in the flow conditions the controlled hydraulic conditions within the smartplus bioreactor was successfully established by combining high rate infiltration trench technology and a horizontal biofiltration system filled with highly uniform porous media karakurt fischer et al 2020 compared to conventional bank filtration systems with a minimum hrt requirement of 50 days smartplus demonstrated similar torc removals with an hrt of 13 h during baseline operation i e without intermediate aeration karakurt fischer et al 2020 to enhance torc biotransformation smartplus is designed to achieve oxic redox conditions via in situ dissolved oxygen do delivery into the porous media of the bioreactor due to fluctuations in the feed water quality of the smartplus bioreactor during continuous operation with tertiary effluent an adjustable oxygen delivery device is essential to achieve steady state torc transformation for this purpose approaches from groundwater bioremediation or membrane aerated bioreactors mabr were initially considered previous studies have used active or passive oxygen delivery methods to facilitate microbial degradation of organic contaminants in water as biodegradation is the main removal mechanism for torcs barcelona and xie 2001 casey et al 1999 haugen et al 2002 syron and casey 2008 wilson and mackay 2002 however active gas sparging into porous media would result in decreased hydraulic conductivity and air binding as the gas would be trapped in otherwise saturated media the other active method direct injection of liquid through needles displaces the contaminated water resulting in non uniform oxygen introduction fry et al 1997 wilson and mackay 2002 passive delivery of electron acceptors via different types of gas liquid membrane contactors or oxygen releasing compounds orcs such as cao2 or mgo2 may allow uniform distribution and provide bubble less steady sources of oxygen over the long term ahmed et al 2004 barcelona and xie 2001 fang et al 2002 li et al 2010 to avoid immediate dissolution of the compound orcs are impregnated with high ph cement which also affects the activities of microorganisms due to the ph increase of the water obiri nyarko et al 2014 furthermore as the dissolution rate of oxygen is not synchronized with the demand bubble formation can still take place due to the passive nature of orcs a gas liquid membrane contactor is a system which provides a well defined and tailored interface for diffusive transfer without direct mixing or dispensing of one phase into another gabelman and hwang 1999 for this reason controllable gas liquid membrane contactors were deemed promising for the smartplus bioreactor since the smartplus bioreactor flow characteristics reactor configuration packed porous media and bubble less oxygen transfer requirement are different from soil passages in groundwater remediation and mabr this study focused on the feasibility of gas liquid membrane contactors for reliable delivery of electron acceptors into the tertiary effluent under laminar flow conditions and short contact times bubble less gas delivery can be achieved via dense or microporous gas permeable membranes the pores of microporous membranes act as the contact area between the gas and liquid phases whereas in dense membranes the gas is absorbed into the membrane facilitating diffusive gas transfer from one bulk phase to another through the membrane al saffar et al 1997 côté et al 1988 on one hand to avoid gas bubble formation on the surface of microporous membranes the gas pressure should be lower than the bubble point of the membrane which depends on the pore size surface tension of the liquid hydrophobicity and the resulting contact angle of the liquid at the membrane bazhenov et al 2018 due to non uniform pore sizes gas bubbles might still appear under very low gas pressures in the ranges of 0 1 0 2 bar although the theoretical bubble point calculated by nominal pore size is not reached ahmed and semmens 1992 a high gas pressure can be only applied if the liquid side is also uniformly pressurized so that the transmembrane pressure does not exceed the bubble point at any point of the membrane on the other hand to avoid membrane pore wetting the liquid side pressure should be less than the breakthrough pressure al saffar et al 1997 however pore wetting may still take place in porous membranes over time during continuous operation regardless of hydrophobicity which causes high mass transfer resistances and fouling al saffar et al 1997 furthermore in presence of low surfactant concentrations reduction in surface tension may occur leading to reduction in liquid breakthrough pressure gabelman and hwang 1999 although microporous membranes may exhibit more favorable mass transfer characteristics particularly at higher liquid velocities gas liquid contactors made from dense membranes provide a better process stability and were considered to be more suitable for the smartplus bioreactor the total mass transfer coefficient can be expressed by the gas side the membrane and the liquid side mass transfer coefficients for both dense and microporous membranes the gas film resistance can be neglected if the gas velocity is considered to be much higher than the liquid velocity in the smartplus bioreactor the hydraulics are governed by laminar flow conditions with a liquid velocity of 1 55 10 4 m s and a rather low reynolds number 0 5 the liquid film resistance is very sensitive to the hydraulic conditions decreasing from 78 5 to 45 5 of the total resistance when the reynolds number increases from 0 6 to 49 côté et al 1989 in addition to liquid film resistance membrane resistance which depends on membrane thickness gas selectivity and diffusivity and thus permeability needs to be considered for dense membranes however if highly oxygen permeable membranes such as silicone rubber polydimethylsiloxane pdms charati and stern 1998 with a thin membrane wall are applied the remaining liquid side resistance would still govern the mass transfer under laminar flow conditions côté et al 1989 in addition to their high oxygen permeability silicone membranes are particularly stable during long term operation another mass transfer resistance to consider is the development of biofilms on the membrane surface if membranes are delivering oxygen into water in the presence of biodegradable organic substance such as tertiary effluent essila et al 2000 although a seemingly negative attribute the membrane fibers could support biofilm growth and attachment potentially decreasing bubble formation due to simultaneous oxygen degradation essila et al 2000 we hypothesize that bubble free delivery of oxygen into the smartplus bioreactor can be achieved under laminar flow conditions and short contact times by diffusive transport through gas liquid membrane contactors this will no longer require an external aeration step and therefore reduce the physical footprint of the smart concept while improving torc attenuation during continuous operation of the smartplus bioreactor in this paper we describe the design and application of a promising passive oxygen delivery system and its effects on the redox zonation and torc attenuation at pilot scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the smartplus pilot plant secondary treated municipal wastewater from the garching wastewater treatment plant wwtp 31 000 pe was used as feed water for the smartplus pilot plant tertiary treatment by a polypropylene filter cartridge 100 μm 20 putsch gmbh and a subsequent rapid sand filter dynasand nordic water gmbh was provided on site the dynasand effluent was stored in a 1800 l buffer tank and was fed continuously to the smartplus bioreactor at a flow rate of 0 3 m3 h fig 1 during the experimental period may october 2019 operational disturbances in the biological treatment of the wwtp resulted in increased ammonium nh4 concentrations in the effluent supplied to the bioreactor thus during elevated nh4 n concentrations 1 5 mg l the dynasand filter was operated with inline h2o2 dosing as an adjacent nitrification step designed for a maximum of 3 mg l nh4 n removal during high nh4 n concentrations in the feed water 4 mg l partial circulation of the bioreactor effluent into fresh incoming tertiary effluent ensured that nh4 n concentrations remained below 4 mg l in the feed water supplied to the smartplus bioreactor the pilot scale smartplus bioreactor was composed of a stainless steel flume 6 m long x 0 9 m wide x 1 4 m high where the first 3 m were sealed with a lid to mimic a confined saturated aquifer a rectangular shaft 0 35 m long x 0 9 m wide x 1 5 m high atop the bioreactor at the inflow side served as an infiltration trench the infiltration trench was filled with gravel d10 3 4 mm for rapid vertical infiltration of feed water followed by horizontal plug flow conditions in the rest of the bioreactor the compartments before and after the electron acceptor ea compartment were filled with uniform technical sand uniformity coefficient 1 3 d10 0 75 mm to maintain the plug flow conditions which is essential for establishing controlled sequential redox conditions during subsequent travel through the saturated zone the ea compartment detailed information in chapter 2 3 and the outflow compartments were filled with gravel d10 2 1 and 3 4 mm respectively twenty four water sampling ports at different heights and depths along the length of the bioreactor and three filter media sampling ports for the sealed area were installed dissolved oxygen do sensors dp pst6 presens gmbh germany were deployed in 6 pvc infiltration wells along the bioreactor and continuously logged data every 10 min more detailed information on the design and operation of the smartplus bioreactor including the hydraulic characterization prior to the commissioning of the in situ oxygen delivery device have been published in karakurt fischer et al 2020 2 2 performance characterization of the gas liquid membrane contactor 2 2 1 design and operation of a gas liquid membrane contactor at lab scale a lab scale flow through setup was constructed to investigate bubble formation and determine mass transfer coefficients fig 2 the initial setup to test bubble formation in tap water and tertiary effluent consisted of a bottom up flow through acrylic glass column 30 cm in length 14 cm in diameter in which the membrane was fixed approximately 10 cm above the bottom experiments to determine mass transfer coefficients corresponding to flow velocities in smartplus table 1 were carried out with tap water in a stainless steel column 30 cm in length 15 cm in diameter membrane fixed 18 cm from the bottom pdms membranes of 2 m length and an inner outer diameter of 1 98 3 18 mm dow silastic cole parmer gmbh were woven onto a metal grid the pdms membrane material is well characterized by berry et al 2017 to model oxygen and ozone mass transfer technical grade pressurized oxygen 99 9 o2 air liquide deutschland gmbh with a feed pressure of 0 1 bar and a constant gas flow rate at 0 1 l min was used in all experiments to mimic the redox conditions at the entrance of the ea compartment of smartplus bioreactor the feed water was sparged with nitrogen gas for 10 15 min to adjust do concentrations to below 1 5 mg l the feed water was then pumped through the experimental setup with a rotary pump except for the lowest velocity 4 72 10 5 m s for which a peristaltic pump was used instead do concentrations were continuously monitored using flow through sensors dp pst6 presens gmbh in the column influent and effluent until equilibrium was reached after approximately two hydraulic retention times the equilibrium concentration was recorded every 10 s for additional 5 min and averaged to calculate cl out the water temperature 17 9 19 6 c was measured at the outlet immediately after each experiment and was similar to water temperatures observed in the smartplus bioreactor during the experimental period 17 2 22 0 c 2 2 2 determination of mass transfer coefficients in cross flow the flux of gas across a membrane can be described as 1 j k δ c with mass transfer coefficient k and the characteristic concentration difference δc which has been characterized as the difference between saturation concentration at the gas phase inlet csat in and the equilibrium concentration in the bulk liquid cl ahmed and semmens 1992 fang et al 2002 however to include the pressure drop along the membrane contact area δc becomes 2 δ c c s a t i n c s a t o u t ln c s a t i n c l a v c s a t o u t c l a v where a logarithmic average is built over the total membrane length with csat in and the saturation concentration at the gas phase outlet csat out côté et al 1989 instead of cl the averaged liquid phase concentration cl av of liquid side concentrations at the inlet cl in and outlet cl out is taken as the bulk liquid concentration which has been proposed for slow flow velocities fang et al 2002 the overall mass transfer coefficient k is typically expressed using the resistance in series model 3 1 k 1 k g 1 k m 1 k l with local resistances in gas phase kg membrane material km and liquid phase kl the resistance at the boundary between a wall and a fluid depends on the fluid velocity and the gas exchange geometry wickramasinghe et al 1992 yang and cussler 1986 the higher the fluid velocity the thinner the liquid or gaseous boundary layer and the lower the resistance respectively as the gas velocity in the investigated system is much higher than the liquid velocities kg was neglected in the resistance term km can be derived from the permeability of oxygen pm in pdms henry s law constant h and the wall thickness τ casey et al 1999 as 4 k m p m h τ the liquid side resistance kl depends on the flow velocity and can be described by numerous dimensionless correlations containing the sherwood number s h k d o d the reynolds number r e v d o ν and the schmidt number s c v d as 5 s h a r e b s c c with liquid velocity ϑ l fiber outer diameter d o kinematic viscosity ν and diffusivity d the dimensionless correlations were determined with porous membranes which were assumed to have a minor membrane resistance thus can be used as approximation for kl examples and further references can be found in gabelman and hwang 1999 for the modeled mass transfer coefficients equations 4 and 5 were solved for km and kl all physical parameters such as the kinematic viscosity of water and the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in water were adjusted to the given experimental conditions the calculated km and kl values were used to obtain the overall k value in case of kl several empirical correlations which were determined in a cross flow design with porous hollow fibers were tested the selected correlation that fits best sh 1 38 re0 34 sc0 33 was set up by yang and cussler 1986 at flow velocities starting approximately from 2 5 10 3 m s with a densely packed cross flow contactor containing 750 polypropylene fibers with an outer diameter of 0 4 mm experimental mass transfer coefficients for the pdms membrane were determined for steady state conditions dc dt 0 with two mass balances of the system as suggested by orgill et al 2019 6 v l dc dt q l

determined concentrations cl in and cl out are used in equation 7 to calculate cg out with knowledge of cg in as this depends on the partial gas pressure then δc in equation 2 is calculated by applying henry s law to solve equation 6 for k including a temperature correction sander 2015 and ideal gas law 2 3 design of the electron acceptor compartment equipped with gas liquid membrane contactors the ea compartment was initially filled with gravel from a tertiary sand filter of the wwtp munich gut marienhof to facilitate biofilm growth in the system this gravel was then partially removed to install the contactor assembly for the in situ oxygen delivery the contactor assembly was composed of perforated pvc infiltration wells gwe pumpenboese gmbh inner diameter 50 mm slot width 0 3 mm in which the gas liquid membrane contactors were submerged fig 3 the perforated wells acted as a physical barrier between the gravel and membrane conductors for easy installation and maintenance the configuration of the infiltration wells is based on the borehole dilution theory stating that the natural lateral hydraulic capture width of an unpumped well with an inner diameter of di amounts to twice of its diameter 2 di wilson et al 1997 this resulted in the installation of 9 infiltration wells in a row according to the width of smartplus bioreactor 895 mm fig 3 left to guarantee the homogenous and sufficient oxygen distribution at the cross section an additional 8 infiltration wells were placed in a second row in a staggered arrangement as the smartplus bioreactor has a trapezoidal bottom each infiltration well was trimmed depending on its position within the compartment to an appropriate length and tightly sealed with a pvc disk the 17 wells were fixed horizontally by a cover plate on top and vertically by a support plate in the middle via fixing strips the gravel used to fill the void volume between the infiltration wells additionally secured the position of the wells after their installation the exact locations and the length of the infiltration wells can be found in the supporting information si fig 1 the total membrane areas amem required for 17 membrane contactors were calculated based on the oxygen transfer rate or necessary to maintain a stable oxygen concentration downstream of the ea compartment this assumes mixing over the compartment length in accordance with the borehole dilution theory or is expressed as 8 o r k δ c a mem and is solved for the required membrane area amem to achieve the desired oxygen concentrations after the ea compartment the membrane contactors were composed of a metallic cross structure to hold the membranes in place tubing for the oxygen distribution pun h 6x1 bl 6 4 mm festo ag co kg two plastic fittings to connect the oxygen distribution tubing to the membrane fiber reducer 4 mm 1 6 mm rotilabo and two ball valves to regulate inflow and outflow qh qs 6 festo ag co kg the metallic cross structures were constructed from two individual metallic sheets 1 mm thickness mevaco gmbh with a width of 30 mm and a length of 1100 1250 mm depending on the length of the infiltration well the sheets had a porous structure pore diameter 4 mm through which the silicon membrane was threaded in a double spiral fashion fig 3 the tubing for the oxygen distribution was attached to the metallic cross structure but had no contact to the membrane surface and the contactors were fed with oxygen bottom up the oxygen transfer rate can be attuned by a pressure regulation gauge the outlet gas pressure was monitored with a manometer to detect any gas leakages 2 4 sampling and analytical methods in addition to online monitoring of do water pressure temperature and conductivity samples for ammonia nitrate dissolved organic carbon doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and torcs were taken from the feed water the infiltration trench 0 4 m at x direction from the sampling ports before 1 64 m and after 2 64 m the ea compartment and from the effluent 5 85 m of the smartplus bioreactor samples were analyzed according to methods described in karakurt fischer et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigating the feasibility of gas liquid membrane contactors for in situ oxygen delivery into the smartplus bioreactor to design the pilot scale membrane contactors the mass transfer coefficients of the pdms membranes had to be determined experimental mass transfer coefficients determined at lab scale for the flow conditions specified in table 1 varied between 2 01 10 6 and 6 42 10 6 m s and agreed well with the model fig 4 left finding a suitable correlation through experimental verification allows the estimation of the flux across the membranes in relation to membrane geometry partial oxygen pressure and flow velocity although the membrane geometry used in the lab scale experiments was different from the wounded modules which would be placed into the pilot scale smartplus bioreactor the boundary layer in different types of cross flow designs has been shown to be similar wickramasinghe et al 1992 the dependence on the liquid side velocity is visible from the positive response of mass transfer coefficients to rising liquid velocities the k value increases by 131 from 2 01 10 6 to 4 65 10 6 m s when the flow velocity is increased from 4 72 10 5 to 1 55 10 4 m s which corresponds to applying a flow rate of 0 1 0 3 m3 h in the smartplus bioreactor by changing the partial pressure of oxygen while other parameters such as temperature and membrane surface remain constant the oxygen transfer can be adjusted to different hydraulic conditions to quantify the impact of the membrane wall and the liquid side velocity the shares of modeled liquid and membrane resistances were compared fig 4 right the liquid side resistance held between approximately 85 and 75 of the total resistance similar to the results of côté et al 1989 for laminar flow regimes the discussed advantage of having a minor membrane resistance if using porous membranes thus is of minor importance for this application additionally the share of the membrane resistance can be decreased by selecting a thinner membrane wall which is a trade off between mechanical stability and higher mass transfer coefficients moreover the higher mass transfer resistance in dense membranes due to additional membrane resistance can be compensated by increasing the driving force therefore the concentration difference by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen however microbubbles on the surface of the fibers can be observed under high oxygen partial pressures which grow while attached to the membrane surface and detach once a critical size is reached for this reason a driving force increase should be matched by a decrease in liquid film resistance to avoid exceeding saturation and to avoid degassing at the membrane wall côté et al 1989 due to the high dependence on the liquid side resistance bubble formation was observed at 1 55 10 4 m s flow velocity retheo 0 50 at pressure ranges between 0 2 and 0 8 bars of o2 partial pressure during the experiments with tap water after 4 days of operation with the tertiary effluent the bubble formation ceased this was explained by the increased oxygen demand and biofilm formation induced changes to the membrane surface also shown for mabr applications essila et al 2000 due to the absence of bubbles and suitable mass transfer coefficients the gas liquid pdms membrane contactor was deemed suitable for the in situ oxygen delivery into the smartplus bioreactor 3 2 development and implementation of pilot scale gas liquid membrane contactors when assuming fully nitrified and oligotrophic water quality bdoc 1 mg l before the ea compartment less than 2 7 mg l oxygen demand 2 7 mg do mg doc rivett et al 2008 after the ea compartment was expected to meet this oxygen demand maintain oxic conditions 1 mg l in the effluent of smartplus bioreactor and not to consume oxygen excessively a do concentration of 3 4 mg l was targeted for the ea compartment and adjusted according to the fluctuating feed water quality accordingly a total membrane area of 1 54 m2 and a fiber length of 11 39 m for each membrane contactor were calculated using equation 8 based on the modeled mass transfer coefficient of 4 35 10 6 m s at 0 3 m3 h 1 55 10 4 m s this membrane size would provide a do concentration of 3 0 mg l with 0 8 bar o2 partial pressure after the ea compartment without considering oxygen depletion by aerobic biotransformation table 2 if the oxygen pressure would be increased to 1 bar the do concentration would increase to 4 1 mg l to minimize the required membrane length for the silicone tubing contactor and or achieve higher do concentrations oxygen partial pressure in the contactor can be increased from 0 8 bar to 2 5 bar during the experiments gas leakages were observed at 2 5 bar due to a membrane adaptor disconnection however in the pilot scale application calculations showed that 100 oxygen saturation 9 3 mg l at 19 c and 1 atm could be achieved downstream of the ea compartment already with 2 3 bar partial pressure in the membrane module assuming perfect mixing of oxygen in the compartment therefore the adaptors were not replaced for the pilot scale membrane contactors for higher pressures however a different adaptor for the membrane contactor would be required finally the membrane contactors were designed and constructed with a membrane length of 11 12 m depending on the length of the infiltration well in which they were submerged the membrane contactors were then conditioned by submerging them into a transparent container filled with tertiary effluent for five days to visibly check for any leaks the goal of the conditioning was to enhance the initial biofilm growth prior to installing the membranes into the ea compartment therefore inhibiting initial bubble formation during commissioning in the smartplus bioreactor after the commissioning the modules were operated in closed mode at varying oxygen partial pressures 0 8 1 0 bar and the modules were flushed once a day to remove nitrogen 3 3 validation of pilot scale gas liquid membrane contactors for the establishment of redox zonation under varying feed water quality to trace the spatial oxygen depletion and determine whether the favorable oxic and oligotrophic conditions could be established with the membrane contactors the bioreactor water quality was monitored at six locations samples for do doc nh4 n no3 n concentrations and uva254 values were taken from the secondary effluent in the feed water after the infiltration trench before and after the ea compartment and in the effluent of the smartplus bioreactor table 3 the mean secondary effluent doc concentration during the operation with in situ oxygen delivery september october 2019 8 1 0 9 mg l was less than the concentration measured during baseline operation april september 2018 11 5 3 2 mg l karakurt fischer et al 2020 the discrepancies and the standard deviations portray seasonal and weekly quality fluctuations of the secondary effluent of garching after the pre treatment a doc concentration of 10 2 2 7 mg l in the feed water was achieved which was then further degraded along the bioreactor to 7 5 2 3 mg l during baseline operation karakurt fischer et al 2020 mean feed water do concentration during baseline operation 5 1 2 3 mg l was lower than during operation with in situ oxygen delivery 8 3 0 5 mg l due to high feed water temperatures up to 27 c and higher feed water doc concentrations fig 5 do of 5 1 2 3 mg l in feed water was then rapidly consumed resulting in a mean do concentration of 1 0 1 0 mg l at the end of the infiltration trench thus shifting from oxic to suboxic redox conditions according to the redox definitions by regnery et al 2015b fig 5 left no nitrate reduction 0 5 mg n l and low do concentrations 1 mg l do confirmed mostly suboxic conditions along the remainder of the bioreactor karakurt fischer et al 2020 during operation with the in situ oxygen delivery a feed water doc concentration of 7 9 0 8 mg l was obtained after the pre treatment with dynasand filter similar mean feed water doc concentrations 7 3 1 0 mg l were observed in a pilot scale sequential biofiltration system with intermediate aeration hrt 33 h fed in batch mode with the same secondary effluent as smartplus müller et al 2017 in the second biofilter 4 4 mg l doc persisted in the effluent while do concentrations remained above 2 mg l müller et al 2017 the prevalence of oxic conditions in the biofilter effluent and the hrt of more than 33 h indicate the refractory character of the remaining 4 4 mg l doc in the garching secondary effluent müller et al 2017 eventually 3 1 1 1 mg l of doc was removed in smartplus resulting in 4 8 0 6 mg l doc before the ea compartment the substantial depletion in the uva254 from the feed water after the infiltration trench supports the main removal of bdoc within the first 40 cm of the bioreactor table 3 stable doc concentrations and uva254 values were observed for the remainder of the bioreactor as the changes were not significant after passage through the ea compartment α 0 05 2 sided paired student s t test during the baseline operation in 2018 and the experiments conducted by müller et al 2017 ammonium was not measured in the garching tertiary effluent in 2019 operational disturbances at the wwtp caused effluent nh4 n concentrations to increase up to 5 9 mg l 90th percentile through inline h2o2 dosing in the dynasand filter which was designed for maximum 3 mg l n removal a lower mean nh4 n concentration 1 9 0 6 mg l was achieved in the smartplus feed water table 3 all available oxygen in the feed water 8 3 0 5 mg l was depleted in the infiltration trench due to both nitrification and doc removal table 3 fig 5 right bringing nh4 n concentrations before the ea compartment to 0 015 mg l however due to the synoptic sampling and fluctuating water quality intermittent occurrences of surplus ammonium before the ea compartment cannot be excluded despite the observed nitrification mean nitrate concentration decreased within the infiltration trench indicating that nitrate was also partially used as an electron acceptor for doc removal furthermore the increase of the mean nitrate concentration right after the ea compartment δno3 n 3 4 1 4 mg l indicates that the nitrification was partially incomplete and or some ammonium was still present before the ea compartment overall observed denitrification supported the presence of anoxic conditions before the ea compartment and the oxygen provided by the ea compartment was partially used to complete the nitrification process this additional demand was not considered during the design of the membrane contactors but was tried to be compensated by higher o2 pressures the oxygen demand from nitrification however seems to be variable and could not be quantified when assuming fully nitrified feed prior to the ea compartment oxygen demand can be estimated from the remaining bdoc of 0 4 mg l based on doc concentration of 4 8 mg l before the ea compartment and persistent doc of 4 4 mg l in the effluent of sequential biofilters for this transformation in situ introduction of 2 mg l do would be required to meet the resulting oxygen demand and to establish oxic conditions 1 mg l in the effluent according to the experimental and modeled mass transfer coefficients as well as the design parameters of the pilot scale membrane contactors o2 pressure was adjusted to 0 8 1 bar to establish do concentrations of 3 0 4 1 mg which would meet this theoretical oxygen demand during the entire experimental period however oxygen demand occasionally exceeded 2 mg l due to the fluctuating influent water quality do concentrations in the reactor directly downstream of the ea compartment 2250 mm showed that 80 of measurements were 1 mg l do mean 2 6 mg l 90th percentile 5 3 mg l fig 5 in the effluent of the smartplus bioreactor however half of the measured concentrations were 1 mg l mean 1 4 mg l 90th percentile 4 1 mg l the continuous monitoring with online do measurements interval 10 min n 3525 indicated substantially higher water quality fluctuations than the analysis of synoptic doc ammonium and nitrate samples further depletion of do downstream of the ea compartment mean δdo 1 2 mg l 90th percentile 4 1 mg l was therefore not directly comparable with the steady doc and nh4 n attenuation derived from the synoptic samples moreover the disturbances of the hydraulic conditions before and within the ea compartment during the experimental period in 2019 si fig 2 possibly resulted in poor mixing of do over the length of the ea compartment which was assumed for the validity of the borehole dilution theory and homogenous oxygen concentrations downstream of the ea compartment chapter 2 3 after the ea compartment the arrival of the tracer at the ports and the outflow of the bioreactor corresponded to their hydraulic retention times si fig 2 however the poor mixing within the ea compartment might have still resulted in the occurrence of spatial differences downstream thus higher up to 5 3 mg l 90th percentile and lower do concentrations than the targeted 3 0 4 1 mg l within one cross section for this reason even though oxic conditions were provided do concentrations were presumably not homogenous and the redox conditions were not at steady state overall the bubble less in situ oxygen delivery to smartplus bioreactor via gas liquid membrane contactors has been proven to be successful at pilot scale although the water quality of the tertiary effluent was improved the strong feed water fluctuations in ammonia could not be compensated smaller changes in oxygen demand could be compensated with an automated process control by using monitoring data from the do and uva254 sensors to assess quality changes and oxygen demand thus a reliable source water quality is a prerequisite for advanced wastewater treatment technologies in order to achieve and maintain the targeted treatment efficiencies likewise steady oxic conditions after the ea compartment can only be established if the wastewater effluent quality is stable 3 4 effects of oxygen delivery and varying feed water quality on the attenuation of torcs due to the incomplete nitrification in the wwtp and described variabilities in redox conditions the expected enhanced removal of torcs in the smartplus bioreactor could not be observed however the prevailing redox conditions within the smartplus bioreactor oxic anoxic oxic suboxic still revealed attenuation of 14 torcs and demonstrated the complexity of mechanisms involved in their biotransformation fig 6 the full breakthrough of the sorptive compound benzotriazole in 2019 indicated that biodegradation was the main removal mechanism for torc transformation within the quartz sand porous media as reported in previous studies alidina et al 2014 hellauer et al 2018b müller et al 2017 reemtsma et al 2010 the transformation of most of the torcs in the anoxic zone before the ea compartment decreased from 2018 to 2019 possibly due to the competitive oxygen demand caused by high ammonium concentrations and corresponding nitrifying and denitrifying anoxic conditions nevertheless additional removal was observed after the in situ oxygen delivery resulting in a similar or improved removal capacity of most of the torcs in 2019 in comparison to operation in 2018 without the oxygen delivery fig 6 major transformation of gabapentin 66 occurred in 2018 under the prevalence of both bdoc and oxygen in the infiltration trench of the smartplus bioreactor which is the most biologically active compartment in the system in 2019 93 of gabapentin was removed already within the dynasand filter prior to the smartplus bioreactor where also both high bdoc and do concentrations due to h2o2 dosing prevailed a similar strong correlation between the biotransformation of gabapentin and do consumption bdoc removal and microbial activity was also observed in the sequential biofiltration system operated by müller et al 2019 in contrast higher recalcitrance of gabapentin has been reported in conventional lab and field scale mar applications hellauer et al 2017 2018a onesios and bouwer 2012 although hellauer et al 2018a observed good oxic transformation of gabapentin at field scale under rather oligotrophic conditions atenolol and trimethoprim behaved similar to gabapentin and were attenuated up to 90 and 75 within the infiltration trench characterized by high bdoc concentrations and oxic conditions rapid biodegradation of trimethoprim and atenolol within the first infiltration step of a smart system has also been reported by regnery et al 2016 while no further removal was observed for atenolol trimethoprim removal increased from 75 up to 88 before the ea compartment under anoxic conditions further removal of trimethoprim under anoxic to anaerobic conditions have also been reported by ghattas et al 2017 and falås et al 2016 schmidt et al 2017 examined the attenuation of atenolol under varying redox conditions at lab scale incubation experiments in this study a complete degradation of atenolol was observed both under oxic and anoxic denitrifying conditions similar to the findings of regnery et al 2015b at a groundwater recharge site after the ea compartment an increase in effluent concentrations reduced the total removal capacity of the smartplus bioreactor for both atenolol 59 and trimethoprim 66 this might be explained by soil disturbances and desorbing effects however to the best of our knowledge this effect has not been reported before for these substances a moderate climbazole removal 44 was observed during both experimental periods in previous studies conducted by hellauer et al 2018b muntau et al 2017 and müller et al 2017 good removal of climbazole 85 was noted under longer hydraulic retention times 1 day in comparison to the smartplus bioreactor 13 h regardless of prevailing redox conditions hermes et al 2019 also confirmed the redox insensitivity of climbazole as enhanced degradation was observed both under oxic and suboxic conditions during sequential biofiltration metoprolol removal 42 was improved during the operation in 2019 and 20 of this removal was observed under anoxic conditions better and faster removal of metoprolol has been noted under oxic in comparison to anoxic suboxic conditions in previous studies bertelkamp et al 2016 hellauer et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 müller et al 2019 also reported an improved removal for metoprolol in the sequential biofiltration system when hrts increased from 10 h 42 to 35 h 95 under steady oxic conditions the strict oxic conditions and longer hrts may be required for further removal of metoprolol after the ea compartment in 2019 diclofenac 21 was poorly removed and no biotransformation was observed for benzotriazole 10 these compounds were reported to be very redox sensitive favoring oxic conditions for improved biotransformation with long adaptation periods from 1 5 months to almost a year hellauer et al 2018a 2018b müller et al 2017 rapid depletion of oxygen within the infiltration trench unsteady do concentrations after the ea compartment and shorter experimental period presumably could not provide those conditions high persistence of carbamazepine venlafaxine and tramadol was observed in 2019 similar to the experimental period before the commissioning of the in situ oxygen delivery in 2018 carbamazepine is widely known to exhibit persistent behavior and has been proposed and used as a wastewater indicator due to its limited biological removal and poor sorption in the aquatic environment under varying redox and hydraulic conditions burke et al 2018 hellauer et al 2018a karakurt et al 2019 müller et al 2017 regnery et al 2016 only under strict anaerobic conditions and long hrts 14 days falås et al 2016 showed improved removal of carbamazepine the persistent behaivour of venlafaxine and tramadol supported the previous findings from müller et al 2017 and hermes et al 2019 a steady transformation of tramadol 70 and venlafaxine loq was observed under oligotrophic and oxic conditions with higher hrts 4 6 days by hellauer et al 2018b higher hrts under strict oxic conditions can be applied at field scale for the smartplus bioreactor possibly improving also tramadol and venlafaxine attenuation a positive effect of oxic conditions downstream of the ea compartment was observed for 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole and citalopram resulting in 20 50 increased removal fig 6 compared to 76 overall removal in 2018 only 14 of 4 faa was removed within the infiltration trench in 2019 possibly due to the rapid depletion of oxygen however a significant increase in the removal of 4 faa up to 63 was eventually achieved with do supply downstream of the ea compartment similar rapid biodegradation of 4 faa under oxic conditions was reported also in previous studies in mar systems hellauer et al 2017 2018a massmann et al 2006 for sulfamethoxazole various removals during mar treatment have been reported ranging from poor to moderate removal grünheid et al 2005 sulfamethoxazole biotransformation in a slow sand filter fed with wwtp effluent was found to even be independent of oxygen and easily degradable acetate concentration zhang et al 2019 however other studies demonstrated that removal of sulfamethoxazole is still enhanced under oxic conditions compared to suboxic or anoxic environments regnery et al 2015b 2016 wiese et al 2011 sulfamethoxazole transformation increased to 43 in 2019 and 36 removal first occurred under oxic conditions after the ea compartment barbieri et al 2012 addressed the complex effects of denitrifying conditions on diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole which resulted in their retransformation towards the end of batch experiments 4 conclusion this study investigated the potential of pdms gas liquid membrane contactors for in situ oxygen delivery into the smartplus bioreactor and the effects of additional oxygen supply on torc biotransformation mass transfer coefficients and bubble formation were investigated for the pdms membrane at lab scale with tertiary effluent based on which the self tailored membrane contactors were constructed and established at pilot scale results from lab and pilot scale applications confirm our hypothesis that bubble free delivery of oxygen into the smartplus bioreactor can be achieved under laminar flow conditions and short contact times by diffusive transport through gas liquid membrane contactors the pilot scale gas liquid membrane contactors were designed based on the borehole dilution theory in a staggered configuration and were capable of providing the modeled oxygen transfer in the smartplus bioreactor the do concentrations were successfully elevated to 1 mg l downstream of the ea compartment however due to the temporarily poor secondary effluent quality of the garching wwtp nh4 n up to 5 9 mg l and despite the in line dosing of h2o2 into the pre treatment to reduce incoming ammonium concentrations 2 mg l steady oxic conditions could not be achieved high nutrient content in the feed water caused anoxic conditions before the ea compartment but also resulted in substantial variation of oxygen demand after the membrane contactors as a result suboxic conditions prevailed towards the end of the bioreactor increased disturbances of hydraulic conditions during in situ oxygen delivery in comparison to the baseline operation karakurt fischer et al 2020 might also have contributed to higher fluctuations of do concentrations within the ea compartment these findings underline the importance of reliable upstream wastewater treatment for water reuse applications in particular regarding full nitrification prior to advanced water treatment with smart technologies furthermore an appropriate online monitoring and control system for customized oxygen delivery could improve the robustness of the smartplus bioreactor and provide stable oxic conditions 1 mg l without introducing excess oxygen the transformation of torcs in the bioreactor was compound specific removal of some compounds 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole and citalopram was enhanced significantly by in situ oxygen supply resulting in 20 50 increase in removal capacity for persistent compounds like carbamazepine tramadol and venlafaxine a reliable removal requires additional barriers e g in situ ozonation other reactive barriers within the bioreactor and or a suitable post treatment to provide a high product water quality for other compounds which were effectively degraded in previous experiments under smart conditions climbazole metoprolol diclofenac and benzotriazole no enhanced removal was observed further improvement in the removal of 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole citalopram diclofenac benzotriazole and metoprolol can be expected if steady feed water quality can be guaranteed to provide stable oxic and oligotrophic conditions for a longer period additionally if oxic conditions are maintained the removal of metoprolol climbazole tramadol and venlafaxine may benefit from higher hrts 1 5 days in a field scale application of the smartplus bioreactor declaration

17830,by applying favorable oxic and oligotrophic conditions through subsequent aeration and an additional infiltration step the sequential managed aquifer recharge technology smart was proven to better remove trace organic chemicals torcs than conventional mar systems to minimize the physical footprint pumping costs and hydraulic retention times as well as to overcome limitations of site specific heterogeneities of such systems the smart concept was further upgraded by two main engineered technologies this smartplus bioreactor is comprised of an infiltration trench and highly homogenous porous media to provide high infiltration rates and plug flow conditions additionally an in situ oxygen delivery device in particular a self designed pdms gas liquid membrane contactor was designed to establish favorable subsurface oxic conditions this novel smartplus technology was investigated at pilot scale and is designed for advanced water treatment either in the context of water reuse or treatment of impaired surface water to determine the design specifications and to construct a pilot scale membrane contactor the mass transfer coefficients of the pdms membrane were investigated at lab scale for varying reynold numbers 0 2 2 with the help of the customized membrane contactor homogenous bubble free and passive oxygen delivery could be successfully demonstrated at pilot scale under laminar flow conditions and short contact times oxygen concentrations downstream of the membrane contactors met the design specifications 1 mg l as long as the required feed water quality was provided however high nh4 concentrations in the secondary effluent resulted in higher and unsteady oxygen demand than the target oxygen transfer rates could meet and suboxic conditions prevailed although a 20 50 enhancement in the removal of certain compounds 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole and citalopram was achieved demonstration of the full potential of enhanced torc removal by smartplus was hindered due to unsteady feed water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bubble less in situ oxygen delivery gas liquid membrane contactors managed aquifer recharge indirect potable reuse biofiltration trace organic chemicals 1 introduction the united nations have identified water as the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change un water 2020 to increase water availability and improve surface water quality the importance of innovations in advanced water treatment technologies has risen combinations of advanced oxidation adsorption and membrane filtration processes have proven to effectively remove chemical and microbial contaminants from wwtp effluents eggen et al 2014 rizzo et al 2020 however the potential of low energy nature based attenuation processes that do not produce residues or require the addition of chemicals have not been extensively studied for advanced water treatment many studies have focused on the attenuation of trace organic chemicals torcs in natural treatment systems such as bank filtration or managed aquifer recharge mar applications grünheid et al 2005 hamann et al 2016 hoppe jones et al 2010 2012 onesios et al 2009 onesios and bouwer 2012 enhanced biotransformation of some torcs was found to be dependent on the composition and the concentration range of the primary substrate due to co metabolism li et al 2012 2013 2014 rauch williams et al 2010 the prevalence of stable oxic conditions dissolved oxygen concentrations 1 mg l was identified as the key factor for the biotransformation of many torcs hellauer et al 2018b regnery et al 2015a schmidt et al 2017 based on those findings a sequential managed aquifer recharge technology smart for enhanced torc removal from impaired water sources was developed the smart concept improved the removal performance of conventional mar techniques where water is infiltrated into the subsurface through three distinct steps first infiltrated water is extracted from the subsurface after which it is aerated ex situ and then subsequently re infiltrated under favorable oxic and oligotrophic conditions regnery et al 2016 however some limitations such as the unpredictable effluent water quality due to subsurface heterogeneity regnery et al 2017 clogging problems associated with fe and mn precipitation high physical footprint due to the usage of two infiltration units increased costs caused by additional pumping and secondary contamination in the open infiltration basins have hindered the broad application and the technology transfer of conventional mar and smart systems consequently the smartplus concept combining all three aforementioned steps into one bioreactor was developed which is designed as an advanced water treatment technology for ipr applications the smartplus bioreactor in comparison to conventional mar systems has a smaller physical footprint reduced operational costs and avoids disturbances in the flow conditions the controlled hydraulic conditions within the smartplus bioreactor was successfully established by combining high rate infiltration trench technology and a horizontal biofiltration system filled with highly uniform porous media karakurt fischer et al 2020 compared to conventional bank filtration systems with a minimum hrt requirement of 50 days smartplus demonstrated similar torc removals with an hrt of 13 h during baseline operation i e without intermediate aeration karakurt fischer et al 2020 to enhance torc biotransformation smartplus is designed to achieve oxic redox conditions via in situ dissolved oxygen do delivery into the porous media of the bioreactor due to fluctuations in the feed water quality of the smartplus bioreactor during continuous operation with tertiary effluent an adjustable oxygen delivery device is essential to achieve steady state torc transformation for this purpose approaches from groundwater bioremediation or membrane aerated bioreactors mabr were initially considered previous studies have used active or passive oxygen delivery methods to facilitate microbial degradation of organic contaminants in water as biodegradation is the main removal mechanism for torcs barcelona and xie 2001 casey et al 1999 haugen et al 2002 syron and casey 2008 wilson and mackay 2002 however active gas sparging into porous media would result in decreased hydraulic conductivity and air binding as the gas would be trapped in otherwise saturated media the other active method direct injection of liquid through needles displaces the contaminated water resulting in non uniform oxygen introduction fry et al 1997 wilson and mackay 2002 passive delivery of electron acceptors via different types of gas liquid membrane contactors or oxygen releasing compounds orcs such as cao2 or mgo2 may allow uniform distribution and provide bubble less steady sources of oxygen over the long term ahmed et al 2004 barcelona and xie 2001 fang et al 2002 li et al 2010 to avoid immediate dissolution of the compound orcs are impregnated with high ph cement which also affects the activities of microorganisms due to the ph increase of the water obiri nyarko et al 2014 furthermore as the dissolution rate of oxygen is not synchronized with the demand bubble formation can still take place due to the passive nature of orcs a gas liquid membrane contactor is a system which provides a well defined and tailored interface for diffusive transfer without direct mixing or dispensing of one phase into another gabelman and hwang 1999 for this reason controllable gas liquid membrane contactors were deemed promising for the smartplus bioreactor since the smartplus bioreactor flow characteristics reactor configuration packed porous media and bubble less oxygen transfer requirement are different from soil passages in groundwater remediation and mabr this study focused on the feasibility of gas liquid membrane contactors for reliable delivery of electron acceptors into the tertiary effluent under laminar flow conditions and short contact times bubble less gas delivery can be achieved via dense or microporous gas permeable membranes the pores of microporous membranes act as the contact area between the gas and liquid phases whereas in dense membranes the gas is absorbed into the membrane facilitating diffusive gas transfer from one bulk phase to another through the membrane al saffar et al 1997 côté et al 1988 on one hand to avoid gas bubble formation on the surface of microporous membranes the gas pressure should be lower than the bubble point of the membrane which depends on the pore size surface tension of the liquid hydrophobicity and the resulting contact angle of the liquid at the membrane bazhenov et al 2018 due to non uniform pore sizes gas bubbles might still appear under very low gas pressures in the ranges of 0 1 0 2 bar although the theoretical bubble point calculated by nominal pore size is not reached ahmed and semmens 1992 a high gas pressure can be only applied if the liquid side is also uniformly pressurized so that the transmembrane pressure does not exceed the bubble point at any point of the membrane on the other hand to avoid membrane pore wetting the liquid side pressure should be less than the breakthrough pressure al saffar et al 1997 however pore wetting may still take place in porous membranes over time during continuous operation regardless of hydrophobicity which causes high mass transfer resistances and fouling al saffar et al 1997 furthermore in presence of low surfactant concentrations reduction in surface tension may occur leading to reduction in liquid breakthrough pressure gabelman and hwang 1999 although microporous membranes may exhibit more favorable mass transfer characteristics particularly at higher liquid velocities gas liquid contactors made from dense membranes provide a better process stability and were considered to be more suitable for the smartplus bioreactor the total mass transfer coefficient can be expressed by the gas side the membrane and the liquid side mass transfer coefficients for both dense and microporous membranes the gas film resistance can be neglected if the gas velocity is considered to be much higher than the liquid velocity in the smartplus bioreactor the hydraulics are governed by laminar flow conditions with a liquid velocity of 1 55 10 4 m s and a rather low reynolds number 0 5 the liquid film resistance is very sensitive to the hydraulic conditions decreasing from 78 5 to 45 5 of the total resistance when the reynolds number increases from 0 6 to 49 côté et al 1989 in addition to liquid film resistance membrane resistance which depends on membrane thickness gas selectivity and diffusivity and thus permeability needs to be considered for dense membranes however if highly oxygen permeable membranes such as silicone rubber polydimethylsiloxane pdms charati and stern 1998 with a thin membrane wall are applied the remaining liquid side resistance would still govern the mass transfer under laminar flow conditions côté et al 1989 in addition to their high oxygen permeability silicone membranes are particularly stable during long term operation another mass transfer resistance to consider is the development of biofilms on the membrane surface if membranes are delivering oxygen into water in the presence of biodegradable organic substance such as tertiary effluent essila et al 2000 although a seemingly negative attribute the membrane fibers could support biofilm growth and attachment potentially decreasing bubble formation due to simultaneous oxygen degradation essila et al 2000 we hypothesize that bubble free delivery of oxygen into the smartplus bioreactor can be achieved under laminar flow conditions and short contact times by diffusive transport through gas liquid membrane contactors this will no longer require an external aeration step and therefore reduce the physical footprint of the smart concept while improving torc attenuation during continuous operation of the smartplus bioreactor in this paper we describe the design and application of a promising passive oxygen delivery system and its effects on the redox zonation and torc attenuation at pilot scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the smartplus pilot plant secondary treated municipal wastewater from the garching wastewater treatment plant wwtp 31 000 pe was used as feed water for the smartplus pilot plant tertiary treatment by a polypropylene filter cartridge 100 μm 20 putsch gmbh and a subsequent rapid sand filter dynasand nordic water gmbh was provided on site the dynasand effluent was stored in a 1800 l buffer tank and was fed continuously to the smartplus bioreactor at a flow rate of 0 3 m3 h fig 1 during the experimental period may october 2019 operational disturbances in the biological treatment of the wwtp resulted in increased ammonium nh4 concentrations in the effluent supplied to the bioreactor thus during elevated nh4 n concentrations 1 5 mg l the dynasand filter was operated with inline h2o2 dosing as an adjacent nitrification step designed for a maximum of 3 mg l nh4 n removal during high nh4 n concentrations in the feed water 4 mg l partial circulation of the bioreactor effluent into fresh incoming tertiary effluent ensured that nh4 n concentrations remained below 4 mg l in the feed water supplied to the smartplus bioreactor the pilot scale smartplus bioreactor was composed of a stainless steel flume 6 m long x 0 9 m wide x 1 4 m high where the first 3 m were sealed with a lid to mimic a confined saturated aquifer a rectangular shaft 0 35 m long x 0 9 m wide x 1 5 m high atop the bioreactor at the inflow side served as an infiltration trench the infiltration trench was filled with gravel d10 3 4 mm for rapid vertical infiltration of feed water followed by horizontal plug flow conditions in the rest of the bioreactor the compartments before and after the electron acceptor ea compartment were filled with uniform technical sand uniformity coefficient 1 3 d10 0 75 mm to maintain the plug flow conditions which is essential for establishing controlled sequential redox conditions during subsequent travel through the saturated zone the ea compartment detailed information in chapter 2 3 and the outflow compartments were filled with gravel d10 2 1 and 3 4 mm respectively twenty four water sampling ports at different heights and depths along the length of the bioreactor and three filter media sampling ports for the sealed area were installed dissolved oxygen do sensors dp pst6 presens gmbh germany were deployed in 6 pvc infiltration wells along the bioreactor and continuously logged data every 10 min more detailed information on the design and operation of the smartplus bioreactor including the hydraulic characterization prior to the commissioning of the in situ oxygen delivery device have been published in karakurt fischer et al 2020 2 2 performance characterization of the gas liquid membrane contactor 2 2 1 design and operation of a gas liquid membrane contactor at lab scale a lab scale flow through setup was constructed to investigate bubble formation and determine mass transfer coefficients fig 2 the initial setup to test bubble formation in tap water and tertiary effluent consisted of a bottom up flow through acrylic glass column 30 cm in length 14 cm in diameter in which the membrane was fixed approximately 10 cm above the bottom experiments to determine mass transfer coefficients corresponding to flow velocities in smartplus table 1 were carried out with tap water in a stainless steel column 30 cm in length 15 cm in diameter membrane fixed 18 cm from the bottom pdms membranes of 2 m length and an inner outer diameter of 1 98 3 18 mm dow silastic cole parmer gmbh were woven onto a metal grid the pdms membrane material is well characterized by berry et al 2017 to model oxygen and ozone mass transfer technical grade pressurized oxygen 99 9 o2 air liquide deutschland gmbh with a feed pressure of 0 1 bar and a constant gas flow rate at 0 1 l min was used in all experiments to mimic the redox conditions at the entrance of the ea compartment of smartplus bioreactor the feed water was sparged with nitrogen gas for 10 15 min to adjust do concentrations to below 1 5 mg l the feed water was then pumped through the experimental setup with a rotary pump except for the lowest velocity 4 72 10 5 m s for which a peristaltic pump was used instead do concentrations were continuously monitored using flow through sensors dp pst6 presens gmbh in the column influent and effluent until equilibrium was reached after approximately two hydraulic retention times the equilibrium concentration was recorded every 10 s for additional 5 min and averaged to calculate cl out the water temperature 17 9 19 6 c was measured at the outlet immediately after each experiment and was similar to water temperatures observed in the smartplus bioreactor during the experimental period 17 2 22 0 c 2 2 2 determination of mass transfer coefficients in cross flow the flux of gas across a membrane can be described as 1 j k δ c with mass transfer coefficient k and the characteristic concentration difference δc which has been characterized as the difference between saturation concentration at the gas phase inlet csat in and the equilibrium concentration in the bulk liquid cl ahmed and semmens 1992 fang et al 2002 however to include the pressure drop along the membrane contact area δc becomes 2 δ c c s a t i n c s a t o u t ln c s a t i n c l a v c s a t o u t c l a v where a logarithmic average is built over the total membrane length with csat in and the

is taken as the bulk liquid concentration which has been proposed for slow flow velocities fang et al 2002 the overall mass transfer coefficient k is typically expressed using the resistance in series model 3 1 k 1 k g 1 k m 1 k l with local resistances in gas phase kg membrane material km and liquid phase kl the resistance at the boundary between a wall and a fluid depends on the fluid velocity and the gas exchange geometry wickramasinghe et al 1992 yang and cussler 1986 the higher the fluid velocity the thinner the liquid or gaseous boundary layer and the lower the resistance respectively as the gas velocity in the investigated system is much higher than the liquid velocities kg was neglected in the resistance term km can be derived from the permeability of oxygen pm in pdms henry s law constant h and the wall thickness τ casey et al 1999 as 4 k m p m h τ the liquid side resistance kl depends on the flow velocity and can be described by numerous dimensionless correlations

and diffusivity d the dimensionless correlations were determined with porous membranes which were assumed to have a minor membrane resistance thus can be used as approximation for kl examples and further references can be found in gabelman and hwang 1999 for the modeled mass transfer coefficients equations 4 and 5 were solved for km and kl all physical parameters such as the kinematic viscosity of water and the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in water were adjusted to the given experimental conditions the calculated km and kl values were used to obtain the overall k value in case of kl several empirical correlations which were determined in a cross flow design with porous hollow fibers were tested the selected correlation that fits best sh 1 38 re0 34 sc0 33 was set up by yang

applying henry s law to solve equation 6 for k including a temperature correction sander 2015 and ideal gas law 2 3 design of the electron acceptor compartment equipped with gas liquid membrane contactors the ea compartment was initially filled with gravel from a tertiary sand filter of the wwtp munich gut marienhof to facilitate biofilm growth in the system this gravel was then partially removed to install the contactor assembly for the in situ oxygen delivery the contactor assembly was composed of perforated pvc infiltration wells gwe pumpenboese gmbh inner diameter 50 mm slot width 0 3 mm in which the gas liquid membrane contactors were submerged fig 3 the perforated wells acted as a physical barrier between the gravel and membrane conductors for easy installation and maintenance the configuration of the infiltration wells is based on the borehole dilution theory stating that the natural lateral hydraulic capture width of an unpumped well with an inner diameter of di amounts to twice of its diameter 2 di wilson et al 1997 this resulted in the installation of 9 infiltration wells in a row according to the width of smartplus bioreactor 895 mm fig 3 left to guarantee the homogenous and sufficient oxygen distribution at the cross section an additional 8 infiltration wells were placed in a second row in a staggered arrangement as the smartplus bioreactor has a trapezoidal bottom each infiltration well was trimmed depending on its position within the compartment to an appropriate length and tightly sealed with a pvc disk the 17 wells were fixed horizontally by a cover plate on top and vertically by a support plate in the middle via fixing strips the gravel used to fill the void volume between the infiltration wells additionally secured the position of the wells after their installation the exact locations and the length of the infiltration wells can be found in the supporting information si fig 1 the total membrane areas amem required for 17 membrane contactors were calculated based on the oxygen transfer rate or necessary to maintain a stable oxygen concentration downstream of the ea compartment this assumes mixing over the compartment length in accordance with the borehole dilution theory or is expressed as 8 o r k δ c a mem and is solved for the required membrane area amem to achieve the desired oxygen concentrations after the ea compartment the membrane contactors were composed of a metallic cross structure to hold the membranes in place tubing for the oxygen distribution pun h 6x1 bl 6 4 mm festo ag co kg two plastic fittings to connect the oxygen distribution tubing to the membrane fiber reducer 4 mm 1 6 mm rotilabo and two ball valves to regulate inflow and outflow qh qs 6 festo ag co kg the metallic cross structures were constructed from two individual metallic sheets 1 mm thickness mevaco gmbh with a width of 30 mm and a length of 1100 1250 mm depending on the length of the infiltration well the sheets had a porous structure pore diameter 4 mm through which the silicon membrane was threaded in a double spiral fashion fig 3 the tubing for the oxygen distribution was attached to the metallic cross structure but had no contact to the membrane surface and the contactors were fed with oxygen bottom up the oxygen transfer rate can be attuned by a pressure regulation gauge the outlet gas pressure was monitored with a manometer to detect any gas leakages 2 4 sampling and analytical methods in addition to online monitoring of do water pressure temperature and conductivity samples for ammonia nitrate dissolved organic carbon doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and torcs were taken from the feed water the infiltration trench 0 4 m at x direction from the sampling ports before 1 64 m and after 2 64 m the ea compartment and from the effluent 5 85 m of the smartplus bioreactor samples were analyzed according to methods described in karakurt fischer et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigating the feasibility of gas liquid membrane contactors for in situ oxygen delivery into the smartplus bioreactor to design the pilot scale membrane contactors the mass transfer coefficients of the pdms membranes had to be determined experimental mass transfer coefficients determined at lab scale for the flow conditions specified in table 1 varied between 2 01 10 6 and 6 42 10 6 m s and agreed well with the model fig 4 left finding a suitable correlation through experimental verification allows the estimation of the flux across the membranes in relation to membrane geometry partial oxygen pressure and flow velocity although the membrane geometry used in the lab scale experiments was different from the wounded modules which would be placed into the pilot scale smartplus bioreactor the boundary layer in different types of cross flow designs has been shown to be similar wickramasinghe et al 1992 the dependence on the liquid side velocity is visible from the positive response of mass transfer coefficients to rising liquid velocities the k value increases by 131 from 2 01 10 6 to 4 65 10 6 m s when the flow velocity is increased from 4 72 10 5 to 1 55 10 4 m s which corresponds to applying a flow rate of 0 1 0 3 m3 h in the smartplus bioreactor by changing the partial pressure of oxygen while other parameters such as temperature and membrane surface remain constant the oxygen transfer can be adjusted to different hydraulic conditions to quantify the impact of the membrane wall and the liquid side velocity the shares of modeled liquid and membrane resistances were compared fig 4 right the liquid side resistance held between approximately 85 and 75 of the total resistance similar to the results of côté et al 1989 for laminar flow regimes the discussed advantage of having a minor membrane resistance if using porous membranes thus is of minor importance for this application additionally the share of the membrane resistance can be decreased by selecting a thinner membrane wall which is a trade off between mechanical stability and higher mass transfer coefficients moreover the higher mass transfer resistance in dense membranes due to additional membrane resistance can be compensated by increasing the driving force therefore the concentration difference by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen however microbubbles on the surface of the fibers can be observed under high oxygen partial pressures which grow while attached to the membrane surface and detach once a critical size is reached for this reason a driving force increase should be matched by a decrease in liquid film resistance to avoid exceeding saturation and to avoid degassing at the membrane wall côté et al 1989 due to the high dependence on the liquid side resistance bubble formation was observed at 1 55 10 4 m s flow velocity retheo 0 50 at pressure ranges between 0 2 and 0 8 bars of o2 partial pressure during the experiments with tap water after 4 days of operation with the tertiary effluent the bubble formation ceased this was explained by the increased oxygen demand and biofilm formation induced changes to the membrane surface also shown for mabr applications essila et al 2000 due to the absence of bubbles and suitable mass transfer coefficients the gas liquid pdms membrane contactor was deemed suitable for the in situ oxygen delivery into the smartplus bioreactor 3 2 development and implementation of pilot scale gas liquid membrane contactors when assuming fully nitrified and oligotrophic water quality bdoc 1 mg l before the ea compartment less than 2 7 mg l oxygen demand 2 7 mg do mg doc rivett et al 2008 after the ea compartment was expected to meet this oxygen demand maintain oxic conditions 1 mg l in the effluent of smartplus bioreactor and not to consume oxygen excessively a do concentration of 3 4 mg l was targeted for the ea compartment and adjusted according to the fluctuating feed water quality accordingly a total membrane area of 1 54 m2 and a fiber length of 11 39 m for each membrane contactor were calculated using equation 8 based on the modeled mass transfer coefficient of 4 35 10 6 m s at 0 3 m3 h 1 55 10 4 m s this membrane size would provide a do concentration of 3 0 mg l with 0 8 bar o2 partial pressure after the ea compartment without considering oxygen depletion by aerobic biotransformation table 2 if the oxygen pressure would be increased to 1 bar the do concentration would increase to 4 1 mg l to minimize the required membrane length for the silicone tubing contactor and or achieve higher do concentrations oxygen partial pressure in the contactor can be increased from 0 8 bar to 2 5 bar during the experiments gas leakages were observed at 2 5 bar due to a membrane adaptor disconnection however in the pilot scale application calculations showed that 100 oxygen saturation 9 3 mg l at 19 c and 1 atm could be achieved downstream of the ea compartment already with 2 3 bar partial pressure in the membrane module assuming perfect mixing of oxygen in the compartment therefore the adaptors were not replaced for the pilot scale membrane contactors for higher pressures however a different adaptor for the membrane contactor would be required finally the membrane contactors were designed and constructed with a membrane length of 11 12 m depending on the length of the infiltration well in which they were submerged the membrane contactors were then conditioned by submerging them into a transparent container filled with tertiary effluent for five days to visibly check for any leaks the goal of the conditioning was to enhance the initial biofilm growth prior to installing the membranes into the ea compartment therefore inhibiting initial bubble formation during commissioning in the smartplus bioreactor after the commissioning the modules were operated in closed mode at varying oxygen partial pressures 0 8 1 0 bar and the modules were flushed once a day to remove nitrogen 3 3 validation of pilot scale gas liquid membrane contactors for the establishment of redox zonation under varying feed water quality to trace the spatial oxygen depletion and determine whether the favorable oxic and oligotrophic conditions could be established with the membrane contactors the bioreactor water quality was monitored at six locations samples for do doc nh4 n no3 n concentrations and uva254 values were taken from the secondary effluent in the feed water after the infiltration trench before and after the ea compartment and in the effluent of the smartplus bioreactor table 3 the mean secondary effluent doc concentration during the operation with in situ oxygen delivery september october 2019 8 1 0 9 mg l was less than the concentration measured during baseline operation april september 2018 11 5 3 2 mg l karakurt fischer et al 2020 the discrepancies and the standard deviations portray seasonal and weekly quality fluctuations of the secondary effluent of garching after the pre treatment a doc concentration of 10 2 2 7 mg l in the feed water was achieved which was then further degraded along the bioreactor to 7 5 2 3 mg l during baseline operation karakurt fischer et al 2020 mean feed water do concentration during baseline operation 5 1 2 3 mg l was lower than during operation with in situ oxygen delivery 8 3 0 5 mg l due to high feed water temperatures up to 27 c and higher feed water doc concentrations fig 5 do of 5 1 2 3 mg l in feed water was then rapidly consumed resulting in a mean do concentration of 1 0 1 0 mg l at the end of the infiltration trench thus shifting from oxic to suboxic redox conditions according to the redox definitions by regnery et al 2015b fig 5 left no nitrate reduction 0 5 mg n l and low do concentrations 1 mg l do confirmed mostly suboxic conditions along the remainder of the bioreactor karakurt fischer et al 2020 during operation with the in situ oxygen delivery a feed water doc concentration of 7 9 0 8 mg l was obtained after the pre treatment with dynasand filter similar mean feed water doc concentrations 7 3 1 0 mg l were observed in a pilot scale sequential biofiltration system with intermediate aeration hrt 33 h fed in batch mode with the same secondary effluent as smartplus müller et al 2017 in the second biofilter 4 4 mg l doc persisted in the effluent while do concentrations remained above 2 mg l müller et al 2017 the prevalence of oxic conditions in the biofilter effluent and the hrt of more than 33 h indicate the refractory character of the remaining 4 4 mg l doc in the garching secondary effluent müller et al 2017 eventually 3 1 1 1 mg l of doc was removed in smartplus resulting in 4 8 0 6 mg l doc before the ea compartment the substantial depletion in the uva254 from the feed water after the infiltration trench supports the main removal of bdoc within the first 40 cm of the bioreactor table 3 stable doc concentrations and uva254 values were observed for the remainder of the bioreactor as the changes were not significant after passage through the ea compartment α 0 05 2 sided paired student s t test during the baseline operation in 2018 and the experiments conducted by müller et al 2017 ammonium was not measured in the garching tertiary effluent in 2019 operational disturbances at the wwtp caused effluent nh4 n concentrations to increase up to 5 9 mg l 90th percentile through inline h2o2 dosing in the dynasand filter which was designed for maximum 3 mg l n removal a lower mean nh4 n concentration 1 9 0 6 mg l was achieved in the smartplus feed water table 3 all available oxygen in the feed water 8 3 0 5 mg l was depleted in the infiltration trench due to both nitrification and doc removal table 3 fig 5 right bringing nh4 n concentrations before the ea compartment to 0 015 mg l however due to the synoptic sampling and fluctuating water quality intermittent occurrences of surplus ammonium before the ea compartment cannot be excluded despite the observed nitrification mean nitrate concentration decreased within the infiltration trench indicating that nitrate was also partially used as an electron acceptor for doc removal furthermore the increase of the mean nitrate concentration right after the ea compartment δno3 n 3 4 1 4 mg l indicates that the nitrification was partially incomplete and or some ammonium was still present before the ea compartment overall observed denitrification supported the presence of anoxic conditions before the ea compartment and the oxygen provided by the ea compartment was partially used to complete the nitrification process this additional demand was not considered during the design of the membrane contactors but was tried to be compensated by higher o2 pressures the oxygen demand from nitrification however seems to be variable and could not be quantified when assuming fully nitrified feed prior to the ea compartment oxygen demand can be estimated from the remaining bdoc of 0 4 mg l based on doc concentration of 4 8 mg l before the ea compartment and persistent doc of 4 4 mg l in the effluent of sequential biofilters for this transformation in situ introduction of 2 mg l do would be required to meet the resulting oxygen demand and to establish oxic conditions 1 mg l in the effluent according to the experimental and modeled mass transfer coefficients as well as the design parameters of the pilot scale membrane contactors o2 pressure was adjusted to 0 8 1 bar to establish do concentrations of 3 0 4 1 mg which would meet this theoretical oxygen demand during the entire experimental period however oxygen demand occasionally exceeded 2 mg l due to the fluctuating influent water quality do concentrations in the reactor directly downstream of the ea compartment 2250 mm showed that 80 of measurements were 1 mg l do mean 2 6 mg l 90th percentile 5 3 mg l fig 5 in the effluent of the smartplus bioreactor however half of the measured concentrations were 1 mg l mean 1 4 mg l 90th percentile 4 1 mg l the continuous monitoring with online do measurements interval 10 min n 3525 indicated substantially higher water quality fluctuations than the analysis of synoptic doc ammonium and nitrate samples further depletion of do downstream of the ea compartment mean δdo 1 2 mg l 90th percentile 4 1 mg l was therefore not directly comparable with the steady doc and nh4 n attenuation derived from the synoptic samples moreover the disturbances of the hydraulic conditions before and within the ea compartment during the experimental period in 2019 si fig 2 possibly resulted in poor mixing of do over the length of the ea compartment which was assumed for the validity of the borehole dilution theory and homogenous oxygen concentrations downstream of the ea compartment chapter 2 3 after the ea compartment the arrival of the tracer at the ports and the outflow of the bioreactor corresponded to their hydraulic retention times si fig 2 however the poor mixing within the ea compartment might have still resulted in the occurrence of spatial differences downstream thus higher up to 5 3 mg l 90th percentile and lower do concentrations than the targeted 3 0 4 1 mg l within one cross section for this reason even though oxic conditions were provided do concentrations were presumably not homogenous and the redox conditions were not at steady state overall the bubble less in situ oxygen delivery to smartplus bioreactor via gas liquid membrane contactors has been proven to be successful at pilot scale although the water quality of the tertiary effluent was improved the strong feed water fluctuations in ammonia could not be compensated smaller changes in oxygen demand could be compensated with an automated process control by using monitoring data from the do and uva254 sensors to assess quality changes and oxygen demand thus a reliable source water quality is a prerequisite for advanced wastewater treatment technologies in order to achieve and maintain the targeted treatment efficiencies likewise steady oxic conditions after the ea compartment can only be established if the wastewater effluent quality is stable 3 4 effects of oxygen delivery and varying feed water quality on the attenuation of torcs due to the incomplete nitrification in the wwtp and described variabilities in redox conditions the expected enhanced removal of torcs in the smartplus bioreactor could not be observed however the prevailing redox conditions within the smartplus bioreactor oxic anoxic oxic suboxic still revealed attenuation of 14 torcs and demonstrated the complexity of mechanisms involved in their biotransformation fig 6 the full breakthrough of the sorptive compound benzotriazole in 2019 indicated that biodegradation was the main removal mechanism for torc transformation within the quartz sand porous media as reported in previous studies alidina et al 2014 hellauer et al 2018b müller et al 2017 reemtsma et al 2010 the transformation of most of the torcs in the anoxic zone before the ea compartment decreased from 2018 to 2019 possibly due to the competitive oxygen demand caused by high ammonium concentrations and corresponding nitrifying and denitrifying anoxic conditions nevertheless additional removal was observed after the in situ oxygen delivery resulting in a similar or improved removal capacity of most of the torcs in 2019 in comparison to operation in 2018 without the oxygen delivery fig 6 major transformation of gabapentin 66 occurred in 2018 under the prevalence of both bdoc and oxygen in the infiltration trench of the smartplus bioreactor which is the most biologically active compartment in the system in 2019 93 of gabapentin was removed already within the dynasand filter prior to the smartplus bioreactor where also both high bdoc and do concentrations due to h2o2 dosing prevailed a similar strong correlation between the biotransformation of gabapentin and do consumption bdoc removal and microbial activity was also observed in the sequential biofiltration system operated by müller et al 2019 in contrast higher recalcitrance of gabapentin has been reported in conventional lab and field scale mar applications hellauer et al 2017 2018a onesios and bouwer 2012 although hellauer et al 2018a observed good oxic transformation of gabapentin at field scale under rather oligotrophic conditions atenolol and trimethoprim behaved similar to gabapentin and were attenuated up to 90 and 75 within the infiltration trench characterized by high bdoc concentrations and oxic conditions rapid biodegradation of trimethoprim and atenolol within the first infiltration step of a smart system has also been reported by regnery et al 2016 while no further removal was observed for atenolol trimethoprim removal increased from 75 up to 88 before the ea compartment under anoxic conditions further removal of trimethoprim under anoxic to anaerobic conditions have also been reported by ghattas et al 2017 and falås et al 2016 schmidt et al 2017 examined the attenuation of atenolol under varying redox conditions at lab scale incubation experiments in this study a complete degradation of atenolol was observed both under oxic and anoxic denitrifying conditions similar to the findings of regnery et al 2015b at a groundwater recharge site after the ea compartment an increase in effluent concentrations reduced the total removal capacity of the smartplus bioreactor for both atenolol 59 and trimethoprim 66 this might be explained by soil disturbances and desorbing effects however to the best of our knowledge this effect has not been reported before for these substances a moderate climbazole removal 44 was observed during both experimental periods in previous studies conducted by hellauer et al 2018b muntau et al 2017 and müller et al 2017 good removal of climbazole 85 was noted under longer hydraulic retention times 1 day in comparison to the smartplus bioreactor 13 h regardless of prevailing redox conditions hermes et al 2019 also confirmed the redox insensitivity of climbazole as enhanced degradation was observed both under oxic and suboxic conditions during sequential biofiltration metoprolol removal 42 was improved during the operation in 2019 and 20 of this removal was observed under anoxic conditions better and faster removal of metoprolol has been noted under oxic in comparison to anoxic suboxic conditions in previous studies bertelkamp et al 2016 hellauer et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 müller et al 2019 also reported an improved removal for metoprolol in the sequential biofiltration system when hrts increased from 10 h 42 to 35 h 95 under steady oxic conditions the strict oxic conditions and longer hrts may be required for further removal of metoprolol after the ea compartment in 2019 diclofenac 21 was poorly removed and no biotransformation was observed for benzotriazole 10 these compounds were reported to be very redox sensitive favoring oxic conditions for improved biotransformation with long adaptation periods from 1 5 months to almost a year hellauer et al 2018a 2018b müller et al 2017 rapid depletion of oxygen within the infiltration trench unsteady do concentrations after the ea compartment and shorter experimental period presumably could not provide those conditions high persistence of carbamazepine venlafaxine and tramadol was observed in 2019 similar to the experimental period before the commissioning of the in situ oxygen delivery in 2018 carbamazepine is widely known to exhibit persistent behavior and has been proposed and used as a wastewater indicator due to its limited biological removal and poor sorption in the aquatic environment under varying redox and hydraulic conditions burke et al 2018 hellauer et al 2018a karakurt et al 2019 müller et al 2017 regnery et al 2016 only under strict anaerobic conditions and long hrts 14 days falås et al 2016 showed improved removal of carbamazepine the persistent behaivour of venlafaxine and tramadol supported the previous findings from müller et al 2017 and hermes et al 2019 a steady transformation of tramadol 70 and venlafaxine loq was observed under oligotrophic and oxic conditions with higher hrts 4 6 days by hellauer et al 2018b higher hrts under strict oxic conditions can be applied at field scale for the smartplus bioreactor possibly improving also tramadol and venlafaxine attenuation a positive effect of oxic conditions downstream of the ea compartment was observed for 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole and citalopram resulting in 20 50 increased removal fig 6 compared to 76 overall removal in 2018 only 14 of 4 faa was removed within the infiltration trench in 2019 possibly due to the rapid depletion of oxygen however a significant increase in the removal of 4 faa up to 63 was eventually achieved with do supply downstream of the ea compartment similar rapid biodegradation of 4 faa under oxic conditions was reported also in previous studies in mar systems hellauer et al 2017 2018a massmann et al 2006 for sulfamethoxazole various removals during mar treatment have been reported ranging from poor to moderate removal grünheid et al 2005 sulfamethoxazole biotransformation in a slow sand filter fed with wwtp effluent was found to even be independent of oxygen and easily degradable acetate concentration zhang et al 2019 however other studies demonstrated that removal of sulfamethoxazole is still enhanced under oxic conditions compared to suboxic or anoxic environments regnery et al 2015b 2016 wiese et al 2011 sulfamethoxazole transformation increased to 43 in 2019 and 36 removal first occurred under oxic conditions after the ea compartment barbieri et al 2012 addressed the complex effects of denitrifying conditions on diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole which resulted in their retransformation towards the end of batch experiments 4 conclusion this study investigated the potential of pdms gas liquid membrane contactors for in situ oxygen delivery into the smartplus bioreactor and the effects of additional oxygen supply on torc biotransformation mass transfer coefficients and bubble formation were investigated for the pdms membrane at lab scale with tertiary effluent based on which the self tailored membrane contactors were constructed and established at pilot scale results from lab and pilot scale applications confirm our hypothesis that bubble free delivery of oxygen into the smartplus bioreactor can be achieved under laminar flow conditions and short contact times by diffusive transport through gas liquid membrane contactors the pilot scale gas liquid membrane contactors were designed based on the borehole dilution theory in a staggered configuration and were capable of providing the modeled oxygen transfer in the smartplus bioreactor the do concentrations were successfully elevated to 1 mg l downstream of the ea compartment however due to the temporarily poor secondary effluent quality of the garching wwtp nh4 n up to 5 9 mg l and despite the in line dosing of h2o2 into the pre treatment to reduce incoming ammonium concentrations 2 mg l steady oxic conditions could not be achieved high nutrient content in the feed water caused anoxic conditions before the ea compartment but also resulted in substantial variation of oxygen demand after the membrane contactors as a result suboxic conditions prevailed towards the end of the bioreactor increased disturbances of hydraulic conditions during in situ oxygen delivery in comparison to the baseline operation karakurt fischer et al 2020 might also have contributed to higher fluctuations of do concentrations within the ea compartment these findings underline the importance of reliable upstream wastewater treatment for water reuse applications in particular regarding full nitrification prior to advanced water treatment with smart technologies furthermore an appropriate online monitoring and control system for customized oxygen delivery could improve the robustness of the smartplus bioreactor and provide stable oxic conditions 1 mg l without introducing excess oxygen the transformation of torcs in the bioreactor was compound specific removal of some compounds 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole and citalopram was enhanced significantly by in situ oxygen supply resulting in 20 50 increase in removal capacity for persistent compounds like carbamazepine tramadol and venlafaxine a reliable removal requires additional barriers e g in situ ozonation other reactive barriers within the bioreactor and or a suitable post treatment to provide a high product water quality for other compounds which were effectively degraded in previous experiments under smart conditions climbazole metoprolol diclofenac and benzotriazole no enhanced removal was observed further improvement in the removal of 4 faa antipyrine sulfamethoxazole citalopram diclofenac benzotriazole and metoprolol can be expected if steady feed water quality can be guaranteed to provide stable oxic and oligotrophic conditions for a longer period additionally if oxic conditions are maintained the removal of metoprolol climbazole tramadol and venlafaxine may benefit from higher hrts 1 5 days in a field scale application of the smartplus bioreactor declaration

length 50 cm and gravity corers ebs 442 hubei china were applied to collect enough sediment cores in order to obtain sufficient sand with different sizes in the following step sediment samples were then stored at 4 c and immediately sent back to the laboratory the in situ collected sediment was measured to contain 1 2 0 12 total carbon wt wt after mixing all the in situ collected sediments we sifted the samples through sieves to obtain sand in two different sizes coarse sand 0 9 1 2 mm and fine sand 0 075 0 250 mm based on the classification system proposed by the united states geological survey poppe and eliason 2008 all sand had been pre fired 450 c 4 h and cleaned with distilled water to ensure that no organic matter was present the sand was then placed in columns to create five treatments differing in the spatial distribution of fine and coarse sand coarse column fine column fine coarse column coarse fine column and mix column volume ratio of course sand to fine sand in fine coarse column coarse fine column and mix column is 1 1 since technical replication was not feasible for similar column experiments only one column setup was applied for each treatment similar to

exchange first a biological inoculum was extracted from fresh sediment samples to obtain a uniformly dispersed cell suspension pyrophosphate 5 ml 50 mm was added to in situ collected sediments and incubated at room temperature with soft shaking at 60 rpm for 15 min all inoculum needed to be sifted through 200 mesh before inoculation to the columns to ensure that no granular deposits 0 075 mm were present the sample was then sonicated with ice for 1 min to avoid cell rupture queric et al 2004 to maintain comparable initial biological conditions and to ensure the organic matter content in each column similar to that in the original in situ collected sediments equal amounts of biological inoculum i e 200 ml containing 1 8 0 05 total carbon were added to each column so that the final total carbon in each column was approximately 1 01 0 02 a peristaltic pump was used to supply water to each column and a 5 cm diversion pipe was placed at the top of each column to ensure that each

accordingly the columns were presaturated with no3 free agw and asw for 3 days before the experiments next agw or asw with no3 was injected at a flow rate determined by the permeability of the sediment filled in each column to mimic the reversal of hydraulic gradients in the hz all columns were alternatively eluted with agw and asw from opposite ends of the column the portion of the columns filled with sand was kept in the dark to mimic subsurface conditions by wrapping them with opaque material during the experiment effluent water samples were taken every 2 h for a total of six times per experimental period and pore water samples were obtained from four side sampling ports along the column at 6 5 cm 11 5 cm 16 5 cm and 21 5 cm respectively every 24 h at the end of the experiment columns were sectioned and sampled along the length of the column at 0 3 cm 5 8 cm 10 13 cm 15 18 cm 20 23 cm and 25 28 cm respectively the sectioned columns were defined as number 1 to number 6 from the bottom to the top of the column for example c1 refers to the sectioned sample in the coarse column at 0 3 cm as shown in fig 1 the no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations of sediment were determined after extraction with potassium chloride solution 1 mol l 2 3 physical and chemical water analyses 2 3 1 hydraulic conductivity and advection time flow rate q was measured manually at the outlet of each individual column during the downwelling process hydraulic conductivity k in m s was calculated using darcy s law 1 k q l δ h a where δh is the piezometric head difference set at a constant value of 0 35 0 09 m l is total length of the sediment 0 30 m a is the cross section area 1 96 10 3 m2 and q is measured in m3 d advection time is a measure of the time that takes water to go through the sediment advection time t was calculated using the formula 2 t l a q where ø is the porosity of the sediment 0 4 for the coarse column 0 32 for the fine column 0 34 for the mix column and 0 36 for fine coarse column and coarse fine column specifically the porosity values of each column sample were shown in table s3 perujo et al 2017 2 3 2 chemical water analyses to monitor the subtle changes in water quality in source water physicochemical parameters including ph do and temperature were measured every 24 h using a hach hq30d portable meter hach company loveland colorado usa in the tanks storing asw and agw during the column tests the collected effluent and pore water samples were immediately filtered with 0 22 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane syringe filters no3 no2 and nh4 in water and sediment samples were determined using the cadmium reduction method the diazotization method and the salicylate spectrophotometric method with the corresponding powder set purchased from the hach company 2 4 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis dna was extracted from a total of 2 g of sediments collected at different depths in all columns and was extracted from each homogenized sample using the e z n a soil dnakit omega bio tek norcross ga usa following the manufacturer s instructions after dna extraction the dna products were combined mixed and stored at 80 c before further analysis proteinase k was used to digest contaminated proteins that might otherwise degrade the dna products the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16 s rrna were amplified with the universal bacterial primers set 341 f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806 r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 pcr amplification and illumina miseq sequencing were performed at shanghai biozeron co ltd shanghai china the conditions for pcr were as follows 95 c for 5 min to denature dna with 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s with a final extension of 10 min at 72 c after quality testing using qiime 1 7 0 software the sequences were cropped and compared using silva128 reference comparison database marti and luis balcazar 2014 the 16 s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity truncated values representative sequences were defined with a commonly applied sequence and used for phylogenetic analyses the targeted genes for absolute qpcr analysis included five nitrogen transformation functional genes amoa aoa and amoa aob for nitrification nirk and nirs for denitrification and nrfa for dnra the potential of nitrogen turnover was obtained by directly comparing the concentration of the functional genes between different samples the specific analysis of absolute fluorescence quantitative pcr was embodied in si the functional genes primer sequences and qpcr procedures are provided in table s4 each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the results were used for error analysis 2 5 ecology process and co occurring network and partial least squares path modeling pls pm analyses we conducted ecological process analyses to clarify the importance of particle size in altering the community assembly ecological process analyses were carried out in r v3 5 3 http cran r project org the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd was applied to calculate the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between bacterial communities the abundance of weighted βmntd was calculated by comdistnt function in picante package stegen et al 2013 in order to evaluate the possibility of relative equilibrium transfer between stochastic and deterministic ecological processes randomizations were used to generate a null distribution 999 randomization for each βmntd estimate βmntd is pairwise distance metric and each pairwise of communities generates a null βmntd distribution the difference between the mean of the βmntd and the null distribution was measured by βnti according to stegen s community assembly method using the r language stegen et al 2013 specifically the percentage of pairwise βnti values indicated that observed turnover between pairwise communities was governed by variable selection βnti 2 and homogeneous selection βnti 2 if communities were as different as expected by random chance βnti 2 stochastic processes dictated community structure these stochastic processes could be further distinguished as dispersal limitation greater than expected turnover rcbray 0 95 homogenizing dispersal less than expected turnover rcbray 0 95 and undominated ecological processes unclear moderate rate of dispersal and weak selection strength rcbray 0 95 saup et al 2019 we were able to identify whether deterministic homogenizing variable or stochastic homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation processes dominate by combining these metrics stegen et al 2013 co occurrence network was conducted to exhibit distinct microbial community structures in coarse mix and fine columns which could capture the underlying causal interaction structure by their accuracy for mapping interactions berry and widder 2014 the co occurring networks of the microbial communities were determined by spearman s correlation analysis specifically spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ between all 97 cutoff otus occurred in at least 25 of the samples and at least 30 counts were calculated pairwise in each cluster using the in house r scripts subsequently significant p 0 001 and robust ρ 0 8 correlations between otus were selected we used gephi http gephi github io for network visualization and modular analyses the topological properties of the networks were calculated using gephi including average degree betweenness centrality modularity and average path length we examined the relationships between sediment porosity do and nutrient concentration in sediments microbial communities and functional genes associated with n transformation using partial least squares path modeling pls pm in the r package plspm seven latent variables were used porosity vertical concentrations of do nutrients no3 n no2 n and nh4 n contents in sediments taxonomic communities the first axis of pcoa and functional groups the first axis of pcoa all of the above analyses were performed in r r version 3 5 3 2 6 data treatment and statistical analysis the α diversity indices otu richness shannon and simpson were calculated using the vegan package in r 3 4 3 nutrient balance and do balance were calculated based on the difference between the column outlet and the inlet tank nutrient balance was divided by advection time to calculate the production consumption rates for ammonium nitrates and do rate table 2 to distinguish the effects of different columns on the nitrogen conversion process do balance was defined as the oxygen balance at the outlet and inlet of the downwelling flow process while nutrient balance was the balance of nutrients at the outlet and inlet of the upwelling flow process for these parameters differences between columns were analyzed with two factors anova factor day and column the further tukey s post hoc tests were performed when significant differences were detected differences between columns at each depth were further analyzed perujo et al 2017 to integrate physicochemical and biological data along the column a redundancy analysis rda was performed by vegan package in r using one matrix with otu data for a bacterial genus fitted with another matrix containing physicochemical parameters nutrient and porosity values measured at different depths in each column on the last day of the experiment anosim analysis was performed by vegan package in r to detect differences in parameters between treatments we generated non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots to visualize and determine the effect of sediment grain size on bacterial community composition using the functions decostand and adonis in the r library vegan multivariate regression tree mrt analysis is a constrained clustering approach that uses the mvpart package with default parameters to correlate the relative abundance of the lineages to the characteristics of the site taxa that were significantly discriminable in each group were determined based on a linear discriminant analysis lda effect size pipeline lefse program at http huttenhowersph harvard edu galaxy which employs the factorial kruskal wallis rank sum test α 0 05 to identify taxa with significantly different relative abundances among different columns segata et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic conductivity and oxygen conditions in hz with different grain sizes the hydraulic connectivity and the ability of each column to pass water were significantly different flow measured at the start of the experiment was 991 16 9 11 717 05 12 53 541 01 11 07 407 99 15 56 and 320 35 9 86 ml d in the coarse coarse fine fine coarse mix and fine columns respectively hydraulic conductivity decreased with time fig s2 previous studies have demonstrated that microbial growth and adhesion occupied the sediment pores thereby causing biological blockage and reducing the exchange flux perujo et al 2017 scheidweiler et al 2019 during the last period of the experiment the highest k values were measured in treatments with coarse sand in the upper layers coarse and coarse fine treatments table 1 as expected hydraulic conductivity was highest in the coarse column while the presence of fine sediments in the other columns resulted in lower conductivity values baveye et al 1998 pavelic et al 2011 all columns showed a negative oxygen balance indicating that oxygen was consumed during downwelling table 2 meanwhile a highest do concentration was detected in the effluent from the coarse column fig s4 the oxygen consumption rate in the coarse column was 6 52 μg o2 l s whereas the oxygen consumption rate in the fine column was only 1 53 μg o2 l s absolute do values showed a significant decrease in depth in all columns p 0 01 table 1 the coarse column also had the shortest advection time meaning that water passed faster through the sediment fine coarse and fine columns showed the longest advection times indicating that water took longer to pass through the sediment table 2 sediment grain size affects hydraulic connectivity and hyporheic exchange flux regulating the supply of nutrients for microbial activities hz sediment porosity affects solute transport dynamics in the hz and alters the degree to which biogenic substances are utilized markedly affecting do transport do is energetically the most favorable electron acceptor and strongly influences the succession of biogeochemical processes within the hz baker et al 2000 denitrification might not have taken place in each column during downwelling as the do concentrations were not low enough alternatively the do gradient might have been caused by the decrease in k at the end of the experiment 3 2 nitrogen transformation in the hz with different grain sizes in the coarse mix and fine columns asw and agw were switched every 4 4 2 0 and 1 8 pore volumes pv from opposite ends of the column i e the effluent side became the inlet side during the switch and vice versa fig 1 and fig s3 middle data panels no3 no2 and nh4 were detected in the effluents of all columns fig 1 and fig s3 left data panels higher no3 concentrations were observed in agw effluents than in asw effluents in each column since no3 was much higher in agw 0 44 mm than in asw 0 044 mm the effluent no3 after drainage was higher during agw injection period than during asw injection period n nh4 balance primarily consisted of positive values indicating nh4 production table 2 the production of nh4 could be ascribed to the oxidation of exchangeable nh4 in sediments during asw drainage and the dnra process when agw passed through the column liu et al 2017 differences in nitrogen concentrations were also observed among columns the left hand data panels in fig 1a shows higher effluent no3 concentrations from coarse column than from mix and fine column nonetheless considering the higher flow rate of 1 26 m d 1 compared to 0 52 m d 1 and 0 51 m d 1 in mix and fine columns the fastest no3 consumption rate occurred in the course column up to 0 116 μg n l s while the nitrate consumption rates were 0 058 μg n l s and 0 059 μg n l s respectively in mix and fine columns shown in table 2 the higher potential process rates were found related to higher flow rates perujo et al 2017 in contrast to no3 the fastest nh4 production rate occurred in the fine column 2 4 μg n l s while the rate was 1 37 μg n l s in the coarse column the higher retention time in fine column resulted in the longer periods of oxic condition during asw drainage and anaerobic condition during agw drainage facilitating the oxidation of exchangeable nh4 and dnra process respectively soluble no3 and no2 and exchangeable sediment nh4 were quantified after the experiments were finished the contents of soluble no2 were rather low in columns 0 2 μm 2 μm and no significant variation was detected among treatments in soluble no3 in the right hand panels in fig 1 and fig s3 the content of exchangeable nh4 in the coarse and fine columns was similar which was higher than in mix coarse fine and fine coarse columns p 0 01 the reasons for these variations were not evident nh4 accumulation in the middle of each column stemmed from the hysteresis coupling effect of cation exchange accumulation and nh4 oxidation loss caused by the periodic reversal in the flow direction liu et al 2017 fig 1 indicates that water flow direction source and their periodic exchanges have a profound impact on the pathways and rates of nitrogen transformation in hyporheic sediments 3 3 microbial community dynamics in response to hydraulic properties overall 57 bacterial phyla were detected in 32 samples including 30 column sediment samples one in situ sediment sample and one biological inoculum sample fig s5 the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria accounting for 58 72 of the total number of bacterial sequences fig 2 illustrates a more pronounced community zonation at the genus level at different depths along each column fig 2 as expected samples from the five columns differed significantly in bacterial community structure at the genus level especially for the coarse mix and fine columns in sediments derived from the coarse column and mix column the genus sulfurifustis 5 66 in coarse column and 5 84 in mix column was relatively abundant whereas the aquabacterium served as the most abundant genus 5 94 in the fine column table s5 shows that the bacterial species richness is higher in the fine column relative to the coarse column table s5 lefse analysis was conducted to reveal the composition of the microbial community and differences among the coarse mix and fine columns as shown in fig 3 a threshold of 3 0 was chosen for the logarithmic lda scores fig s6 gammaproteobacteria cytophagia alphaproteobacteria and bacilli were defined as the main microbial taxa enriched in the coarse column at the class level in the mix column characteristic strains at the class level included clostridia nitrospira and betaproteobacteria while in the fine column enrichment of betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were observed fig 3 shows clear enrichment of cytophagaceae and bacillaceae in coarse column which might be actively involved in nitrite oxidation in the second step of nitrification paungfoo et al 2007 preena et al 2017 wang et al 2012 comamonadaceae and lysobacterwhich showed characteristic presence in fine column which had been confirmed possessing strong denitrification potential ding et al 2019 sotres et al 2016 in addition the strain of comamonadaceae can concurrently show nitrification and denitrification capacity khan et al 2002 nmds analysis was performed to explore the distributional patterns of the microbial community in the coarse mix and fine columns and revealed three distinct clusters fig 4 a environmental factors were added to the nmds to assess which factors might contribute to this distributional pattern a clear distinction between samples collected near the inlet of agw injection and all other samples was observed in the rda plots among the top 10 microorganisms at the genus level fig 4b and of n transformation functional genes fig 4c from the coarse mix and fine columns do and porosity were the two main factors contributing to differences in the structure of the microbial community therefore we hypothesized that different sized sediments in different columns conferred different hydraulic properties changing the structure of the microbial community and thereby leading to different nitrogen conversion processes anosim testing was conducted to test for differences between the microbial communities of the three columns in fig 4 the microbial community in the fine column was significantly different from that in the mix column r 0 567 p 0 05 and the coarse column r 0 603 p 0 05 however no significant differences were found between the microbial communities in the coarse and the mix column r 0 459 p 0 125 rda was performed using these significant environmental factors do had the strongest effect on microbial community composition in all samples followed by porosity and no3 fig 4a and b mrt analysis was used to corroborate the results of the nmds analysis fig 4d shows that the mrt constructed from the data of the microbial community exhibited three splits and four levels the 18 samples were clustered into two groups by porosity and the group with porosity less than 0 3872 was split by do into pore water samples with do less than 0 705 mg l were then distinguished by no3 concentration in sediments these results confirmed the hypothesis that differences in sediment grain size were the main factor driving the microbial community structure 3 4 distribution of functional genes associated with n transformation in the hz functional genes for nitrification denitrification and dnra were all identified in the sediment fig 5 implying that the microbial communities in the columns were capable of transforming inorganic n in addition the abundance of nitrification genes i e amoa aoa and amoa aob in the coarse column was higher 7 40 104 copies to 2 58 104copies amoa aob per gram as reflected in table s6 than that in the other columns furthermore the relative abundance of nitrification genes in the middle of each column was higher than that in the other parts of the column the distribution of functional genes in all columns fig 5 revealed a higher abundance of denitrification and dnra genes at the anaerobic agw inlet where no3 concentration was high and do concentration was relatively low a higher representation of the dnra nrfa was found in the outlet of the mix column fig 5 where elevated exchangeable nh4 was observed nitrification genes were observed prevalent throughout the column the highest relative abundances of denitrification genes nirs and nirk were located near the middle of the fine column the relative abundances of nirs nirk and nrfa marker genes for denitrification and dnra were lower in the coarse column than in the mix and fine columns consistent with these three genes being involved in anaerobic processes overall the taxonomic composition and n transformation genes in the coarse column were representative of aerobic microbial activities in addition we also found that regions filled with coarse sediment exhibited higher nitrification functional potential while regions with fine sediment had higher denitrification functional potential generally a longer flow retention time in the hz leads to a higher turnover rate of nutrients including carbon and nitrogen harjung et al 2019 contrary to the presence of denitrification genes in the fine column the nitrate balance analysis showed that the finer particle size failed in achieving a faster nitrate consumption rate the results signified that the expression of gene function might have been restricted at a lower flow rate table 2 compared with the fine sediment area denitrification in the coarse particle size area may occur in deeper hyporheic sediment indicating that coarse sediment areas are more conducive to the internal migration of nutrients deeper in the hz the coarse sediment area reinforces the encountering opportunity for groundwater and surface water and enhances the biogeochemical process in the hz boano et al 2014 shuai et al 2017 despite the fact that the adhesion area of microorganisms might be restricted due to the lower specific surface area higher do consumption rates and nitrification functional potential were observed in coarse column while fine particles have a larger specific surface area hydraulic properties limited solute transport leading to reduced biogeochemical reactivity these results demonstrated how the discrepancy in solution chemistry and fluid residence time caused by sediment heterogeneity collectively affected spatial and temporal variation in microbial function 3 5 microbial community structure and ecological processes in columns network analysis was applied to help elucidate the underlying network of microbe microbe interactions fig s7 among the three columns the fine column network contained 8 482 edges among 2 284 nodes which were fewer than those of the networks of the coarse column 10 485 edges among 2 407 nodes and the mix column 9 314 edges among 2 303 nodes reflecting a smaller number of co occurrences in the fine column edge node ratio 3 71 the decreases in cluster coefficients average degree and figure density further demonstrated a reduction in network complexity in the fine column relative to the coarse column these results showed that the topological features of the samples from different columns were distinguishable and that the degree of co occurrence of bacterial communities in the fine column was lower than that in the coarse and mix columns next we examined the relationship between βnti and its potential drivers to examine the effects of different ecological processes on microbial assembly in hyporheic sediments as shown in fig 6 a d porosity was most strongly associated with variation in βnti between columns among all of the environmental variables examined the βnti distribution changed as the difference in porosity difference caused by sediment grain size became more pronounced fig 6a specifically the distribution ranged from being primarily consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 to being consistent with variable selection βnti 2 similarly as differences in no3 n concentration in sediments increased the distribution changed from being consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 to variable selection βnti 2 in sediment samples along columns βnti increases as the difference in porosity between two samples increases suggesting that there is a pattern of increasing dissimilarity between bacterial communities based on the linear relationship deterministic processes were found to dominate microbial community assembly in columns when the difference in porosity between two samples exceeded 0 146 porosity significantly alters microbial community assembly and also alters the composition and structure of the microbial community considering stochastic vs deterministic processes porosity was identified based on phylogenetic null model deviation as the main driver to determine bacterial community assembly in hz sediments with high frequency hyporheic exchange 3 6 mutual relationships among sediment properties microbial communities and n related functional genes pls pm is a robust form of structural equation modelling sanchez 2013 that is particularly useful when predictors are highly correlated we conducted pls pm to understand the effects of sediment grain size reflected in porosity on nitrogen and do concentration in sediments no3 no2 nh4 concentration and do gradient with depth microbial communities and functional genes related to n transformations the results of the pls pm showed that sediment porosity had dominant negative effects on the nitrogen and do levels in sediments path coefficient 0 6 p 0 01 the negative effects of sediment porosity were less profound on the structure of microbial communities path coefficient 0 308 p 0 05 and the distribution of functional genes associated with n transformation path coefficient 0 395 p 0 05 fig 7 in contrast the nitrogen and do concentrations in sediments had a strong positive and direct effect on microbial communities path coefficient 0 721 p 0 001 and n related functional gene abundance path coefficient 0 441 p 0 05 the pls pm analysis showed that sediment porosity primarily altered the chemical properties including the contents of nitrogen species and vertical distribution of do vertical levels in do and nitrogen species in hyporheic sediments posed significant positive direct effects on microbial community and n related functional genes fig 7 suggesting that microorganisms were sensitive to the variations in nutrient and do levels in hyporheic sediments which were in agreement with some previous reported results hou et al 2017 liu et al 2017 another interesting finding is that microbial community has limited effect on functional genes related to n transformation path coefficient 0 095 the result might possibly suggest that the alterations in n related functional genes were more relevant to physico chemical modifications in hyporheic sediments such as the depletion of oxygen and transformation in nutrient level rather than the changes in microbial community the results of the nitrogen conversion functional genes also showed that the differences in depletion of oxygen and transformation in nutrient level caused by the low flow rate limited the expression of denitrification genes function in the fine column pls pm analysis broadens our understanding on how and to which extent sediment porosity affects the concentrations of do and nitrogen species microbial community structure and potential function under the influence of hydraulic connectivity future work on the mutual relationship among sediment characteristics microbial community assembly and underlying nitrogen conversion mechanisms under high frequency hyporheic exchange in real cases impacted by dam operation is interesting and highly required 4 conclusions our work disclosed the mutual effects of grain size microbial community structure functional potential and associated nitrogen transformation in hz under frequent hyporheic exchange grain size predominantly governed the hydraulic connectivity and process rates of solutes in vertical direction the alterations in the microbial community stemming from variable geophysical properties of sediments in turn shift n transforming processes sediment porosity was identified based on phylogenetic null model deviation as the main driver determining bacterial community structure and assembly specifically coarse sediment facilitated interspecies interactions and stimulated nitrification process while in fine sediment area the nitrogen removal and the expression of n related functional genes were restricted possibly owing to the confined flow rate the study sheds light on the impacts of grain size and spatial transitions between size fractionated layers on microbial community assembly and n cycling which deserves attention of both scientists and decision makers on the corridor managements future work will focus on the feedbacks of microbial community and biogeochemical processes in real world cases and extend the ecological processes towards the evaluation of both vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange in regulated river systems in a

17831,hyporheic zones hz are hotspots for biogeochemical reactions where groundwater and surface water mix river dam buildings and other hydrologic controls alter the sediment grain size distribution and modify the downstream hyporheic exchange with cascading effects on geochemical and microbial processes in river corridors in this lab scale column experiment the n transformations in hz filled with sediments in different grain sizes were investigated with a focus on understanding the interplay among variational hydraulic connectivity microbial community structure functional potential under frequent groundwater surface water exchange porosity was identified as the main driver determining bacterial community assembly in hz sediments significant microbial zonation was observed along the columns and the degree of co occurrence of bacterial communities in the fine column was lower than that in the coarse and mix columns the coarse column allowed for almost 2 47 times the exchange flux relative to the fine column and generates the fastest do consumption rate 6 52 μg o2 l s the enrichment of nitrifiers i e cytophagaceae and bacillaceae and nitrification functional genes i e amoa aoa and amoa aob revealed the higher nitrification potential in column filled with coarse sediments in comparison the highest nh4 production rates 2 4 10 3 μg n l s took place in fine column the higher abundancies of denitrifiers such as comamonadaceae and lysobacter and enrichment of functional genes of nirk and nirs interestingly suggested the elevated denitrification potential in fine column in a more anaerobic environment the results implied that variations in microbial functional potential and associated nitrogen transformation may occur in size fractioned hz to dynamic hyporheic exchange which added new knowledge to the underlying biogeochemical and ecological processes in regulated river corridors graphical abstract image 1 keywords hyporheic exchange grain size hydraulic conductivity microbial community assembly nitrogen transformation 1 introduction the hyporheic zone hz is a unique ecotone where groundwater and surface water mix the active biogeochemical region develops strong chemical gradients and stimulates the transformation of c n and other elements boulton et al 1998 krause et al 2011 owing to the dynamic hydrological features and sediment heterogeneity liu et al 2017 nitrogen is actively consumed through biological uptake or denitrification in the hz resulting in its significant depletion in riverine systems marzadri et al 2017 hence characterizing nitrogen transformations in the hz is important for enhancing understanding of nutrient retention and ecological restoration in river corridors boulton et al 2010 liu et al 2017 murdoch and staniec 2013 the hz has been identified as a no3 buffer zone along rivers and capable of removing 37 76 of nitrogen inputs fischer et al 2005 the transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species has been extensively studied with an emphasis on denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nitrification and anammox han et al 2014 smith et al 2015 the strong redox gradient and the substantial mixing of components from distinct sources could stimulate denitrification contributing up to 14 97 of the denitrification in riverine systems briody et al 2016 kiel and bayani cardenas 2014 stegen et al 2018 zarnetske et al 2011 factors including riverbed hydraulic connectivity exchange flux nutrient inputs and the microbial community were confirmed impacting the internal biogeochemical reactions in the unique hydrological region fetzer et al 2017 perujo et al 2017 by regulating flow velocity and fluid residence time during hyporheic exchanges hydraulic connectivity fundamentally determines the oxygen levels and produces distinct microenvironments for biogeochemical processes bao et al 2018 han et al 2019 krause et al 2013 hyporheic sediments house a characteristic microbial community whose structure and activity are sensitive to the physicochemical parameter changes in the hz peralta maraver et al 2018 the coarse sized particles could facilitate solute transport stimulate microbial activity and accelerate biogeochemical cycling rates hou et al 2017 during unidirectional surface water discharge the presence of micrometer grade fine sediments could impede the solute transport and reduce more than 75 of the exchange flux fetzer et al 2017 wooster et al 2008 once the fine sediments blocked the exchange channel oxygen and nutrients were confined in the hz and rapidly consumed the reduced redox gradient subsequently decreased microbial activity and restricted nutrient conversion rates caruso et al 2017 datry et al 2015 microbial community assembly is a core ecological process in the hz but has not been analyzed at length saup et al 2019 in an important relevant study stegen et al 2013 have proven that in deeper finer grained sediments selection was a strong community assembly process governing 60 of the turnover while in shallower coarser grained sediments selection was weaker governing 30 of turnover being imposed by vertically and horizontally structured hydrological factors stegen et al 2013 however our limited knowledge of the mutual feedbacks between hydraulic conductivity shifts in microbial community structure and functional potential precludes a complete understanding of community assembly in the hz to date more than 60 of the world s rivers have been dammed nilsson et al 2005 dams not only trap sediments and nutrients supposed to flow downstream but also alter downstream hyporheic exchange in natural river groundwater system groundwater flows steadily through the riparian aquifer in one direction like water through a gill nonetheless the exchange between ground and surface water changes from a gill model to a lung model in a dam dominated river where river water flows in and out of the riparian aquifer like air flowing across the lungs due to frequent stage fluctuations sawyer et al 2009 meanwhile fluctuations in the water level downstream by dam operations result in frequent reversals in flow direction in the hz mccallum and shanafield 2016 shuai et al 2017 taleb et al 2008 the variations in water level could markedly affect aerobic respiration denitrification and the overall nitrogen cycling hester et al 2019 liu et al 2017 additionally dam operations stimulate the dissimilation of sediment grain size downstream naganna and deka 2018 nonetheless limited research on the mutual roles of hz sediment grain size hyporheic exchange frequency and the role of microbial community assembly in the control of nitrogen transformation hinders our understanding of the influence of anthropogenic activities such as dam operations on the ecological function of riverine networks the objectives of this work were threefold 1 to investigate the effects of sediment grain size under high frequency hyporheic exchange on the physicochemical water parameters of sediment 2 study nitrogen conversion during this process and 3 characterize how these parameters affect microbial community structure and functional potential in this high frequency hyporheic exchange system we designed several column setups to simulate hyporheic exchange the interplay of microenvironment change high frequency exchange and the microbial community on nitrogen transformation were unraveled by an integrated approach using seepage dynamics dna sequencing and statistical methods decision makers are suggested to consider the impact of management measures on the redistribution of channel grain size and its cascading effects on hyporheic exchange 2 material and methods 2

length 50 cm and gravity corers ebs 442 hubei china were applied to collect enough sediment cores in order to obtain sufficient sand with different sizes in the following step sediment samples were then stored at 4 c and immediately sent back to the laboratory the in situ collected sediment was measured to contain 1 2 0 12 total carbon wt wt after mixing all the in situ collected sediments we sifted the samples through sieves to obtain sand in two different sizes coarse sand 0 9 1 2 mm and fine sand 0 075 0 250 mm based on the classification system proposed by the united states geological survey poppe and eliason 2008 all sand had been pre fired 450 c 4 h and cleaned with distilled water to ensure that no organic matter was present the sand was then placed in columns to create five treatments differing in the spatial distribution of fine and coarse sand coarse column fine column fine coarse column coarse fine column and mix column volume ratio of course sand to fine sand in fine coarse column coarse fine column and mix column is 1 1 since technical replication was not feasible for similar column experiments only one column setup was applied for each treatment similar to relevant studies liu et al 2017 lópez ortiz et al 2018 2 2 experimental design we used vertical columns 35 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter filled with different grain sizes to simulate hyporheic exchange first a biological inoculum was extracted from fresh sediment samples to obtain a uniformly dispersed cell suspension pyrophosphate 5 ml 50 mm was added to in situ collected sediments and incubated at room temperature with soft shaking at 60 rpm for 15 min all inoculum needed to be sifted through 200 mesh before inoculation to the columns to ensure that no granular deposits 0 075 mm were present the sample was then sonicated with ice for 1 min to avoid cell rupture queric et al 2004 to maintain comparable initial biological conditions and to ensure the organic matter content in each column similar to that in the original in situ collected sediments equal amounts of biological inoculum i e 200 ml containing 1 8 0 05 total carbon were added to each column so that the final total carbon in each column was approximately 1 01 0 02 a peristaltic pump was used to supply water to each column and a 5 cm diversion pipe was placed at the top of each column to ensure that each column had a 5 cm piezometric head considering the comparative physical and chemical properties of surface water and groundwater and the difference in nitrogen concentration between surface water and groundwater liu et al 2017 stegen et al 2016 zachara et al 2013 the properties of artificial surface water asw and artificial groundwater agw were designed table s2 the flow of agw into each column was controlled to ensure that the flow rate of each column was consistent with that of asw column physical properties and measured influent do and no3 concentrations are provided in fig 1 s3 and s4 flow velocities in the columns ranged from 0 55 m d 1 to 1 39 m d 1 table 1 the velocity of asw was determined by the seepage character of each column and the drainage velocity of agw was controlled accordingly the columns were presaturated with no3 free agw and asw for 3 days before the experiments next agw or asw with no3 was injected at a flow rate determined by the permeability of the sediment filled in each column to mimic the reversal of hydraulic gradients in the hz all columns were alternatively eluted with agw and asw from opposite ends of the column the portion of the columns filled with sand was kept in the dark to mimic subsurface conditions by wrapping them with opaque material during the experiment effluent water samples were taken every 2 h for a total of six times per experimental period and pore water samples were obtained from four side sampling ports along the column at 6 5 cm 11 5 cm 16 5 cm and 21 5 cm respectively every 24 h at the end of the experiment columns were sectioned and sampled along the length of the column at 0 3 cm 5 8 cm 10 13 cm 15 18 cm 20 23 cm and 25 28 cm respectively the sectioned columns were defined as number 1 to number 6 from the bottom to the top of the column for example c1 refers to the sectioned sample in the coarse column at 0 3 cm as shown in fig 1 the no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations of sediment were determined after extraction with potassium chloride solution 1 mol l 2 3 physical and chemical water analyses 2 3 1 hydraulic conductivity and advection time flow rate q was measured manually at the outlet of each individual column during the downwelling process hydraulic conductivity k in m s was calculated using darcy s law 1 k q l δ h a where δh is the piezometric head difference set at a constant value of 0 35 0 09 m l is total length of the sediment 0 30 m a is the cross section area 1 96 10 3 m2 and q is measured in m3 d advection time is a measure of the time that takes water to go through the sediment advection time t was calculated using the formula 2 t l a q where ø is the porosity of the sediment 0 4 for the coarse column 0 32 for the fine column 0 34 for the mix column and 0 36 for fine coarse column and coarse fine column specifically the porosity values of each column sample were shown in table s3 perujo et al 2017 2 3 2 chemical water analyses to monitor the subtle changes in water quality in source water physicochemical parameters including ph do and temperature were measured every 24 h using a hach hq30d portable meter hach company loveland colorado usa in the tanks storing asw and agw during the column tests the collected effluent and pore water samples were immediately filtered with 0 22 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane syringe filters no3 no2 and nh4 in water and sediment samples were determined using the cadmium reduction method the diazotization method and the salicylate spectrophotometric method with the corresponding powder set purchased from the hach company 2 4 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis dna was extracted from a total of 2 g of sediments collected at different depths in all columns and was extracted from each homogenized sample using the e z n a soil dnakit omega bio tek norcross ga usa following the manufacturer s instructions after dna extraction the dna products were combined mixed and stored at 80 c before further analysis proteinase k was used to digest contaminated proteins that might otherwise degrade the dna products the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16 s rrna were amplified with the universal bacterial primers set 341 f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806 r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 pcr amplification and illumina miseq sequencing were performed at shanghai biozeron co ltd shanghai china the conditions for pcr were as follows 95 c for 5 min to denature dna with 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s with a final extension of 10 min at 72 c after quality testing using qiime 1 7 0 software the sequences were cropped and compared using silva128 reference comparison database marti and luis balcazar 2014 the 16 s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity truncated values representative sequences were defined with a commonly applied sequence and used for phylogenetic analyses the targeted genes for absolute qpcr analysis included five nitrogen transformation functional genes amoa aoa and amoa aob for nitrification nirk and nirs for denitrification and nrfa for dnra the potential of nitrogen turnover was obtained by directly comparing the concentration of the functional genes between different samples the specific analysis of absolute fluorescence quantitative pcr was embodied in si the functional genes primer sequences and qpcr procedures are provided in table s4 each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the results were used for error analysis 2 5 ecology process and co occurring network and partial least squares path modeling pls pm analyses we conducted ecological process analyses to clarify the importance of particle size in altering the community assembly ecological process analyses were carried out in r v3 5 3 http cran r project org the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd was applied to calculate the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between bacterial communities the abundance of weighted βmntd was calculated by comdistnt function in picante package stegen et al 2013 in order to evaluate the possibility of relative equilibrium transfer between stochastic and deterministic ecological processes randomizations were used to generate a null distribution 999 randomization for each βmntd estimate βmntd is pairwise distance metric and each pairwise of communities generates a null βmntd distribution the difference between the mean of the βmntd and the null distribution was measured by βnti according to stegen s community assembly method using the r language stegen et al 2013 specifically the percentage of pairwise βnti values indicated that observed turnover between pairwise communities was governed by variable selection βnti 2 and homogeneous selection βnti 2 if communities were as different as expected by random chance βnti 2 stochastic processes dictated community structure these stochastic processes could be further distinguished as dispersal limitation greater than expected turnover rcbray 0 95 homogenizing dispersal less than expected turnover rcbray 0 95 and undominated ecological processes unclear moderate rate of dispersal and weak selection strength rcbray 0 95 saup et al 2019 we were able to identify whether deterministic homogenizing variable or stochastic homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation processes dominate by combining these metrics stegen et al 2013 co occurrence network was conducted to exhibit distinct microbial community structures in coarse mix and fine columns which could capture the underlying causal interaction structure by their accuracy for mapping interactions berry and widder 2014 the co occurring networks of the microbial communities were determined by spearman s correlation analysis specifically spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ between all 97 cutoff otus occurred in at least 25 of the samples and at least 30 counts were calculated pairwise in each cluster using the in house r scripts subsequently significant p 0 001 and robust ρ 0 8 correlations between otus were selected we used gephi http gephi github io for network visualization and modular analyses the topological properties of the networks were calculated using gephi including average degree betweenness centrality modularity and average path length we examined the relationships between sediment porosity do and nutrient concentration in sediments microbial communities and functional genes associated with n transformation using partial least squares path modeling pls pm in the r package plspm seven latent variables were used porosity vertical concentrations of do nutrients no3 n no2 n and nh4 n contents in sediments taxonomic communities the first axis of pcoa and functional groups the first axis of pcoa all of the above analyses were performed in r r version 3 5 3 2 6 data treatment and statistical analysis the α diversity indices otu richness shannon and simpson were calculated using the vegan package in r 3 4 3 nutrient balance and do balance were calculated based on the difference between the column outlet and the inlet tank nutrient balance was divided by advection time to calculate the production consumption rates for ammonium nitrates and do rate table 2 to distinguish the effects of different columns on the nitrogen conversion process do balance was defined as the oxygen balance at the outlet and inlet of the downwelling flow process while nutrient balance was the balance of nutrients at the outlet and inlet of the upwelling flow process for these parameters differences between columns were analyzed with two factors anova factor day and column the further tukey s post hoc tests were performed when significant differences were detected differences between columns at each depth were further analyzed perujo et al 2017 to integrate physicochemical and biological data along the column a redundancy analysis rda was performed by vegan package in r using one matrix with otu data for a bacterial genus fitted with another matrix containing physicochemical parameters nutrient and porosity values measured at different depths in each column on the last day of the experiment anosim analysis was performed by vegan package in r to detect differences in parameters between treatments we generated non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots to visualize and determine the effect of sediment grain size on bacterial community composition using the functions decostand and adonis in the r library vegan multivariate regression tree mrt analysis is a constrained clustering approach that uses the mvpart package with default parameters to correlate the relative abundance of the lineages to the characteristics of the site taxa that were significantly discriminable in each group were determined based on a linear discriminant analysis lda effect size pipeline lefse program at http huttenhowersph harvard edu galaxy which employs the factorial kruskal wallis rank sum test α 0 05 to identify taxa with significantly different relative abundances among different columns segata et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic conductivity and oxygen conditions in hz with different grain sizes the hydraulic connectivity and the ability of each column to pass water were significantly different flow measured at the start of the experiment was 991 16 9 11 717 05 12 53 541 01 11 07 407 99 15 56 and 320 35 9 86 ml d in the coarse coarse fine fine coarse mix and fine columns respectively hydraulic conductivity decreased with time fig s2 previous studies have demonstrated that microbial growth and adhesion occupied the sediment pores thereby causing biological blockage and reducing the exchange flux perujo et al 2017 scheidweiler et al 2019 during the last period of the experiment the highest k values were measured in treatments with coarse sand in the upper layers coarse and coarse fine treatments table 1 as expected hydraulic conductivity was highest in the coarse column while the presence of fine sediments in the other columns resulted in lower conductivity values baveye et al 1998 pavelic et al 2011 all columns showed a negative oxygen balance indicating that oxygen was consumed during downwelling table 2 meanwhile a highest do concentration was detected in the effluent from the coarse column fig s4 the oxygen consumption rate in the coarse column was 6 52 μg o2 l s whereas the oxygen consumption rate in the fine column was only 1 53 μg o2 l s absolute do values showed a significant decrease in depth in all columns p 0 01 table 1 the coarse column also had the shortest advection time meaning that water passed faster through the sediment fine coarse and fine columns showed the longest advection times indicating that water took longer to pass through the sediment table 2 sediment grain size affects hydraulic connectivity and hyporheic exchange flux regulating the supply of nutrients for microbial activities hz sediment porosity affects solute transport dynamics in the hz and alters the degree to which biogenic substances are utilized markedly affecting do transport do is energetically the most favorable electron acceptor and strongly influences the succession of biogeochemical processes within the hz baker et al 2000 denitrification might not have taken place in each column during downwelling as the do concentrations were not low enough alternatively the do gradient might have been caused by the decrease in k at the end of the experiment 3 2 nitrogen transformation in the hz with different grain sizes in the coarse mix and fine columns asw and agw were switched every 4 4 2 0 and 1 8 pore volumes pv from opposite ends of the column i e the effluent side became the inlet side during the switch and vice versa fig 1 and fig s3 middle data panels no3 no2 and nh4 were detected in the effluents of all columns fig 1 and fig s3 left data panels higher no3 concentrations were observed in agw effluents than in asw effluents in each column since no3 was much higher in agw 0 44 mm than in asw 0 044 mm the effluent no3 after drainage was higher during agw injection period than during asw injection period n nh4 balance primarily consisted of positive values indicating nh4 production table 2 the production of nh4 could be ascribed to the oxidation of exchangeable nh4 in sediments during asw drainage and the dnra process when agw passed through the column liu et al 2017 differences in nitrogen concentrations were also observed among columns the left hand data panels in fig 1a shows higher effluent no3 concentrations from coarse column than from mix and fine column nonetheless considering the higher flow rate of 1 26 m d 1 compared to 0 52 m d 1 and 0 51 m d 1 in mix and fine columns the fastest no3 consumption rate occurred in the course column up to 0 116 μg n l s while the nitrate consumption rates were 0 058 μg n l s and 0 059 μg n l s respectively in mix and fine columns shown in table 2 the higher potential process rates were found related to higher flow rates perujo et al 2017 in contrast to no3 the fastest nh4 production rate occurred in the fine column 2 4 μg n l s while the rate was 1 37 μg n l s in the coarse column the higher retention time in fine column resulted in the longer periods of oxic condition during asw drainage and anaerobic condition during agw drainage facilitating the oxidation of exchangeable nh4 and dnra process respectively soluble no3 and no2 and exchangeable sediment nh4 were quantified after the experiments were finished the contents of soluble no2 were rather low in columns 0 2 μm 2 μm and no significant variation was detected among treatments in soluble no3 in the right hand panels in fig 1 and fig s3 the content of exchangeable nh4 in the coarse and fine columns was similar which was higher than in mix coarse fine and fine coarse columns p 0 01 the reasons for these variations were not evident nh4 accumulation in the middle of each column stemmed from the hysteresis coupling effect of cation exchange accumulation and nh4 oxidation loss caused by the periodic reversal in the flow direction liu et al 2017 fig 1 indicates that water flow direction source and their periodic exchanges have a profound impact on the pathways and rates of nitrogen transformation in hyporheic sediments 3 3 microbial community dynamics in response to hydraulic properties overall 57 bacterial phyla were detected in 32 samples including 30 column sediment samples one in situ sediment sample and one biological inoculum sample fig s5 the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria accounting for 58 72 of the total number of bacterial sequences fig 2 illustrates a more pronounced community zonation at the genus level at different depths along each column fig 2 as expected samples from the five columns differed significantly in bacterial community structure at the genus level especially for the coarse mix and fine columns in sediments derived from the coarse column and mix column the genus sulfurifustis 5 66 in coarse column and 5 84 in mix column was relatively abundant whereas the aquabacterium served as the most abundant genus 5 94 in the fine column table s5 shows that the bacterial species richness is higher in the fine column relative to the coarse column table s5 lefse analysis was conducted to reveal the composition of the microbial community and differences among the coarse mix and fine columns as shown in fig 3 a threshold of 3 0 was chosen for the logarithmic lda scores fig s6 gammaproteobacteria cytophagia alphaproteobacteria and bacilli were defined as the main microbial taxa enriched in the coarse column at the class level in the mix column characteristic strains at the class level included clostridia nitrospira and betaproteobacteria while in the fine column enrichment of betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were observed fig 3 shows clear enrichment of cytophagaceae and bacillaceae in coarse column which might be actively involved in nitrite oxidation in the second step of nitrification paungfoo et al 2007 preena et al 2017 wang et al 2012 comamonadaceae and lysobacterwhich showed characteristic presence in fine column which had been confirmed possessing strong denitrification potential ding et al 2019 sotres et al 2016 in addition the strain of comamonadaceae can concurrently show nitrification and denitrification capacity khan et al 2002 nmds analysis was performed to explore the distributional patterns of the microbial community in the coarse mix and fine columns and revealed three distinct clusters fig 4 a environmental factors were added to the nmds to assess which factors might contribute to this distributional pattern a clear distinction between samples collected near the inlet of agw injection and all other samples was observed in the rda plots among the top 10 microorganisms at the genus level fig 4b and of n transformation functional genes fig 4c from the coarse mix and fine columns do and porosity were the two main factors contributing to differences in the structure of the microbial community therefore we hypothesized that different sized sediments in different columns conferred different hydraulic properties changing the structure of the microbial community and thereby leading to different nitrogen conversion processes anosim testing was conducted to test for differences between the microbial communities of the three columns in fig 4 the microbial community in the fine column was significantly different from that in the mix column r 0 567 p 0 05 and the coarse column r 0 603 p 0 05 however no significant differences were found between the microbial communities in the coarse and the mix column r 0 459 p 0 125 rda was performed using these significant environmental factors do had the strongest effect on microbial community composition in all samples followed by porosity and no3 fig 4a and b mrt analysis was used to corroborate the results of the nmds analysis fig 4d shows that the mrt constructed from the data of the microbial community exhibited three splits and four levels the 18 samples were clustered into two groups by porosity and the group with porosity less than 0 3872 was split by do into pore water samples with do less than 0 705 mg l were then distinguished by no3 concentration in sediments these results confirmed the hypothesis that differences in sediment grain size were the main factor driving the microbial community structure 3 4 distribution of functional genes associated with n transformation in the hz functional genes for nitrification denitrification and dnra were all identified in the sediment fig 5 implying that the microbial communities in the columns were capable of transforming inorganic n in addition the abundance of nitrification genes i e amoa aoa and amoa aob in the coarse column was higher 7 40 104 copies to 2 58 104copies amoa aob per gram as reflected in table s6 than that in the other columns furthermore the relative abundance of nitrification genes in the middle of each column was higher than that in the other parts of the column the distribution of functional genes in all columns fig 5 revealed a higher abundance of denitrification and dnra genes at the anaerobic agw inlet where no3 concentration was high and do concentration was relatively low a higher representation of the dnra nrfa was found in the outlet of the mix column fig 5 where elevated exchangeable nh4 was observed nitrification genes were observed prevalent throughout the column the highest relative abundances of denitrification genes nirs and nirk were located near the middle of the fine column the relative abundances of nirs nirk and nrfa marker genes for denitrification and dnra were lower in the coarse column than in the mix and fine columns consistent with these three genes being involved in anaerobic processes overall the taxonomic composition and n transformation genes in the coarse column were representative of aerobic microbial activities in addition we also found that regions filled with coarse sediment exhibited higher nitrification functional potential while regions with fine sediment had higher denitrification functional potential generally a longer flow retention time in the hz leads to a higher turnover rate of nutrients including carbon and nitrogen harjung et al 2019 contrary to the presence of denitrification genes in the fine column the nitrate balance analysis showed that the finer particle size failed in achieving a faster nitrate consumption rate the results signified that the expression of gene function might have been restricted at a lower flow rate table 2 compared with the fine sediment area denitrification in the coarse particle size area may occur in deeper hyporheic sediment indicating that coarse sediment areas are more conducive to the internal migration of nutrients deeper in the hz the coarse sediment area reinforces the encountering opportunity for groundwater and surface water and enhances the biogeochemical process in the hz boano et al 2014 shuai et al 2017 despite the fact that the adhesion area of microorganisms might be restricted due to the lower specific surface area higher do consumption rates and nitrification functional potential were observed in coarse column while fine particles have a larger specific surface area hydraulic properties limited solute transport leading to reduced biogeochemical reactivity these results demonstrated how the discrepancy in solution chemistry and fluid residence time caused by sediment heterogeneity collectively affected spatial and temporal variation in microbial function 3 5 microbial community structure and ecological processes in columns network analysis was applied to help elucidate the underlying network of microbe microbe interactions fig s7 among the three columns the fine column network contained 8 482 edges among 2 284 nodes which were fewer than those of the networks of the coarse column 10 485 edges among 2 407 nodes and the mix column 9 314 edges among 2 303 nodes reflecting a smaller number of co occurrences in the fine column edge node ratio 3 71 the decreases in cluster coefficients average degree and figure density further demonstrated a reduction in network complexity in the fine column relative to the coarse column these results showed that the topological features of the samples from different columns were distinguishable and that the degree of co occurrence of bacterial communities in the fine column was lower than that in the coarse and mix columns next we examined the relationship between βnti and its potential drivers to examine the effects of different ecological processes on microbial assembly in hyporheic sediments as shown in fig 6 a d porosity was most strongly associated with variation in βnti between columns among all of the environmental variables examined the βnti distribution changed as the difference in porosity difference caused by sediment grain size became more pronounced fig 6a specifically the distribution ranged from being primarily consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 to being consistent with variable selection βnti 2 similarly as differences in no3 n concentration in sediments increased the distribution changed from being consistent with stochastic community assembly 2 βnti 2 to variable selection βnti 2 in sediment samples along columns βnti increases as the difference in porosity between two samples increases suggesting that there is a pattern of increasing dissimilarity between bacterial communities based on the linear relationship deterministic processes were found to dominate microbial community assembly in columns when the difference in porosity between two samples exceeded 0 146 porosity significantly alters microbial community assembly and also alters the composition and structure of the microbial community considering stochastic vs deterministic processes porosity was identified based on phylogenetic null model deviation as the main driver to determine bacterial community assembly in hz sediments with high frequency hyporheic exchange 3 6 mutual relationships among sediment properties microbial communities and n related functional genes pls pm is a robust form of structural equation modelling sanchez 2013 that is particularly useful when predictors are highly correlated we conducted pls pm to understand the effects of sediment grain size reflected in porosity on nitrogen and do concentration in sediments no3 no2 nh4 concentration and do gradient with depth microbial communities and functional genes related to n transformations the results of the pls pm showed that sediment porosity had dominant negative effects on the nitrogen and do levels in sediments path coefficient 0 6 p 0 01 the negative effects of sediment porosity were less profound on the structure of microbial communities path coefficient 0 308 p 0 05 and the distribution of functional genes associated with n transformation path coefficient 0 395 p 0 05 fig 7 in contrast the nitrogen and do concentrations in sediments had a strong positive and direct effect on microbial communities path coefficient 0 721 p 0 001 and n related functional gene abundance path coefficient 0 441 p 0 05 the pls pm analysis showed that sediment porosity primarily altered the chemical properties including the contents of nitrogen species and vertical distribution of do vertical levels in do and nitrogen species in hyporheic sediments posed significant positive direct effects on microbial community and n related functional genes fig 7 suggesting that microorganisms were sensitive to the variations in nutrient and do levels in hyporheic sediments which were in agreement with some previous reported results hou et al 2017 liu et al 2017 another interesting finding is that microbial community has limited effect on functional genes related to n transformation path coefficient 0 095 the result might possibly suggest that the alterations in n related functional genes were more relevant to physico chemical modifications in hyporheic sediments such as the depletion of oxygen and transformation in nutrient level rather than the changes in microbial community the results of the nitrogen conversion functional genes also showed that the differences in depletion of oxygen and transformation in nutrient level caused by the low flow rate limited the expression of denitrification genes function in the fine column pls pm analysis broadens our understanding on how and to which extent sediment porosity affects the concentrations of do and nitrogen species microbial community structure and potential function under the influence of hydraulic connectivity future work on the mutual relationship among sediment characteristics microbial community assembly and underlying nitrogen conversion mechanisms under high frequency hyporheic exchange in real cases impacted by dam operation is interesting and highly required 4 conclusions our work disclosed the mutual effects of grain size microbial community structure functional potential and associated nitrogen transformation in hz under frequent hyporheic exchange grain size predominantly governed the hydraulic connectivity and process rates of solutes in vertical direction the alterations in the microbial community stemming from variable geophysical properties of sediments in turn shift n transforming processes sediment porosity was identified based on phylogenetic null model deviation as the main driver determining bacterial community structure and assembly specifically coarse sediment facilitated interspecies interactions and stimulated nitrification process while in fine sediment area the nitrogen removal and the expression of n related functional genes were restricted possibly owing to the confined flow rate the study sheds light on the impacts of grain size and spatial transitions between size fractionated layers on microbial community assembly and n cycling which deserves attention of both scientists and decision makers on the corridor managements future work will focus on the feedbacks of microbial community and biogeochemical processes in real world cases and extend the ecological processes towards the evaluation of both vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange in regulated river systems in a

17832,the bacterial inactivation mechanisms by solar light and the photo fenton process is still a matter of debate in this study we bring evidence towards the elucidation of the mechanisms that govern photo fenton disinfection at near neutral ph with the use of porin deficient and catalase over producing e coli strains in conjunction with measurements of cell wall oxidation and permeability we are able to i highlight the role of the aforementioned components in bacterial inactivation and ii localize the damages in the intracellular domain despite the addition of the fenton reagents in the bulk we report that h2o2 oxidizes cell walls but under light the process is of low significance uva initiated an intracellular oxidation process based on excess accumulated h2o2 while the uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 processes have the same effect with light albeit enhanced as shown by malondialdehyde mda production and onpg hydrolysis rates finally compared to the uva assisted photo fenton process its solar counterpart is enhanced by the direct uvb effects on bacterial dna in conclusion we have sufficient evidence to postulate that the photo fenton process is intracellular and propose the pathways that form the integrated bacterial inactivation mechanism by photo fenton graphical abstract image 1 keywords outer membrane porins catalase intracellular oxidation solar disinfection sodis fenton process 1 introduction solar disinfection sodis is a well established water disinfection process leading to inactivation of bacterial and viral pathogens by uv and heat and is currently a method of daily use in developing and sunny countries around 8 million people apply sodis for water sterilization on account of its simplicity and high efficiency mcguigan et al 2012 in order to reduce the exposure times and limit bacterial regrowth giannakis et al 2015 ndounla et al 2013 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and the fenton reagents have been applied to enhance bacterial inactivation during sodis ndounla and pulgarin 2015 sciacca et al 2010 villar navarro et al 2019 due to their non toxic nature and compatibility with sodis these methods have attracted interest with its involved parameters such as the light irradiance the dose of hydrogen peroxide and iron the temperature of operation etc already well studied rodríguez chueca et al 2019 rubio et al 2013 spuhler et al 2010 however although some insights on the role of light boyle et al 2008 h2o2 castro alférez et al 2016 etc exist the detailed mechanisms of bacterial disinfection under these methods is still not entirely unveiled besides the enhancement of sodis and its potential as a drinking water treatment process the simultaneous addition of fe and h2o2 can induce the photo fenton reaction a method that has been long proposed as effective for wastewater ww disinfection ortega gómez et al 2014 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 with the advent of the raceway pond reactors as a prominent reactor for ww treatment de la obra et al 2019 esteban garcía et al 2017 the potentials of photo fenton as a disinfection method before ww reuse e g in agriculture can be now further considered however similarly to drinking water although some works have intended to dissociate the events that take place during ww disinfection de la obra jiménez et al 2020 attributing the pathways of inactivation to the simultaneous actions taking place during photo fenton is a highly complex task considering the main inactivation force during oxidative treatment previous studies suggest that bacteria are inactivated

protection ezraty et al 2017 hoerter et al 2005a such as catalases and peroxidases it has been proven that 0 2 μm h2o2 is naturally present in bacteria while cytotoxicity levels are encountered with as low as 0 5 μm h2o2 imlay 2008 park et al 2005 currently although we arrive at a convergence on the possible inactivation pathways for sodis castro alférez et al 2016 giannakis et al 2016 the photo fenton at near neutral ph is still facing controversies as far as the dominant mechanisms that lead to bacterial inactivation are concerned mosteo et al 2020 or the main oxidants that lead to inactivation by the fenton process ho or ferryl farinelli et al 2020 in order to further understand the composite photo fenton process and the fundamentals behind the current study we present here the two parts in brief uva 400 315 nm radiation could generates ros as superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh h2o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 by dissolved oxygen in water and photo sensitizers in cell hoerter et al 2005a santos et al 2013 adding h2o2 in water can either directly damage the membrane of the cell if encountered in high concentrations uhl and dukan 2016 or diffuse into the cell to imbalance the steady state concentration of intracellular h2o2 seaver and imlay 2001a 2001b normally the excess h2o2 is catalyzed into water and oxygen by cell s catalases in order to keep its ros balance imlay 2008 pericone et al 2003 however under light this capacity is diminished hoerter et al 2005a 2005b furthermore h2o2 in cells could react with iron released from the fe s clusters and initiate an internal fenton reaction which will eventually kill the bacteria jang and imlay 2007 or oh can be generated from h2o2 via electron transfer from atp bosshard et al 2010a in the presence of both h2o2 and ferrous iron fe2 in water under light oh is quickly generated in the bulk photo fenton reaction which normally would be resulting in cell membrane breakage and bacterial inactivation park and imlay 2003 however primary data indicated that compared to e g tio2 photo fenton works in the intracellular domain ruales lonfat et al 2014 some more recent works have shown a difference in photo fenton mediated killing when h2o2 was allowed or delayed in entering the cell giannakis et al 2018 hence there are two interesting points whose implication holds the key to explain and localize the photo fenton process action namely the fenton reagents diffusion into the cell and their handling under light stress to verify the role of external h2o2 participates in oxidation mechanism in water disinfection it is important to know the way of h2o2 transport into cell it has been generally accepted that h2o2 can diffuse freely into the cell through the lipid bilayer however e coli bacteria have porins 1 1 1 3 nm channels for transport of small hydrophilic molecules across the outer membrane masi et al 2019 vergalli et al 2019 ompf and ompc are the two outer membrane porins of e coli their role has been queried and the first data show a possible role in affecting h2o2 influx giannakis et al 2018 furthermore the intracellular ros may be detoxified by enzymes such as superoxide dismutases sods catalases and peroxidases in the cytoplasm it is important to know how these enzymes especially the scavengers of h2o2 render bacteria adaptive to oxidative stress environment it has been proven that oxyr oxidative stress response regulon is a transcriptional activator of the stress response genes which could directly detect the oxidative stress scavenge h2o2 and repair damage to protect the cell from h2o2 toxicity chiang and schellhorn 2012 on the other hand katg is the bifunctional hydroperoxidase i hpi that demonstrates both catalase and peroxidase character and is induced by oxyr activation after its initiation by high intracellular h2o2 concentrations chelikani et al 2004 as such the hydroperoxidase i hpi encoded by katg could protect cells against oxidative stress sun et al 2016 however since light and heat affect hydroxyperoxidases their capacity must be further scrutinized in this work bacteria deficient of ompf and ompc porinless are applied to distinguish the extra and intra cellular mechanisms as well as catalase over productive strains in order to understand the response of h2o2 scavenging enzymes under light assisted fenton stress more specifically the porinless e coli tk821 and its parent strain mc4100 were employed to assess the role of h2o2 under light or dark and the photo fenton process by limiting the flux of external oxidants into cell building on our previous study on the topic giannakis et al 2018 but uva light is now used to avoid the genetic damage by uvb in parallel strains with h2o2 scavenger mutations i e oxyr overexpression and subsequent katg overproduction pgs058 and its corresponding strain empty vector plasmid pacyc184 were treated under uva light in presence of h2o2 and or both fenton reagents in order to assess the protective activity of catalases against the oxidative stress generated by the action of light and the fenton reagents the oxidation of membrane lipids and the permeability change of the cell wall was followed and compared in all conditions thus assessing the localization of the damage and aid towards the resolution of the intracellular and extracellular mechanisms of photo fenton disinfection at near neutral ph 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the reagents and chemicals used for this study were of high purity analytical grade the reactants applied for the fenton and sole h2o2 process were ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w v both supplied from sigma aldrich switzerland the materials used for measurements as titanium iv oxysulfate tioso4 1 9 2 1 and ortho nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside onpg both aforementioned products were purchased from sigma aldrich switzerland bacto tryptone was acquired from bd while the growth media and related reagents nacl kcl yeast extract plate count agar were purchased from sigma aldrich switzerland 2 2 microbial methods 2 2 1 e coli strains tk821 mc4100 pacyc184 and pgs058 preparation and growth conditions the e coli strains employed in this study are listed in table 1 tk821 is deficient in porins encoding genes ompf and ompc and is a derivative of the parent mc4100 e coli strain dsmz no 6574 compared to the previous study giannakis et al 2018 the mc4100 is the exact parent strain not simply in the same lineage the e coli pgs058 strain is harboring an oxyr over expressing plasmid derived from its parent strain e coli pacyc184 dsmz no 4439 with empty vector the mutant bacteria tk821 and pgs058 are derivatives of mc4100 and pacyc184 respectively the rationale between the choice was the following by assessing the differences of the porinless strain with its parent evidence for the participation of the porins will be obtained alongside with pinpointing the damage inside or outside the cell using the oxyr over expressing strain will show if the katg normally produced is enough to protect the cell and if the presence of extra katg could possibly shield it from the light induced oxidative stress cells were inoculated into 5 ml of luria bertani lb broth 10 0 g l bacto tryptone 5 0 g l yeast extract and 10 0 g l nacl in milli q water agitated under dark aerobic conditions cells were grown overnight to reach stationary phase sod synthesis will then be normal katg normally present and kate properly expressed imlay 2013 cells were separated by centrifugation at 500 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and the remaining bacterial pellet was washed three times with saline solution 8 0 g l nacl and 0 8 g l kcl this procedure resulted in approximately 109 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 2 2 2 bacterial enumeration procedure 1 ml of solution was sampled into 1 5 ml sterile plastic eppendorf vials at set intervals within the experiments and immediately enumerated bacterial count was performed by standard plate count via proper dilutions in 9 cm sterile petri dishes and the results are given in cfu ml alternatively when experiments are presented in text the logarithmic units of bacterial cultivability reduction logu may be used for comparison reasons all experiments were conducted at least in duplicates biological replicates in two separate reactors for each condition statistical replicates and enumerated by plating at least two serial dilutions technical replicates the detection limit for diluted samples is 10

cfu ml stock suspension in 100 ml milli q water and was introduced in uvb transparent pyrex glass reactors outer diameter 2 5 cm inner diameter 2 4 cm height 5 5 cm irradiation surface 98 cm2 the samples were placed within a light simulator equipped with uva lamps and ventilation for their cooling supplied with magnetic stirrers to obtain a constant mixing 450 rpm for the uva exposure experiments five uva blacklight lamps with a peak emission at 365 nm phillips tl 18 w blb provide 40 w m2 uva irradiance see supplementary fig s1 for details and spectra for the solar irradiation experiments the light source was provided by an atlas suntest cps solar simulator employing a 1500 w xenon lamp with a 560 cm2 effective illumination surface the lamp emits 0 5 of the photons below 300 nm uvb and 5 7 at the 320 400 nm region uva the irradiance was controlled by a global irradiance and uv radiometer kipp zonen models cm3 and cuv3 respectively the emission spectrum of the suntest can be found in supplementary fig s2 the experiments were designed to query the function of membrane porins and catalase under oxidative conditions i e under h2o2 uva uva h2o2 and photo fenton process during the tests h2o2 concentrations 10 ppm and fe2 h2o2 ratio 1 10 were chosen which have been well studied in previous works as optimal range for photo disinfection processes allowing relatively short experimentation times while allowing kinetic study marjanovic et al 2018 ruales lonfat et al 2016 spuhler et al 2010 valero et al 2017 the oxidants were measured and the changes of membrane oxidation and permeability and damage during the process were monitored to explain the oxidative pathways proposed see below for the corresponding methods in some instances 20 ppm h2o2 were added to make sure the effect is notable the maximum temperature was 30 c during treatment all experiments took place in milli q water at near neutral starting ph 6 5 0 1 and the final ph was no less than 5 9

spectrophotometer 2 4 2 membranes permeability and damage cell surface damage and the subsequent change in cell wall permeability was monitored by an intracellular enzyme of e coli β d galactoside ortho nitrophenyl β galactoside onpg is hydrolyzed to o nitrophenol onp when it reacts with β d galactosidase which results in a yellow color under alkaline conditions the production of onp over time was analyzed using a spectrophotometer at 420 nm ruales lonfat et al 2014 during the disinfection processes the degradation kinetics of intact and lysed cells was determined 4 5 ml of samples was added into an equal volume of milli q water and following with addition of 1 ml of onpg cells were removed by centrifugation and residual h2o2 was neutralized by catalase 1u of enzyme decomposes 1 μm of h2o2 at ph 7 3x this stoichiometric amount was used then 0 9 ml of the samples was transferred to a sterile eppendorf tube and every 3 min interval for 12 min 0 1 ml of a 1 m sodium carbonate bicarbonate buffer ph 10 was added to both stop the enzyme substrate reaction and to obtain maximum absorbance the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 420 nm the kinetics were determined by following the absorbance of the samples and the slope was determined by linear regression of absorbance versus time 2 4 3 lipid peroxidation the oxidation of the bacterial membrane was determined by lipid peroxidation levels and was detected by measuring the accumulation of malondialdehyde mda quantified through high performance liquid chromatography hplc an agilent hplc 1100 series equipped with a uv absorbance detector set at 268 nm was used to monitor the 0 2 μm filtered samples the mobile phase used was at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min of a 3 mm kh2po4 meoh 65 35 v v mixture at ph 4 through a nucleosil c18 marcherey nagel column with the retention time of mda at 5 2 min for calibration purposes a solution of mda was prepared through acid hydrolysis of 1 1 3 3 tetraethoxypropane soares et al 2004 tsaknis et al 1999 3 results and discussion in order to effectively assess the photo fenton pathways towards bacterial inactivation the effects of h2o2 uva light and their combination was firstly assessed for each group of bacteria the use of uva was preferred as an initial step in order to avoid the uvb effects of solar light following addition of iron was performed and experimentation under simulated solar light was assessed 3 1 effect of h2o2 and uva light on bacterial disinfection 3 1 1 inactivation of porinless mutant bacteria by h2o2 uva light and uva h2o2 fig 1 a c summarizes the experiments performed with a typical e coli strain mc4100 vs its ompc ompf strain hereon tk821 the rationale between the choice of these strains would be the different h2o2 influx towards the cell which we hypothesize to be limited in absence of the outer membrane porins in tk821 the dark blank tests with h2o2 indicate a negligible loss of cultivability at 10 ppm which becomes significant at 20 ppm p 0 05 manifesting at t 120 min it is firstly shown here that porins play a role in bacterial inactivation by h2o2 in dark while the delay indicates that it takes time for h2o2 to diffuse into the cell get scavenged and when this capacity is overcome to lead to inactivation nearly half of the h2o2 was depleted by mc4100 fig 1b which leads to cellular death this h2o2 depletion is the result of the possible scavenging action of the cell s enzymes as well as the oxidation reaction that takes place into the cell the fact that the mc4100 demonstrates this and not tk821 combined with the inactivation observed it indicates that it is probably the latter fig 1a shows that the use of uva light allows a complete inactivation of mutants porin bacteria tk821 and mc4100 within 4 h introduction of uva light to the system leads to bacterial inactivation in a similar trend with insignificant differences in cultivability between the two strains pearson correlation 0 532 i e not correlated however addition of h2o2 in the uva illuminated system affects mc4100 more than tk821 in the uva h2o2 system apparently cells are more sensitive to stresses and a complete inactivation is achieved within 150 min accompanied with a shorter time of a shoulder an obvious 3 logu difference between the two strains is shown in fig 1a fact that shows that membrane porin probably serves as an additional tunnel for outer h2o2 into cell while uv irradiation make cell more sensitive for diffusion berney et al 2006b hence more h2o2 diffuses into the mc4100 cell which fuels the intracellular photo fenton occurring and leads to an enhancement of the bacterial inactivation in order to verify the localization of the damages the mda formation and onpg hydrolysis were followed during the three types of treatment fig 1c the concentration of mda formed and onpg hydrolysis rate show that the changes of permeability are synchronous between inner and outer membrane all significant p 0 05 the mda levels present a similar trend in the dark with slightly smaller values for tk821 after 30 min since uva is unable to activate h2o2 we propose two hypotheses for this effect i a possible oxidation of mda itself due to by the higher concentration of h2o2 outside the cell as a side reaction as also found in ruales lonfat et al 2014 but for photo fenton or ii a possible increase of h2o2 influx increases the possibility of random oxidation reactions by h2o2 during its passage into the cytoplasm meanwhile the experimental results of mda formation in the illuminated processes all show significant difference p 0 05 between the two mutants in uva and uva h2o2 process the uva trends and levels were similar to the ones after addition of h2o2 which is an indication that the enhanced uva h2o2 inactivation is an intracellular event rather than extracellular i e an accelerated photo fenton process the onpg hydrolysis rates show a steady increase of the rate over time of exposure to h2o2 in the dark however the illuminated systems show a peak followed by a decrease most likely due to oxidation of onp the measurable molecule the identical shape and height of peaks shows that the mode of action under uva and uva h2o2 is similar and the delay presented in tk821 supports the hypotheses of a an enhanced intracellular photo fenton manifesting in intensely parent strain that allows more h2o2 diffusion inside the cell and b the role of porins in the diffusion of h2o2 into the cell as a regulator of this event 3 1 2 inactivation of catalase overproducing bacteria by h2o2 uva light and uva h2o2 fig 2 a c summarizes the experiments with a typical e coli strain that carries plasmid pacyc184 and its corresponding mutant with constitutive non stop oxyr expression pgs058 the rationale between the choice of these two plasmids is that the latter would have the stress response already activated and constantly express the katg gene to generate hydroxyperoxidase i hpi which will scavenge the h2o2 that normally enters the cell the dark blank tests with 10 ppm h2o2 do not indicate any difference in cultivability while a slight decrease is observed under 20 ppm this change is attributed to the oxidation of the outer membrane by the elevated h2o2 presence accumulated outside the cell exceeding the inward flux the penetrated intracellular h2o2 induces the intracellular oxidation in parallel with the extracellular one accelerating cell death interestingly the two strains have an identical behavior under both uva and uva h2o2 fig 2a no significant difference is observed as high correlation was measured between the two strains pearson correlation 0 995 i e highly correlated this is a clear indication for the role and activity of catalases into the cell it has been reported that h2o2 is an important photoproduct under uva radiation on bacteria it is expected that the overproducing strain pgs058 would be far more resistant to h2o2 than the strain pacyc184 eisenstark and perrot 1987 here the cells used were already in the stationary phase where activation of the rpos system and kate hpii expression is responsible for h2o2 scavenging nevertheless hpi is known to be more light and heat sensitive berney et al 2006a bosshard et al 2010a but its overexpression is effectively scavenging h2o2 the proof can be found in fig 2b where higher amounts of h2o2 are eliminated in the dark by the over expressing pgs058 strain these observations underline the importance of katg and kate into h2o2 scavenging but also indicate that under light even an over expressed gene cannot produce enough catalases to protect the cell it becomes clear that light inactivates the higher quantities of catalases as easily the mda formation in the dark follows a steady increasing trend with higher levels for the overexpressing strain p 0 01 fig 2c which supports the hypothesis that in the dark external h2o2 works on bacterial extracellular oxidation while h2o2 it slowly diffuses into the cell to initiate an intracellular oxidation process uva and uva h2o2 show lower mda formation that verifies the enhanced intracellular inactivation inflicted by this process the onpg rates present similar trends among the tk821 mc4100 strains where h2o2 in the dark inflicts a slow but steady increase in permeability while uva and uva h2o2 present a peak the similar heights and shapes in the two tests combined with the faster appearance of the peak under uva h2o2 validate the enhanced intracellular inactivation hypothesis these two results are actually an analogue of the behavior found in the ompc ompf strain but the peroxide flux is modified because of the intracellular scavenging instead of the blocking of porins here the higher h2o2 scavenging creates a bigger difference of h2o2 levels inside and outside the cell hence a faster gradient is generated leading to higher random oxidative attacks or the mda is degraded outside the cell in the case of pacyc184 which has more h2o2 in the matrix or in the cell for onp degradation 3 2 effect of fenton reagents h2o2 fe2 on uva assisted bacterial inactivation after analysis of the h2o2 uva and their combined action on e coli we proceeded to a uva assisted photo fenton process and the results are summarized in fig 3 a b by comparing the traces of tk821 and mc4100 we can first note that the inactivation times have dropped from 240 min under uva to 150 and 90 for tk821 uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 while lower times are necessary for mc4100 i e 90 and 60 min for uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 respectively the inactivation rate is accelerated by the oh produced via the fenton reaction fig 3a in the meantime the shoulder shortens to 30 min compared with uva alone 60 min or uva h2o2 system 45 min this is an indication for the role that porin mutations played in the transport of h2o2 and now of fe2 the similar h2o2 evolution indicates that the dominating mechanism is different where in tk821 this excess h2o2 results in oh production outside the cell which is apparently a slower process to inactivate a cell than the corresponding intracellular fenton we have previously estimated more than twice as oh necessary to externally inactivate bacteria giannakis et al 2018 furthermore the higher mda accumulation in tk821 shows that the effect was indeed extracellular the intracellular oxidation of the tk821 strain occurs later than mc4100 due to the lower h2o2 available to initiate the photo fenton reaction this effect is verified by the lower and delayed onpg peak fig 3b where a lower and delayed 60 min onpg hydrolysis rate of tk821 than mc4100 45 min is observed onp is intracellular and in the case of mc4100 we propose that a combined intra and extra cellular damages happens leading to faster and more intense permeability loss while in tk821 the h2o2 stays out of the cell oxidizing the cell wall components unilaterally in mc4100 the intracellular h2o2 and fe2 have a bilateral effect with higher intracellular effect the comparison among the other two strains is more straightforward as even less differences are demonstrated we observed that the inactivation pattern and the localization indicators of mda and onpg are almost identical p 0 05 it is similar on consumption of h2o2 formation of mda onpg hydrolysis rate and rates peak time under these circumstances the strains have no difference in photo fenton process fully proves that catalase loses the ability of degrade h2o2 under uva exposure also the lower levels of onpg hydrolysis at the peak times 60 min compared to uva h2o2 clearly demonstrate that the cell integrity was not decomposed when it got inactivated this is a clear indication that the action mode is similar and intracellular although katg was found important for cell protection against h2o2 stress uva light completely incapacitates the catalase scavenging capacity even at high amounts 3 3 change from uva to solar irradiation and its effect on bacterial disinfection following we have assessed the same pairs of mutants under a solar simulator instead of uva light while the mda and onpg did not present significant differences data not shown the cultivability has demonstrated some changes normally the inactivation kinetics was ksolar ksolar h2o2 kphoto fenton even with higher h2o2 amounts for solar h2o2 than photo fenton however distinct differences were noted among the strains more specifically when the tk821 mc4100 pair was assessed fig 4 a we noted same tendencies for the solar h2o2 and solar fe2 with the corresponding ones assisted by uva but with significantly smaller differences among the two strains conversely when comparing the pacyc184 and pgs058 a difference has appeared among the two strains fig 4b the difference observed in both strains is attributed to the presence of the uvb fraction of emitted light the only change in the system which inflicts an extra intracellular inactivation pathway that of the direct inactivation by dna dimerization giannakis 2018 and a possible uvb mediated h2o2 activation to produce oh in the bulk also taking account the latter pair of strains and the presented difference we observe here in another manner a possible protective effect previously reported in literature katg protects e coli from uvb stress hence an over expression brings this small delay heck et al 2010 in summary the solar tests were well represented by the uva only experiments but considering the description of the inactivation pathway apart from the uva mediated catalase inactivation actions they may affect the expression of catalases since they damage the dna 3 4 integrated mechanism of bacterial disinfection under light h2o2 and fe2 according to the experimental results in fig 5 the bacterial inactivation mechanism under uva exposure h2o2 and both fenton reagents is proposed by comparison of the two different sets of strains in this study when h2o2 was added into the solution bacterial inactivation is caused i by extracellular oxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipids in membrane alteration of the permeability of cell membrane and ii the intracellular oxidation by reaction of h2o2 with oxidizable moieties and or fe to generate the hydroxyl radical the extracellular inactivation is achieved in the following order decomposition of the outer membrane caused by peroxidation process resulting in cytoplasmatic membrane disorder and afterwards in cellular death we have measured here a higher formation of mda and onpg hydrolysis rate as well as a time difference between inactivation and h2o2 consumption for tk821 and mc4100 which indicate that h2o2 in the system is consumed on damage outer membrane tk821 the difference of inactivation contributes to the remaining h2o2 penetrating into mc4100 escaped from catalyzing could induce intracellular oxidation leading bacterial death however as we report that almost half of the h2o2 was used up for oxidizing the outer membrane but did not result in cell inactivation hence we can hereon suggest that the extracellular oxidation takes place but is late to inactivate bacteria while the catalases can scavenge a certain amount of it we also report that h2o2 can use cell porins to diffuse but not as an exclusive pathway and hpi can degrade it to h2o and o2 in the cytoplasm the continuous incoming h2o2 flux into the cell that was not degraded participates in intracellular oxidation leading to cell death hence as we saw in the dark experiments the higher expression of oxyr and the resulting katg are mediating to maintain the intracellular physiological ros levels to harmless events we also confirm the previous literature suggestion that the uva irradiation could damage the membranes lipids and cellular proteins through the oxidative stress caused by ros but we bring evidence that this takes place from within the cells firstly it is known that uva generates ros in the presence of o2 in water to form such as 1o2 o2 ho and h2o2 that could attack the cell uva wavelength mainly activates intracellular photo sensitizers like flavins quinones nadh nadph and others producing ros to lead to internal damages as the peroxidation of proteins and lipids or dna rupture generating single strand breaks and then intracellular substance release outside with losses in membrane permeability cause the cell death berney et al 2006b bosshard et al 2010b our mda and onpg measurements of both sets of strains support this hypothesis nevertheless we suggest that the damage of the outer membrane of both tk821 mc4100 and pacyc184 pgs058 showed that the extracellular inactivation contributes less on cell death as shown by mda whereas the fact that the peak of onpg hydrolysis rate appeared on 120 min for both mutants illustrates that the intracellular ros can degrade the membrane and lead to its permeabilization furthermore uva irradiation inactivates the enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and hydroperoxidases which can no longer effectively convert superoxide to h2o2 and then degrade it our use of the oxyr mutant that produces excess katg highlights its role but also reveals that uva incapacitates its role of h2o2 scavenging combined with the fact that fe s clusters and ferritin protein release irons into cytoplasm these constitute the necessary reagents to start a photo fenton reaction inside the cell producing oh that damage intracellular substances and contribute to cell death we measured a lower mda formation and peak of onpg hydrolysis rate during the bacterial inactivation process which in turn indicates that intracellular oxidation mostly occurs in uva irradiation process as far as the fenton reagents addition are concerned a h2o2 in the uva h2o2 system our experimental results point towards an identical oxidative mechanism as in uva irradiation process but in an enhanced version we stated before that bacteria become more sensitive under uva irradiation incapacitation of catalase and membrane damage onpg mds so it is easier for outer oxidants to enter into the cell meanwhile the iron released from inactivated iron related proteins and the h2o2 accumulated as catalase inactivated under uva irradiation plus the added amounts in the bulk increasing the production of oh from the internal photo fenton reaction this pathway of intracellular inactivation initiated by uva light with h2o2 is fully proved by our measurements of mda formation and onpg hydrolysis rate of mutant cells the highest peak of onpg hydrolysis rate of mc4100 even 30 min in advance of tk821 indicated that h2o2 penetrates into the cell to initiate the intracellular oxidation and it certifies that h2o2 also uses porins to diffuse into the cell and to induce extra intracellular damage faster leakage of periplasm substances and alter the permeability to inactive the bacteria under uva stress always after the catalases are fully inactivated as seen in the identical graphs pacyc184 pgs058 strains b fe2 addition of fe2 theoretically starts an extracellular photo fenton reaction and an oxidation of the outer cell wall however we measure similar trends and amounts of mda and onpg hydrolysis rates between uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 in both sets of strains this fact shows that it does not occur so intensely outside the cell but intracellularly with the fenton reagents diffusion into the cell and enhancing the existing pathways by light and h2o2 4 conclusions the aim of this work was to specify the role of light and h2o2 in the photo fenton bacterial inactivation mechanisms in water the porin and catalase mutants employed lead to new observations towards this objective when h2o2 was added in water the external h2o2 proceeds to damage the cell membrane meanwhile we evidence that the cell membrane porins play a role in the h2o2 diffusion into the cell facilitating the intracellular oxidation but even in stationary phase cells were kate is the primary scavenger katg could catalyze h2o2 into water and oxygen hence intracellular oxidation occurs with a delay under uva irradiation the cell becomes more sensitive to stress that oxidants are easier to penetrate the cell and induce intracellular oxidation more specifically uva initiates an h2o2 mediated inactivation cascade since o2 in water and photo sensitizers in cell produce ros under irradiation to enhance the intracellular photo fenton oxidation the addition of h2o2 under light conditions has been shown to tip the scales towards an intracellular photo fenton process while not even the catalase over expressing strain was able to protect the cell especially we prove that the pgs058 has the overexpressing catalase advantage but under light katg even at excess amounts will be rendered inutile under irradiation and most likely an intracellular photo fenton is still initiated iron added in water enhances the intracellular damage described before according to the damage patterns of membrane oxidation and leakage of intracellular substance the intracellular photo fenton still is the main inactivation mechanism in disinfection by the photo fenton process despite the initial presence of h2o2 and fe in the bulk finally it can be concluded that solar photo fenton is an intracellular oxidation with the added enhancement of direct uvb

17832,the bacterial inactivation mechanisms by solar light and the photo fenton process is still a matter of debate in this study we bring evidence towards the elucidation of the mechanisms that govern photo fenton disinfection at near neutral ph with the use of porin deficient and catalase over producing e coli strains in conjunction with measurements of cell wall oxidation and permeability we are able to i highlight the role of the aforementioned components in bacterial inactivation and ii localize the damages in the intracellular domain despite the addition of the fenton reagents in the bulk we report that h2o2 oxidizes cell walls but under light the process is of low significance uva initiated an intracellular oxidation process based on excess accumulated h2o2 while the uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 processes have the same effect with light albeit enhanced as shown by malondialdehyde mda production and onpg hydrolysis rates finally compared to the uva assisted photo fenton process its solar counterpart is enhanced by the direct uvb effects on bacterial dna in conclusion we have sufficient evidence to postulate that the photo fenton process is intracellular and propose

reduce the exposure times and limit bacterial regrowth giannakis et al 2015 ndounla et al 2013 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and the fenton reagents have been applied to enhance bacterial inactivation during sodis ndounla and pulgarin 2015 sciacca et al 2010 villar navarro et al 2019 due to their non toxic nature and compatibility with sodis these methods have attracted interest with its involved parameters such as the light irradiance the dose of hydrogen peroxide and iron the temperature of operation etc already well studied rodríguez chueca et al 2019 rubio et al 2013 spuhler et al 2010 however although some insights on the role of light boyle et al 2008 h2o2 castro alférez et al 2016 etc exist the detailed mechanisms of bacterial disinfection under these methods is still not entirely unveiled besides the enhancement of sodis and its potential as a drinking water treatment process the simultaneous addition of fe and h2o2 can induce the photo fenton reaction a method that has been long proposed as effective for wastewater ww disinfection ortega gómez et al 2014 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 with the advent of the raceway pond reactors as a prominent reactor for ww treatment de la obra et al 2019 esteban garcía et al 2017 the potentials of photo fenton as a disinfection method before ww reuse e g in agriculture can be now further considered however similarly to drinking water although some works have intended to dissociate the events that take place during ww disinfection de la obra jiménez et al 2020 attributing the pathways of inactivation to the simultaneous actions taking place during photo fenton is a highly complex task considering the main inactivation force during oxidative treatment previous studies suggest that bacteria are inactivated by reactive oxygen species ros gianazza et al 2007 kohantorabi et al 2019 generally depending on their place of generation ros kill bacteria by oxidative damage to membrane enzymes structural proteins dna and lipids cho et al 2004 hoerter et al 2005b however bacteria possess protective enzyme s in order to control their intracellular ros concentration by catalyzing oxidative reactions for their protection ezraty et al 2017 hoerter et al 2005a such as catalases and peroxidases it has been proven that 0 2 μm h2o2 is naturally present in bacteria while cytotoxicity levels are encountered with as low as 0 5 μm h2o2 imlay 2008 park et al 2005 currently although we arrive at a convergence on the possible inactivation pathways for sodis castro alférez et al 2016 giannakis et al 2016 the photo fenton at near neutral ph is still facing controversies as far as the dominant mechanisms that lead to bacterial inactivation are concerned mosteo et al 2020 or the main oxidants that lead to inactivation by the fenton process ho or ferryl farinelli et al 2020 in order to further understand the composite photo fenton process and the fundamentals behind the current study we present here the two parts in brief uva 400 315 nm radiation could generates ros as superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh h2o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 by dissolved oxygen in water and photo sensitizers in cell hoerter et al 2005a santos et al 2013 adding h2o2 in water can either directly damage the membrane of the cell if encountered in high concentrations uhl and dukan 2016 or diffuse into the cell to imbalance the steady state concentration of intracellular h2o2 seaver and imlay 2001a 2001b normally the excess h2o2 is catalyzed into water and oxygen by cell s catalases in order to keep its ros balance imlay 2008 pericone et al 2003 however under light this capacity is diminished hoerter et al 2005a 2005b furthermore h2o2 in cells could react with iron released from the fe s clusters and initiate an internal fenton reaction which will eventually kill the bacteria jang and imlay 2007 or oh can be generated from h2o2 via electron transfer from atp bosshard et al 2010a in the presence of both h2o2 and ferrous iron fe2 in water under light oh is quickly generated in the bulk photo fenton reaction which normally would be resulting in cell membrane breakage and bacterial inactivation park and imlay 2003 however primary data indicated that compared to e g tio2 photo fenton works in the intracellular domain ruales lonfat et al 2014 some more recent works have shown a difference in photo fenton mediated killing when h2o2 was allowed or delayed in entering the cell giannakis et al 2018 hence there are two interesting points whose implication holds the key to explain and localize the photo fenton process action namely the fenton reagents diffusion into the cell and their handling under light stress to verify the role of external h2o2 participates in oxidation mechanism in water disinfection it is important to know the way of h2o2 transport into cell it has been generally accepted that h2o2 can diffuse freely into the cell through the lipid bilayer however e coli bacteria have porins 1 1 1 3 nm channels for transport of small hydrophilic molecules across the outer membrane masi et al 2019 vergalli et al 2019 ompf and ompc are the two outer membrane porins of e coli their role has been queried and the first data show a possible role in affecting h2o2 influx giannakis et al 2018 furthermore the intracellular ros may be detoxified by enzymes such as superoxide dismutases sods catalases and peroxidases in the cytoplasm it is important to know how these enzymes especially the scavengers of h2o2 render bacteria adaptive to oxidative stress environment it has been proven that oxyr oxidative stress response regulon is a transcriptional activator of the stress response genes which could directly detect the oxidative stress scavenge h2o2 and repair damage to protect the cell from h2o2 toxicity chiang and schellhorn 2012 on the other hand katg is the bifunctional hydroperoxidase i hpi that demonstrates both catalase and peroxidase character and is induced by oxyr activation after its initiation by high intracellular h2o2 concentrations chelikani et al 2004 as such the hydroperoxidase i hpi encoded by katg could protect cells against oxidative stress sun et al 2016 however since light and heat affect hydroxyperoxidases their capacity must be further scrutinized in this work bacteria deficient of ompf and ompc porinless are applied to distinguish the extra and intra cellular mechanisms as well as catalase over productive strains in order to understand the response of h2o2 scavenging enzymes under light assisted fenton stress more specifically the porinless e coli tk821 and its parent strain mc4100 were employed to assess the role of h2o2 under light or dark and the photo fenton process by limiting the flux of external oxidants into cell building on our previous study on the topic giannakis et al 2018 but uva light is now used to avoid the genetic damage by uvb in parallel strains with h2o2 scavenger mutations i e oxyr overexpression and subsequent katg overproduction pgs058 and its corresponding strain empty vector plasmid pacyc184 were treated under uva light in presence of h2o2 and or both fenton reagents in order to assess the protective activity of catalases against the oxidative stress generated by the action of light and the fenton reagents the oxidation of membrane lipids and the permeability change of the cell wall was followed and compared in all conditions thus assessing the localization of the damage and aid towards the resolution of the intracellular and extracellular mechanisms of photo fenton disinfection at near neutral ph 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the reagents and chemicals used for this study were of high purity analytical grade the reactants applied for the fenton and sole h2o2 process were ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w v both supplied from sigma aldrich switzerland the materials used for measurements as titanium iv oxysulfate tioso4 1 9 2 1 and ortho nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside onpg both aforementioned products were purchased from sigma aldrich switzerland bacto tryptone was acquired from bd while the growth media and related reagents nacl kcl yeast extract plate count agar were purchased from sigma aldrich switzerland 2 2 microbial methods 2 2 1 e coli strains tk821 mc4100 pacyc184 and pgs058 preparation and growth conditions the e coli strains employed in this study are listed in table 1 tk821 is deficient in porins encoding genes ompf and ompc and is a derivative of the parent mc4100 e coli strain dsmz no 6574 compared to the previous study giannakis et al 2018 the mc4100 is the exact parent strain not simply in the same lineage the e coli pgs058 strain is harboring an oxyr over expressing plasmid derived from its parent strain e coli pacyc184 dsmz no 4439 with empty vector the mutant bacteria tk821 and pgs058 are derivatives of mc4100 and pacyc184 respectively the rationale between the choice was the following by assessing the differences of the porinless strain with its parent evidence for the participation of the porins will be obtained alongside with pinpointing the damage inside or outside the cell using the oxyr over expressing strain will show if the katg normally produced is enough to protect the cell and if the presence of extra katg could possibly shield it from the light induced oxidative stress cells were inoculated into 5 ml of luria bertani lb broth 10 0 g l bacto tryptone 5 0 g l yeast extract and 10 0 g l nacl in milli q water agitated under dark aerobic conditions cells were grown overnight to reach stationary phase sod synthesis will then be normal katg normally present and kate properly expressed imlay 2013 cells were separated by centrifugation at 500 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and the remaining bacterial pellet was washed three times with saline solution 8 0 g l nacl and 0 8 g l kcl this procedure resulted in approximately 109 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 2 2 2 bacterial enumeration procedure 1 ml of solution was sampled into 1 5 ml sterile plastic eppendorf vials at set intervals within the experiments and immediately enumerated bacterial count was performed by standard plate count via proper dilutions in 9 cm sterile petri dishes and the results are given in cfu ml alternatively when experiments are presented in text the logarithmic units of bacterial cultivability reduction logu may be used for comparison reasons all experiments were conducted at least in duplicates biological replicates in two separate reactors for each condition statistical replicates and enumerated by plating at least two serial dilutions technical replicates the detection limit for diluted samples is 10

linear regression the variance and correlation tests were performed by spss for windows 2 3 experimental details the working bacterial suspension of 106 cfu ml was prepared by dilution from the 109 cfu ml stock suspension in 100 ml milli q water and was introduced in uvb transparent pyrex glass reactors outer diameter 2 5 cm inner diameter 2 4 cm height 5 5 cm irradiation surface 98 cm2 the samples were placed within a light simulator equipped with uva lamps and ventilation for their cooling supplied with magnetic stirrers to obtain a constant mixing 450 rpm for the uva exposure experiments five uva blacklight lamps with a peak emission at 365 nm phillips tl 18 w blb provide 40 w m2 uva irradiance see supplementary fig s1 for details and spectra for the solar irradiation experiments the light source was provided by an atlas suntest cps solar simulator employing a 1500 w xenon lamp with a 560 cm2 effective illumination surface the lamp emits 0 5 of the photons below 300 nm uvb and 5 7 at the 320 400 nm region uva the irradiance was controlled by a global irradiance and uv radiometer kipp zonen models cm3 and cuv3 respectively the emission spectrum of the suntest can be found in supplementary fig s2 the experiments were designed to query the function of membrane porins and catalase under oxidative conditions i e under h2o2 uva uva h2o2 and photo fenton process during the tests h2o2 concentrations 10 ppm and fe2 h2o2 ratio 1 10 were chosen which have been well studied in previous works as optimal range for photo disinfection processes allowing relatively short experimentation times while allowing kinetic study marjanovic et al 2018 ruales lonfat et al 2016 spuhler et al 2010 valero et al 2017 the oxidants were measured and the changes of membrane oxidation and permeability and damage during the process were monitored to explain the oxidative pathways proposed see below for the corresponding methods in some instances 20 ppm h2o2 were added to make sure the effect is notable the maximum temperature was 30 c during treatment all experiments took place in milli q water at near neutral starting ph 6 5 0 1 and the final ph was no less than 5 9 0 1 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 determination of h2o2 the concentration of h2o2 was monitored by titanium iv oxysulfate solution and the subsequent measurement of the pertitanic acid at 410 nm din method 38409 part 15 dev 18 the extracellular h2o2 concentration was determined via pre defined calibration curves the limit of detection for the method is 0 1 mg l measured by a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer 2 4 2 membranes permeability and damage cell surface damage and the subsequent change in cell wall permeability was monitored by an intracellular enzyme of e coli β d galactoside ortho nitrophenyl β galactoside onpg is hydrolyzed to o nitrophenol onp when it reacts with β d galactosidase which results in a yellow color under alkaline conditions the production of onp over time was analyzed using a spectrophotometer at 420 nm ruales lonfat et al 2014 during the disinfection processes the degradation kinetics of intact and lysed cells was determined 4 5 ml of samples was added into an equal volume of milli q water and following with addition of 1 ml of onpg cells were removed by centrifugation and residual h2o2 was neutralized by catalase 1u of enzyme decomposes 1 μm of h2o2 at ph 7 3x this stoichiometric amount was used then 0 9 ml of the samples was transferred to a sterile eppendorf tube and every 3 min interval for 12 min 0 1 ml of a 1 m sodium carbonate bicarbonate buffer ph 10 was added to both stop the enzyme substrate reaction and to obtain maximum absorbance the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 420 nm the kinetics were determined by following the absorbance of the samples and the slope was determined by linear regression of absorbance versus time 2 4 3 lipid peroxidation the oxidation of the bacterial membrane was determined by lipid peroxidation levels and was detected by measuring the accumulation of malondialdehyde mda quantified through high performance liquid chromatography hplc an agilent hplc 1100 series equipped with a uv absorbance detector set at 268 nm was used to monitor the 0 2 μm filtered samples the mobile phase used was at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min of a 3 mm kh2po4 meoh 65 35 v v mixture at ph 4 through a nucleosil c18 marcherey nagel column with the retention time of mda at 5 2 min for calibration purposes a solution of mda was prepared through acid hydrolysis of 1 1 3 3 tetraethoxypropane soares et al 2004 tsaknis et al 1999 3 results and discussion in order to effectively assess the photo fenton pathways towards bacterial inactivation the effects of h2o2 uva light and their combination was firstly assessed for each group of bacteria the use of uva was preferred as an initial step in order to avoid the uvb effects of solar light following addition of iron was performed and experimentation under simulated solar light was assessed 3 1 effect of h2o2 and uva light on bacterial disinfection 3 1 1 inactivation of porinless mutant bacteria by h2o2 uva light and uva h2o2 fig 1 a c summarizes the experiments performed with a typical e coli strain mc4100 vs its ompc ompf strain hereon tk821 the rationale between the choice of these strains would be the different h2o2 influx towards the cell which we hypothesize to be limited in absence of the outer membrane porins in tk821 the dark blank tests with h2o2 indicate a negligible loss of cultivability at 10 ppm which becomes significant at 20 ppm p 0 05 manifesting at t 120 min it is firstly shown here that porins play a role in bacterial inactivation by h2o2 in dark while the delay indicates that it takes time for h2o2 to diffuse into the cell get scavenged and when this capacity is overcome to lead to inactivation nearly half of the h2o2 was depleted by mc4100 fig 1b which leads to cellular death this h2o2 depletion is the result of the possible scavenging action of the cell s enzymes as well as the oxidation reaction that takes place into the cell the fact that the mc4100 demonstrates this and not tk821 combined with the inactivation observed it indicates that it is probably the latter fig 1a shows that the use of uva light allows a complete inactivation of mutants porin bacteria tk821 and mc4100 within 4 h introduction of uva light to the system leads to bacterial inactivation in a similar trend with insignificant differences in cultivability between the two strains pearson correlation 0 532 i e not correlated however addition of h2o2 in the uva illuminated system affects mc4100 more than tk821 in the uva h2o2 system apparently cells are more sensitive to stresses and a complete inactivation is achieved within 150 min accompanied with a shorter time of a shoulder an obvious 3 logu difference between the two strains is shown in fig 1a fact that shows that membrane porin probably serves as an additional tunnel for outer h2o2 into cell while uv irradiation make cell more sensitive for diffusion berney et al 2006b hence more h2o2 diffuses into the mc4100 cell which fuels the intracellular photo fenton occurring and leads to an enhancement of the bacterial inactivation in order to verify the localization of the damages the mda formation and onpg hydrolysis were followed during the three types of treatment fig 1c the concentration of mda formed and onpg hydrolysis rate show that the changes of permeability are synchronous between inner and outer membrane all significant p 0 05 the mda levels present a similar trend in the dark with slightly smaller values for tk821 after 30 min since uva is unable to activate h2o2 we propose two hypotheses for this effect i a possible oxidation of mda itself due to by the higher concentration of h2o2 outside the cell as a side reaction as also found in ruales lonfat et al 2014 but for photo fenton or ii a possible increase of h2o2 influx increases the possibility of random oxidation reactions by h2o2 during its passage into the cytoplasm meanwhile the experimental results of mda formation in the illuminated processes all show significant difference p 0 05 between the two mutants in uva and uva h2o2 process the uva trends and levels were similar to the ones after addition of h2o2 which is an indication that the enhanced uva h2o2 inactivation is an intracellular event rather than extracellular i e an accelerated photo fenton process the onpg hydrolysis rates show a steady increase of the rate over time of exposure to h2o2 in the dark however the illuminated systems show a peak followed by a decrease most likely due to oxidation of onp the measurable molecule the identical shape and height of peaks shows that the mode of action under uva and uva h2o2 is similar and the delay presented in tk821 supports the hypotheses of a an enhanced intracellular photo fenton manifesting in intensely parent strain that allows more h2o2 diffusion inside the cell and b the role of porins in the diffusion of h2o2 into the cell as a regulator of this event 3 1 2 inactivation of catalase overproducing bacteria by h2o2 uva light and uva h2o2 fig 2 a c summarizes the experiments with a typical e coli strain that carries plasmid pacyc184 and its corresponding mutant with constitutive non stop oxyr expression pgs058 the rationale between the choice of these two plasmids is that the latter would have the stress response already activated and constantly express the katg gene to generate hydroxyperoxidase i hpi which will scavenge the h2o2 that normally enters the cell the dark blank tests with 10 ppm h2o2 do not indicate any difference in cultivability while a slight decrease is observed under 20 ppm this change is attributed to the oxidation of the outer membrane by the elevated h2o2 presence accumulated outside the cell exceeding the inward flux the penetrated intracellular h2o2 induces the intracellular oxidation in parallel with the extracellular one accelerating cell death interestingly the two strains have an identical behavior under both uva and uva h2o2 fig 2a no significant difference is observed as high correlation was measured between the two strains pearson correlation 0 995 i e highly correlated this is a clear indication for the role and activity of catalases into the cell it has been reported that h2o2 is an important photoproduct under uva radiation on bacteria it is expected that the overproducing strain pgs058 would be far more resistant to h2o2 than the strain pacyc184 eisenstark and perrot 1987 here the cells used were already in the stationary phase where activation of the rpos system and kate hpii expression is responsible for h2o2 scavenging nevertheless hpi is known to be more light and heat sensitive berney et al 2006a bosshard et al 2010a but its overexpression is effectively scavenging h2o2 the proof can be found in fig 2b where higher amounts of h2o2 are eliminated in the dark by the over expressing pgs058 strain these observations underline the importance of katg and kate into h2o2 scavenging but also indicate that under light even an over expressed gene cannot produce enough catalases to protect the cell it becomes clear that light inactivates the higher quantities of catalases as easily the mda formation in the dark follows a steady increasing trend with higher levels for the overexpressing strain p 0 01 fig 2c which supports the hypothesis that in the dark external h2o2 works on bacterial extracellular oxidation while h2o2 it slowly diffuses into the cell to initiate an intracellular oxidation process uva and uva h2o2 show lower mda formation that verifies the enhanced intracellular inactivation inflicted by this process the onpg rates present similar trends among the tk821 mc4100 strains where h2o2 in the dark inflicts a slow but steady increase in permeability while uva and uva h2o2 present a peak the similar heights and shapes in the two tests combined with the faster appearance of the peak under uva h2o2 validate the enhanced intracellular inactivation hypothesis these two results are actually an analogue of the behavior found in the ompc ompf strain but the peroxide flux is modified because of the intracellular scavenging instead of the blocking of porins here the higher h2o2 scavenging creates a bigger difference of h2o2 levels inside and outside the cell hence a faster gradient is generated leading to higher random oxidative attacks or the mda is degraded outside the cell in the case of pacyc184 which has more h2o2 in the matrix or in the cell for onp degradation 3 2 effect of fenton reagents h2o2 fe2 on uva assisted bacterial inactivation after analysis of the h2o2 uva and their combined action on e coli we proceeded to a uva assisted photo fenton process and the results are summarized in fig 3 a b by comparing the traces of tk821 and mc4100 we can first note that the inactivation times have dropped from 240 min under uva to 150 and 90 for tk821 uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 while lower times are necessary for mc4100 i e 90 and 60 min for uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 respectively the inactivation rate is accelerated by the oh produced via the fenton reaction fig 3a in the meantime the shoulder shortens to 30 min compared with uva alone 60 min or uva h2o2 system 45 min this is an indication for the role that porin mutations played in the transport of h2o2 and now of fe2 the similar h2o2 evolution indicates that the dominating mechanism is different where in tk821 this excess h2o2 results in oh production outside the cell which is apparently a slower process to inactivate a cell than the corresponding intracellular fenton we have previously estimated more than twice as oh necessary to externally inactivate bacteria giannakis et al 2018 furthermore the higher mda accumulation in tk821 shows that the effect was indeed extracellular the intracellular oxidation of the tk821 strain occurs later than mc4100 due to the lower h2o2 available to initiate the photo fenton reaction this effect is verified by the lower and delayed onpg peak fig 3b where a lower and delayed 60 min onpg hydrolysis rate of tk821 than mc4100 45 min is observed onp is intracellular and in the case of mc4100 we propose that a combined intra and extra cellular damages happens leading to faster and more intense permeability loss while in tk821 the h2o2 stays out of the cell oxidizing the cell wall components unilaterally in mc4100 the intracellular h2o2 and fe2 have a bilateral effect with higher intracellular effect the comparison among the other two strains is more straightforward as even less differences are demonstrated we observed that the inactivation pattern and the localization indicators of mda and onpg are almost identical p 0 05 it is similar on consumption of h2o2 formation of mda onpg hydrolysis rate and rates peak time under these circumstances the strains have no difference in photo fenton process fully proves that catalase loses the ability of degrade h2o2 under uva exposure also the lower levels of onpg hydrolysis at the peak times 60 min compared to uva h2o2 clearly demonstrate that the cell integrity was not decomposed when it got inactivated this is a clear indication that the action mode is similar and intracellular although katg was found important for cell protection against h2o2 stress uva light completely incapacitates the catalase scavenging capacity even at high amounts 3 3 change from uva to solar irradiation and its effect on bacterial disinfection following we have assessed the same pairs of mutants under a solar simulator instead of uva light while the mda and onpg did not present significant differences data not shown the cultivability has demonstrated some changes normally the inactivation kinetics was ksolar ksolar h2o2 kphoto fenton even with higher h2o2 amounts for solar h2o2 than photo fenton however distinct differences were noted among the strains more specifically when the tk821 mc4100 pair was assessed fig 4 a we noted same tendencies for the solar h2o2 and solar fe2 with the corresponding ones assisted by uva but with significantly smaller differences among the two strains conversely when comparing the pacyc184 and pgs058 a difference has appeared among the two strains fig 4b the difference observed in both strains is attributed to the presence of the uvb fraction of emitted light the only change in the system which inflicts an extra intracellular inactivation pathway that of the direct inactivation by dna dimerization giannakis 2018 and a possible uvb mediated h2o2 activation to produce oh in the bulk also taking account the latter pair of strains and the presented difference we observe here in another manner a possible protective effect previously reported in literature katg protects e coli from uvb stress hence an over expression brings this small delay heck et al 2010 in summary the solar tests were well represented by the uva only experiments but considering the description of the inactivation pathway apart from the uva mediated catalase inactivation actions they may affect the expression of catalases since they damage the dna 3 4 integrated mechanism of bacterial disinfection under light h2o2 and fe2 according to the experimental results in fig 5 the bacterial inactivation mechanism under uva exposure h2o2 and both fenton reagents is proposed by comparison of the two different sets of strains in this study when h2o2 was added into the solution bacterial inactivation is caused i by extracellular oxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipids in membrane alteration of the permeability of cell membrane and ii the intracellular oxidation by reaction of h2o2 with oxidizable moieties and or fe to generate the hydroxyl radical the extracellular inactivation is achieved in the following order decomposition of the outer membrane caused by peroxidation process resulting in cytoplasmatic membrane disorder and afterwards in cellular death we have measured here a higher formation of mda and onpg hydrolysis rate as well as a time difference between inactivation and h2o2 consumption for tk821 and mc4100 which indicate that h2o2 in the system is consumed on damage outer membrane tk821 the difference of inactivation contributes to the remaining h2o2 penetrating into mc4100 escaped from catalyzing could induce intracellular oxidation leading bacterial death however as we report that almost half of the h2o2 was used up for oxidizing the outer membrane but did not result in cell inactivation hence we can hereon suggest that the extracellular oxidation takes place but is late to inactivate bacteria while the catalases can scavenge a certain amount of it we also report that h2o2 can use cell porins to diffuse but not as an exclusive pathway and hpi can degrade it to h2o and o2 in the cytoplasm the continuous incoming h2o2 flux into the cell that was not degraded participates in intracellular oxidation leading to cell death hence as we saw in the dark experiments the higher expression of oxyr and the resulting katg are mediating to maintain the intracellular physiological ros levels to harmless events we also confirm the previous literature suggestion that the uva irradiation could damage the membranes lipids and cellular proteins through the oxidative stress caused by ros but we bring evidence that this takes place from within the cells firstly it is known that uva generates ros in the presence of o2 in water to form such as 1o2 o2 ho and h2o2 that could attack the cell uva wavelength mainly activates intracellular photo sensitizers like flavins quinones nadh nadph and others producing ros to lead to internal damages as the peroxidation of proteins and lipids or dna rupture generating single strand breaks and then intracellular substance release outside with losses in membrane permeability cause the cell death berney et al 2006b bosshard et al 2010b our mda and onpg measurements of both sets of strains support this hypothesis nevertheless we suggest that the damage of the outer membrane of both tk821 mc4100 and pacyc184 pgs058 showed that the extracellular inactivation contributes less on cell death as shown by mda whereas the fact that the peak of onpg hydrolysis rate appeared on 120 min for both mutants illustrates that the intracellular ros can degrade the membrane and lead to its permeabilization furthermore uva irradiation inactivates the enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and hydroperoxidases which can no longer effectively convert superoxide to h2o2 and then degrade it our use of the oxyr mutant that produces excess katg highlights its role but also reveals that uva incapacitates its role of h2o2 scavenging combined with the fact that fe s clusters and ferritin protein release irons into cytoplasm these constitute the necessary reagents to start a photo fenton reaction inside the cell producing oh that damage intracellular substances and contribute to cell death we measured a lower mda formation and peak of onpg hydrolysis rate during the bacterial inactivation process which in turn indicates that intracellular oxidation mostly occurs in uva irradiation process as far as the fenton reagents addition are concerned a h2o2 in the uva h2o2 system our experimental results point towards an identical oxidative mechanism as in uva irradiation process but in an enhanced version we stated before that bacteria become more sensitive under uva irradiation incapacitation of catalase and membrane damage onpg mds so it is easier for outer oxidants to enter into the cell meanwhile the iron released from inactivated iron related proteins and the h2o2 accumulated as catalase inactivated under uva irradiation plus the added amounts in the bulk increasing the production of oh from the internal photo fenton reaction this pathway of intracellular inactivation initiated by uva light with h2o2 is fully proved by our measurements of mda formation and onpg hydrolysis rate of mutant cells the highest peak of onpg hydrolysis rate of mc4100 even 30 min in advance of tk821 indicated that h2o2 penetrates into the cell to initiate the intracellular oxidation and it certifies that h2o2 also uses porins to diffuse into the cell and to induce extra intracellular damage faster leakage of periplasm substances and alter the permeability to inactive the bacteria under uva stress always after the catalases are fully inactivated as seen in the identical graphs pacyc184 pgs058 strains b fe2 addition of fe2 theoretically starts an extracellular photo fenton reaction and an oxidation of the outer cell wall however we measure similar trends and amounts of mda and onpg hydrolysis rates between uva h2o2 and uva h2o2 fe2 in both sets of strains this fact shows that it does not occur so intensely outside the cell but intracellularly with the fenton reagents diffusion into the cell and enhancing the existing pathways by light and h2o2 4 conclusions the aim of this work was to specify the role of light and h2o2 in the photo fenton bacterial inactivation mechanisms in water the porin and catalase mutants employed lead to new observations towards this objective when h2o2 was added in water the external h2o2 proceeds to damage the cell membrane meanwhile we evidence that the cell membrane porins play a role in the h2o2 diffusion into the cell facilitating the intracellular oxidation but even in stationary phase cells were kate is the primary scavenger katg could catalyze h2o2 into water and oxygen hence intracellular oxidation occurs with a delay under uva irradiation the cell becomes more sensitive to stress that oxidants are easier to penetrate the cell and induce intracellular oxidation more specifically uva initiates an h2o2 mediated inactivation cascade since o2 in water and photo sensitizers in cell produce ros under irradiation to enhance the intracellular photo fenton oxidation the addition of h2o2 under light conditions has been shown to tip the scales towards an intracellular photo fenton process while not even the catalase over expressing strain was able to protect the cell especially we prove that the pgs058 has the overexpressing catalase advantage but under light katg even at excess amounts will be rendered inutile under irradiation and most likely an intracellular photo fenton is still initiated iron added in water enhances the intracellular damage described before according to the damage patterns of membrane oxidation and leakage of intracellular substance the intracellular photo fenton still is the main inactivation mechanism in disinfection by the photo fenton process despite the initial presence of h2o2 and fe in the bulk finally it can be concluded that solar photo fenton is an intracellular oxidation with the added enhancement of direct uvb

17833,a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec such as the urinary pathogenic e coli upec are common constituents of treated wastewater and therefore represent a potential public health risk however no single virulence gene or set of virulence genes can be used to conclusively identify this genetically diverse pathotype as such we sought to identify and characterize the public health relevance of potential upec found in treated sewage wastewater using a comparative genomics approach presumptive wastewater upec w upec were initially identified by virulence gene screening against 5 virulence genes and for which isolates containing 3 virulence genes were whole genome sequenced n 24 single nucleotide polymorphic snp spanning tree analysis demonstrated that many of these wastewater upec wupec were virtually identical at the core genome 0 4 mbp when compared to clinical upec c upec sequences obtained from ncbi varying by as little as 1 snp remarkably at the whole genome level w upec isolates displayed 96 whole genome similarity to c upec counterparts in ncbi with one strain demonstrating 99 5 genome similarity to a particular c upec strain the w upec populations were represented by sequence types st known to be clinically important including st131 st95 st127 and st640 many of the w upec carried the exact same complement of virulence genes as their most closely related c upec strains for example o25b st131 w upec strains possessed the same 80 virulence genes as their most closely related c upec counterparts concerningly w upec strains also carried a plethora of antibiotic resistance genes and o25b st131strains were designated as extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl producing e coli by both genome profiling and phenotypic resistance testing w upec st131 strains were found in the effluents of a single treatment plant at different times as well as different wastewater treatment plants suggesting a differentially ability to survive wastewater treatment indeed in sewage samples treated with chlorine doses sufficient for inducing a 99 99 reduction in total e coli levels upec represented a significant proportion of the chlorine resistant population by contrast no shiga toxin producing e coli were observed in these chlorinated sewage libraries our results suggest that clinically relevant upec exist in treated wastewater effluents and that they appear to be specifically adapted to survive wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords urinary pathogenic e coli upec

water treatment and waste sanitation represent the most important public health intervention strategies for control of infectious diseases in developed society it is estimated that between 1900 and 1936 a reduction of 50 of infectious disease mortality rates in the u s could be attributed to the advent of drinking water treatment accounting for a 75 decline in infant mortality and a 66 decline in childhood mortality cutler and miller 2005 an estimated economic return of 23 1 exists for clean water investments and the cost per life year saved has been estimated at 500 per individual based on 2003 estimates making water treatment the most cost effective barrier to infectious disease prevention cutler and miller 2005 consider the following what would happen if microbes were able to breach this buttress of public health by evolving resistance to water treatment indeed several chlorine specific transcription factors have been identified in e coli including hypt rclr and nemr gray et al 2013 melnyk et al 2015 parker et al 2013 chlorine resistance and resistance to advanced oxidation products aops have been linked to the generalized stress response of e coli cabiscol et al 2000 drazic et al 2013 du et al 2015 hillion and antelmann 2015 parker et al 2013 as well as the production of heat shock proteins winter et al 2008 it is estimated that at least 10 of the entire genome of e coli is dedicated to the generalized stress response landini et al 2014 and this estimate does not include other adaptive stress responses such as the universal stress response sos response and soxrs systems trastoy et al 2018 which are involved in survival against nutrient deprivation osmotic stress and oxidative stress including uv the diversity of stress mechanisms in the microbial toolbox is astounding and along with their ability to transfer genes horizontally microbes are empowered to evolve and adapt to virtually any environment collectively this raises the public health specter that wastewater treatment may actually drive the natural co selection and evolution of water treatment resistance in microbes such as e coli in fact recent evidence suggests that some strains of e coli are more resistant to water treatment than others and include certain pathotypes such as extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec anastasi and colleagues anastasi et al 2013 observed that various strains of e coli differentially survived wastewater treatment processes activated sludge chlorination and uv irradiation and that isolates surviving treatment were dominated by expec pathotypes such as urinary pathogenic e coli upec in another study anastasia et al anastasi et al 2010 observed that 59 5 of isolates surviving wastewater treatment possessed 1 or more virulence genes associated with upec papa h pape f papc hlya cnf1 and iron based on virulence gene profiling adefisoye and okoh 2016 observed that 41 7 of e coli isolates from treated wastewater effluents were considered as potential upec calhau et al 2015 identified upec in wastewater effluents based on the presence of the virulence genes iuta papa h and sfa as well as various upec associated pathogenicity islands and observed a dominance of upec strains in hospital treated wastewaters including sequence type st 131 extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl producing strains the observation that expec dominates the population of e coli in treated wastewater led paulshus et al 2019 to suggest that these findings can only be explained by a higher than expected level of infection in the community or that expec naturally occur in wastewater the common occurrence of emerging pathotypes of e coli such as esbl producing o25b st131strains in treated wastewater dolejska et al 2011 elevates the concerns for public health upec are the most important cause of urinary tract infections uti accounting for 65 75 of uti cases flores mireles et al 2015 resulting in 10 million physician visits each year in the u s and imposing an estimated 3 5 billion in healthcare costs flores mireles et al 2015 among the sequence types associated with clinical infections the st131 strain is of major public concern mathers et al 2015 this sequence type has emerged on all continents and is associated with greater antibiotic resistance than other sequence types and includes esbl producing strains mathers et al 2015 nicolas chanoine et al 2014 unfortunately no single virulence gene or set of virulence genes clearly define upec schreiber et al 2017 raising questions about whether the strains observed in various wastewater studies outlined above may represent clinically relevant upec as such our main objective was to determine whether the treatment resistant population of e coli isolated from treated sewage wastewater samples represented clinically relevant upecs collectively our comparative whole genome data demonstrates that many of the water treatment resistant strains found in treated wastewater represent clonally identical and clinically relevant upec strains and include antibiotic resistant sequence types of global concern such as the st131 esbl producing upec 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains e coli isolates for this study were obtained using two different approaches one approach sample set 1 employed the united states environmental protection agency s u s epa alternate test procedure atp us epa 2010 for obtaining chlorine stressed bacteria from chlorinated sewage this procedure incorporates a process step in which raw sewage is treated with chlorine bleach in the laboratory to reduce the viable e coli concentration within the sewage by up 4 log10 resulting in a chlorine stressed and tolerant population briefly raw sewage samples from 10 different sewage treatment plants in alberta canada were collected and sent to the alberta provincial laboratory for public health provlab for analysis each raw sewage sample was treated with 3 sodium hypochlorite with a free chlorine residual of 0 3 0 5 ppm and for a sufficient length of time to cause a 4 log10 reduction in the culturable concentration of e coli chlorine reactivity was neutralized by addition of a 10 solution of sodium thiosulfate the 4 log10 reduction in culturable e coli levels was verified using parallel samples with numbers estimated based on most probable numbers using a colilert quantitray system idexx laboratories inc chlorine treated wastewater samples were then used to inoculate either colitag or lauryl trypticase broth bcg media according to method 9221 f in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater american public health association et al 1999 e coli was isolated from colitag or ltb bg positive cultures by selective plating onto x gluc agar plates frampton et al 1988 and incubating the plates at 44 5 c for 24 h blue colonies were picked and streaked onto non selective blood agar plates and incubated at 35 c for 24 h all presumptive wastewater e coli isolates were confirmed as e coli through comprehensive biochemical testing using a vitek 2 automated bacterial identification system biomerieux st laurent quebec canada according to the manufacturer s instructions all isolates were stored in tryptic soy broth tsb containing 50 skim milk at 80 c individual isolates were subsequently thawed and cultured in tsb broth overnight at 37 c prior to identification and characterization of upec isolates using molecular methods see below the second approach for obtaining e coli isolates sample set 2 used partially treated and finished effluents from three municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the city of calgary as a source of treatment resistant e coli wastewater treatment configurations include grit removal primary clarification activated sludge secondary clarification and uv disinfection low or medium pressure at doses of 25 30 mj cm2 at peak flow and with maximal treatment capacities ranging from 140 ml day to 1020 ml day wastewater effluent samples were processed by standard membrane filtration 100 ml on x gluc agar plates and blue isolates were selected and inoculated into a 96 well plate containing 100ul 1x luria bertani lb broth followed by incubation overnight without shaking at 37 c for long time storage of the plates 50 lb glycerol in a 1 1 ratio was added to each well and frozen at 80 c a total of 1212 isolates were collected during the study and a random collection of 261 isolates from this library were selected for further analysis and confirmed as e coli using a vitek 2 automated bacterial identification system 2 2 analysis of upec related virulence genes and molecular markers e coli isolates were grown in tsb overnight at 37 c and their genomic dna extracted from the tsb culture using dneasy blood tissue kits qiagen toronto canada according to the manufacturer s instructions e coli isolates from sample set 1 i e chlorinated sewage were analyzed by pcr against a panel of upec related virulence genes and various other molecular markers a total of 376 chlorine tolerant isolates from sample set 1 were tested against a panel of two e coli related markers usp is30 flhdc and uida two upec related sequence type st markers st131 and o25b st131 five known upec related virulence genes described below and shiga toxins 1 and 2 stx1 and stx2 the uspc is30 flhdc marker was used to exclude naturalized wastewater strains of e coli from further analysis since these strains have been shown to dominate the population of treatment resistant e coli found in chlorinated sewage zhi et al 2016 the uida marker was used as a genetic confirmatory marker of all e coli strains phenotypically typed by the vitek automated bacterial identification system the presence of the st131 and the o25b st131 markers were included in the panel since st131 upec strains represent a dominantly emerging pandemic lineage of clinically important uti cases and for which the o25b st131 sub lineage is of particular concern clermont et al 2009 the presence of five common upec related virulence genes were also incorporated in the analysis and included the genes papc outer membrane usher protein sfa foc s and f1c fimbriae fyua outer membrane iron receptor chua outer membrane heme receptor and iron siderophore receptor the stx1 and stx2 genes were also included in the analysis to determine if shiga toxin producing e coli stec were represented in the chlorine tolerant e coli population of treated sewage wastewater all primers used in this study are provided in table 1 purified genomic dna gdna was quantified using the qubit fluorimeter thermo fisher scientific inc all pcr reactions were performed on an abi 2720 thermocycler applied biosystems pcr protocols for the uspc is30 flhdc and uida markers have been previously described by zhi et al 2016 and taskin et al 2011 respectively for other pcr assays the reactions consisted of 20 40 ng of gdna template 1x gotaq mastermix promega 10

followed by 30 cycles of 5 s at 94 c 10 s at 65 c followed by a 5 min incubation at 72 c all pcr products were run on 1 5 agarose gels and photographed on an imagequant las 4000 ge healthcare life sciences in some experiments clonal relatedness between strains was determined by gtg 5 rep pcr using the methods of korvin et al 2014 cycling conditions for rep pcr experiments were 95 c for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 c 1 min at 50 c 8 min at 65 c followed by an 8 min incubation at 65 c the rep pcr amplicons were run on a qiaxcel high resolution cartridge qiagen using the om1200 program with a 20 s injection time a 15bp 10 kb alignment marker and 250bp 8 kb size marker were used for determining band sizes produced by rep pcr 2 3 phenotypic characterization of antibiotic resistance in w upec wastewater upec w upec strains were phenotypically tested for antibiotic susceptibility using the vitek 2 antibiotic susceptibility testing ast cards ast n391 and ast gn98 biomerieux st laurent quebec canada according to the manufacturer s instructions resistance to 27 individual antibiotics as well as an esbl specific combination were assessed in the analysis eight antibiotics were similar between the two vitek 2 ast cards and acted as a quality control for resistance testing among different cards for the purposes of this study strains classified as having intermediate resistance or complete resistance were considered as resistant to a particular antibiotic previously isolated and purified presumptive w upec isolates were streaked on tryptic soy agar plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 c after incubation colonies were suspended in 3 ml of 0 45 saline and adjusted to an optical density of 0 5 0 63 mcfarland standard by densichektmplus biomerieux st laurent quebec canada one hundred forty five μl of the adjusted suspensions from each isolate was transferred to a clear plastic test tube containing another 3 ml of 0 45 saline the prepared tubes 2 for each isolate were loaded into a vitek 2 compact biomerieux along with the ast gn98 and ast n391 cards one card per suspension both positive and negative quality control samples were included in the analysis positive controls were e coli atcc 25912 e coli atcc 35218 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 as per recommended and the negative control was 0 45 saline 2 4 whole genome sequencing of presumptive wastewater upec w upec strains and sequence assembly genomic dna of each presumptive wastewater upec w upec isolate from sample set 1 as identified from the pcr panel screen was sent to genome quebec montreal canada for sequencing using an illumina hiseq x platform illumina with paired end 150 nucleotide reads trimmomatic version 0 38 was used to trim the low quality reads of each genome with the following parameters slidingwindow 4 15 leading 3 trailing 3 minlen 36 de novo assembly was performed using spades version 3 9 1 bankevich et al 2012 with careful and k 21 33 55 77 options the spades assembled contigs smaller than 1000 bp were removed from downstream analysis 2 5 phylogenetic analysis and multilocus sequencing typing mlst of w upec strains whole genome phylogenetic analysis was performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated based on the whole genome sequence wgs of presumptive w upec strains from this study n 24 29 clinical upec c upec strains 6 cryptic e coli as well as 27 e coli strains with known phylogroups sims and kim 2011 the phylogenetic tree was visualized using interactive tree of life itol letunic and bork 2019 and was rooted against the e albertii genome information pertaining to the bacterial strains used in this analysis can be found in supplementary table s1 mlst was also performed on all presumptive w upec strains using mlst 2 0 with escherichia coli 1 scheme larsen et al 2012 the serotype of w upec strains and their genetically similar c upec counterparts were predicted using serotypefinder 2 0 joensen et al 2015 2 6 minimum spanning tree of w upec and clinical upec c upec strains based on core genome snp analysis comparative core genome snp analysis of the presumptive w upec n 24 and 328 c upec strains obtained from ncbi databases see supplementary table s1 for list of isolates was performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 to build a minimum spanning tree in brief whole genome sequences of all 352 strains were loaded into the local realphy input folder one of the e coli strains was randomly selected as a reference sequence the genome sequences of all other strains were then mapped to the reference genome for snp assessment the core genome snps identified by realphy were analyzed by phyloviz francisco et al 2012 to generate a minimum spanning tree based on snps differences between the various strains in addition the core genome sequence alignments of all 352 strains were also used to generate a core genome snp distance matrix using the r package biostrings pagès et al 2019 2 7 pairwise whole genome comparison of w upec and clinical upec strains pairwise whole genome comparisons were performed on w upec and closely related c upec strains as identified in minimum spanning tree and core genome similarity analysis described above realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 was used to determine the pairwise genome similarity with default parameters the genome similarity between different strains was then calculated based on the core genome size result of the realphy analysis an additional pairwise whole genome comparison was performed among 30 e coli o157 h7 strains supplementary table s1 to determine the level of whole genome similarity that exists between strains of the same bacterial species that cause a similar pathology i e gastrointestinal illness since e coli o157 h7 strains are genetically more homogeneous than upec strains the comparative genome analysis of e coli o157 h7 strains established an upper threshold of whole genome intra pathotype genetic variability that is associated with a particular disease phenotype all e coli o157 h7 strains were downloaded from the ncbi genome database the upper median threshold of whole genome intra pathotype variability in e coli o157 h7 strains was then used as a threshold criterion for determining whole genome relatedness between w upec and c upec that would likely result in a similar pathology i e urinary tract infection 2 8 whole genome analysis of virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes in w upec w upec strains and selected c upec strains from ncbi were analyzed for virulence gene and antibiotic resistance gene composition for the virulence gene search a local blast database of w upec and c upec strains was built using blast 2 5 0 after which 2600 virulence factors in the core dataset of the virulence factor database vfdb chen et al 2016 were compared to the genome database to identify virulence gene matches in the upec genomes the minimum query coverage was set to 90 with a percent identity of 80 antibiotic resistance genes in e coli genomes were identified using the resistance gene identifier rgi of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card jia et al 2017 3 results 3 1 identification of presumptive w upec from chlorine treated sewage a library consisting of 376 e coli isolates obtained from chlorinated sewage samples sample set 1 was screened by pcr against a panel of e coli related markers as well as upec and stec related virulence genes one hundred forty five 38 isolates within this chlorine tolerant library contained the uspc is30 flhdc marker and were therefore considered as naturalized wastewater strains of e coli nine isolates that were biochemically confirmed using the automated vitek 2 automated bacterial identification system lacked the uida gene strains possessing the uspc is30 flhdc marker or lacking the uida gene 154 of the original 376 isolates were not included in the subsequent virulence gene analysis the remaining 222 chlorine tolerant isolates were tested by pcr for the virulence genes papc sfa foc fyua chua iron stx1 and stx2 and were screened for st131 and o25b st131 markers none of the 222 chlorine tolerant isolates possessed stx1 or stx2 of the 222 isolates 129 or 34 of the original 376 chlorine tolerant e coli did not possess any of the upec related virulence genes ninety three isolates 25 of the original 376 chlorine tolerant e coli contained one or more upec related virulence genes of these 93 isolates 51 isolates possessed one of the upec related virulence genes 18 possessed two virulence genes 14 possessed three virulence genes 4 possessed four virulence genes and 6 possessed five virulence genes a breakdown of the occurrence of each of these virulence genes is provided in fig 1 isolates possessing at least 3 of the initial 5 virulence screen genes papc sfa foc fyua chua and iron were subjected to whole genome sequencing n 24 or 6 of the original 376 chlorine tolerant isolates these 24 isolates were considered as presumptive w upec five of these 24 presumptive w upec isolates wu 1155 1030 1266 1036 and 1265 were also positive for the st131 pcr marker and all five were of the o25b st131 lineage 3 2 whole genome sequence analysis of presumptive w upec from chlorinated sewage genome characteristics of the 24 presumptive w upec strains are summarised in table 2 genome sizes ranged from 4 8 mbp to 5 3 mbp with an average g c content of 50 5 the mean number of putative coding genes within these presumptive w upec wastewater strains was approximately 4762 and sequence coverage ranged from 332x to 569x maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was used to compare whole genome sequences of the 24 chlorine resistant presumptive w upec strains against 29 clinical upec c upec genomes from ncbi as well e coli strains with known phylogroups beatson et al 2015 tenaillon et al 2010 touchon et al 2009 zhang and lin 2012 presumptive w upec strains scattered within phylogroups b1 b2 and d fig 2 in total 21 of the w upec strains clustered within phylogroup b2 while only one and two strains grouped within phylogroups d and b1 respectively a similar phylogrouping pattern was also observed in clinical upec strains with the majority of the clinical strains partitioning into phylogroup b2 followed by phylogroup b1 and a sequence types st of the 24 chlorine resistant presumptive w upec was determined by mlst sequence analysis fig 2 four strains were designated to unknown sts for the remaining 20 strains 11 sts were identified among which the most predominant sequence type was st131 20 8 5 24 followed by st95 16 7 4 24 st127 8 3 2 24 and st640 8 3 2 24 the other sts st6331 st349 st80 st625 st538 st357 st117 were each represented by only one strain 4 2 1 24 each data also confirmed that the five st131 strains identified by pcr were also designated as st131 by whole genome sequencing analysis and also belonged to the o25b st131 sub type a current global pandemic strain can et al 2015 mathers et al 2015 nicolas chanoine et al 2014 all of the chlorine tolerant o25b st131 isolates originated from the same wwtp in total the 24 presumptive w upec strains originated from eight of ten different wwtps surveyed across alberta canada fig 2 suggesting that chlorine tolerance among w upec pathotypes is widely distributed remarkably the chlorine resistant population of presumptive w upecs from chlorinated sewage from one wwtp was shown to be comprised of 6 different sequence types all of which are known to be clinically important including the most common clinical upec sequence types st131 st95 and st127 fig 2 toval et al 2014 yun et al 2015 this suggests that a variety of w upec strains appear to display tolerance to chlorine conversely none of the chlorine resistant strains represented in our chlorine treated library were shown to contain shiga toxin virulence genes stx1 or stx2 3 3 genomic similarity between w upec and c upec strains a core genome similarity comparison of the 24 presumptive w upec isolates against 328 c upec strains in ncbi was performed to further assess whether any of the chlorine tolerant w upec strains actually represented clinically important upec strains a minimum spanning tree was built based on core genome snps differences supplementary fig s1 for visualization of relatedness between w upec and c upec several w upec strains clustered closely with c upec strains differing by only a few snps across the core genome for example the w upec strain wu1036 and the c upec strain u308 differed from each other by only one snp across a 0 4 mbp core genome this high genome similarity was also observed among the w upec strains wu1025 and the c upec strain u64 4 snps differences other w upec strains such as wu1157 differed from the most closely related c upec strain u60 by only 4 snps similarly the w upec strain wu1214 differed from the c upec strain u341 by only 7 snps across the core genome in addition to the spanning tree analysis for determining core genome similarity a core genome snp distance matrix of all 352 strains was generated supplementary table s2 this distance matrix was used to further characterize all pairs of w upec and c upec that had high core genome similarity a core genome snp difference of 50 was used as a threshold to identify genetic matches between w upec and c upec strains as shown in table 3 fifteen w upec strains were found to have c upec matches that met this criterion these fifteen w upec included the five st131 isolates the four st95 isolates the two st127 isolates one st80 isolate and two isolates with unknown sequence types serotype prediction from genome sequences was subsequently done to evaluate similarity between w upec and their most closely related c upec strains as identified in the analysis above table 4 the predicted serotype of all w upec strains matched the serotype predictions of their most closely related c upec counterparts table 4 all o25b st131 pcr positive w upec strains were predicted to have an o25 h4 serotype by whole genome sequencing table 4 and matched the predictions for their mostly closely related clinical upec counterparts since upec are a genetically diverse group of pathogenic e coli we sought to further evaluate and understand the overall intra pathotype variation between chlorine tolerant w upec and c upec at the whole genome level to root this comparison we performed a pairwise genome alignment against 30 clinical strains of e coli 0157 h7 a genetically more homogeneous pathotype stec ehec compared to upec for this analysis 435 paired genome comparisons were performed across the 30 e coli 0157 h7 genomes and for which whole genome similarity between any two representative diarrheal disease causing e coli 0157 h7 isolates ranged from 79 67 to 99 95 with mean and median genetic similarity estimates of 94 24 and 96 03 respectively we therefore selected the higher median similarity value of 96 03 as the upper threshold of pathotype similarity to determine if any two w upec and c upec strains were indeed closely related at the whole genome level and likely to cause the same phenotypic disease pattern in humans in total 14 of the w upec strains had at least one closely related clinical upec strain that passed this criterion table 3 whole genome similarity of the w upec and c upec matches ranged from 96 05 to 99 49 suggesting an extremely high degree of genetic similarity at the whole genome level between each of the w upec and their most closed related c upec strain the genome of w upec strain wu1214 an st80 isolate displayed the highest degree of similarity to its c upec counterpart 99 49 interestingly and in agreement with the pairwise whole genome comparison analysis the o25b st131 pcr assay demonstrated that all five st131 w upec strains belonged to an e coli clonal group frequently isolated from urine samples of patients with uti clermont et al 2009 coque et al 2008 gibreel et al 2012a vimont et al 2012 3 4 comparative assessment of virulence gene composition in w upec and c upec strains the high degree of genetic relatedness between the w upec strains and their c upec counterparts at the core and whole genome level was also reflected in virulence gene analysis virulence gene composition was compared between each of the 14 w upec strains identified above and their most closely related c upec counterparts a maximum of four c upec representative strains were included for each pair the results are provided in supplementary table s3 w upec strains wu965 wu1752 and wu1033 possessed the exact same complement of virulence genes as their most closely related c upec strains supplementary table s3 based on whole genome searching the five o25b st131 w upec strains wu1030 wu1036 wu1155 wu1265 and wu1266 contained 78 different virulence genes that were also found in their genetically related c upec counterparts upon initial assessment using curated whole genome data the w upec strains appeared to lack two virulence genes compared to their most closely related c upec strains including the iuta gene which encodes for aerobactin receptor protein and the iucd virulence gene an aerobactin biosynthesis protein however when these genes were blasted against raw genome data including the short contigs the iuta gene and a partial iucd gene were found in short contig sequences suggesting that the five st 131 w upec strains actually possessed the same 80 virulence gene complement as the c upec strains in addition to possessing these 80 virulence genes the st131 w upec strains also possessed the sfax and papx virulence genes which were not found in their c upec counterparts interestingly one w upec st131 strain wu1266 also possessed the gspc m gene cluster associated with the type 2 secretion system which was not observed in their most closely related c upec strains albeit this gene cluster was observed in other w upec and c upec strains the additional effort of searching for virulence genes in raw genome data revealed the presence of the same complement of virulence genes between the majority of the w upec strains and their most closely related c upec counterparts supplementary table s3 this was true for all st131 strains mentioned above as well as w upec strains wu1025 wu1151 and wu1214 in the case of the w upec strain wu1214 although it carried all virulence genes similar to the related c upec isolates u57 and u341 the papb gene had only an 81 sequence identity the exceptions to the virulence gene similarity analysis were i a w upec strain wu1157 which did not possess the hlycabd gene operon as well as the cnf1 gene compared to their most closely related c upec strains u115 u203 u334 and u60 ii a w upec strain wu1274 which did not possess the type 2 secretion system t2ss coding genes gspcdefghijklm compared to its closely related c upec strains u23 u67 u294 and u295 and c a w upec strain wu3707 in which the irobcden operon was absent when compared to its most closely related c upec strains u48 u139 u162 and u289 3 5 antibiotic resistance in w upec strains w upec strains were also shown to possess a plethora of antibiotic resistance genes as identified through the card database jia et al 2017 supplementary table s4 sixty antibiotic resistance genes were identified in the st131 w upec isolates and for which these isolates possessed the greatest number of antibiotic resistance genes compared to the other w upec strains among the 60 antibiotic resistance genes identified bla ctx m 15 bla oxa 1 ampc aac 6 ib cr aac 3 ii ptsi parc gyra catb3 and vagc were only present in st131 w upec strains and not the other w upec strains the presence of bla ctx m 15 bla oxa 1 and the ampc gene suggested that these isolates may represent esbl producing e coli the five st131 w upec strains also carried two genes encoding aminoglycoside modifying enzymes aac 3 iib and aac 6 iia representing the most common mechanisms for resistance against aminoglycosides ramirez and tolmasky 2010 the five st131 w upec strains also possessed four genes that confer resistance to fosfomycin including glpt ptsi uhpt and mdtg ballestero tellez et al 2017 ohkoshi et al 2017 among which ptsi was only found in the five st131 strains two additional antibiotic resistance genes found only in the five st131 strains included parc and gyra genes involved in fluoroquinolone resistance johnning et al 2015 the chloramphenicol resistance gene catb3 bunny et al 1995 was also exclusively present in the five st131 strains the antibiotic resistance gene profiles of the remaining 19 w upec isolates supplementary table s4 were quite similar to each other and contained upwards of 49 antibiotic resistance genes these genes are known to confer resistance to various classes of antibiotics including β lactams fluoroquinolones fosfomycin phenicol antibiotics tetracycline ansamycins macrolides nitrofurantoins aminoglycosides aminocoumarin peptide antibiotics and lincosamides although the 24 w upec from chlorine treated sewage were shown to possess an abundance of antibiotic resistance genes phenotypically only 11 of the isolates displayed antibiotic resistance at clinical minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints as determined by antibiotic susceptibility testing using vitek 2 ast n391 and ast gn98 cards table 5 the five st131 strains were shown to be clinically resistant to 16 antibiotics from five different antimicrobial classes including the penicillins and β lactam β lactamase inhibitor combinations cephalosporins aminoglycosides and quinolones and fluoroquinolones these isolates were phenotypically classified as esbls antibiotic resistance in the other six w upec were as follows wu1157 an st127 strain was only resistant to cefalexin cephalosporins wu3598 an unknown st strain was resistant to ampicillin only wu3165 an st117 strain was resistant to the quinolone antibiotics enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin and chloramphenicol phenicols wu2356 an st6331 strain was resistant to chloramphenicol phenicols wu1630 an st640 strain was resistant to cefalexin cephalosporins and chloramphenicol phenicols and wu664 an st538 strain was resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics cefpodoxime cefovecin ceftiofur cefazolin cefalexin and cefixime as well as β lactam beta lactamase inhibitors including amoxicillin clavulanic acid and piperacillin tazobactam collectively the data confirms that w upec isolates surviving chlorination appear to represent clinically important upec pathotypes of public health concern and include the emerging antibiotic resistant esbl strains associated with the o25b st131 lineage and other public health strains of global public health significance i e st95 st127 st640 3 6 characterization of w upec in full scale wastewater effluents the screening protocols developed for identification and characterization of clinically important upec from chlorinated sewage samples was subsequently used to identify and isolate upec from full scale wwtps from the city of calgary supplementary fig s1 a microbial library of presumptive e coli isolates from partially treated e g secondary treated and uv disinfected wastewater effluents was generated and represented the survivor population of e coli from 3 different wwtps these samples were collected from different days throughout the year this collection of e coli isolates was negatively selected against naturalized wastewater strains i e those possessing the uspc is30 flhdc marker of the 261 e coli isolates randomly selected for analysis from 1212 isolates collected only 13 isolates 5 possessed the uspc is30 flhdc marker and were therefore considered as naturalized wastewater e coli the remaining 248 e coli isolates were subsequently tested for the presence of the uida gene five upec related virulence genes papc sfa foc fyua chua and iron as well as the st131 o25b st131 stx1 and stx2 pcr markers one hundred and fifty five isolates possessed one or more of the upec related virulence genes nineteen isolates possessed 3 or more virulence genes of these 19 isolates however only 1 was st131 positive fifteen additional st131 positive isolates were also identified and which possessed at least one other upec related virulence gene the 19 e coli isolates containing more than 3 virulence genes and the 15 st 131 positive isolates were further characterized genetically n 34 rep pcr was used to look at clonal relatedness between the whole genome characterized w upec isolates from chlorinated sewage i e isolates from sample set 1 and isolates screened from the effluents of full scale wastewater treatment plants sample set 2 in total 16 unique rep pcr fingerprints were obtained through this comparison table 6 lists all rep pcr patterns represented by more than two isolates pattern iii was the most abundant clonal group and contained the five st131 w upec strains isolated from chlorinated sewage sample set 1 as well as seven st131 strains isolated from full scale wastewater treated effluents sample set 2 interestingly all e coli strains belonging to rep pcr pattern iii i e those collected from chlorinated sewage or full scale treated wastewater were also pcr positive for the o25b st131 sub lineage marker fig 3 the remaining nine st131 strains obtained from full scale treated wastewater effluents formed the second most abundant clonal group pattern iv rep pcr patterns iii and iv encompassed all st131 strains fig 3 interestingly six of the st131 strains 2f5 2f6 4b8 1f2a 5a5 and 3c4 were all isolated from the final uv disinfected effluents from two different wwtps and on different sampling days suggesting that this clonal population of st131w upec appear to routinely survive the wastewater treatment train among different wwtps throughout the year similar to our findings observed in sample set 1 i e chlorinated sewage no stx1 or stx2 positive e coli isolates were observed in treated effluents from the wwtps in total seven different rep pcr patterns were represented by at least two w upec strains from either the chlorinated sewage samples sample set 1 or from full scale effluents sample set 2 strain 3b7 isolated from a secondary treated effluent at full scale from a wwtp was clonally related to w upec strains wu1025 and wu1157 st127 isolated from chlorinated sewage samples strains 2b8 3h3 2e3 and 4f6 were isolated from secondary treated wastewater effluents and were clonally related to the w upec strain wu965 isolated from chlorinated sewage samples unknown st strains 3b9 and 4g1 isolated from secondary treated wastewater effluents from two different wwtps in calgary were clonally related to the w upec strains wu1274 st95 and wu1151 st95 from chlorinated sewage in total 14 out of 34 strains isolated from full scale wwtp effluents were clonally similar to the whole genome characterized w upec strains found in chlorinated sewage samples suggesting that w upec found in full scale treated wastewater effluents sample set 2 also represented clinically important strains to further validate the clinical importance of these isolates found in treated wastewater effluents sample set 2 antibiotic resistance testing was performed table 5 four of these w upec strains were sensitive to all antibiotics while the other 30 strains showed clinical resistance to one or more antibiotics twenty six of the 34 isolates 76 were resistant to more than 3 antibiotics remarkably one isolate 4c1 collected from a secondary treated wastewater effluent sample represented an st131 strain that was clinically resistant to 19 different antibiotics of the sixteen st131 isolates obtained from wastewater effluents 14 88 were resistant to more than 4 antibiotics w upec isolates 2f5 and 2f6 represented two o25b st131 isolates that a were esbls b had identical clinical antibiotic resistance patterns 15 different antibiotics c possessed resistance to the same 12 antibiotics that o25b st131 strains from chlorinated samples were resistant to d had identical rep pcr patterns to each other and for which the rep pcr patterns were virtually identical to the o25b st131 isolates obtained from chlorinated sewage and e originated from two different wwtps in calgary and for which the point of origin was different than the o25b st131 strains isolated from chlorinated samples coming from the third wwtp in calgary the data suggest that antibiotic resistant clonal o25b st131 strains of upec can be routinely found in finished treated effluents of all of calgary s wwtps in total 7 35 isolates collected from treated wastewater samples were considered as esbls by phenotypic resistance testing five of these belonged to the st131 lineage 4b8 2f5 2f6 4c1 5b5 and two to non st131 lineages 4c8 1e1a 4 discussion collectively the data presented in this study provide compelling evidence that clinically important pathotypes of e coli comprise a major proportion of the e coli population surviving wastewater treatment a finding similar to that reported in other research studies adefisoye and okoh 2016 anastasi et al 2010 boczek et al 2007 ebomah et al 2018 in two separate studies by anastasi et al 2010 2013 certain strains of e coli were shown to have enhanced survivability to wastewater treatment processes including chlorination and uv irradiation and that isolates surviving treatment were dominated by upec pathotypes likewise adefisoye and okoh 2016 and ebomah et al 2018 observed that 40 of e coli isolates from treated wastewater effluents and from a beach impacted by wastewater were deemed to be expec calhau et al 2015 observed a dominance of upec related strains in hospital treated wastewaters including st131 esbl strains in the present study 94 377 25 isolates from chlorinated sewage possessed one or more of the upec related virulence genes similar to the findings described by calhau et al 2015 we also identified a predominance of st131 esbl strains in both chlorinated sewage and in treated wastewater effluents and for which these isolates were obtained from several wastewater treatment plants across alberta canada of 24 wastewater upec isolates subjected to whole genome sequencing in the present study 11 sequence types were represented and dominated by st131 followed by st95 st127 and st640 other sts included st6331 st349 st80 st625 st538 st357 and st117 the majority of these sequence types have also been observed in clinical uti cases 15 16 56 in a u s study by yamaji et al 2018 the most common sts among 233 clinical upec strains were found to be st95 st127 st73 st69 and st131 in a british study the most common sequence types were st73 st131 st69 st95 st10 and st127 gibreel et al 2012b the relative abundance and diversity of upec sequence types observed in treated wastewater effluents and chlorinated sewage compared to other e coli pathotypes i e stec suggests that upec may be more adapted to survival and persistence in environmental water matrices compared to other pathotypes anastasi et al 2013 noted an absence of stec representation in a library of e coli isolates collected from treated wastewater effluents franz et al 2015 also observed a lack of representation of stec in surface and wastewater libraries of e coli but found that gastrointestinal pathotypes included mostly enteroaggregative e coli eaec similar to that reported by anastasi et al 2013 we did not find any stx positive e coli isolates in our chlorinated sewage or wastewater effluent libraries although previous research supports the idea that upec may be particularly adapted to survive wastewater treatment a major challenge rests with the fact that no single virulence gene or designated set can be used to conclusively identify this genetically heterogeneous group of pathogenic e coli barber et al 2016 schreiber et al 2017 in fact expec appear to have exploited an array of molecular strategies and redundant cellular mechanisms to attach and colonize to host cell surfaces and have acquired diverse toxin production systems and invasion strategies that allow it to diversify and exploit multiple niches for survival and growth i e gut urethra bladder kidney and blood barber et al 2016 nielubowicz and mobley 2010 indeed many of the so called virulence genes described from upec are also found in commensal strains of e coli cyoia et al 2015 qin et al 2013 and for which these genes facilitate adhesion and colonization of the gut i e a general prerequisite for survival in the gut for both commensals and pathogens consequently virulence gene profiling among clinical upec strains has been shown to be highly variable kanamaru et al 2003 mao et al 2012 marrs et al 2002 2005 spurbeck et al 2012 vigil et al 2011 yun et al 2014 from a human clinical perspective uti symptomology in clinically ill patients provide the necessary and accessory evidence for labelling a clinical isolate as a upec strain likewise bloodborne infections caused by systemic expec result in a range of clinical symptoms that support culture confirmation of e coli isolated from the blood virulence gene profiling and sequence typing in these cultured isolates simply confirms the pathogenic nature of the isolates unfortunately the lack of a clearly defined set of virulence genes makes it difficult to predict and assess the true pathogenic potential of presumptive strains found in environmental samples this has led to some uncertainty regarding the public health risks posed when these presumptive upec isolates are observed in treated wastewater samples another challenge rests with the fact that animal upec often have similar virulence profiles as human clinical upec suggesting that animal reservoirs may also contribute to the occurrence of presumptive upec in environmental samples but for which the true zoonotic potential of these animal strains still remains somewhat unclear singer 2015 as such this study provides very important evidence validating the genomic relatedness between expec strains in treated sewage wastewater and strains causing clinical disease in humans furthermore it supports the emerging hypothesis that these pathotypes may be adapted to survive water treatment our evidence for clinical relevance is based on a number of comparative genomic approaches including snp core genome analysis pairwise whole genome sequence comparisons virulence gene composition antibiotic resistance gene composition and phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiling across the core genome 0 4 mb analyzed w upec varied from their most closely related c upec counterpart by only a few snps in one case only 1 snp differed whole genome pairwise sequence analysis demonstrated that most w upec strains had 96 similarity to one or more c upec strains found in ncbi of all the w upec strains examined wu1214 had the highest similarity to its c upec counterpart u341 with 99 49 similarity at the whole genome level in most cases virulence gene profiling demonstrated a similar complement of virulence genes between a particular w upec strain and their most closely related c upec counterparts found in ncbi databases for example based on whole genome sequencing all o25b st131 w upec isolates collected from chlorinated sewage possessed the same set of 80 virulence genes that their most closely related c upec counterparts possessed these w upec strains also contained 60 different antibiotic resistance genes and were found to be phenotypically resistant to 16 different antibiotics at clinical minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints genetically and phenotypically the o25b st131 isolates from chlorinated sewage were classified as esbls and were genetically similar to the o25b st131 strains found in the treated effluents of three different wwtps in calgary based on rep pcr and virulence gene profiling the observation that these o25b st131 strains were found in multiple treatment plants and at different times supports the idea that these strains may be evolutionarily adapted to survive wastewater treatment compared to other e coli pathotypes several other sequence types of clinical importance were also identified and characterized in the chlorinated sewage population including those associated with st95 and st127 both considered as globally emerging pathogens of significant concern o hara et al 2019 clonally related isolates from multiple sequence types were found in both treated wastewater effluents as well as chlorinated sewage as further evidence of enhanced survival of upec during wastewater treatment a single sample of chlorinated sewage from a wwtp in calgary alberta contained 13 different upec isolates comprised of 6 different sequence types st131 st80 st625 st127 st95 and an unknown st and for which 11 of the isolates from 4 sequence types st131 st80 st127 and st95 displayed 96 genome similarity to clinical upec collectively our data demonstrate that the upec observed in treated wastewater effluents are very likely to be pathogenic to humans although our screening approach to detect and isolate clinically relevant upec from sewage wastewater was extremely effective the process likely targets select strains and therefore underestimates overall representation of the diversity of clinical upec strains that might be present based on our data we estimate that 25 of the surviving e coli population found in treated wastewater effluents represent potentially pathogenic upec a number that is in alignment with other studies anastasi et al 2010 2013 adefisoye and okoh 2016 ebomah et al 2018 calhau et al 2015 our data is also in alignment with paulshus et al 2019 who recently used whole genome sequencing to characterize esbls from sewage pump stations in suburban communities in norway forty five repetitive samplings were conducted over 15 months of this study generating a library of 3123 e coli isolates up to 10 of e coli isolates observed in this study were considered esbls of which 44 of these were characterized as st131 and st648 strains the fact that these strains were present throughout the sampling period and in such abundance led the authors to speculate that expec may represent a a resident population within wastewater systems or b that these expec strains circulate abundantly in the community and for which infections may be underreported paulshus et al 2019 in a survey of wastewater treatment plants in the u s hoelle et al 2019 also observed a relative abundance of esbl strains associated with st131 o25b st131 and st648 lineages findings that are in alignment with ours our o25b st131 w upec isolates were confirmed as esbls based on phenotypic resistance profiling and were resistant to penicillins β lactam β lactamase inhibitor combinations and all eight cephalosporins cefazolin cefixime ceftriaxone cefalexin cefpodoxime cefovecin ceftazidime and ceftiofur the strains obtained from chlorinated sewage also possessed the bla ctx m 15 bla oxa 1 and ampc genes and for which the bla ctx m 15 and bla oxa 1 genes are known to confer resistance to β lactam β lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotics sugumar et al 2014 in addition to being esbls our o25b st131 strains were also resistant to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones both of which are also commonly used antimicrobials to treat uti ghafourian et al 2015 goodlet et al 2019 the emergence of highly multidrug resistant upec greatly complicates clinical treatment and sometimes results in treatment failure of uti or even death can et al 2015 owens et al 2011 the apparent ability of upec to survive wastewater has also been noted in other e coli strains anastasi et al 2010 2013 including naturalized wastewater strains of e coli zhi et al 2016 2017 2019 naturalized wastewater strains of e coli have been shown to be genetically distinct from the cryptic and the human animal enteric clades of e coli based on comparative whole genome sequencing and phylogrouping zhi et al 2019 they can be distinguished from enteric and cryptic clades through possession of the uspc is30 flhdc marker zhi et al 2016 2019 naturalized wastewater strains possess an over abundance of stress adaptive genes compared to enteric clades zhi et al 2019 believed to be acquired through horizontal gene transfer and have been shown to be resistant to chlorine zhi et al 2017 and heat wang et al 2020 interestingly their extreme resistance to heat is conferred by the locus of heat resistance lhr and for which we have demonstrated that lhr cross protects these strains against chlorine wang et al 2020 the dominance of stress related genes in naturalized wastewater strains of e coli as compared to enteric clades suggests the evolution of survival strategies aimed at overcoming the harsh conditions of a wastewater treatment plant and for which these strains may be specifically adapted to live and survive in this environment based on the thousands of e coli genomes sequenced to date these naturalized strains have only ever been found in sewage and wastewater zhi et al 2019 it is believed that these naturalized wastewater strains of e coli are non pathogenic in nature having abandoned life in the gut of an animal for life in sewage wastewater remarkably these naturalized wastewater e coli strains possess upwards of 36 different upec related virulence genes including a the ferrienterobactin multi enzyme synthetase complex and transport system b upec fimbrial genes c the curli virulence gene csgb d the outer membrane protein gene known as ompa and e the flagellar biosynthesis protein encoded by flha zhi et al 2019 some naturalized strains also possessed the yersiniabactin siderophore biosynthetic pathway and receptor transport system found in many clinical upec as well as the virulence genes fyua and irp1 2 zhi et al 2019 it is interesting to note that the virulence genes highlighted above have been identified as being important in the survival of clinical upec in the nutrient deprived and osmotically hydrologically stressed environment of the urinary tract i e low solutes and repetitive flushing mann et al 2017 for example human upec strains have a predominance of iron sequestering virulence genes e g ferribactin yersinabactin enterobactin related genes and transport pathways to enhance their survival in iron deficient urine terlizzi et al 2017 an important finding noted by zhi et al 2019 was that many of these upec related virulence genes found could also be found in the environmental cryptic clades zhi et al 2019 thus the existence of these so called virulence genes in naturalized wastewater e coli strains environmental cryptic clades of e coli and in clinical upec suggests that the genes may actually provide an adaptive evolutionary advantage for survival in extraintestinal niches including non host environmental niches such as water sewage and wastewater our data and that of others also raises some important questions about the public health risks associated with upec expec infections acquired through waterborne routes of transmission greater than 10 million physician visits occur each year in the u s due to urinary tract infections and for which the vast majority of these infections are caused by upec flores mireles et al 2015 foxman 2010 pitout and devinney 2017 russell et al 2018 xie et al 2006 as with many clinical infections the number of reported cases likely underestimates the true scope of the health issue recently it has been demonstrated that swimming in natural water bodies has been epidemiologically linked to increased prevalence of urinary tract infections utis largely caused by upec soraas et al 2013 urinary pathogenic e coli have also been identified as extremely important emerging foodborne pathogens liu et al 2018 markland et al 2015 and although foodborne upec are typically attributed to animal reservoirs todd 1997 singer 2015 it is important to note that wastewater effluent discharges can comprise a significant proportion of water available for agricultural production animal and crop production it is estimated that 50 of drinking water treatment plants in the u s are impacted by wastewater effluents and in some cases wastewater effluents account for 50 and as high as 90 of river flow volumes in the u s rice and westerhoff 2015 2017 the u s epa estimates that as many as 40 000 sewer overflows occur each year and up to 500 000 km of coastlines rivers and streams do not currently meet ambient microbial water quality guidelines for recreation as a result of human and animal waste contamination us epa 2007a us epa 2007b for these reasons there is growing concern that water could represent an important transmission nexus for upec and other expec strains the plausibility of waterborne disease transmission i e ingestion associated with urinary and septicemic e coli is supported by recent research that suggests that expec strains typically establish infection by first asymptomatically colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of an animal host subsequently invading the gut lining and disseminating to the urinary tract e g upec or bloodstream e g nmec bower et al 2005 russell et al 2017 therefore ingestion of wastewater contaminated food i e crop irrigation drinking water i e untreated or inadequately treated or recreational water i e ingestion offer possible transmission pathways for expec infections from water unfortunately utis or systemic septicemia have not been considered as clinical endpoints for most epidemiological studies examining water as a vehicle of transmission focusing primarily on gastrointestinal illness for example the most recent recreational water quality standards promulgated by the u s epa in 2012 did not include utis or systemic septicemia in their epidemiological benchmarks but rather gastrointestinal illness as the clinical outcome us epa 2012 as mentioned previously utis have been epidemiologically linked to recreational water exposures soraas et al 2013 and esbl e coli have been routinely found in surface water samples and irrigation water samples franz et al 2015 gekenidis et al 2018 gomi et al 2017 njage and buys 2015 nuesch inderbinen et al 2015 in a study by tanner et al 2019 esbls were found in 6 4 of drinking water samples that failed bacteriological water quality parameters in the u s i e total coliforms for which several of the esbls identified were e coli and which led the authors to conclude that drinking water may be an underestimated vehicle for transmission of expec into the community arguably gastrointestinal illness may still be a more sensitive measure of the human health outcomes associated with exposure to contaminated water largely due to the diversity of etiological agents that can cause gastroenteritis viruses bacteria protozoa however given the emerging global distribution and dramatic increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant utis i e esbls and septicemia caused by expec over the last decade we would encourage future research aimed at addressing the contribution that waterborne transmission may play in this important and emerging public health issue this call for research is further galvanized if we consider that pathogens may not only be emerging resistance to antibiotics but also to our most important barrier for infectious disease control in society water treatment and sanitation 5 conclusion clinically relevant upec strains readily survive municipal wastewater treatment processes upec strains found in treated wastewater include st131 esbl producing e coli and represent strains of global public health concern the resistance of upec to wastewater treatment implies that a potentially significant public health risk may exist for downstream drinking water systems impacted by wastewater discharge as well as for crops irrigated with water contaminated by treated wastewater or

17833,a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec such as the urinary pathogenic e coli upec are common constituents of treated wastewater and therefore represent a potential public health risk however no single virulence gene or set of virulence genes can be used to conclusively identify this genetically diverse pathotype as such we sought to identify and characterize the public health relevance of potential upec found in treated sewage wastewater using a comparative genomics approach presumptive wastewater upec w upec were initially identified by virulence gene screening against 5 virulence genes and for which isolates containing 3 virulence genes were whole genome sequenced n 24 single nucleotide polymorphic snp spanning tree analysis demonstrated that many of these wastewater upec wupec were virtually identical at the core genome 0 4 mbp when compared to clinical upec c upec sequences obtained from ncbi varying by as little as 1 snp remarkably at the whole genome level w upec isolates displayed 96 whole genome similarity to c upec counterparts in ncbi with one strain demonstrating 99 5 genome similarity to a particular c upec strain the w upec populations were represented by sequence types st known to be clinically important including st131 st95 st127 and st640 many of the w upec carried the exact same complement of virulence genes as their most closely related c upec strains for example o25b st131 w upec strains possessed the same 80 virulence genes as their most closely related c upec counterparts concerningly w upec strains also carried a plethora of antibiotic resistance genes and o25b st131strains were designated as extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl producing e coli by both genome profiling and phenotypic resistance testing w upec st131 strains were found in the effluents of a single treatment plant at different times as well as different wastewater treatment plants suggesting a differentially ability to survive wastewater treatment indeed in sewage samples treated with chlorine doses sufficient for inducing a 99 99 reduction in total e coli levels upec represented a significant proportion of the chlorine resistant population by contrast no shiga toxin producing e coli were observed in these chlorinated sewage libraries our results suggest that clinically relevant upec exist in treated wastewater effluents and that they appear to be specifically adapted to survive wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords urinary pathogenic e coli upec

water treatment and waste sanitation represent the most important public health intervention strategies for control of infectious diseases in developed society it is estimated that between 1900 and 1936 a reduction of 50 of infectious disease mortality rates in the u s could be attributed to the advent of drinking water treatment accounting for a 75 decline in infant mortality and a 66 decline in childhood mortality cutler and miller 2005 an estimated economic return of 23 1 exists for clean water investments and the cost per life year saved has been estimated at 500 per individual based on 2003 estimates making water treatment the most cost effective barrier to infectious disease prevention cutler and miller 2005 consider the following what would happen if microbes were able to breach this buttress of public health by evolving resistance to water treatment indeed several chlorine specific transcription factors have been identified in e coli including hypt rclr and nemr gray et al 2013 melnyk et al 2015 parker et al 2013 chlorine resistance and resistance to advanced oxidation products aops have been linked to the generalized stress response of e coli cabiscol et al 2000 drazic et al 2013 du et al 2015 hillion and antelmann 2015 parker et al 2013 as well as the production of heat shock proteins winter et al 2008 it is estimated that at least 10 of the entire genome of e coli is dedicated to the generalized stress response landini et al 2014 and this estimate does not include other adaptive stress responses such as the universal stress response sos response and soxrs systems trastoy et al 2018 which are involved in survival against nutrient deprivation osmotic stress and oxidative stress including uv the diversity of stress mechanisms in the microbial toolbox is astounding and along with their ability to transfer genes horizontally microbes are empowered to evolve and adapt to virtually any environment collectively this raises the public health specter that wastewater treatment may actually drive the natural co selection and evolution of water treatment resistance in microbes such as e coli in fact recent evidence suggests that some strains of e coli are more resistant to water treatment than others and include certain pathotypes such as extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec anastasi and colleagues anastasi et al 2013 observed that various strains of e coli differentially survived wastewater treatment processes activated sludge chlorination and uv irradiation and that isolates surviving treatment were dominated by expec pathotypes such as urinary pathogenic e coli upec in another study anastasia et al anastasi et al 2010 observed that 59 5 of isolates surviving wastewater treatment possessed 1 or more virulence genes associated with upec papa h pape f papc hlya cnf1 and iron based on virulence gene profiling adefisoye and okoh 2016 observed that 41 7 of e coli isolates from treated wastewater effluents were considered as potential upec calhau et al 2015 identified upec in wastewater effluents based on the presence of the virulence genes iuta papa h and sfa as well as various upec associated pathogenicity islands and observed a dominance of upec strains in hospital treated wastewaters including sequence type st 131 extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl producing strains the observation that expec dominates the population of e coli in treated wastewater led paulshus et al 2019 to suggest that these findings can only be explained by a higher than expected level of infection in the community or that expec naturally occur in wastewater the common occurrence of emerging pathotypes of e coli such as esbl producing o25b st131strains in treated wastewater dolejska et al 2011 elevates the concerns for public health upec are the most important cause of urinary tract infections uti accounting for 65 75 of uti cases flores mireles et al 2015 resulting in 10 million physician visits each year in the u s and imposing an estimated 3 5 billion in healthcare costs flores mireles et al 2015 among the sequence types associated with clinical infections the st131 strain is of major public concern mathers et al 2015 this sequence type has emerged on all continents and is associated with greater antibiotic resistance than other sequence types and includes esbl producing strains mathers et al 2015 nicolas chanoine et al 2014 unfortunately no single virulence gene or set of virulence genes clearly define upec schreiber et al 2017 raising questions about whether the strains observed in various wastewater studies outlined above may represent clinically relevant upec as such our main objective was to determine whether the treatment resistant population of e coli isolated from treated sewage wastewater samples represented clinically relevant upecs collectively our comparative whole genome data demonstrates that many of the water treatment resistant strains found in treated wastewater represent clonally identical and clinically relevant upec strains and include antibiotic resistant sequence types of global concern such as the st131 esbl producing upec 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains e coli isolates for this study were obtained using two different approaches one approach sample set 1 employed the united states environmental protection agency s u s epa alternate test procedure atp us epa 2010 for obtaining chlorine stressed bacteria from chlorinated sewage this procedure incorporates a process step in which raw sewage is treated with chlorine bleach in the laboratory to reduce the viable e coli concentration within the sewage by up 4 log10 resulting in a chlorine stressed and tolerant population briefly raw sewage samples from 10 different sewage treatment plants in alberta canada were collected and sent to the alberta provincial laboratory for public health provlab for analysis each raw sewage sample was treated with 3 sodium hypochlorite with a free chlorine residual of 0 3 0 5 ppm and for a sufficient length of time to cause a 4 log10 reduction in the culturable concentration of e coli chlorine reactivity was neutralized by addition of a 10 solution of sodium thiosulfate the 4 log10 reduction in culturable e coli levels was verified using parallel samples with numbers estimated based on most probable numbers using a colilert quantitray system idexx laboratories inc chlorine treated wastewater samples were then used to inoculate either colitag or lauryl trypticase broth bcg media according to method 9221 f in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater american public health association et al 1999 e coli was isolated from colitag or ltb bg positive cultures by selective plating onto x gluc agar plates frampton et al 1988 and incubating the plates at 44 5 c for 24 h blue colonies were picked and streaked onto non selective blood agar plates and incubated at 35 c for 24 h all presumptive wastewater e coli isolates were confirmed as e coli through comprehensive biochemical testing using a vitek 2 automated bacterial identification system biomerieux st laurent quebec canada according to the manufacturer s instructions all isolates were stored in tryptic soy broth tsb containing 50 skim milk at 80 c individual isolates were subsequently thawed and cultured in tsb broth overnight at 37 c prior to identification and characterization of upec isolates using molecular methods see below the second approach for obtaining e coli isolates sample set 2 used partially treated and finished effluents from three municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the city of calgary as a source of treatment resistant e coli wastewater treatment configurations include grit removal primary clarification activated sludge secondary clarification and uv disinfection low or medium pressure at doses of 25 30 mj cm2 at peak flow and with maximal treatment capacities ranging from 140 ml day to 1020 ml day wastewater effluent samples were processed by standard membrane filtration 100 ml on x gluc agar plates and blue isolates were selected and inoculated into a 96 well plate containing 100ul 1x luria bertani lb broth followed by incubation overnight without shaking at 37 c for long time storage of the plates 50 lb glycerol in a 1 1 ratio was added to each well and frozen at 80 c a total of 1212 isolates were collected during the study and a random collection of 261 isolates from this library were selected for further analysis and confirmed as e coli using a vitek 2 automated bacterial identification system 2 2 analysis of upec related virulence genes and molecular markers e coli isolates were grown in tsb overnight at 37 c and their genomic dna extracted from the tsb culture using dneasy blood tissue kits qiagen toronto canada according to the manufacturer s instructions e coli isolates from sample set 1 i e chlorinated sewage were analyzed by pcr against a panel of upec related virulence genes and various other molecular markers a total of 376 chlorine tolerant isolates from sample set 1 were tested against a panel of two e coli related markers usp is30 flhdc and uida two upec related sequence type st markers st131 and o25b st131 five known upec related virulence genes described below and shiga toxins 1 and 2 stx1 and stx2 the uspc is30 flhdc marker was used to exclude naturalized wastewater strains of e coli from further analysis since these strains have been shown to dominate the population of treatment resistant e coli found in chlorinated sewage zhi et al 2016 the uida marker was used as a genetic confirmatory marker of all e coli strains phenotypically typed by the vitek automated bacterial identification system the presence of the st131 and the o25b st131 markers were included in the panel since st131 upec strains represent a dominantly emerging pandemic lineage of clinically important uti cases and for which the o25b st131 sub lineage is of particular concern clermont et al 2009 the presence of five common upec related virulence genes were also incorporated in the analysis and included the genes papc outer membrane usher protein sfa foc s and f1c fimbriae fyua outer membrane iron receptor chua outer membrane heme receptor and iron siderophore receptor the stx1 and stx2 genes were also included in the analysis to determine if shiga toxin producing e coli stec were represented in the chlorine tolerant e coli population of treated sewage wastewater all primers used in this study are provided in table 1 purified genomic dna gdna was quantified using the qubit fluorimeter thermo fisher scientific inc all pcr reactions were performed on an abi 2720 thermocycler applied biosystems pcr protocols for the uspc is30 flhdc and uida markers have been previously described by zhi et al 2016 and taskin et al 2011 respectively for other pcr assays the reactions consisted of 20 40 ng of gdna template 1x gotaq mastermix promega 10 μg ml bsa and 500 nm of each primer cycling conditions for papc and sfa foc were 95 c 2 min followed by 33 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 63 c and 45 s at 72 c followed by a 7 min incubation at 72 c cycling conditions for fyua chua and iron were 95 c for 2 min followed by 33 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 63 c and 1 min at 72 c followed by a 7 min incubation at 72 c cycling conditions for

followed by 30 cycles of 5 s at 94 c 10 s at 65 c followed by a 5 min incubation at 72 c all pcr products were run on 1 5 agarose gels and photographed on an imagequant las 4000 ge healthcare life sciences in some experiments clonal relatedness between strains was determined by gtg 5 rep pcr using the methods of korvin et al 2014 cycling conditions for rep pcr experiments were 95 c for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 c 1 min at 50 c 8 min at 65 c followed by an 8 min incubation at 65 c the rep pcr amplicons were run on a qiaxcel high resolution cartridge qiagen using the om1200 program with a 20 s injection time a 15bp 10 kb alignment marker and 250bp 8 kb size marker were used for determining band sizes produced by rep pcr 2 3 phenotypic characterization of antibiotic resistance in w upec wastewater upec w upec strains were phenotypically tested for antibiotic susceptibility using the vitek 2 antibiotic susceptibility testing ast cards ast n391 and ast gn98 biomerieux st laurent quebec canada according to the manufacturer s instructions resistance to 27 individual antibiotics as well as an esbl specific combination were assessed in the analysis eight antibiotics were similar between the two vitek 2 ast cards and acted as a quality control for resistance testing among different cards for the purposes of this study strains classified as having intermediate resistance or complete resistance were considered as resistant to a particular antibiotic previously isolated and purified presumptive w upec isolates were streaked on tryptic soy agar plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 c after incubation colonies were suspended in 3 ml of 0 45 saline and adjusted to an optical density of 0 5 0 63 mcfarland standard by densichektmplus biomerieux st laurent quebec canada one hundred forty five μl of the adjusted suspensions from each isolate was transferred to a clear plastic test tube containing another 3 ml of 0 45 saline the prepared tubes 2 for each isolate were loaded into a vitek 2 compact biomerieux along with the ast gn98 and ast n391 cards one card per suspension both positive and negative quality control samples were included in the analysis positive controls were e coli atcc 25912 e coli atcc 35218 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 as per recommended and the negative control was 0 45 saline 2 4 whole genome sequencing of presumptive wastewater upec w upec strains and sequence assembly genomic dna of each presumptive wastewater upec w upec isolate from sample set 1 as identified from the pcr panel screen was sent to genome quebec montreal canada for sequencing using an illumina hiseq x platform illumina with paired end 150 nucleotide reads trimmomatic version 0 38 was used to trim the low quality reads of each genome with the following parameters slidingwindow 4 15 leading 3 trailing 3 minlen 36 de novo assembly was performed using spades version 3 9 1 bankevich et al 2012 with careful and k 21 33 55 77 options the spades assembled contigs smaller than 1000 bp were removed from downstream analysis 2 5 phylogenetic analysis and multilocus sequencing typing mlst of w upec strains whole genome phylogenetic analysis was performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated based on the whole genome sequence wgs of presumptive w upec strains from this study n 24 29 clinical upec c upec strains 6 cryptic e coli as well as 27 e coli strains with known phylogroups sims and kim 2011 the phylogenetic tree was visualized using interactive tree of life itol letunic and bork 2019 and was rooted against the e albertii genome information pertaining to the bacterial strains used in this analysis can be found in supplementary table s1 mlst was also performed on all presumptive w upec strains using mlst 2 0 with escherichia coli 1 scheme larsen et al 2012 the serotype of w upec strains and their genetically similar c upec counterparts were predicted using serotypefinder 2 0 joensen et al 2015 2 6 minimum spanning tree of w upec and clinical upec c upec strains based on core genome snp analysis comparative core genome snp analysis of the presumptive w upec n 24 and 328 c upec strains obtained from ncbi databases see supplementary table s1 for list of isolates was performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 to build a minimum spanning tree in brief whole genome sequences of all 352 strains were loaded into the local realphy input folder one of the e coli strains was randomly selected as a reference sequence the genome sequences of all other strains were then mapped to the reference genome for snp assessment the core genome snps identified by realphy were analyzed by phyloviz francisco et al 2012 to generate a minimum spanning tree based on snps differences between the various strains in addition the core genome sequence alignments of all 352 strains were also used to generate a core genome snp distance matrix using the r package biostrings pagès et al 2019 2 7 pairwise whole genome comparison of w upec and clinical upec strains pairwise whole genome comparisons were performed on w upec and closely related c upec strains as identified in minimum spanning tree and core genome similarity analysis described above realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 was used to determine the pairwise genome similarity with default parameters the genome similarity between different strains was then calculated based on the core genome size result of the realphy analysis an additional pairwise whole genome comparison was performed among 30 e coli o157 h7 strains supplementary table s1 to determine the level of whole genome similarity that exists between strains of the same bacterial species that cause a similar pathology i e gastrointestinal illness since e coli o157 h7 strains are genetically more homogeneous than upec strains the comparative genome analysis of e coli o157 h7 strains established an upper threshold of whole genome intra pathotype genetic variability that is associated with a particular disease phenotype all e coli o157 h7 strains were downloaded from the ncbi genome database the upper median threshold of whole genome intra pathotype variability in e coli o157 h7 strains was then used as a threshold criterion for determining whole genome relatedness between w upec and c upec that would likely result in a similar pathology i e urinary tract infection 2 8 whole genome analysis of virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes in w upec w upec strains and selected c upec strains from ncbi were analyzed for virulence gene and antibiotic resistance gene composition for the virulence gene search a local blast database of w upec and c upec strains was built using blast 2 5 0 after which 2600 virulence factors in the core dataset of the virulence factor database vfdb chen et al 2016 were compared to the genome database to identify virulence gene matches in the upec genomes the minimum query coverage was set to 90 with a percent identity of 80 antibiotic resistance genes in e coli genomes were identified using the resistance gene identifier rgi of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card jia et al 2017 3 results 3 1 identification of presumptive w upec from chlorine treated sewage a library consisting of 376 e coli isolates obtained from chlorinated sewage samples sample set 1 was screened by pcr against a panel of e coli related markers as well as upec and stec related virulence genes one hundred forty five 38 isolates within this chlorine tolerant library contained the uspc is30 flhdc marker and were therefore considered as naturalized wastewater strains of e coli nine isolates that were biochemically confirmed using the automated vitek 2 automated bacterial identification system lacked the uida gene strains possessing the uspc is30 flhdc marker or lacking the uida gene 154 of the original 376 isolates were not included in the subsequent virulence gene analysis the remaining 222 chlorine tolerant isolates were tested by pcr for the virulence genes papc sfa foc fyua chua iron stx1 and stx2 and were screened for st131 and o25b st131 markers none of the 222 chlorine tolerant isolates possessed stx1 or stx2 of the 222 isolates 129 or 34 of the original 376 chlorine tolerant e coli did not possess any of the upec related virulence genes ninety three isolates 25 of the original 376 chlorine tolerant e coli contained one or more upec related virulence genes of these 93 isolates 51 isolates possessed one of the upec related virulence genes 18 possessed two virulence genes 14 possessed three virulence genes 4 possessed four virulence genes and 6 possessed five virulence genes a breakdown of the occurrence of each of these virulence genes is provided in fig 1 isolates possessing at least 3 of the initial 5 virulence screen genes papc sfa foc fyua chua and iron were subjected to whole genome sequencing n 24 or 6 of the original 376 chlorine tolerant isolates these 24 isolates were considered as presumptive w upec five of these 24 presumptive w upec isolates wu 1155 1030 1266 1036 and 1265 were also positive for the st131 pcr marker and all five were of the o25b st131 lineage 3 2 whole genome sequence analysis of presumptive w upec from chlorinated sewage genome characteristics of the 24 presumptive w upec strains are summarised in table 2 genome sizes ranged from 4 8 mbp to 5 3 mbp with an average g c content of 50 5 the mean number of putative coding genes within these presumptive w upec wastewater strains was approximately 4762 and sequence coverage ranged from 332x to 569x maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was used to compare whole genome sequences of the 24 chlorine resistant presumptive w upec strains against 29 clinical upec c upec genomes from ncbi as well e coli strains with known phylogroups beatson et al 2015 tenaillon et al 2010 touchon et al 2009 zhang and lin 2012 presumptive w upec strains scattered within phylogroups b1 b2 and d fig 2 in total 21 of the w upec strains clustered within phylogroup b2 while only one and two strains grouped within phylogroups d and b1 respectively a similar phylogrouping pattern was also observed in clinical upec strains with the majority of the clinical strains partitioning into phylogroup b2 followed by phylogroup b1 and a sequence types st of the 24 chlorine resistant presumptive w upec was determined by mlst sequence analysis fig 2 four strains were designated to unknown sts for the remaining 20 strains 11 sts were identified among which the most predominant sequence type was st131 20 8 5 24 followed by st95 16 7 4 24 st127 8 3 2 24 and st640 8 3 2 24 the other sts st6331 st349 st80 st625 st538 st357 st117 were each represented by only one strain 4 2 1 24 each data also confirmed that the five st131 strains identified by pcr were also designated as st131 by whole genome sequencing analysis and also belonged to the o25b st131 sub type a current global pandemic strain can et al 2015 mathers et al 2015 nicolas chanoine et al 2014 all of the chlorine tolerant o25b st131 isolates originated from the same wwtp in total the 24 presumptive w upec strains originated from eight of ten different wwtps surveyed across alberta canada fig 2 suggesting that chlorine tolerance among w upec pathotypes is widely distributed remarkably the chlorine resistant population of presumptive w upecs from chlorinated sewage from one wwtp was shown to be comprised of 6 different sequence types all of which are known to be clinically important including the most common clinical upec sequence types st131 st95 and st127 fig 2 toval et al 2014 yun et al 2015 this suggests that a variety of w upec strains appear to display tolerance to chlorine conversely none of the chlorine resistant strains represented in our chlorine treated library were shown to contain shiga toxin virulence genes stx1 or stx2 3 3 genomic similarity between w upec and c upec strains a core genome similarity comparison of the 24 presumptive w upec isolates against 328 c upec strains in ncbi was performed to further assess whether any of the chlorine tolerant w upec strains actually represented clinically important upec strains a minimum spanning tree was built based on core genome snps differences supplementary fig s1 for visualization of relatedness between w upec and c upec several w upec strains clustered closely with c upec strains differing by only a few snps across the core genome for example the w upec strain wu1036 and the c upec strain u308 differed from each other by only one snp across a 0 4 mbp core genome this high genome similarity was also observed among the w upec strains wu1025 and the c upec strain u64 4 snps differences other w upec strains such as wu1157 differed from the most closely related c upec strain u60 by only 4 snps similarly the w upec strain wu1214 differed from the c upec strain u341 by only 7 snps across the core genome in addition to the spanning tree analysis for determining core genome similarity a core genome snp distance matrix of all 352 strains was generated supplementary table s2 this distance matrix was used to further characterize all pairs of w upec and c upec that had high core genome similarity a core genome snp difference of 50 was used as a threshold to identify genetic matches between w upec and c upec strains as shown in table 3 fifteen w upec strains were found to have c upec matches that met this criterion these fifteen w upec included the five st131 isolates the four st95 isolates the two st127 isolates one st80 isolate and two isolates with unknown sequence types serotype prediction from genome sequences was subsequently done to evaluate similarity between w upec and their most closely related c upec strains as identified in the analysis above table 4 the predicted serotype of all w upec strains matched the serotype predictions of their most closely related c upec counterparts table 4 all o25b st131 pcr positive w upec strains were predicted to have an o25 h4 serotype by whole genome sequencing table 4 and matched the predictions for their mostly closely related clinical upec counterparts since upec are a genetically diverse group of pathogenic e coli we sought to further evaluate and understand the overall intra pathotype variation between chlorine tolerant w upec and c upec at the whole genome level to root this comparison we performed a pairwise genome alignment against 30 clinical strains of e coli 0157 h7 a genetically more homogeneous pathotype stec ehec compared to upec for this analysis 435 paired genome comparisons were performed across the 30 e coli 0157 h7 genomes and for which whole genome similarity between any two representative diarrheal disease causing e coli 0157 h7 isolates ranged from 79 67 to 99 95 with mean and median genetic similarity estimates of 94 24 and 96 03 respectively we therefore selected the higher median similarity value of 96 03 as the upper threshold of pathotype similarity to determine if any two w upec and c upec strains were indeed closely related at the whole genome level and likely to cause the same phenotypic disease pattern in humans in total 14 of the w upec strains had at least one closely related clinical upec strain that passed this criterion table 3 whole genome similarity of the w upec and c upec matches ranged from 96 05 to 99 49 suggesting an extremely high degree of genetic similarity at the whole genome level between each of the w upec and their most closed related c upec strain the genome of w upec strain wu1214 an st80 isolate displayed the highest degree of similarity to its c upec counterpart 99 49 interestingly and in agreement with the pairwise whole genome comparison analysis the o25b st131 pcr assay demonstrated that all five st131 w upec strains belonged to an e coli clonal group frequently isolated from urine samples of patients with uti clermont et al 2009 coque et al 2008 gibreel et al 2012a vimont et al 2012 3 4 comparative assessment of virulence gene composition in w upec and c upec strains the high degree of genetic relatedness between the w upec strains and their c upec counterparts at the core and whole genome level was also reflected in virulence gene analysis virulence gene composition was compared between each of the 14 w upec strains identified above and their most closely related c upec counterparts a maximum of four c upec representative strains were included for each pair the results are provided in supplementary table s3 w upec strains wu965 wu1752 and wu1033 possessed the exact same complement of virulence genes as their most closely related c upec strains supplementary table s3 based on whole genome searching the five o25b st131 w upec strains wu1030 wu1036 wu1155 wu1265 and wu1266 contained 78 different virulence genes that were also found in their genetically related c upec counterparts upon initial assessment using curated whole genome data the w upec strains appeared to lack two virulence genes compared to their most closely related c upec strains including the iuta gene which encodes for aerobactin receptor protein and the iucd virulence gene an aerobactin biosynthesis protein however when these genes were blasted against raw genome data including the short contigs the iuta gene and a partial iucd gene were found in short contig sequences suggesting that the five st 131 w upec strains actually possessed the same 80 virulence gene complement as the c upec strains in addition to possessing these 80 virulence genes the st131 w upec strains also possessed the sfax and papx virulence genes which were not found in their c upec counterparts interestingly one w upec st131 strain wu1266 also possessed the gspc m gene cluster associated with the type 2 secretion system which was not observed in their most closely related c upec strains albeit this gene cluster was observed in other w upec and c upec strains the additional effort of searching for virulence genes in raw genome data revealed the presence of the same complement of virulence genes between the majority of the w upec strains and their most closely related c upec counterparts supplementary table s3 this was true for all st131 strains mentioned above as well as w upec strains wu1025 wu1151 and wu1214 in the case of the w upec strain wu1214 although it carried all virulence genes similar to the related c upec isolates u57 and u341 the papb gene had only an 81 sequence identity the exceptions to the virulence gene similarity analysis were i a w upec strain wu1157 which did not possess the hlycabd gene operon as well as the cnf1 gene compared to their most closely related c upec strains u115 u203 u334 and u60 ii a w upec strain wu1274 which did not possess the type 2 secretion system t2ss coding genes gspcdefghijklm compared to its closely related c upec strains u23 u67 u294 and u295 and c a w upec strain wu3707 in which the irobcden operon was absent when compared to its most closely related c upec strains u48 u139 u162 and u289 3 5 antibiotic resistance in w upec strains w upec strains were also shown to possess a plethora of antibiotic resistance genes as identified through the card database jia et al 2017 supplementary table s4 sixty antibiotic resistance genes were identified in the st131 w upec isolates and for which these isolates possessed the greatest number of antibiotic resistance genes compared to the other w upec strains among the 60 antibiotic resistance genes identified bla ctx m 15 bla oxa 1 ampc aac 6 ib cr aac 3 ii ptsi parc gyra catb3 and vagc were only present in st131 w upec strains and not the other w upec strains the presence of bla ctx m 15 bla oxa 1 and the ampc gene suggested that these isolates may represent esbl producing e coli the five st131 w upec strains also carried two genes encoding aminoglycoside modifying enzymes aac 3 iib and aac 6 iia representing the most common mechanisms for resistance against aminoglycosides ramirez and tolmasky 2010 the five st131 w upec strains also possessed four genes that confer resistance to fosfomycin including glpt ptsi uhpt and mdtg ballestero tellez et al 2017 ohkoshi et al 2017 among which ptsi was only found in the five st131 strains two additional antibiotic resistance genes found only in the five st131 strains included parc and gyra genes involved in fluoroquinolone resistance johnning et al 2015 the chloramphenicol resistance gene catb3 bunny et al 1995 was also exclusively present in the five st131 strains the antibiotic resistance gene profiles of the remaining 19 w upec isolates supplementary table s4 were quite similar to each other and contained upwards of 49 antibiotic resistance genes these genes are known to confer resistance to various classes of antibiotics including β lactams fluoroquinolones fosfomycin phenicol antibiotics tetracycline ansamycins macrolides nitrofurantoins aminoglycosides aminocoumarin peptide antibiotics and lincosamides although the 24 w upec from chlorine treated sewage were shown to possess an abundance of antibiotic resistance genes phenotypically only 11 of the isolates displayed antibiotic resistance at clinical minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints as determined by antibiotic susceptibility testing using vitek 2 ast n391 and ast gn98 cards table 5 the five st131 strains were shown to be clinically resistant to 16 antibiotics from five different antimicrobial classes including the penicillins and β lactam β lactamase inhibitor combinations cephalosporins aminoglycosides and quinolones and fluoroquinolones these isolates were phenotypically classified as esbls antibiotic resistance in the other six w upec were as follows wu1157 an st127 strain was only resistant to cefalexin cephalosporins wu3598 an unknown st strain was resistant to ampicillin only wu3165 an st117 strain was resistant to the quinolone antibiotics enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin and chloramphenicol phenicols wu2356 an st6331 strain was resistant to chloramphenicol phenicols wu1630 an st640 strain was resistant to cefalexin cephalosporins and chloramphenicol phenicols and wu664 an st538 strain was resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics cefpodoxime cefovecin ceftiofur cefazolin cefalexin and cefixime as well as β lactam beta lactamase inhibitors including amoxicillin clavulanic acid and piperacillin tazobactam collectively the data confirms that w upec isolates surviving chlorination appear to represent clinically important upec pathotypes of public health concern and include the emerging antibiotic resistant esbl strains associated with the o25b st131 lineage and other public health strains of global public health significance i e st95 st127 st640 3 6 characterization of w upec in full scale wastewater effluents the screening protocols developed for identification and characterization of clinically important upec from chlorinated sewage samples was subsequently used to identify and isolate upec from full scale wwtps from the city of calgary supplementary fig s1 a microbial library of presumptive e coli isolates from partially treated e g secondary treated and uv disinfected wastewater effluents was generated and represented the survivor population of e coli from 3 different wwtps these samples were collected from different days throughout the year this collection of e coli isolates was negatively selected against naturalized wastewater strains i e those possessing the uspc is30 flhdc marker of the 261 e coli isolates randomly selected for analysis from 1212 isolates collected only 13 isolates 5 possessed the uspc is30 flhdc marker and were therefore considered as naturalized wastewater e coli the remaining 248 e coli isolates were subsequently tested for the presence of the uida gene five upec related virulence genes papc sfa foc fyua chua and iron as well as the st131 o25b st131 stx1 and stx2 pcr markers one hundred and fifty five isolates possessed one or more of the upec related virulence genes nineteen isolates possessed 3 or more virulence genes of these 19 isolates however only 1 was st131 positive fifteen additional st131 positive isolates were also identified and which possessed at least one other upec related virulence gene the 19 e coli isolates containing more than 3 virulence genes and the 15 st 131 positive isolates were further characterized genetically n 34 rep pcr was used to look at clonal relatedness between the whole genome characterized w upec isolates from chlorinated sewage i e isolates from sample set 1 and isolates screened from the effluents of full scale wastewater treatment plants sample set 2 in total 16 unique rep pcr fingerprints were obtained through this comparison table 6 lists all rep pcr patterns represented by more than two isolates pattern iii was the most abundant clonal group and contained the five st131 w upec strains isolated from chlorinated sewage sample set 1 as well as seven st131 strains isolated from full scale wastewater treated effluents sample set 2 interestingly all e coli strains belonging to rep pcr pattern iii i e those collected from chlorinated sewage or full scale treated wastewater were also pcr positive for the o25b st131 sub lineage marker fig 3 the remaining nine st131 strains obtained from full scale treated wastewater effluents formed the second most abundant clonal group pattern iv rep pcr patterns iii and iv encompassed all st131 strains fig 3 interestingly six of the st131 strains 2f5 2f6 4b8 1f2a 5a5 and 3c4 were all isolated from the final uv disinfected effluents from two different wwtps and on different sampling days suggesting that this clonal population of st131w upec appear to routinely survive the wastewater treatment train among different wwtps throughout the year similar to our findings observed in sample set 1 i e chlorinated sewage no stx1 or stx2 positive e coli isolates were observed in treated effluents from the wwtps in total seven different rep pcr patterns were represented by at least two w upec strains from either the chlorinated sewage samples sample set 1 or from full scale effluents sample set 2 strain 3b7 isolated from a secondary treated effluent at full scale from a wwtp was clonally related to w upec strains wu1025 and wu1157 st127 isolated from chlorinated sewage samples strains 2b8 3h3 2e3 and 4f6 were isolated from secondary treated wastewater effluents and were clonally related to the w upec strain wu965 isolated from chlorinated sewage samples unknown st strains 3b9 and 4g1 isolated from secondary treated wastewater effluents from two different wwtps in calgary were clonally related to the w upec strains wu1274 st95 and wu1151 st95 from chlorinated sewage in total 14 out of 34 strains isolated from full scale wwtp effluents were clonally similar to the whole genome characterized w upec strains found in chlorinated sewage samples suggesting that w upec found in full scale treated wastewater effluents sample set 2 also represented clinically important strains to further validate the clinical importance of these isolates found in treated wastewater effluents sample set 2 antibiotic resistance testing was performed table 5 four of these w upec strains were sensitive to all antibiotics while the other 30 strains showed clinical resistance to one or more antibiotics twenty six of the 34 isolates 76 were resistant to more than 3 antibiotics remarkably one isolate 4c1 collected from a secondary treated wastewater effluent sample represented an st131 strain that was clinically resistant to 19 different antibiotics of the sixteen st131 isolates obtained from wastewater effluents 14 88 were resistant to more than 4 antibiotics w upec isolates 2f5 and 2f6 represented two o25b st131 isolates that a were esbls b had identical clinical antibiotic resistance patterns 15 different antibiotics c possessed resistance to the same 12 antibiotics that o25b st131 strains from chlorinated samples were resistant to d had identical rep pcr patterns to each other and for which the rep pcr patterns were virtually identical to the o25b st131 isolates obtained from chlorinated sewage and e originated from two different wwtps in calgary and for which the point of origin was different than the o25b st131 strains isolated from chlorinated samples coming from the third wwtp in calgary the data suggest that antibiotic resistant clonal o25b st131 strains of upec can be routinely found in finished treated effluents of all of calgary s wwtps in total 7 35 isolates collected from treated wastewater samples were considered as esbls by phenotypic resistance testing five of these belonged to the st131 lineage 4b8 2f5 2f6 4c1 5b5 and two to non st131 lineages 4c8 1e1a 4 discussion collectively the data presented in this study provide compelling evidence that clinically important pathotypes of e coli comprise a major proportion of the e coli population surviving wastewater treatment a finding similar to that reported in other research studies adefisoye and okoh 2016 anastasi et al 2010 boczek et al 2007 ebomah et al 2018 in two separate studies by anastasi et al 2010 2013 certain strains of e coli were shown to have enhanced survivability to wastewater treatment processes including chlorination and uv irradiation and that isolates surviving treatment were dominated by upec pathotypes likewise adefisoye and okoh 2016 and ebomah et al 2018 observed that 40 of e coli isolates from treated wastewater effluents and from a beach impacted by wastewater were deemed to be expec calhau et al 2015 observed a dominance of upec related strains in hospital treated wastewaters including st131 esbl strains in the present study 94 377 25 isolates from chlorinated sewage possessed one or more of the upec related virulence genes similar to the findings described by calhau et al 2015 we also identified a predominance of st131 esbl strains in both chlorinated sewage and in treated wastewater effluents and for which these isolates were obtained from several wastewater treatment plants across alberta canada of 24 wastewater upec isolates subjected to whole genome sequencing in the present study 11 sequence types were represented and dominated by st131 followed by st95 st127 and st640 other sts included st6331 st349 st80 st625 st538 st357 and st117 the majority of these sequence types have also been observed in clinical uti cases 15 16 56 in a u s study by yamaji et al 2018 the most common sts among 233 clinical upec strains were found to be st95 st127 st73 st69 and st131 in a british study the most common sequence types were st73 st131 st69 st95 st10 and st127 gibreel et al 2012b the relative abundance and diversity of upec sequence types observed in treated wastewater effluents and chlorinated sewage compared to other e coli pathotypes i e stec suggests that upec may be more adapted to survival and persistence in environmental water matrices compared to other pathotypes anastasi et al 2013 noted an absence of stec representation in a library of e coli isolates collected from treated wastewater effluents franz et al 2015 also observed a lack of representation of stec in surface and wastewater libraries of e coli but found that gastrointestinal pathotypes included mostly enteroaggregative e coli eaec similar to that reported by anastasi et al 2013 we did not find any stx positive e coli isolates in our chlorinated sewage or wastewater effluent libraries although previous research supports the idea that upec may be particularly adapted to survive wastewater treatment a major challenge rests with the fact that no single virulence gene or designated set can be used to conclusively identify this genetically heterogeneous group of pathogenic e coli barber et al 2016 schreiber et al 2017 in fact expec appear to have exploited an array of molecular strategies and redundant cellular mechanisms to attach and colonize to host cell surfaces and have acquired diverse toxin production systems and invasion strategies that allow it to diversify and exploit multiple niches for survival and growth i e gut urethra bladder kidney and blood barber et al 2016 nielubowicz and mobley 2010 indeed many of the so called virulence genes described from upec are also found in commensal strains of e coli cyoia et al 2015 qin et al 2013 and for which these genes facilitate adhesion and colonization of the gut i e a general prerequisite for survival in the gut for both commensals and pathogens consequently virulence gene profiling among clinical upec strains has been shown to be highly variable kanamaru et al 2003 mao et al 2012 marrs et al 2002 2005 spurbeck et al 2012 vigil et al 2011 yun et al 2014 from a human clinical perspective uti symptomology in clinically ill patients provide the necessary and accessory evidence for labelling a clinical isolate as a upec strain likewise bloodborne infections caused by systemic expec result in a range of clinical symptoms that support culture confirmation of e coli isolated from the blood virulence gene profiling and sequence typing in these cultured isolates simply confirms the pathogenic nature of the isolates unfortunately the lack of a clearly defined set of virulence genes makes it difficult to predict and assess the true pathogenic potential of presumptive strains found in environmental samples this has led to some uncertainty regarding the public health risks posed when these presumptive upec isolates are observed in treated wastewater samples another challenge rests with the fact that animal upec often have similar virulence profiles as human clinical upec suggesting that animal reservoirs may also contribute to the occurrence of presumptive upec in environmental samples but for which the true zoonotic potential of these animal strains still remains somewhat unclear singer 2015 as such this study provides very important evidence validating the genomic relatedness between expec strains in treated sewage wastewater and strains causing clinical disease in humans furthermore it supports the emerging hypothesis that these pathotypes may be adapted to survive water treatment our evidence for clinical relevance is based on a number of comparative genomic approaches including snp core genome analysis pairwise whole genome sequence comparisons virulence gene composition antibiotic resistance gene composition and phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiling across the core genome 0 4 mb analyzed w upec varied from their most closely related c upec counterpart by only a few snps in one case only 1 snp differed whole genome pairwise sequence analysis demonstrated that most w upec strains had 96 similarity to one or more c upec strains found in ncbi of all the w upec strains examined wu1214 had the highest similarity to its c upec counterpart u341 with 99 49 similarity at the whole genome level in most cases virulence gene profiling demonstrated a similar complement of virulence genes between a particular w upec strain and their most closely related c upec counterparts found in ncbi databases for example based on whole genome sequencing all o25b st131 w upec isolates collected from chlorinated sewage possessed the same set of 80 virulence genes that their most closely related c upec counterparts possessed these w upec strains also contained 60 different antibiotic resistance genes and were found to be phenotypically resistant to 16 different antibiotics at clinical minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints genetically and phenotypically the o25b st131 isolates from chlorinated sewage were classified as esbls and were genetically similar to the o25b st131 strains found in the treated effluents of three different wwtps in calgary based on rep pcr and virulence gene profiling the observation that these o25b st131 strains were found in multiple treatment plants and at different times supports the idea that these strains may be evolutionarily adapted to survive wastewater treatment compared to other e coli pathotypes several other sequence types of clinical importance were also identified and characterized in the chlorinated sewage population including those associated with st95 and st127 both considered as globally emerging pathogens of significant concern o hara et al 2019 clonally related isolates from multiple sequence types were found in both treated wastewater effluents as well as chlorinated sewage as further evidence of enhanced survival of upec during wastewater treatment a single sample of chlorinated sewage from a wwtp in calgary alberta contained 13 different upec isolates comprised of 6 different sequence types st131 st80 st625 st127 st95 and an unknown st and for which 11 of the isolates from 4 sequence types st131 st80 st127 and st95 displayed 96 genome similarity to clinical upec collectively our data demonstrate that the upec observed in treated wastewater effluents are very likely to be pathogenic to humans although our screening approach to detect and isolate clinically relevant upec from sewage wastewater was extremely effective the process likely targets select strains and therefore underestimates overall representation of the diversity of clinical upec strains that might be present based on our data we estimate that 25 of the surviving e coli population found in treated wastewater effluents represent potentially pathogenic upec a number that is in alignment with other studies anastasi et al 2010 2013 adefisoye and okoh 2016 ebomah et al 2018 calhau et al 2015 our data is also in alignment with paulshus et al 2019 who recently used whole genome sequencing to characterize esbls from sewage pump stations in suburban communities in norway forty five repetitive samplings were conducted over 15 months of this study generating a library of 3123 e coli isolates up to 10 of e coli isolates observed in this study were considered esbls of which 44 of these were characterized as st131 and st648 strains the fact that these strains were present throughout the sampling period and in such abundance led the authors to speculate that expec may represent a a resident population within wastewater systems or b that these expec strains circulate abundantly in the community and for which infections may be underreported paulshus et al 2019 in a survey of wastewater treatment plants in the u s hoelle et al 2019 also observed a relative abundance of esbl strains associated with st131 o25b st131 and st648 lineages findings that are in alignment with ours our o25b st131 w upec isolates were confirmed as esbls based on phenotypic resistance profiling and were resistant to penicillins β lactam β lactamase inhibitor combinations and all eight cephalosporins cefazolin cefixime ceftriaxone cefalexin cefpodoxime cefovecin ceftazidime and ceftiofur the strains obtained from chlorinated sewage also possessed the bla ctx m 15 bla oxa 1 and ampc genes and for which the bla ctx m 15 and bla oxa 1 genes are known to confer resistance to β lactam β lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotics sugumar et al 2014 in addition to being esbls our o25b st131 strains were also resistant to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones both of which are also commonly used antimicrobials to treat uti ghafourian et al 2015 goodlet et al 2019 the emergence of highly multidrug resistant upec greatly complicates clinical treatment and sometimes results in treatment failure of uti or even death can et al 2015 owens et al 2011 the apparent ability of upec to survive wastewater has also been noted in other e coli strains anastasi et al 2010 2013 including naturalized wastewater strains of e coli zhi et al 2016 2017 2019 naturalized wastewater strains of e coli have been shown to be genetically distinct from the cryptic and the human animal enteric clades of e coli based on comparative whole genome sequencing and phylogrouping zhi et al 2019 they can be distinguished from enteric and cryptic clades through possession of the uspc is30 flhdc marker zhi et al 2016 2019 naturalized wastewater strains possess an over abundance of stress adaptive genes compared to enteric clades zhi et al 2019 believed to be acquired through horizontal gene transfer and have been shown to be resistant to chlorine zhi et al 2017 and heat wang et al 2020 interestingly their extreme resistance to heat is conferred by the locus of heat resistance lhr and for which we have demonstrated that lhr cross protects these strains against chlorine wang et al 2020 the dominance of stress related genes in naturalized wastewater strains of e coli as compared to enteric clades suggests the evolution of survival strategies aimed at overcoming the harsh conditions of a wastewater treatment plant and for which these strains may be specifically adapted to live and survive in this environment based on the thousands of e coli genomes sequenced to date these naturalized strains have only ever been found in sewage and wastewater zhi et al 2019 it is believed that these naturalized wastewater strains of e coli are non pathogenic in nature having abandoned life in the gut of an animal for life in sewage wastewater remarkably these naturalized wastewater e coli strains possess upwards of 36 different upec related virulence genes including a the ferrienterobactin multi enzyme synthetase complex and transport system b upec fimbrial genes c the curli virulence gene csgb d the outer membrane protein gene known as ompa and e the flagellar biosynthesis protein encoded by flha zhi et al 2019 some naturalized strains also possessed the yersiniabactin siderophore biosynthetic pathway and receptor transport system found in many clinical upec as well as the virulence genes fyua and irp1 2 zhi et al 2019 it is interesting to note that the virulence genes highlighted above have been identified as being important in the survival of clinical upec in the nutrient deprived and osmotically hydrologically stressed environment of the urinary tract i e low solutes and repetitive flushing mann et al 2017 for example human upec strains have a predominance of iron sequestering virulence genes e g ferribactin yersinabactin enterobactin related genes and transport pathways to enhance their survival in iron deficient urine terlizzi et al 2017 an important finding noted by zhi et al 2019 was that many of these upec related virulence genes found could also be found in the environmental cryptic clades zhi et al 2019 thus the existence of these so called virulence genes in naturalized wastewater e coli strains environmental cryptic clades of e coli and in clinical upec suggests that the genes may actually provide an adaptive evolutionary advantage for survival in extraintestinal niches including non host environmental niches such as water sewage and wastewater our data and that of others also raises some important questions about the public health risks associated with upec expec infections acquired through waterborne routes of transmission greater than 10 million physician visits occur each year in the u s due to urinary tract infections and for which the vast majority of these infections are caused by upec flores mireles et al 2015 foxman 2010 pitout and devinney 2017 russell et al 2018 xie et al 2006 as with many clinical infections the number of reported cases likely underestimates the true scope of the health issue recently it has been demonstrated that swimming in natural water bodies has been epidemiologically linked to increased prevalence of urinary tract infections utis largely caused by upec soraas et al 2013 urinary pathogenic e coli have also been identified as extremely important emerging foodborne pathogens liu et al 2018 markland et al 2015 and although foodborne upec are typically attributed to animal reservoirs todd 1997 singer 2015 it is important to note that wastewater effluent discharges can comprise a significant proportion of water available for agricultural production animal and crop production it is estimated that 50 of drinking water treatment plants in the u s are impacted by wastewater effluents and in some cases wastewater effluents account for 50 and as high as 90 of river flow volumes in the u s rice and westerhoff 2015 2017 the u s epa estimates that as many as 40 000 sewer overflows occur each year and up to 500 000 km of coastlines rivers and streams do not currently meet ambient microbial water quality guidelines for recreation as a result of human and animal waste contamination us epa 2007a us epa 2007b for these reasons there is growing concern that water could represent an important transmission nexus for upec and other expec strains the plausibility of waterborne disease transmission i e ingestion associated with urinary and septicemic e coli is supported by recent research that suggests that expec strains typically establish infection by first asymptomatically colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of an animal host subsequently invading the gut lining and disseminating to the urinary tract e g upec or bloodstream e g nmec bower et al 2005 russell et al 2017 therefore ingestion of wastewater contaminated food i e crop irrigation drinking water i e untreated or inadequately treated or recreational water i e ingestion offer possible transmission pathways for expec infections from water unfortunately utis or systemic septicemia have not been considered as clinical endpoints for most epidemiological studies examining water as a vehicle of transmission focusing primarily on gastrointestinal illness for example the most recent recreational water quality standards promulgated by the u s epa in 2012 did not include utis or systemic septicemia in their epidemiological benchmarks but rather gastrointestinal illness as the clinical outcome us epa 2012 as mentioned previously utis have been epidemiologically linked to recreational water exposures soraas et al 2013 and esbl e coli have been routinely found in surface water samples and irrigation water samples franz et al 2015 gekenidis et al 2018 gomi et al 2017 njage and buys 2015 nuesch inderbinen et al 2015 in a study by tanner et al 2019 esbls were found in 6 4 of drinking water samples that failed bacteriological water quality parameters in the u s i e total coliforms for which several of the esbls identified were e coli and which led the authors to conclude that drinking water may be an underestimated vehicle for transmission of expec into the community arguably gastrointestinal illness may still be a more sensitive measure of the human health outcomes associated with exposure to contaminated water largely due to the diversity of etiological agents that can cause gastroenteritis viruses bacteria protozoa however given the emerging global distribution and dramatic increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant utis i e esbls and septicemia caused by expec over the last decade we would encourage future research aimed at addressing the contribution that waterborne transmission may play in this important and emerging public health issue this call for research is further galvanized if we consider that pathogens may not only be emerging resistance to antibiotics but also to our most important barrier for infectious disease control in society water treatment and sanitation 5 conclusion clinically relevant upec strains readily survive municipal wastewater treatment processes upec strains found in treated wastewater include st131 esbl producing e coli and represent strains of global public health concern the resistance of upec to wastewater treatment implies that a potentially significant public health risk may exist for downstream drinking water systems impacted by wastewater discharge as well as for crops irrigated with water contaminated by treated wastewater or

17834,reuse of sludge derived fe rich biochar as sludge conditioner is an attractive route for management of waste activated sludge at source homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton reactions have been proved in sludge conditioning with fe rich biochar activating h2o2 to enhance sludge dewaterability the feal2o4 phase in fe rich biochar was first identified during pyrolysis of sewage sludge after adding both fe2o3 and al2o3 since fe and al elements are two of major metal elements in fe rich sludge compared with the fe rich biochar that did not comprise feal2o4 phase the capillary suction time cst and specific resistance to filterability srf of the sludge conditioned with the fe rich biochar comprising feal2o4 phase could be efficiently decreased by 23 and 44 respectively the results indicated that feal2o4 phase in fe rich biochar could improve sludge dewaterability by enhancing heterogeneous fenton reaction synergistic effect between fe and al in feal2o4 contributed to weak the o o bond in h2o2 and reduce the activation energy of h2o2 decomposition for enhancing oh generation which could be explained by density functional theory dft calculations for the first time thus the decomposition rate of h2o2 and the amount of oh generation were obviously promoted by feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar during sludge conditioning attributing to the destruction of sludge flocs the release of bound water and the improvement of sludge dewaterability graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge biochar sludge dewatering feal2o4 heterogeneous fenton reaction extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is attracting more and more attentions due to its large quantity and high annual increase cieślik et al 2015 traditional dewatering methods commonly use polymer conditioner such as polyacrylamide pam as flocculent followed by mechanically dewatering procedure with centrifugation or belt filter press the dewatered sludge cake possesses a high water content of 75 85 wt which cause challenge of subsequent sludge disposal liu et al 2013 deep dewatering of sludge to reduce the water content below 60 wt is effective to reduce volume and mass of sludge for subsequent treatment and disposal yu et al 2008 saprc 2009 recently advanced oxidation processes have been considered as effective pretreatment strategies for sludge dewatering among which fenton and fenton like processes have been intensively studied due to their superior capabilities for destroying sludge flocs and releasing bound water by reactive hydroxyl radicals neyens et al 2004 he et al 2016 the water content of sludge cake could decrease to 54 2 wt after fenton oxidation pretreatment liu et al 2013 however most of the fe element would be remained in sludge cake resulting in a large amount of fe rich sludge cake required to be disposed bautista et al 2008 therefore proper fe rich sludge management strategies with both environmental and economic benefits are of great demand traditional treatment methods of sludge cake including landfilling and incineration are no longer recognized as environmentally sustainable techniques due to the risk of secondary pollution and lack of material recovery chen et al 2018 recently sludge pyrolysis which could eliminate the pollution of toxic organic compounds and immobilize heavy metals has attracted wide attentions because it can significantly reduce the amount of sludge and produce high value added carbon materials for further applications méndez et al 2013 hadi et al 2015 recent researches have confirmed that the fe rich sludge could be converted to fe rich biochar that could activate h2o2 to initiate fenton or fenton like catalytic oxidation for degradation of organic pollutants tu et al 2012 gu et al 2013 the existing mineral phases of iron in the fe rich biochar have important influence on its catalytic performance fe3o4 generated in sludge derived biochar in pyrolysis process showed high catalytic activity in 1 diazo 2 naphthol 4 sulfonic acid degradation gu et al 2012 the biochar comprising fe0 fe3c derived from fe rich sludge via pyrolysis at 900 c exhibited high catalytic behavior in ciprofloxacin degradation zhu et al 2019 in our previous study fe rich biochar was synthesized from pyrolysis of sludge cake conditioned with fenton s reagents tao et al 2019 heterogeneous fenton induced by iron bonded on the fe rich biochar and homogeneous fenton induced by leached fe2 from the fe rich biochar both contributed to the enhanced sludge dewaterability by catalyzing the decomposition of h2o2 however compared to biochar derived from biomass such as lignocellulose and bacterial cellulose the iron containing phase of sludge derived biochar was complicate owing to the existence of rich content of inorganic elements such as si al and ca et al in sludge yuan and dai 2017 besides the generation of iron oxides with different valence state iron would form ferrites with other elements during the thermal treatment process chen et al 2010 recently some studies have showed that ferrite derived from iron rich sludge could act as catalyst with high activity and stability in heterogeneous fenton process zhang et al 2017 cao et al 2017 the catalytic properties of ferrites are strongly dependent on the synergistic effect between divalent ion and trivalent ion jauhar et al 2014 feal2o4 is a kind of ferrites which could be synthesized at high temperature from the reaction between iron oxide and aluminum oxide cabello et al 2014 its high and stable heterogeneous catalytic activities were demonstrated in phenol degradation wang et al 2016 but the mechanism of synergistic effect between fe2 and al3 of feal2o4 contributed to the high catalyst properties for heterogeneous fenton process was still unclarified especially in advanced oxidation treatment of sewage sludge besides fe element al is also the main element in fe rich sludge due to the widely used al rich precipitating agents in wwtps ottosen et al 2013 so during the fe rich sludge pyrolysis process it is reasonable to infer that iron compounds and al2o3 would undergo series of reactions to form feal2o4 phase which may in turn affect the catalytic performance of biochar however to the best of our knowledge the in situ generation of feal2o4 from fe rich sludge has not been reported in this study phase transformations of fe and al compounds in sludge derived biochar during sludge pyrolysis after adding both fe2o3 and al2o3 were studied since fe and al are two of major metal elements in fe rich sludge ottosen et al 2013 bautista et al 2008 moreover the catalytic behavior of the new formed feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar for fenton reaction during sludge conditioning was studied theoretical simulations were conducted to explain the catalytic properties of different iron containing compounds in sludge derived biochar for h2o2 activation the synergistic effect between fe and al of feal2o4 in sludge derived biochar for enhancing h2o2 to be dissociated into oh was explored the electronic localization function elf between fe and o of h2o2 molecule on the surface of biochar was also investigated finally the mechanism of feal2o4 as a catalyst for improving sludge dewatering performance was clarified by the analysis of extracellular polymeric substances eps bound water content zeta potential and particle size distribution of sludge flocs during sludge dewatering the schematic diagram of this study is shown in fig s1 2 materials and methods

through an 80 mesh screen the proximate and element analysis of dried raw sludge are listed in table s1 of the support information the methods of proximate analysis of the samples were according to the chinese national standards of proximate analysis of coal gb t 212 2008 in order to avoid interference from other elements in iron salts during sludge conditioning process the dried rs was mixed with a certain amount of fe2o3 named as rs fe2o3 the mass ratio of fe2o3 to the dried rs was 0 23 which was determined according to the total iron content in added reagents during sludge conditioning process in our previous study tao et al 2019 the samples were heated from room temperature to 800 c with an increment of 10 c per minute in an inert nitrogen atmosphere according to the optimal pyrolysis condition in our previous study tao et al 2019 biochar obtained from the mixture of rs and fe2o3 was named as rs fe to obtain sludge derived biochar with different al element contents the rs fe2o3 was then mixed with al2o3 of different doses of 5 wt 10 wt and 15 wt respectively and then the biochar samples pyrolyzed from those mixtures at 800 c were named as rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al respectively in order to avoid the interference from inorganic minerals in biochar the biochar derived from the demineralized sludge named as drs was used to clarify the mechanism of phase transformation of biochar and catalytic behavior in sludge conditioning process the detailed demineralization treatment method for sludge is presented in text s1 of the support information zhang et al 2016 the proximate and ultimate analysis of dried demineralized sludge is listed in table s1 similar to the synthesis of rs fe biochar the named drs fe biochar was prepared from the mixture of drs 23 wt fe2o3 under the same pyrolysis procedure at 800 c the biochar derived from the mixture of drs 23 wt fe2o3 5 wt al2o3 was named as drs fe 5al in order to figure out the effect of fe in biochar on sludge dewaterability the biochar derived from the mixture of drs 5 wt al2o3 was named as drs 5al the chemical compositions of inorganic elements of the different biochar samples were analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf table s2 2 3 sludge conditioning procedure and sludge dewaterability the sludge was conditioned according to our previous study tao et al 2019 adjusting the initial ph of sludge to 2 biochar adding mixing for 5 min h2o2 adding mixing for 30min the doses of h2o2 and biochar sample were applied according to the optimal values in our previous study shown in table s3 in order to focus on the effect of al element content in biochar on the dewaterability of sludge the total mass of fe content of the added biochar samples was controlled as the same the fe contents in biochar

hydroxyl radical oh production during reaction was detected through benzoic acid method by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20at shimadzu with a c18 column and ultraviolet detector chen et al 2017 the mobile phase composed of 15 acetonitrile and 85 water the flow rate was 1 ml min and the detection wavelength was 270 nm the organic compounds in eps were analyzed through three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem by a fp 6500 fluorescence spectrometer jasco japan zhang et al 2015 protein in eps of sludge was measured by protein assay kit thermofisher shanghai china based on the lowry s method yu et al 2016 the concentration of h2o2 was analyzed via titanometry sellers 1980 the concentration of fe2 in the solution was measured by 1 10 phenanthroline method hou et al 2017 the zeta potential of biochar and sludge samples was measured by a zeta potential analyzing instrument brookhaven ltd zetaplus usa the particle sizes of sludge samples were measured with a laser particle size analyzer bettersize china 2 6 characterization methods of biochar samples the mineral phases of biochar samples were analyzed through x ray diffraction xrd method using an x ray diffractometer xrd7000 shimadzu japan the inorganic elements compositions of the biochar samples were analyzed by the xrf spectrometer axiosmax panalytical netherlands the quantitative x ray diffraction analysis was carried out with maud 2 92 software since the biochar samples might contain both amorphous and crystalline phases all biochar samples were mixed with 20 25 wt of caf2 as an internal standard to help quantify amorphous content liao et al 2015 morphology and microstructural characterization of biochar samples were carried out with scanning electron microscopy sirion 2000 fei netherlands and transmission electron microscopy tecnai g2 20 fei netherlands the specific surface area of the biochar samples were determined by a surface area analyzer bk112 tb jwgb china tao et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of al2o3 content on phase composition of sludge biochar 3 1 1 the main characteristics of the sludge biochar samples the surface area of biochar samples obtained by the demineralized sludge was much lower than that of biochar samples derived from raw sludge table 3 this might be because that the inorganic minerals in sludge could act as skeleton to form porous structure liu et al 2016 the surface area results also showed that the addition of al2o3 to the sludge did not affect the surface area of sludge derived biochar obviously the morphologies of different sludge biochar samples are presented in fig s4 of the support information it was observed that the surface of the rs fe rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al was rough and covered by irregular particles possibly resulting from the added iron aluminum salts and intrinsic inorganic matters in sludge lu et al 2013 the morphology of biochar samples drs fe and drs fe 5al derived from the demineralized sludge was much smoother than that of rs fe it is consistent with the xrf results of biochar samples table s2 that most of inorganic elements such as si al na et al were successfully removed during the demineralization process other physicochemical properties of different biochar samples are also provided in table 3 due to the mixing the inorganic minerals fe2o3 and al2o3 the yield of biochar samples increased from rs derived biochar 49 90 to rs fe 5al 60 96 and also increased from drs derived biochar 19 44 to drs fe 5al 39 33 as the al element content in the sludge biochar increased the ph of the leaching solution of biochar decreased this might be because the added al2o3 could increase lewis acid sites in biochar and increase the ability of surface hydroxyl groups to dissociate or to be protonated in water kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 the h has a tendency to release from al oh resulting in the less negative charge of biochar particles thus zeta potential of the leaching solution of biochar samples increased with the increase of al content of biochar which is consistent with the previous study tu et al 2012 3 1 2 phase compositions of biochar samples with different al element contents the added al2o3 has a great effect on the phase compositions of the biochar samples fig 1 the main crystalline minerals of rs fe are sio2 and iron containing compounds including fe0 fe0 95c0 05 fe3o4 fesio3 and feal2o4 fig 1a comparing with rs fe the peak of fe3o4 in the biochar samples of rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al gradually disappeared while the intensity of the peak of feal2o4 in the biochar samples gradually increased with the increase of al2o3 dose peak intensities of other iron containing compounds peak showed no obvious change based on the above results it was inferred that al2o3 could react with iron compounds in biochar to form feal2o4 phase at 800 c which is consistent with previous research chai and zhang 2017 the crystalline mineral of drs derived biochar was only quartz sio2 fig 1b which further proved the effect of the demineralization process the xrd pattern of drs 5al biochar showed that the added al2o3 tended to react with sio2 to form al2o3 sio2 during pyrolysis at 800 c to further prove the effect of al2o3 addition on feal2o4 generation the phase compositions of drs fe and drs fe 5al biochar samples are comparatively presented in fig 1b after eliminating the influence of intrinsic minerals in the sludge the main crystals of drs fe are only remained as fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 the newly generated feal2o4 phase was identified in drs fe 5al with adding of al2o3 it further demonstrated that the al2o3 and iron containing compounds of sludge could form feal2o4 phase during the pyrolysis procedure the tem images of drs fe 5al are shown in fig s5 the crystalline structure of drs fe 5al biochar has an interplanar spacing of 2 04 å corresponding to the 0 0 4 plane of feal2o4 3 1 3 quantitative x ray diffraction analysis the xrd results of the biochar samples and the theoretical calculation results were fitted fig s6 the reliability indices of the fitting results are listed in table s4 the low index values rp and rwp 5 gof 5 indicated the success of the quantitative analysis with reliable quantification results liao et al 2015 comparing the relative content of the fe containing phases in drs fe and drs fe 5al the amount of feal2o4 phase in drs fe 5al significantly increased and the content of amorphous fe decreased to some extent fig 2 a furthermore there was indiscernible change in the content of both fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 phases it indicated that the formation of feal2o4 might be attributed to the transformation of the amorphous fe in the biochar during pyrolysis comparing the relative contents of the fe containing phase in rs fe rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al with the increase of al content both fe3o4 and fesio3 phases decreased obviously while the zero valent iron and the amorphous fe slightly increased fig 2a it was further inferred that the fe3o4 fesio3 could react with the added al2o3 to form feal2o4 during pyrolysis at 800 c gibbs free energy changes δg of possible reactions 1 3 for the generation of the feal2o4 phase during the sludge pyrolysis process are presented in fig 2b the δg values of all the reactions were negative at temperature of 800 c indicating that the conversion of fe3o4 fesio3 and feo into feal2o4 phase through reacting with al2o3 could proceed spontaneously thus the results of thermodynamics also proved that the fe containing compounds in the sludge had a tendency to form feal2o4 1 fe3o4 al2o3 feal2o4 fe2o3 2 fesio3 al2o3 feal2o4 sio2 3 feo al2o3 feal2o4 3 2 sludge dewatering performance after conditioning with different fe rich biochar samples and h2o2 3 2 1 sludge conditioning and dewatering performance results the results of dewatering performance of sludge conditioned by rs derived biochar samples with different al element contents are shown in fig 3 a compared with the cst 205 2 s and srf 2 45 1013 m kg of rs table 1 the cst and srf of sludge with only acidic and h2o2 treatment referred to as control decreased to 110 4 s and 1 3 1013 m kg suggesting that the effect of acidic treatment control on sludge dewaterability was limited fig 3 compared with only acidic treatment the dewaterability of sludge conditioned by rs fe and h2o2 was significantly improved which is consistent with our previous study tao et al 2019 compared with rs fe h2o2 system the sludge dewaterability conditioned with rs fe 5al h2o2 system was significantly improved and the cst and srf of the conditioned sludge decreased by about 23 and 44 respectively and the water content of sludge cake decreased by about 9 62 fig s7 compared with the control group the cst and srf of sludge conditioned with rs fe 5al h2o2 system decreased by 71 5 and 82 7 respectively it indicated that the sludge dewaterability could be improved by conditioning with rs derived biochar by adding fe2o3 and al2o3 before pyrolysis however sludge dewatering performance changed indiscernibly with the increase of al2o3 dose from 10 to 15 wt figs 3 and s7 it might be because the dose of h2o2 was limited it indicated that the generation of oh during sludge conditioning was limited even though the generated feal2o4 phase increased as the al2o3 dose increased thus in the subsequent mechanism experiments the dose of al2o3 was chosen as 5 wt of dry solid of sludge compared with the control group of sludge conditioned by acidic treatment and adding h2o2 alone dewatering performance of sludge conditioned by drs 5al h2o2 system has no improvement suggesting that drs 5al has no effect on sludge dewaterability figs 3 and s7 compared the dewatering performance of sludge conditioned by drs 5al h2o2 with drs fe h2o2 system it was concluded that fe played a dominant role in improving sludge dewaterability according to our previous study fe2 leached from biochar and fe ii bonded on the biochar both contributed to initiate fenton reaction during sludge conditioning tao et al 2019 compared with drs fe h2o2 system the sludge dewaterability conditioned by drs fe 5al h2o2 system was significantly improved and the cst and srf decreased by about 28 and 40 6 respectively fig 3b and the water content of sludge cake decreased by about 9 09 fig s7 combined with the xrd phase analysis of drs derived biochar samples in fig 1b the feal2o4 phase was identified after adding both al and fe in drs during the pyrolysis process which demonstrated that the feal2o4 phase in biochar had a significant influence on sludge dewatering performance improvement 3 2 2 the analysis of homogenous and heterogeneous fenton reaction in sludge conditioning procedure compared with rs fe and rs fe 5al the increase of al element content in sludge biochar had no significant effect on fe2 leaching behavior fig s8 the amount of soluble fe2 from rs fe 5al was lower than that of rs fe therefore rs fe 5al has indiscernible effect on improvement of homogeneous fenton reaction compared with rs fe as shown in fig s8b based on our previous study fe2 dissolved from biochar samples was mainly from the fe0 and iron carbon compound fe0 95c0 05 and then the generated fe2 in liquid phase would initiate the homogeneous fenton process tao et al 2019 yang et al 2009 combined with the corresponding quantitative xrd analysis in figs 1 and 2 the contents of fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 changed a little with the addition of al this might be the main reason why the fe2 leaching concentration did not change obviously with the addition of al element after leaching process the crystalline peaks of fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 disappeared fig s9 while the crystalline peaks of feal2o4 did not show obvious changes showing great stability of feal2o4 in biochar under acid solution during sludge conditioning based on the above results rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar had little effect on improving the homogeneous fenton reaction compared with rs fe and drs fe biochar without adding al2o3 however rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar significantly enhanced the sludge dewatering performance compared with rs fe and drs fe biochar figs 3 and s7 it was inferred that the heterogeneous fenton reaction mainly contributed to the enhanced sludge dewaterability during sludge treatment process conditioned with rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar it indicated that the feal2o4 phase in rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar might play a key role in the heterogeneous fenton reaction the h2o2 decomposition rate in the presence of rs fe 5al was higher than that with rs fe fig 4 a similar results were observed in the drs derived groups of drs fe and drs fe 5al fig 4b it indicated that the newly formed feal2o4 phase might improve the catalytic performance of biochar for enhanced h2o2 decomposition by heterogeneous fenton reaction comparing the h2o2 decomposition rate with the drs 5al and drs fe biochar it could be concluded that both the fe2 leached from biochar and fe ii bonded on the surface of biochar were the main reason for promoting the h2o2 decomposition with drs fe biochar the faster the decomposition rate of h2o2 the more radicals might be generated which would improve the oxidation intensity of the fenton reaction thus contributing to enhance the destruction of the sludge flocs and release more intracellular bound water he et al 2016 in many reported fenton systems h2o2 takes part in both the production of oh reactive oxygen species for sludge flocs destruction and o2h or o2 ineffective consumption of h2o2 ma et al 2018 in order to evaluate the effective decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of different biochar samples the content of oh generated during sludge conditioning was measured fig 4c and d comparing oh generation rate during sludge conditioning with rs fe and rs fe 5al biochar in fig 4c the oh generation rate in the presence of rs fe 5al was much higher than that with rs fe the rate and amount of oh generation during sludge conditioning with drs fe and drs fe 5al showed the same trend fig 4c and d no oh was observed during sludge conditioning with drs 5al which is consistent with the previous study that al iii compounds could not catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 bokare and choi 2014 these results further proved that feal2o4 phase in rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar played a major role in catalyzing the heterogeneous fenton reaction 3 3 the synergistic effect between fe and al elements in biochar h2o2 conditioning system 3 3 1 the feal2o4 phase in biochar for high h2o2 utilization efficiency based on the xrd results in fig 1 the theoretical simulations of the surface structure of pure feo fe3o4 fesio3 and feal2o4 on each facets for h2o2 adsorption were investigated as shown in fig 5 a d the adsorption energy δeads of h2o2 exhibited an order of pure feo 0 56 ev fesio3 0 67 ev fe3o4 1 17 ev feal2o4 5 82 ev it indicated that the h2o2 molecule was more easily adsorbed on the surface of feal2o4 thus leading to the increase of h2o2 decomposition rate during the sludge conditioning process fig 4 compared with the initial state of h2o2 molecule on the surface of iron containing compounds fig s3 the o o bond lengths of the h2o2 molecule apparently increased in the order of pure fesio3 1 479 å feo 1 481 å fe3o4 1 486 å feal2o4 3 042 å fig 5 it illustrated that the o o bonds were strongly weakened on the surface of feal2o4 phase with the introduction of al element luo et al 2010 as shown in fig 5 the absolute values of δq for the two o atoms of h2o2 on the surface of different iron compounds maintained the order rule of fesio3 0 020 e feo 0 052 e fe3o4 0 111 e feal2o4 1 087 e it implied that the o atoms of the h2o2 molecule on the surface of feal2o4 obtained much more electrons from feal2o4 phase than those from feo fe3o4 and fesio3 phases thus h2o2 molecule becomes more activated and tends to be more easily dissociated into oh and oh group on the surface of feal2o4 phase during the heterogeneous fenton reaction it is consistent with the experimental results of the oh generation during the sludge conditioning with the rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar fig 4 3 3 2 the analysis of the electronic localization function elf the intensity of the total electronic density between the two o atoms in h2o2 molecule increases from 0 0 to 1 0 fig s10 only one attractor elf 0 7 was observed in the middle of the o o bond of the h2o2 molecule on the surface of feo fe3o4 and fesio3 figs s10a c indicating that a strong covalent bond was observed between the two o atoms wang et al 2019 as shown in fig s10d there were two attractors elf 0 7 between the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule on the surface of feal2o4 phase corresponding to the 2p electrons in the two o atoms it indicated that the strong covalent bond of o o bond in h2o2 molecule was broken becke and edgecombe 1990 the two dimensional valence electron density maps demonstrated that there were no strong interaction between the o atom of oh group in h2o2 molecule and fe atom on the surface of feo fe3o4 and fesio3 figs s11a c as shown in fig s11d strong interaction between the fe atom on the surface of feal2o4 and the oh group was observed forming a charge transfer channel to transfer from the fe atom to o atom of the oh group it indicated that the outermost electrons tended to accumulate on h2o2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of feal2o4 phase li et al 2017 the two dimensional valence electron density maps between al atom on the surface of feal2o4 and the other oh group of h2o2 molecule were also calculated fig s12 an obvious charge transfer channel was found between al and o atoms in oh group which confirmed that the strong chemical attraction between al atom on the surface of feal2o4 and o atom of the h2o2 was mainly due to the lewis acidity of the al atom in order to eliminate the influence of different exposed facets on the h2o2 activation and further confirm the function of al on the high reactivity toward fenton reaction during sludge dewatering the modified crystal structure of al doped feo was cleaved as a slab model under periodic boundary condition to represent the surface structure as shown in fig 6 a and b the δeads exhibited an order of pure feo 0 56 ev al doped feo 6 70 ev it indicated that the h2o2 molecule was more easily adsorbed on the surface of al doped feo compared to feo the o o bond length of the h2o2 molecule was apparently increased in the order of feo 1 481 å al doped feo 3 113 å which illustrated that the o o bonds were strongly weakened in al doped feo phase compared to feo the absolute values of δq for the two o atoms on the surface of two iron compounds maintained the rule of feo 0 052 e al doped feo 1 087 e it indicated that the intensity of the charge delivery channel between h2o2 molecule and two iron compounds apparently increased from the elf calculation results only one attractor elf 0 7 was observed in the middle of the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule on the surface of feo phase fig 6c however two attractors elf 0 7 were observed between the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule on the surface of al doped feo phase corresponding to the 2p electrons in the two o atoms fig 6d it suggested that the strong covalent bond between the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule was broken all the above results confirmed that the al doped feo could activate the o o bond in h2o2 more easily 3 3 3 the schematic illustration of synergistic catalysis of fe and al elements in feal2o4 for enhancing heterogeneous fenton reaction herein it indicated that the adsorption and activation of h2o2 molecules on the feal2o4 surface could be attributed to the al lewis acidity and the interactions between fe and al in fe2 al3 unit on the surface of feal2o4 the schematic illustration of the whole process of heterogeneous fenton reaction occurred on the surface fe2 al3 unit is presented in fig 7 specifically the mechanism of feal2o4 enhancing heterogeneous fenton reaction could be elucidated as follows step i the preactivation of h2o2 as discussed above the two o atoms in h2o2 molecule had strong chemical attraction separately with the fe and al atoms of feal2o4 step ii the decomposition of h2o2 the covalent interaction in h2o2 molecule was weakened and less energy was required for h2o2 molecule to climb over the barrier to be dissociated step iii the generation of oh on the surface fe2 al3 unit the h2o2 molecule would obtain an electron from fe2 and then it would be dissociated into oh and oh group after the electron transformation the generated oh and oh were captured by fe3 and al3 in fe2 al3 unit wherein the oh group was neutralized by h in the solution to form h2o molecule and the oh was desorbed into the solution to destroy sludge flocs 3 4 sludge dewatering mechanism 3 4 1 changes in sludge physicochemical properties as shown in fig 8 a the rs had a negatively charge and the initial zeta potential was 12 63 0 44 mv possibly due to the ionization functional groups in sludge flocs xiao et al 2018 as shown in fig s13 by only acidification ph 2 0 and h2o2 pre treatment the zeta potential of sludge of control group elevated from 12 63 0 44 mv to 8 19 0 61 mv due to the high concentration of h in the liquid phase compared with the control group the zeta potential values of sludge conditioned with rs fe biochar decreased from 8 19 0 61 mv to 5 99 0 41 mv mainly due to the release of negative charged intracellular polymers i e protein released during the sludge conditioning process compared with the rs fe and drs fe the zeta potential of sludge samples conditioned with rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al decreased from 5 99 0 41 mv and 5 12 0 34 mv to 1 11 0 37 mv and 0 91 0 44 mv respectively it is because that the formed feal2o4 phase in biochar would cause the faster decomposition rate of h2o2 and the more amount of oh generation during the sludge conditioning process and then more sludge flocs would be disrupted and more negative charged intracellular polymers i e protein would be released leading to the decrease of zeta potential the less positive zeta potential suggested the decreasing positive charge density and the decreasing repulsive force between sludge particles which would lead to agglomeration of flocs and finally enhance the sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2018 it is noted that the particle size of the flocs conditioned with the rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar was smaller than those of rs fe and drs fe biochar respectively table s5 furthermore the smaller flocs sizes indicated the successful disruption of sludge flocs and eps by oh oxidation during sludge conditioning which was an important factor affecting sludge dewaterability fig 8b it was concluded that the feal2o4 phase in biochar efficiently enhanced the dewaterability of sludge through promoting charge neutralization and release of bound water 3 4 2 changes in eps properties since protein in sludge is the main factor affecting sludge dewaterability the changes of extracellular protein under different sludge conditioning process were also investigated wu et al 2017 compared with rs sludge conditioned by drs fe and rs fe contained less organic compounds and protein in tb eps than those in lb and sb eps fig 9 it indicated that both homogeneous fenton reaction initiated by the fe2 in the liquid and heterogeneous fenton reaction initiated by the bound fe ii on the surface of biochar could decompose the eps and release the organic matters and protein from the inner layer tb eps to the outer of flocs sb eps xiao et al 2017 moreover the sludge conditioned by drs fe 5al and rs fe 5al showed higher toc and protein contents in tb eps and sb eps compared to the drs fe and rs fe this confirmed that the feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar contributed to higher destruction of the sludge flocs by oh oxidation attack which is consistent with the analysis of oh generation in fig 4 the more organic compounds and proteins were released from sludge flocs the more negative charged intercellular polymers and bound water would be released which is consistent with the results of zeta potential and bound water content of conditioned sludge samples in fig 8 in order to further explore the organic compounds in different fractions of eps extracted from sludge 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied table 4 for rs fe and drs fe conditioning compared to the rs intensities of fulvic acid like and humic acid like organic compounds obviously increased in sb eps while the intensities of all the organic compounds were weaken in lb and tb eps for rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar h2o2 conditioning system it could be observed that tyrosine like proteins and tryptophan like proteins in lb eps were also significantly reduced compared to rs fe and drs fe biochar h2o2 conditioning system the pearson correlation matrix is presented in table 5 there were positive correlations r 0 7 p 0 05 among improved dewaterability cst and srf indexes the removal of tryptophan like protein and tyrosine like proteins in lb eps and soluble microbial byproduct like substances in tb eps these results showed that the inner part of sludge flocs such as tb eps and protein like compounds in lb eps had a strong relationship with the sludge dewaterability which was consistent with our previous study lv et al 2019 the breakage and oxidative degradation of them could be attributed to the heterogeneous fenton reaction initiated by feal2o4 phase contributing to enhancement of sludge dewaterability in biochar conditioning process the mechanism of al element in sludge derived biochar for enhancing the dewaterability of sludge could be concluded in two aspects first the preactivation of h2o2 caused by the interactions between fe and al elements in fe2 al3 unit on the surface of feal2o4 would make the h2o2 easier to be dissociated into oh and oh group furthermore the oh generated from the surface of biochar would be more likely to react with the inner sludge flocs leading to the significant degradation of the protein like substances and soluble microbial byproduct like substances therefore the heterogeneous fenton reaction between feal2o4 and h2o2 enhanced the dewaterability through promoting the destruction of the inner eps fractions of sludge and releasing more bound water 4 conclusions in this study the synergistic catalytic effect between fe and al elements of feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar on initiating h2o2 during sludge conditioning process was clarified the feal2o4 phase was identified for the first time in fe rich biochar after adding both fe2o3 and al2o3 in raw sludge rs and demineralized sludge drs during pyrolysis process at 800 c due to the strong chemical attraction between the two o atoms in h2o2 molecule and fe al atoms in fe2 al3 unit on the surface of feal2o4 phase the covalent interaction of o o bond in h2o2 molecule was weakened and then h2o2 molecule was easily dissociated into oh and oh group during sludge conditioning step the decomposition rate of h2o2 and the amount of oh generation were obviously promoted by feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar attributing to the destruction of the inner part of sludge flocs such as tb eps and protein like compounds in lb eps fractions of sludge and the release of more bound water in general a deep illustration has been explored on the enhanced heterogeneous fenton reaction by synergistic interaction between fe and al elements of the feal2o4 phase in biochar during sludge conditioning the result could promote the sustainable sludge recycling

17834,reuse of sludge derived fe rich biochar as sludge conditioner is an attractive route for management of waste activated sludge at source homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton reactions have been proved in sludge conditioning with fe rich biochar activating h2o2 to enhance sludge dewaterability the feal2o4 phase in fe rich biochar was first identified during pyrolysis of sewage sludge after adding both fe2o3 and al2o3 since fe and al elements are two of major metal elements in fe rich sludge compared with the fe rich biochar that did not comprise feal2o4 phase the capillary suction time cst and specific resistance to filterability srf of the sludge conditioned with the fe rich biochar comprising feal2o4 phase could be efficiently decreased by 23 and 44 respectively the results indicated that feal2o4 phase in fe rich biochar could improve sludge dewaterability by enhancing heterogeneous fenton reaction synergistic effect between fe and al in feal2o4 contributed to weak the o o bond in h2o2 and reduce the activation energy of h2o2 decomposition for enhancing oh generation which could be explained by density functional theory dft calculations for the first time thus the decomposition rate of h2o2 and the amount of oh generation were obviously promoted by feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar during sludge conditioning attributing to the destruction of sludge flocs the release of bound water and the improvement of sludge dewaterability graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge biochar sludge dewatering feal2o4 heterogeneous fenton reaction extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is attracting more and more attentions due to its large quantity and high annual increase cieślik et al 2015 traditional dewatering methods commonly use polymer conditioner such as polyacrylamide pam as flocculent followed by mechanically dewatering procedure with centrifugation or belt filter press the dewatered sludge cake possesses a high water content of 75 85 wt which cause challenge of subsequent sludge disposal liu et al 2013 deep dewatering of sludge to reduce the water content below 60 wt is effective to reduce volume and mass of sludge for subsequent treatment and disposal yu et al 2008 saprc 2009 recently advanced oxidation processes have been considered as effective pretreatment strategies for sludge dewatering among which fenton and fenton like processes have been intensively studied due to their superior capabilities for destroying sludge flocs and releasing bound water by reactive hydroxyl radicals neyens et al 2004 he et al 2016 the water content of sludge cake could decrease to 54 2 wt after fenton oxidation pretreatment liu et al 2013 however most of the fe element would be remained in sludge cake resulting in a large amount of fe rich sludge cake required to be disposed bautista et al 2008 therefore proper fe rich sludge management strategies with both environmental and economic benefits are of great demand traditional treatment methods of sludge cake including landfilling and incineration are no longer recognized as environmentally sustainable techniques due to the risk of secondary pollution and lack of material recovery chen et al 2018 recently sludge pyrolysis which could eliminate the pollution of toxic organic compounds and immobilize heavy metals has attracted wide attentions because it can significantly reduce the amount of sludge and produce high value added carbon materials for further applications méndez et al 2013 hadi et al 2015 recent researches have confirmed that the fe rich sludge could be converted to fe rich biochar that could activate h2o2 to initiate fenton or fenton like catalytic oxidation for degradation of organic pollutants tu et al 2012 gu et al 2013 the existing mineral phases of iron in the fe rich biochar have important influence on its catalytic performance fe3o4 generated in sludge derived biochar in pyrolysis process showed high catalytic activity in 1 diazo 2 naphthol 4 sulfonic acid degradation gu et al 2012 the biochar comprising fe0 fe3c derived from fe rich sludge via pyrolysis at 900 c exhibited high catalytic behavior in ciprofloxacin degradation zhu et al 2019 in our previous study fe rich biochar was synthesized from pyrolysis of sludge cake conditioned with fenton s reagents tao et al 2019 heterogeneous fenton induced by iron bonded on the fe rich biochar and homogeneous fenton induced by leached fe2 from the fe rich biochar both contributed to the enhanced sludge dewaterability by catalyzing the decomposition of h2o2 however compared to biochar derived from biomass such as lignocellulose and bacterial cellulose the iron containing phase of sludge derived biochar was complicate owing to the existence of rich content of inorganic elements such as si al and ca et al in sludge yuan and dai 2017 besides the generation of iron oxides with different valence state iron would form ferrites with other elements during the thermal treatment process chen et al 2010 recently some studies have showed that ferrite derived from iron rich sludge could act as catalyst with high activity and stability in heterogeneous fenton process zhang et al 2017 cao et al 2017 the catalytic properties of ferrites are strongly dependent on the synergistic effect between divalent ion and trivalent ion jauhar et al 2014 feal2o4 is a kind of ferrites which could be synthesized at high temperature from the reaction between iron oxide and aluminum oxide cabello et al 2014 its high and stable heterogeneous catalytic activities were demonstrated in phenol degradation wang et al 2016 but the mechanism of synergistic effect between fe2 and al3 of feal2o4 contributed to the high catalyst properties for heterogeneous fenton process was still unclarified especially in advanced oxidation treatment of sewage sludge besides fe element al is also the main element in fe rich sludge due to the widely used al rich precipitating agents in wwtps ottosen et al 2013 so during the fe rich sludge pyrolysis process it is reasonable to infer that iron compounds and al2o3 would undergo series of reactions to form feal2o4 phase which may in turn affect the catalytic performance of biochar however to the best of our knowledge the in situ generation of feal2o4 from fe rich sludge has not been reported in this study phase transformations of fe and al compounds in sludge derived biochar during sludge pyrolysis after adding both fe2o3 and al2o3 were studied since fe and al are two of major metal elements in fe rich sludge ottosen et al 2013 bautista et al 2008 moreover the catalytic behavior of the new formed feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar for fenton reaction during sludge conditioning was studied theoretical simulations were conducted to explain the catalytic properties of different iron containing compounds in sludge derived biochar for h2o2 activation the synergistic effect between fe and al of feal2o4 in sludge derived biochar for enhancing h2o2 to be dissociated into oh was explored the electronic localization function elf between fe and o of h2o2 molecule on the surface of biochar was also investigated finally the mechanism of feal2o4 as a catalyst for improving sludge dewatering performance was clarified by the analysis of extracellular polymeric substances eps bound water content zeta potential and particle size distribution of sludge flocs during sludge dewatering the schematic diagram of this study is shown in fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals raw sludge rs used in this research was thicken waste activated sludge from shahu municipal wwtp wuhan china the main characteristics and the chemical compositions of rs

kgaa 2 2 preparation of sludge derived biochar with different al element contents the sludge biochar was prepared by the following procedures rs was first dried at 105 c for 24 h ground and screened through an 80 mesh screen the proximate and element analysis of dried raw sludge are listed in table s1 of the support information the methods of proximate analysis of the samples were according to the chinese national standards of proximate analysis of coal gb t 212 2008 in order to avoid interference from other elements in iron salts during sludge conditioning process the dried rs was mixed with a certain amount of fe2o3 named as rs fe2o3 the mass ratio of fe2o3 to the dried rs was 0 23 which was determined according to the total iron content in added reagents during sludge conditioning process in our previous study tao et al 2019 the samples were heated from room temperature to 800 c with an increment of 10 c per minute in an inert nitrogen atmosphere according to the optimal pyrolysis condition in our previous study tao et al 2019 biochar obtained from the mixture of rs and fe2o3 was named as rs fe to obtain sludge derived biochar with different al element contents the rs fe2o3 was then mixed with al2o3 of different doses of 5 wt 10 wt and 15 wt respectively and then the biochar samples pyrolyzed from those mixtures at 800 c were named as rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al respectively in order to avoid the interference from inorganic minerals in biochar the biochar derived from the demineralized sludge named as drs was used to clarify the mechanism of phase transformation of biochar and catalytic behavior in sludge conditioning process the detailed demineralization treatment method for sludge is presented in text s1 of the support information zhang et al 2016 the proximate and ultimate analysis of dried demineralized sludge is listed in table s1 similar to the synthesis of rs fe biochar the named drs fe biochar was prepared from the mixture of drs 23 wt fe2o3 under the same pyrolysis procedure at 800 c the biochar derived from the mixture of drs 23 wt fe2o3 5 wt al2o3 was named as drs fe 5al in order to figure out the effect of fe in biochar on sludge dewaterability the biochar derived from the mixture of drs 5 wt al2o3 was named as drs 5al the chemical compositions of inorganic elements of the different biochar samples were analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf table s2 2 3 sludge conditioning procedure and sludge dewaterability the sludge was conditioned according to our previous study tao et al 2019 adjusting the initial ph of sludge to 2 biochar adding mixing for 5 min h2o2 adding mixing for 30min the doses of h2o2 and biochar sample were applied according to the optimal values in our previous study shown in table s3 in order to focus on the effect of al element content in biochar on the dewaterability of sludge the total mass of fe content of the added biochar samples was controlled as the same the fe contents in biochar samples are listed in table 3 sludge dewaterability was evaluated based on capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filterability srf water content of dewatered sludge and bound water content the sludge dewatering procedure was provided in text s2 the cst was measured using a cst instrument model 304 triton uk shi et al 2015 the bound water content of the sludge was measured according to the modified thermal analysis method zhang et al 2014 2 4 computational methods the chemisorption and reaction of h2o2 molecule on the surface of different fe compounds feo fe3o4 fesio3 and feal2o4 were investigated by density functional theory dft using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp code 5 4 1 to clarify the catalytic active centers and electron transfer in the process of heterogeneous fenton reaction more detailed computational methods are presented in the support information text s3 and fig s2 the adsorption energy δeads ev was also defined in text s3 tuckerman 2002 the optimized structure of h2o2 molecule and the initial state of h2o2 molecule on surface of iron containing compounds slab models were presented in fig s3 of the support information 2 5 analysis methods eps of sludge samples including soluble eps sb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps was extracted according to the procedures described in the literature yu et al 2016 hydroxyl radical oh production during reaction was detected through benzoic acid method by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20at shimadzu with a c18 column and ultraviolet detector chen et al 2017 the mobile phase composed of 15 acetonitrile and 85 water the flow rate was 1 ml min and the detection wavelength was 270 nm the organic compounds in eps were analyzed through three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem by a fp 6500 fluorescence spectrometer jasco japan zhang et al 2015 protein in eps of sludge was measured by protein assay kit thermofisher shanghai china based on the lowry s method yu et al 2016 the concentration of h2o2 was analyzed via titanometry sellers 1980 the concentration of fe2 in the solution was measured by 1 10 phenanthroline method hou et al 2017 the zeta potential of biochar and sludge samples was measured by a zeta potential analyzing instrument brookhaven ltd zetaplus usa the particle sizes of sludge samples were measured with a laser particle size analyzer bettersize china 2 6 characterization methods of biochar samples the mineral phases of biochar samples were analyzed through x ray diffraction xrd method using an x ray diffractometer xrd7000 shimadzu japan the inorganic elements compositions of the biochar samples were analyzed by the xrf spectrometer axiosmax panalytical netherlands the quantitative x ray diffraction analysis was carried out with maud 2 92 software since the biochar samples might contain both amorphous and crystalline phases all biochar samples were mixed with 20 25 wt of caf2 as an internal standard to help quantify amorphous content liao et al 2015 morphology and microstructural characterization of biochar samples were carried out with scanning electron microscopy sirion 2000 fei netherlands and transmission electron microscopy tecnai g2 20 fei netherlands the specific surface area of the biochar samples were determined by a surface area analyzer bk112 tb jwgb china tao et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of al2o3 content on phase composition of sludge biochar 3 1 1 the main characteristics of the sludge biochar samples the surface area of biochar samples obtained by the demineralized sludge was much lower than that of biochar samples derived from raw sludge table 3 this might be because that the inorganic minerals in sludge could act as skeleton to form porous structure liu et al 2016 the surface area results also showed that the addition of al2o3 to the sludge did not affect the surface area of sludge derived biochar obviously the morphologies of different sludge biochar samples are presented in fig s4 of the support information it was observed that the surface of the rs fe rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al was rough and covered by irregular particles possibly resulting from the added iron aluminum salts and intrinsic inorganic matters in sludge lu et al 2013 the morphology of biochar samples drs fe and drs fe 5al derived from the demineralized sludge was much smoother than that of rs fe it is consistent with the xrf results of biochar samples table s2 that most of inorganic elements such as si al na et al were successfully removed during the demineralization process other physicochemical properties of different biochar samples are also provided in table 3 due to the mixing the inorganic minerals fe2o3 and al2o3 the yield of biochar samples increased from rs derived biochar 49 90 to rs fe 5al 60 96 and also increased from drs derived biochar 19 44 to drs fe 5al 39 33 as the al element content in the sludge biochar increased the ph of the leaching solution of biochar decreased this might be because the added al2o3 could increase lewis acid sites in biochar and increase the ability of surface hydroxyl groups to dissociate or to be protonated in water kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 the h has a tendency to release from al oh resulting in the less negative charge of biochar particles thus zeta potential of the leaching solution of biochar samples increased with the increase of al content of biochar which is consistent with the previous study tu et al 2012 3 1 2 phase compositions of biochar samples with different al element contents the added al2o3 has a great effect on the phase compositions of the biochar samples fig 1 the main crystalline minerals of rs fe are sio2 and iron containing compounds including fe0 fe0 95c0 05 fe3o4 fesio3 and feal2o4 fig 1a comparing with rs fe the peak of fe3o4 in the biochar samples of rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al gradually disappeared while the intensity of the peak of feal2o4 in the biochar samples gradually increased with the increase of al2o3 dose peak intensities of other iron containing compounds peak showed no obvious change based on the above results it was inferred that al2o3 could react with iron compounds in biochar to form feal2o4 phase at 800 c which is consistent with previous research chai and zhang 2017 the crystalline mineral of drs derived biochar was only quartz sio2 fig 1b which further proved the effect of the demineralization process the xrd pattern of drs 5al biochar showed that the added al2o3 tended to react with sio2 to form al2o3 sio2 during pyrolysis at 800 c to further prove the effect of al2o3 addition on feal2o4 generation the phase compositions of drs fe and drs fe 5al biochar samples are comparatively presented in fig 1b after eliminating the influence of intrinsic minerals in the sludge the main crystals of drs fe are only remained as fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 the newly generated feal2o4 phase was identified in drs fe 5al with adding of al2o3 it further demonstrated that the al2o3 and iron containing compounds of sludge could form feal2o4 phase during the pyrolysis procedure the tem images of drs fe 5al are shown in fig s5 the crystalline structure of drs fe 5al biochar has an interplanar spacing of 2 04 å corresponding to the 0 0 4 plane of feal2o4 3 1 3 quantitative x ray diffraction analysis the xrd results of the biochar samples and the theoretical calculation results were fitted fig s6 the reliability indices of the fitting results are listed in table s4 the low index values rp and rwp 5 gof 5 indicated the success of the quantitative analysis with reliable quantification results liao et al 2015 comparing the relative content of the fe containing phases in drs fe and drs fe 5al the amount of feal2o4 phase in drs fe 5al significantly increased and the content of amorphous fe decreased to some extent fig 2 a furthermore there was indiscernible change in the content of both fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 phases it indicated that the formation of feal2o4 might be attributed to the transformation of the amorphous fe in the biochar during pyrolysis comparing the relative contents of the fe containing phase in rs fe rs fe 5al rs fe 10al and rs fe 15al with the increase of al content both fe3o4 and fesio3 phases decreased obviously while the zero valent iron and the amorphous fe slightly increased fig 2a it was further inferred that the fe3o4 fesio3 could react with the added al2o3 to form feal2o4 during pyrolysis at 800 c gibbs free energy changes δg of possible reactions 1 3 for the generation of the feal2o4 phase during the sludge pyrolysis process are presented in fig 2b the δg values of all the reactions were negative at temperature of 800 c indicating that the conversion of fe3o4 fesio3 and feo into feal2o4 phase through reacting with al2o3 could proceed spontaneously thus the results of thermodynamics also proved that the fe containing compounds in the sludge had a tendency to form feal2o4 1 fe3o4 al2o3 feal2o4 fe2o3 2 fesio3 al2o3 feal2o4 sio2 3 feo al2o3 feal2o4 3 2 sludge dewatering performance after conditioning with different fe rich biochar samples and h2o2 3 2 1 sludge conditioning and dewatering performance results the results of dewatering performance of sludge conditioned by rs derived biochar samples with different al element contents are shown in fig 3 a compared with the cst 205 2 s and srf 2 45 1013 m kg of rs table 1 the cst and srf of sludge with only acidic and h2o2 treatment referred to as control decreased to 110 4 s and 1 3 1013 m kg suggesting that the effect of acidic treatment control on sludge dewaterability was limited fig 3 compared with only acidic treatment the dewaterability of sludge conditioned by rs fe and h2o2 was significantly improved which is consistent with our previous study tao et al 2019 compared with rs fe h2o2 system the sludge dewaterability conditioned with rs fe 5al h2o2 system was significantly improved and the cst and srf of the conditioned sludge decreased by about 23 and 44 respectively and the water content of sludge cake decreased by about 9 62 fig s7 compared with the control group the cst and srf of sludge conditioned with rs fe 5al h2o2 system decreased by 71 5 and 82 7 respectively it indicated that the sludge dewaterability could be improved by conditioning with rs derived biochar by adding fe2o3 and al2o3 before pyrolysis however sludge dewatering performance changed indiscernibly with the increase of al2o3 dose from 10 to 15 wt figs 3 and s7 it might be because the dose of h2o2 was limited it indicated that the generation of oh during sludge conditioning was limited even though the generated feal2o4 phase increased as the al2o3 dose increased thus in the subsequent mechanism experiments the dose of al2o3 was chosen as 5 wt of dry solid of sludge compared with the control group of sludge conditioned by acidic treatment and adding h2o2 alone dewatering performance of sludge conditioned by drs 5al h2o2 system has no improvement suggesting that drs 5al has no effect on sludge dewaterability figs 3 and s7 compared the dewatering performance of sludge conditioned by drs 5al h2o2 with drs fe h2o2 system it was concluded that fe played a dominant role in improving sludge dewaterability according to our previous study fe2 leached from biochar and fe ii bonded on the biochar both contributed to initiate fenton reaction during sludge conditioning tao et al 2019 compared with drs fe h2o2 system the sludge dewaterability conditioned by drs fe 5al h2o2 system was significantly improved and the cst and srf decreased by about 28 and 40 6 respectively fig 3b and the water content of sludge cake decreased by about 9 09 fig s7 combined with the xrd phase analysis of drs derived biochar samples in fig 1b the feal2o4 phase was identified after adding both al and fe in drs during the pyrolysis process which demonstrated that the feal2o4 phase in biochar had a significant influence on sludge dewatering performance improvement 3 2 2 the analysis of homogenous and heterogeneous fenton reaction in sludge conditioning procedure compared with rs fe and rs fe 5al the increase of al element content in sludge biochar had no significant effect on fe2 leaching behavior fig s8 the amount of soluble fe2 from rs fe 5al was lower than that of rs fe therefore rs fe 5al has indiscernible effect on improvement of homogeneous fenton reaction compared with rs fe as shown in fig s8b based on our previous study fe2 dissolved from biochar samples was mainly from the fe0 and iron carbon compound fe0 95c0 05 and then the generated fe2 in liquid phase would initiate the homogeneous fenton process tao et al 2019 yang et al 2009 combined with the corresponding quantitative xrd analysis in figs 1 and 2 the contents of fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 changed a little with the addition of al this might be the main reason why the fe2 leaching concentration did not change obviously with the addition of al element after leaching process the crystalline peaks of fe0 and fe0 95c0 05 disappeared fig s9 while the crystalline peaks of feal2o4 did not show obvious changes showing great stability of feal2o4 in biochar under acid solution during sludge conditioning based on the above results rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar had little effect on improving the homogeneous fenton reaction compared with rs fe and drs fe biochar without adding al2o3 however rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar significantly enhanced the sludge dewatering performance compared with rs fe and drs fe biochar figs 3 and s7 it was inferred that the heterogeneous fenton reaction mainly contributed to the enhanced sludge dewaterability during sludge treatment process conditioned with rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar it indicated that the feal2o4 phase in rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar might play a key role in the heterogeneous fenton reaction the h2o2 decomposition rate in the presence of rs fe 5al was higher than that with rs fe fig 4 a similar results were observed in the drs derived groups of drs fe and drs fe 5al fig 4b it indicated that the newly formed feal2o4 phase might improve the catalytic performance of biochar for enhanced h2o2 decomposition by heterogeneous fenton reaction comparing the h2o2 decomposition rate with the drs 5al and drs fe biochar it could be concluded that both the fe2 leached from biochar and fe ii bonded on the surface of biochar were the main reason for promoting the h2o2 decomposition with drs fe biochar the faster the decomposition rate of h2o2 the more radicals might be generated which would improve the oxidation intensity of the fenton reaction thus contributing to enhance the destruction of the sludge flocs and release more intracellular bound water he et al 2016 in many reported fenton systems h2o2 takes part in both the production of oh reactive oxygen species for sludge flocs destruction and o2h or o2 ineffective consumption of h2o2 ma et al 2018 in order to evaluate the effective decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of different biochar samples the content of oh generated during sludge conditioning was measured fig 4c and d comparing oh generation rate during sludge conditioning with rs fe and rs fe 5al biochar in fig 4c the oh generation rate in the presence of rs fe 5al was much higher than that with rs fe the rate and amount of oh generation during sludge conditioning with drs fe and drs fe 5al showed the same trend fig 4c and d no oh was observed during sludge conditioning with drs 5al which is consistent with the previous study that al iii compounds could not catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 bokare and choi 2014 these results further proved that feal2o4 phase in rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar played a major role in catalyzing the heterogeneous fenton reaction 3 3 the synergistic effect between fe and al elements in biochar h2o2 conditioning system 3 3 1 the feal2o4 phase in biochar for high h2o2 utilization efficiency based on the xrd results in fig 1 the theoretical simulations of the surface structure of pure feo fe3o4 fesio3 and feal2o4 on each facets for h2o2 adsorption were investigated as shown in fig 5 a d the adsorption energy δeads of h2o2 exhibited an order of pure feo 0 56 ev fesio3 0 67 ev fe3o4 1 17 ev feal2o4 5 82 ev it indicated that the h2o2 molecule was more easily adsorbed on the surface of feal2o4 thus leading to the increase of h2o2 decomposition rate during the sludge conditioning process fig 4 compared with the initial state of h2o2 molecule on the surface of iron containing compounds fig s3 the o o bond lengths of the h2o2 molecule apparently increased in the order of pure fesio3 1 479 å feo 1 481 å fe3o4 1 486 å feal2o4 3 042 å fig 5 it illustrated that the o o bonds were strongly weakened on the surface of feal2o4 phase with the introduction of al element luo et al 2010 as shown in fig 5 the absolute values of δq for the two o atoms of h2o2 on the surface of different iron compounds maintained the order rule of fesio3 0 020 e feo 0 052 e fe3o4 0 111 e feal2o4 1 087 e it implied that the o atoms of the h2o2 molecule on the surface of feal2o4 obtained much more electrons from feal2o4 phase than those from feo fe3o4 and fesio3 phases thus h2o2 molecule becomes more activated and tends to be more easily dissociated into oh and oh group on the surface of feal2o4 phase during the heterogeneous fenton reaction it is consistent with the experimental results of the oh generation during the sludge conditioning with the rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar fig 4 3 3 2 the analysis of the electronic localization function elf the intensity of the total electronic density between the two o atoms in h2o2 molecule increases from 0 0 to 1 0 fig s10 only one attractor elf 0 7 was observed in the middle of the o o bond of the h2o2 molecule on the surface of feo fe3o4 and fesio3 figs s10a c indicating that a strong covalent bond was observed between the two o atoms wang et al 2019 as shown in fig s10d there were two attractors elf 0 7 between the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule on the surface of feal2o4 phase corresponding to the 2p electrons in the two o atoms it indicated that the strong covalent bond of o o bond in h2o2 molecule was broken becke and edgecombe 1990 the two dimensional valence electron density maps demonstrated that there were no strong interaction between the o atom of oh group in h2o2 molecule and fe atom on the surface of feo fe3o4 and fesio3 figs s11a c as shown in fig s11d strong interaction between the fe atom on the surface of feal2o4 and the oh group was observed forming a charge transfer channel to transfer from the fe atom to o atom of the oh group it indicated that the outermost electrons tended to accumulate on h2o2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of feal2o4 phase li et al 2017 the two dimensional valence electron density maps between al atom on the surface of feal2o4 and the other oh group of h2o2 molecule were also calculated fig s12 an obvious charge transfer channel was found between al and o atoms in oh group which confirmed that the strong chemical attraction between al atom on the surface of feal2o4 and o atom of the h2o2 was mainly due to the lewis acidity of the al atom in order to eliminate the influence of different exposed facets on the h2o2 activation and further confirm the function of al on the high reactivity toward fenton reaction during sludge dewatering the modified crystal structure of al doped feo was cleaved as a slab model under periodic boundary condition to represent the surface structure as shown in fig 6 a and b the δeads exhibited an order of pure feo 0 56 ev al doped feo 6 70 ev it indicated that the h2o2 molecule was more easily adsorbed on the surface of al doped feo compared to feo the o o bond length of the h2o2 molecule was apparently increased in the order of feo 1 481 å al doped feo 3 113 å which illustrated that the o o bonds were strongly weakened in al doped feo phase compared to feo the absolute values of δq for the two o atoms on the surface of two iron compounds maintained the rule of feo 0 052 e al doped feo 1 087 e it indicated that the intensity of the charge delivery channel between h2o2 molecule and two iron compounds apparently increased from the elf calculation results only one attractor elf 0 7 was observed in the middle of the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule on the surface of feo phase fig 6c however two attractors elf 0 7 were observed between the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule on the surface of al doped feo phase corresponding to the 2p electrons in the two o atoms fig 6d it suggested that the strong covalent bond between the two o atoms of h2o2 molecule was broken all the above results confirmed that the al doped feo could activate the o o bond in h2o2 more easily 3 3 3 the schematic illustration of synergistic catalysis of fe and al elements in feal2o4 for enhancing heterogeneous fenton reaction herein it indicated that the adsorption and activation of h2o2 molecules on the feal2o4 surface could be attributed to the al lewis acidity and the interactions between fe and al in fe2 al3 unit on the surface of feal2o4 the schematic illustration of the whole process of heterogeneous fenton reaction occurred on the surface fe2 al3 unit is presented in fig 7 specifically the mechanism of feal2o4 enhancing heterogeneous fenton reaction could be elucidated as follows step i the preactivation of h2o2 as discussed above the two o atoms in h2o2 molecule had strong chemical attraction separately with the fe and al atoms of feal2o4 step ii the decomposition of h2o2 the covalent interaction in h2o2 molecule was weakened and less energy was required for h2o2 molecule to climb over the barrier to be dissociated step iii the generation of oh on the surface fe2 al3 unit the h2o2 molecule would obtain an electron from fe2 and then it would be dissociated into oh and oh group after the electron transformation the generated oh and oh were captured by fe3 and al3 in fe2 al3 unit wherein the oh group was neutralized by h in the solution to form h2o molecule and the oh was desorbed into the solution to destroy sludge flocs 3 4 sludge dewatering mechanism 3 4 1 changes in sludge physicochemical properties as shown in fig 8 a the rs had a negatively charge and the initial zeta potential was 12 63 0 44 mv possibly due to the ionization functional groups in sludge flocs xiao et al 2018 as shown in fig s13 by only acidification ph 2 0 and h2o2 pre treatment the zeta potential of sludge of control group elevated from 12 63 0 44 mv to 8 19 0 61 mv due to the high concentration of h in the liquid phase compared with the control group the zeta potential values of sludge conditioned with rs fe biochar decreased from 8 19 0 61 mv to 5 99 0 41 mv mainly due to the release of negative charged intracellular polymers i e protein released during the sludge conditioning process compared with the rs fe and drs fe the zeta potential of sludge samples conditioned with rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al decreased from 5 99 0 41 mv and 5 12 0 34 mv to 1 11 0 37 mv and 0 91 0 44 mv respectively it is because that the formed feal2o4 phase in biochar would cause the faster decomposition rate of h2o2 and the more amount of oh generation during the sludge conditioning process and then more sludge flocs would be disrupted and more negative charged intracellular polymers i e protein would be released leading to the decrease of zeta potential the less positive zeta potential suggested the decreasing positive charge density and the decreasing repulsive force between sludge particles which would lead to agglomeration of flocs and finally enhance the sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2018 it is noted that the particle size of the flocs conditioned with the rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar was smaller than those of rs fe and drs fe biochar respectively table s5 furthermore the smaller flocs sizes indicated the successful disruption of sludge flocs and eps by oh oxidation during sludge conditioning which was an important factor affecting sludge dewaterability fig 8b it was concluded that the feal2o4 phase in biochar efficiently enhanced the dewaterability of sludge through promoting charge neutralization and release of bound water 3 4 2 changes in eps properties since protein in sludge is the main factor affecting sludge dewaterability the changes of extracellular protein under different sludge conditioning process were also investigated wu et al 2017 compared with rs sludge conditioned by drs fe and rs fe contained less organic compounds and protein in tb eps than those in lb and sb eps fig 9 it indicated that both homogeneous fenton reaction initiated by the fe2 in the liquid and heterogeneous fenton reaction initiated by the bound fe ii on the surface of biochar could decompose the eps and release the organic matters and protein from the inner layer tb eps to the outer of flocs sb eps xiao et al 2017 moreover the sludge conditioned by drs fe 5al and rs fe 5al showed higher toc and protein contents in tb eps and sb eps compared to the drs fe and rs fe this confirmed that the feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar contributed to higher destruction of the sludge flocs by oh oxidation attack which is consistent with the analysis of oh generation in fig 4 the more organic compounds and proteins were released from sludge flocs the more negative charged intercellular polymers and bound water would be released which is consistent with the results of zeta potential and bound water content of conditioned sludge samples in fig 8 in order to further explore the organic compounds in different fractions of eps extracted from sludge 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied table 4 for rs fe and drs fe conditioning compared to the rs intensities of fulvic acid like and humic acid like organic compounds obviously increased in sb eps while the intensities of all the organic compounds were weaken in lb and tb eps for rs fe 5al and drs fe 5al biochar h2o2 conditioning system it could be observed that tyrosine like proteins and tryptophan like proteins in lb eps were also significantly reduced compared to rs fe and drs fe biochar h2o2 conditioning system the pearson correlation matrix is presented in table 5 there were positive correlations r 0 7 p 0 05 among improved dewaterability cst and srf indexes the removal of tryptophan like protein and tyrosine like proteins in lb eps and soluble microbial byproduct like substances in tb eps these results showed that the inner part of sludge flocs such as tb eps and protein like compounds in lb eps had a strong relationship with the sludge dewaterability which was consistent with our previous study lv et al 2019 the breakage and oxidative degradation of them could be attributed to the heterogeneous fenton reaction initiated by feal2o4 phase contributing to enhancement of sludge dewaterability in biochar conditioning process the mechanism of al element in sludge derived biochar for enhancing the dewaterability of sludge could be concluded in two aspects first the preactivation of h2o2 caused by the interactions between fe and al elements in fe2 al3 unit on the surface of feal2o4 would make the h2o2 easier to be dissociated into oh and oh group furthermore the oh generated from the surface of biochar would be more likely to react with the inner sludge flocs leading to the significant degradation of the protein like substances and soluble microbial byproduct like substances therefore the heterogeneous fenton reaction between feal2o4 and h2o2 enhanced the dewaterability through promoting the destruction of the inner eps fractions of sludge and releasing more bound water 4 conclusions in this study the synergistic catalytic effect between fe and al elements of feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar on initiating h2o2 during sludge conditioning process was clarified the feal2o4 phase was identified for the first time in fe rich biochar after adding both fe2o3 and al2o3 in raw sludge rs and demineralized sludge drs during pyrolysis process at 800 c due to the strong chemical attraction between the two o atoms in h2o2 molecule and fe al atoms in fe2 al3 unit on the surface of feal2o4 phase the covalent interaction of o o bond in h2o2 molecule was weakened and then h2o2 molecule was easily dissociated into oh and oh group during sludge conditioning step the decomposition rate of h2o2 and the amount of oh generation were obviously promoted by feal2o4 phase in sludge derived biochar attributing to the destruction of the inner part of sludge flocs such as tb eps and protein like compounds in lb eps fractions of sludge and the release of more bound water in general a deep illustration has been explored on the enhanced heterogeneous fenton reaction by synergistic interaction between fe and al elements of the feal2o4 phase in biochar during sludge conditioning the result could promote the sustainable sludge recycling in wwtps and provide a promising prospect for sludge treatment with significant environmental benefits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
