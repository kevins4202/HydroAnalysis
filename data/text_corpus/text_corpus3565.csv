17825,terrestrial organic matter occupies an important position in the oceanic organic carbon pool some terrestrial proxies like the branched and isoprenoid tetraether bit index have been applied successfully to indicate the relative abundance of terrestrial organic matter in marine sediments a new terrestrial proxy derived from sediment pore water fluorescent dissolved matter fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom was developed in this study surface sediment samples were collected from forty two sites in the coastal region of the east china sea ecs to examine the distributional patterns of fdom three protein like components c1 c4 and c5 and two humic like components c2 and c3 of fdom were identified using fluorescence excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eems parafac spatially the intensity of these five components generally increased from the coast to the ocean with protein like components showing a more obvious trend which suggested that all five components had autochthonous contribution however the c2 and c3 proportions especially c2 that mainly corresponds to the proportion of peak a in fluorescence excitation emission matrices significantly decreased from the coast to the ocean and significantly correlated with the bit index from corresponding solid fractions we posit that part of the humic like components from terrestrial organic matter in sediments are released into the c2 and c3 pools in pore waters which may be constrained by specific environmental conditions thus the fdom from pore waters can be integrated with bit index to validate the nature of fdom and use it as a biomarker to reflect the terrestrial input of organic matter mediated by different biogeochemical processes in coastal oceans the proportion of peak a responsible for the fluorescence of c2 was suggest as a new terrestrial derived from fdom graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediments fluorescent dissolved organic matter eems parafac east china sea terrestrial proxy 1 introduction amount of terrestrial organic matter is transported from rivers to the ocean it is further carried to the deeper ocean and functions as an essential compartment of the global carbon budget hedges and oades 1997 schlünz and schneider 2000 in order to understand the fate of terrestrial organic matter in the ocean many terrestrial proxies from the solid fraction of sediments have been developed in the past few decades e g hopmans et al 2004 carbon and nitrogen isotopes and total organic carbon toc have been widely applied to indicate the source of organic carbon in a great range of marginal sea areas ogrinc et al 2005 tan et al 1991 zhang et al 2015 long chain odd carbon numbered n alkanes also have been used to identify the terrestrial compounds in marine sediments successfully eglinton and hamilton 1963 the index branched and isoprenoid tetraether bit is derived from crenarchaeol the biomarker of the ammonia oxidizing archaea and the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers bgdgts from bacteria which serves as a novel proxy to indicate the relative contribution of terrestrial input to marine sediments pitcher et al 2011 a series of processes during the remineralization of sediment particulate organic matter pom could produce and or consume pore water dissolved organic matter dom burdige 2001 which assumes a significant role in the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nutrients and the sequestration and transportation of toxic substances chen and hur 2015 studies have considered pore water dom as an indispensable intermediate of sediment carbon preservation burdige et al 1999 mayer 1994 the turnover rate of dom in sediments was viewed as an essential section for estimating the global carbon budget chen and hur 2015 also it was reported that dom in sediment can reflect not only the productivity in aquatic environment but also the nature of pom from which dom stem cividanes et al 2002 osburn et al 2012 considering the heterogeneity and complexity of dom the information obtained by the quantification of dom alone is very limited and the compositional diversity of dom must be weighed however determining the structure of dom is a daunting and expensive task which is a significant hindrance for comprehensive studies of dom composition strohmeier et al 2013 although fluorescence spectroscopy cannot directly describe the chemical structure of dom they have been extensively used in dom research due to their low cost and high sensitivity chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is a very important component of the dom spectrum and has a profound effect on the optical properties of dom that is characterized by a mixture of high molecular weight compounds with unknown structures in the aquatic systems nelson and siegel 2013 a portion of cdom is known as fluorescent dom fdom which fluoresces when absorbing ultraviolet light fluorescence spectroscopy is a simple sensitive and reliable fingerprint to study the quality of fdom and its geochemical behavior e g marhaba 2000 eems excitation emission matrices have been widely used in the characterization of fdom which provides a detailed map of fdom fluorescence characteristics coble 1996 her et al 2003 stedmon et al 2003 wang et al 2009 coupled with the multi dimensional data analysis method parafac parallel factor analysis eems spectral data can be decomposed into several fluorescent components that indicate different substances thus eems parafac makes it available to observe componential qualitative changes in dom stedmon and bro 2008 dom in marine sediments could originate autochthonously algae microbial derived and or allochthonously terrestrial input fdom components characterized by eems parafac can be mainly divided into two groups protein like components and humic like components it is generally believed that more active biological activity and higher autochthonous productivity means more protein like components baker and spencer 2004 yamashita and tanoue 2003 therefore phytoplankton bloom events are often accompanied by a rise of protein like component mendoza et al 2012 the humic like components can be subdivided into marine microbial derived humic like components and terrestrial humic like components in general marine microbial derived humic like component comes from both microbial degradation of organic matter and phytoplankton production castillo et al 2010 yamashita et al 2008 some studies also reported a terrestrial source of marine microbial derived humic like component murphy et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 the sources of terrestrial humic like component are complex in addition to humic substances from terrestrial matter as the name indicates terrestrial humic like could be produced by some phytoplankton and microbial process of phytoplankton exudates fukuzaki et al 2014 kwon et al 2018 romera castillo et al 2011 in coastal area strong negative correlation between humic like components and salinity in waters shows terrestrial matter as a main controlling factor cao et al 2016 fellman et al 2010 kim and kim 2017 hence humic like components can even be used to track different freshwater end members in coastal waters mizuno et al 2018 bit index and humic like components can verify each other as proxies for terrestrial input however bit index is less available because extracting and analyzing gdgts is more complex to the best of our knowledge archaeal biomarkers and dom are rarely combined in the study of sediments although both are important for understanding the biogeochemical cycle of the sedimentary environment the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent sea the east china sea ecs are typical estuary marginal sea areas ecs has been considered as one of the most important sink of riverine terrestrial organic matter among the east asian margin seas yang et al 2011 about 4 8 1012 g of organic carbon is imported into ecs through the yangtze river each year ogawa et al 2003 the surface currents of ecs are composed of the northward taiwan warm current and the relatively colder fujian zhejiang coastal current in the southeastern china milliman et al 1985 the organic matter input from the yangtze river and other rivers is washed into the okinawa trench under the action of the near bottom stream which is then engulfed by the taiwan warm current and become part of organic matter cycle in ecs zhu et al 2008 in addition due to the input of terrestrial nutrients occasional red tide occur in this area which can affect the dynamic changes of dom liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2007 complex ocean currents strong ocean land interactions and active biological activities make ecs an ideal area for studying biogeochemical processes of dom in this study surface sediment samples from ecs were collected for measurement of fdom in pore waters and gdgts and other biochemical indicators in solid phases our main objectives were 1 to characterize pore water fdom of the study area 2 to elucidate the source and controlling factors for different fdom components and 3 to explore the relationship between archaeal biomarkers gdgts and fdom and try to suggest a fdom derived terrestrial proxy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the cruise was conducted in the coastal region of ecs from august to september 2015 the study area was located at longitudes of 122 0 e 124 0 e and latitudes of 29 12 n 32 26 n fig 1 the depth and the salinity of the bottom water near the surface sediments were measured with a ctd sea bird usa surface sediment samples were collected from forty two sides using a grab sampler the top layers ca 10 cm were carefully collected and stored at 20 c before further analysis around 20 g of each sediment sample were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to extract pore waters after the centrifugation all water samples were filtered using 0 2 μm polyethersulfone membranes millipore millex gp filtered samples were stored in amber glass vials at 80 c before subsequent analysis it was reported that freezing has little effect on fluorescence properties of extracted and filtered sediment pore water dom although alternation of fluorescence properties due to freezing thaw was observed in previous studies about rivers and grassland or forest soils otero et al 2007 spencer et al 2007 thieme et al 2016 furthermore thieme et al 2019 believed that freeze thaw has similar effect on all samples so freezing treatment did not hinder the comparability of dom quality between samples 2 2 fluorescence spectrum analysis optical indices and parafac modeling eems of pore waters were obtained with aqualog 800 fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba scientific usa after thaw the pore water samples were stand until room temperature and diluted table s1 before measurement all eems were generated over excitation wavelengths from 240 nm to 400 nm in 3 nm intervals and emission wavelengths from 246 nm to 827 nm in 2 35 nm intervals with an integration time of 5s milli q water milli q integral 10 millipore france was daily applied to check the stability of the instrument and its raman spectrum was collected for normalization of fluorescence intensity in further analysis in this study the implementation of parafac modeling relied on matlab vision 2018a mathworks usa and toolbox domfluor stedmon and bro 2008 the primary and secondary rayleigh scattering regions were firstly eliminated to improve the accuracy of subsequent processing outlier data with severe artificial error or systematic error were rejected using built in function outliertest to minimize the computation labor the part of eems with an emission wavelength greater than 570 nm was excised since only background was included there then through the steps of model validation split half analysis and random initialization a five component model was claimed to be valid and the three dimensional fluorescence data were characterized as five fdom components the modeled fluorescence intensity was normalized to the raman unit r u based on the area of the milli q water raman peak lawaetz and stedmon 2009 by multiplying the dilution factors the fluorescence intensity fmax of each fdom component was obtained and used to indicate the relative concentration of fdom components the humification index hix and fluorescence index fi are optical indices derived from the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum hix was calculated as the ratio of the integrated area of the fluorescence intensity in the region with emission wavelength of 435 480 nm to that in the region of 300 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm zsolnay et al 1999 higher values of hix indicate a higher degree of humidification fi was calculated as the method described by mcknight et al 2001 the value of fi can roughly indicate the sources of the dom with 1 3 1 4 for terrestrial dom and 1 7 2 0 for microbial derived dom mcknight et al 2001 2 3 the extract and measurement of chlorin in this study chlorin was employed as a proxy for paleo primary productivity in sediments harris et al 1996 about 200 mg of freeze dried and ground sediment sample was taken to ultrasonically extract twice with 90 acetone for 15 min and then centrifuge at 2500 r min for 5 min to collect the extract the extract was again extracted with 100 acetone after that the extract was taken up in a constant volume with 3 ml of methanol filtered through a 0 22 μm disposable filter and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc e600 waters usa 2 4 measurement of toc and carbon isotopes toc and carbon isotopes were measured to identify different sources of organic matter in sediments about 200 mg of freeze dried and ground sediment sample was placed in a teflon tube and an excess of 1 mol l of hcl was added to remove carbonates from samples after ultrasonication for 5 min and standing for 12 h ultrasonication was applied for another 5 min then the supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 3000 r min for 5 min the deionized water was repeatedly used for sonication and centrifugation until the supernatant was neutral after the sediment samples were freeze dried toc and carbon isotope analysis was performed using a thermo ne1112 carbon and nitrogen analyzer usa connected to a delta plus ad isotope mass spectrometer through a conflo iii thermo finnigan mat bremen germany 2 5 the extraction and measurement of gdgts about 5 g of freeze dried and ground sediment sample were placed in a 30 ml teflon tube the sample was extracted by adding 15 ml of dichloromethane sonicated for 10 min and then centrifuged at 3000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was placed in a glass bottle that was pre burned at 500 c to remove any organic carbon then the same extraction step was repeated once thereafter the sample was extracted another twice using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol 1 1 then methanol was used for the final extraction and was repeated twice a total of 60 ml of membrane lipid extract was obtained for the entire extraction after the membrane lipid extract was blown dry using mild nitrogen a silica gel column was used to separate the components within the extract hexane was used to soak the silica gel column the non polar component and the polar component were respectively rinsed using a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane 9 1 and a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol 1 1 the polar components were collected dried using gentle nitrogen and dissolved in a mixture of hexane and isopropanol 99 1 and then transferred to a 2 ml cell bottle high performance liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry hplc apci ms agilent usa was used to measure gdgts the calculation of bit index referred to the empirical formula eq 1 of hopmans et al 2004 gdgt i gdgt ii and gdgt iii are bgdgts containing four five and six methyl branches respectively fig s1 1 bit g d

mathworks usa was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient r and the corresponding significance p between variables 3 results 3 1 characterization of fdom in sediment pore waters with eems parafac five fluorescent components fig 2 table s1 were characterized from those 42 sediment pore water samples from ecs based on previous studies c1 excitation emission ex em maxima 277 327 nm and c4 ex em maxima 256 244 327 nm has been assigned as peak t and are identified as tryptophan like components coble 1996 coble et al 1998 which were commonly found in peptides or proteinaceous substances derived from fresh organic matter clark et al 2008 c5 ex em maxima 274 300 nm is a tyrosine component that conforms to the characteristics of peak b coble 1996 coble et al 1998 it is usually associated with biodegradable components of dom jamieson et al 2014 c2 ex em maxima 240 305 410 nm is consistent with the fluorescence spectra of the mixing of a and m peaks it is identified as a microbial marine derived humic like component coble 1996 coble et al 1998 however a study by stedmon et al showed that c2 like components were also present in samples dominated by terrestrial materials 2003 c3 ex em maxima 270 370 500 nm is also a humic like component peaks of similar fluorescence spectral properties have not been well defined yet santín et al characterized a component similar to c3 in the estuarine soil dominated by terrestrial matter ex em maxima 256 385 500 nm 2009 this component has also been reported in related studies on cdom in water and was considered to originate from terrestrial humic substances stedmon and markager 2005a stedmon et al 2003 or by microbial oxidation of organic matter yamashita et al 2010 3 2 distribution of the fdom intensities in sediment pore waters the spatial distribution of the fluorescence intensity of c1 c5 are shown fig 3 above in general the fluorescence intensity of c1 c5 showed an increasing trend from coastal area to ocean to varying degrees fmax of three protein like components showed obvious increasing trends from coastal area to the ocean the maximum and minimum intensities of c1 and c4 appeared at the same sites a8 7 and a7 2 respectively the ranges of intensity were 0 34 8 26 r u for c1 and 0 080 5 56 r u for c4 c5 reached its peak at site a4 8 with an intensity of 4 06 r u and its bottom at site a6 4 with an intensity of 0 92 r u according to figs 3 and 5 fmax of c2 and c3 distributed in roughly the same trend as protein like both c2 and c3 had an abnormal high intensity at site a3 3 suggesting the riverine terrestrial contribution however intensities of c2 and c3 at the near shore sites were generally lower than that at the far shore sites except for site a3 3 this suggests that humic like components had other contributions such as in situ microbial production e g arai et al 2017 besides terrestrial input implying poor relation between these components and terrestrial matter 3 3 distribution of the relative intensities of fdom in sediment pore waters for a more comprehensive understanding relative intensities of c1 c5 c1 c5 were defined as the ratio of their fluorescence intensity to the total fluorescence intensity fig 3 below shows the distributions of c1 c5 in sediment pore waters of marginal ecs comparing the two groups of humic like and protein like components 39 of the 42 sites were dominant in protein like components and only three sites with almost the same longitude of a6 5 a7 2 and a8 1 were humic like dominated among three protein like components c1 had highest fluorescence intensity of at most sites all three protein like components had the same increasing trend from the coastal water to the ocean between their intensities and relative intensities for humic like components c2 dominated and its fluorescence intensity reached 3 4 times that of c3 at site a4 6 the relative intensities of these two humic like components had opposite trend between their fluorescence intensities both c2 and c3 decreased with increasing distance from the coastal area which could be taken as a hint for exploring the relation between humic like components and terrestrial matter in sediment pore waters in ecs 3 4 factors controlling the distribution of fdom in sediment pore waters rda of the intensities of fdom components and other biochemical and environmental variables was carried out the results showed that rda1 and rda2 explained 81 1 and 17 2 of the variance respectively among c1 c5 bit vector was closest to rda1 axis suggesting that bit correlated strongly with rda1 both c2 and c3 were positively correlated with bit index chlorin and δ13c were identified as other two controlling factors fig 4 in correction matrix fig 5 among all variables significant correlations in intensity were frequently found among the five fdom components the intensity of c2 and c3 had a strong positive correlation r 0 93 p 0 005 fig s2 the intensities of all three protein like components were positively correlated with longitude but negatively with toc in addition to the relationships with latitude and longitude the intensities of c2 and c3 were lack of relationships with environmental parameters compared with the intensities of c2 and c3 the relative intensities of c2 and c3 had more complex correlations with environmental parameters c2 was positively correlated with hix r 0 92 p 0 005 toc r 0 37 p 0 05 bgdgts r 0 35 p 0 05 and bit index r 0 54 p 0 005 and negatively correlated with salinity r 0 47 p 0 005 longitude r 0 42 p 0 05 and water depth r 0 41 p 0 05 c3 was positively with hix r 0 90 p 0 005 and bit index r 0 48 p 0 005 and also negatively correlated with salinity r 0 39 p 0 05 longitude r 0 31 p 0 05 and water depth r 0 36 p 0 05 remarkably c2 and c3 of the pore water samples both showed positive correlations with the terrestrial proxy bit index that widely used to track the relative fluvial soil organic matter contribution to aquatic sediments hopmans et al 2004 sun et al 2011 xu et al 2020 yamamoto et al 2017 zhu et al 2011 the regression coefficient r between c2 and bit index was higher than that between c3 and bit index suggesting the more applicability of c2 than c3 in reflecting the terrestrial input in the ecs 4 discussion 4 1 sources of fdom in sediment pore waters in this study δ13c value in this study ranged from 25 95 to 23 17 the marine end member δ13c value was generally set as 20 hedges et al 1997 weijers et al 2009 and the terrestrial end member δ13c value referring to the riverbank of yangtze river was from 28 9 to 24 3 wu et al 2007 δ13c value fell between the two end members illustrating that the sedimentary organic matter originated from both sources moreover hix ranged from 0 32 to 3 61 and fi ranged from 1 07 to 2 08 preliminarily indicated that the fdom in study area was affected by both allochthonous terrestrial input and autochthonous biogenic production this inference is in line with the higher intensities of those fdom at offshore sites than near shore sites a previous study also showed that sediment pore water fdom in near area originated from both microbial activities and terrestrial matter using principal component analysis wang et al 2013 a total of 41 samples from the 42 sites had a bit index of less than 0 4 except for site a1 1 that was closest to the land the average value of bit index was 0 15 0 13 indicating a sedimentary environment in which ocean input dominated toc of the study area generally decreased from the nearshore to the ocean reflecting the terrestrial control of toc and that toc could serve as another terrestrial proxy in the correlation analysis between protein like components and other parameters the intensity of the protein like components was negatively correlated with toc it suggested that terrestrial matter contribution little to the protein like components and thus protein like components in this study was microbial derived in studies of fdom in the estuary and marginal sea areas the negative correlation between salinity and humic like components is often observed cao et al 2016 fellman et al 2010 kim and kim 2017 li et al 2015 also observed a significant negative correlation between salinity and humic components in the seawater of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent east china sea r 0 9 p 0 001 and the study area was basically the same as this study in this study however there was no significant correlation between salinity and c2 or c3 fig 5 to claim the terrestrial material as the main end member for the intensities of humic like components in ecs sediment pore water this could be attributed to the dual sources of riverine input and marine productivity of organic matter in ecs surface sediments xing et al 2011 in this study humic like components of sediment pore waters were increased from the nearshore sites to offshore sites in ecs thus the intensities of humic like components in sediment pore waters cannot indicate the input of terrestrial material as that in seawater this inference was further supported by the lack of correlations between the c2 or c3 with bit index to sum up the main contribution to fdom here was autochthonous production instead of allochthonous input terrestrial input for allochthonous input the overwhelming majority of terrestrial derived fluorescence was humic like stedmon and nelson 2015 these fluorescence signals may result from the terrestrial humic substances or humidification process of terrestrial organic matter mediated by microbes stevenson 1994 as for autochthonous production during the degradation of pom to inorganic matter mediated mainly by bacteria and archaea in sediments there was a net production of refractory pore water fdom and much of this production was considered as humic like signals arnosti 2004 burdige et al 2004 burdige and komada 2015 the significant autochthonous microbial production in sediments of humic like components have also been verified with isotopic method kim et al 2018 as the early diagenetic products of chlorophylls chlorin could indicate the abundance of pigment related organic matter in sediments schubert et al 2002 and its roughly increasing longitudinal distribution fig s3 may partially explain the increasing trend of fdom components considering only microbial degradation humic like components should have dominated the fluorescence signals however most of the sites 39 of 42 fig s4 was dominated by protein like components suggesting that protein like components may have other sources for example viral lysis of the microbes in sediments may contribute to pore water protein like components rowe and deming 2011 sipler and bronk 2015 also a study has shown that peaks responsible for protein like components were most remarkable in the sediment water interface coble 1996 this observation may imply the input of protein like signal from microbial activity in the water column although protein like components were generally considered to be more biological labile than the humic like pore water protein like components were reported to related closely with refractory dom burdige et al 2004 fellman et al 2009 hence the alteration of protein like components due to further microbial utilization could be fairly minor 4 2 relative intensity implication for a new terrestrial proxy the dual source of humic like components resulted in the loss of their indicator function of terrestrial input but the opposite distribution of their intensities and relative intensities provides an insight for exploring a new terrestrial proxy in sediments negative correlations between salinity and both c2 and c3 further illustrated that the contribution of terrestrial matter to the humic like components in sediments was preserved in the form of relative intensity terrestrial proxy bit also correlated with both c2 and c3 r 0 54 0 48 respectively p 0 005 and both had discrete values that were significantly different from the other 40 sites in site a1 1 and a6 5 fig s5 at site a1 1 bit index was too high but c2 and c3 were too low as can be seen from figure 2b in cheng et al 2019 toc of this site was the largest but the humic like components of this site were mainly controlled by microbial activities rather than terrestrial input which led to high terrestrial signals of bit index but low proportion of humic like components in this site the reason behind this needs to be further explored the situation of site a6 5 was opposite to that of site a1 1 its bit index was low while c2 and c3 were high site a6 5 was located in a special area in ecs called the estuarine turbidity maximum etm studies have shown that resuspension of sediments and photolysis of pom often occurred in etm li and zhang 1998 in the study of the overlying water on ecs sediment fdom fluorescence intensity of the bottom water was higher than that of the surface water and the increase of protein like components at this site was much more obvious than that of humic like components the study concluded that the resuspension at the etm drove sediment fdom to replenish the underlying water li et al 2015 the greater increase etm associated with protein like components than with humic like components indicated the uneven effect of resuspension on different fdom components and more protein like components may be input into overlaying water than the humic component leading to an increase in the proportion of humic like components in site a6 5 in addition the fdom produced by the photolysis of pom was believed to be mainly humic like component liu and shank 2015 pisani et al 2011 these humic like components may feed the sediment fdom back further increasing the proportion of humic like components discarding these two anomalies the correlations between bit index and relative intensity of humic like protein became more apparent r 0 79 for c2 and r 0 65 for c3 p 0 005 fig 6 these correlations indicated that c2 and c3 can serve as alternative indicators of bit to indicate the input of terrestrial matter and the humic like components retain the signals input by terrestrial matter through their relative intensity 4 3 possible mechanisms for c2 bit relationship two possible mechanisms may underpin the relationship between bit and humic like components one is that the trend of the humic like proportions decreased passively due to the increasing trend of protein like proportions which means there was only pseudo correlations between bit and humic like components the other one is that the trend of the humic like proportions decreased actively due to their decreasing terrestrial contribution as shown in fig 5 the relative intensity of humic like components c2 and c3 had stronger correlations between bit than that of protein like components c1 c4 and c5 thus c2 and c3 were more likely to be directly related to bit than those mediated by protein like components humic like proportions tended to decrease actively due to the seaward decreasing terrestrial input because of the release of organic material from the coastal sediments the humic like organic matter was always abundant in pore waters chen et al 2016 wang et al 2013 however poor correlation was found between the humic like components revealed by eems parafac and terrestrial input chen et al 2016 wang et al 2013 which might be due to their autochthonous microbial production in coastal sediments in this study the in situ microbial production was predominant over its terrestrial counterpart in contributing to c2 and c3 which led to the lack of the decreasing trend in the intensity of c2 and c3 here we assume that the contribution of overall autochthonous microbial production microbial degradation viral lysis and other possible processes in 4 1 to both humic like and protein like components was quite impartial although they may originated from different microbial pathways while the input of the terrestrial matter only contributed to humic like components this allochthonous contribution could either directly generate humic like signals or possibly enhance them indirectly by further microbial humidification of the part of relatively fresh terrestrial organic matter whether it was directly or indirectly both of them shared the same terrestrial end member and showed had a same tendency to weaken from the near shore to the ocean thus although fluorescence intensities of c2 and c3 had rough increasing trend from nearshore to ocean due to prevailing contribution from microbial production their relative intensities were determined by the amount of terrestrial matter input neither this study nor other studies could support quantitative analyses of a concrete mechanism researches on single end member to humic like components and on more specific chemical compounds may aid to the explanation from the above analysis it was found that the correlations between c2 and related indicators hix salinity bit index were stronger than c3 so its indication to terrestrial matter was stronger than c3 c3 has a maximum emission wavelength of up to 500 nm which was rarely reported in the study of fdom in waters stedmon and markager also found a component similar to c3 and believed that it could be rapidly generated by visible light and rapidly degraded 2005b making it difficult to detect in seawater both c2 and c3 have two peaks and both peaks of c3 were red shifted to those of c2 a longer emission wavelength within c3 indicates a larger size of aromatic compound and less energy difference between ground and excited states stedmon and nelson 2015 it was reported that the degradation and or aging of dom may response for the shift to longer wavelength komada et al 2002 which indicates that c3 may have experienced a higher degree of transformation from its origin and thereby the relationship between c3 and bit index has been weakened to some extent moreover humic like peaks were found to exist in pairs this is highly consistent with our results with one pair being peak a and peak m similar to c2 in this study and the other pair being peak a and peak c similar to c3 in this study peak a and peak c may result from the in situ transformation of peak a and peak m in addition to their terrestrial source burdige et al 2004 this suggests that the existence of humic like peaks in pairs may be a common feature of fdom in sediment pore waters and that c3 may have undergone a more complex and uncharacterized formation process compared with c2 studies of humic like fdom degradation state would be helpful to clarify the mechanism behind the relationship between c3 and bit overall c2 would be a more appropriate fdom derived terrestrial proxy than c3 considering that specific fdom component modeled by parafac relied on the dataset used it would be more practicable to suggest a more direct proxy from the eems data here the proportion of peak a the main peak corresponding to c2 is suggested as a new terrestrial proxy derived from fdom 5 conclusions by analyzing the characteristics of fdom in sediment pore waters from ecs combined with other environmental parameters biological parameters and chemical parameters five fdom components were characterized with eems parafac and they were believed to be controlled by both allochthonous terrestrial input and autochthonous microbial production and the latter dominated overall protein like components were primarily microbial derived while humic like components had mixing sources of terrestrial matter and microbial production the dual sources of humic like components led to their special spatial distribution and masked their indications to terrestrial matter however their relative intensities c2 and c3 still retained sensitivity to terrestrial input and could be used as a supplementary indicator of bit index for a better technical operation the proportion of the main peak of c2 peak a was suggested as a terrestrial proxy due to the lack of studies on planktonic organisms in sediments and overlaying waters concrete controlling mechanisms of biological effects on fdom have not been elucidated further study of the interaction between sediments and overlaying waters will help us to better understand the transformation and generation of fdom in sedimentary environments and thus more fully the role of fdom in biogeochemical cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17825,terrestrial organic matter occupies an important position in the oceanic organic carbon pool some terrestrial proxies like the branched and isoprenoid tetraether bit index have been applied successfully to indicate the relative abundance of terrestrial organic matter in marine sediments a new terrestrial proxy derived from sediment pore water fluorescent dissolved matter fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom was developed in this study surface sediment samples were collected from forty two sites in the coastal region of the east china sea ecs to examine the distributional patterns of fdom three protein like components c1 c4 and c5 and two humic like components c2 and c3 of fdom were identified using fluorescence excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eems parafac spatially the intensity of these five components generally increased from the coast to the ocean with protein like components showing a more obvious trend which suggested that all five components had autochthonous contribution however the c2 and c3 proportions especially c2 that mainly corresponds to the proportion of peak a in fluorescence excitation emission matrices significantly decreased from the coast to the ocean and significantly correlated with the bit index from corresponding solid fractions we posit that part of the humic like components from terrestrial organic matter in sediments are released into the c2 and c3 pools in pore waters which may be constrained by specific environmental conditions thus the fdom from pore waters can be integrated with bit index to validate the nature of fdom and use it as a biomarker to reflect the terrestrial input of organic matter mediated by different biogeochemical processes in coastal oceans the proportion of peak a responsible for the fluorescence of c2 was suggest as a new terrestrial derived from fdom graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediments fluorescent dissolved organic matter eems parafac east china sea

sediments have been developed in the past few decades e g hopmans et al 2004 carbon and nitrogen isotopes and total organic carbon toc have been widely applied to indicate the source of organic carbon in a great range of marginal sea areas ogrinc et al 2005 tan et al 1991 zhang et al 2015 long chain odd carbon numbered n alkanes also have been used to identify the terrestrial compounds in marine

dialkyl glycerol tetraethers bgdgts from bacteria which serves as a novel proxy to indicate the relative contribution of terrestrial input to marine sediments pitcher et al 2011 a series of processes during the remineralization of sediment particulate organic matter pom could produce and or consume pore water dissolved organic matter dom burdige 2001 which assumes a significant role in the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nutrients and the sequestration and transportation of toxic substances chen and hur 2015 studies have considered pore water dom as an indispensable intermediate of sediment carbon preservation burdige et al 1999 mayer 1994 the turnover rate of dom in sediments was viewed as an essential section for estimating the global carbon budget chen and hur 2015 also it was reported that dom in sediment can reflect not only the productivity in aquatic environment but also the nature of pom from which dom stem cividanes et al 2002 osburn et al 2012 considering the heterogeneity and complexity of dom the information obtained by the quantification of dom alone is very limited and the compositional diversity of dom must be weighed however determining the structure of dom is a daunting and expensive task which is a significant hindrance for comprehensive studies of dom composition strohmeier et al 2013 although fluorescence spectroscopy cannot directly describe the chemical structure of dom they have been extensively used in dom research due to their low cost and high sensitivity chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is a very important component of the dom spectrum and has a profound effect on the optical properties of dom that is characterized by a mixture of high molecular weight compounds with unknown structures in the aquatic systems nelson and siegel 2013 a portion of cdom is known as fluorescent dom fdom which fluoresces when absorbing ultraviolet light fluorescence spectroscopy is a simple sensitive and reliable fingerprint to study the quality of fdom and its geochemical behavior e g marhaba 2000 eems excitation emission matrices have been widely used in the characterization of fdom which provides a detailed map of fdom fluorescence characteristics coble 1996 her et al 2003 stedmon et al 2003 wang et al 2009 coupled with the multi dimensional data analysis method parafac parallel factor analysis eems spectral data can be decomposed into several fluorescent components that indicate different substances thus eems parafac makes it available to observe componential qualitative changes in dom stedmon and bro 2008 dom in marine sediments could originate autochthonously algae microbial derived and or allochthonously terrestrial input fdom components characterized by eems parafac can be mainly divided into two groups protein like components and humic like components it is generally believed that more active biological activity and higher autochthonous productivity means more protein like components baker and spencer 2004 yamashita and tanoue 2003 therefore phytoplankton bloom events are often accompanied by a rise of protein like component mendoza et al 2012 the humic like components can be subdivided into marine microbial derived humic like components and terrestrial humic like components in general marine microbial derived humic like component comes from both microbial degradation of organic matter and phytoplankton production castillo et al 2010 yamashita et al 2008 some studies also reported a terrestrial source of marine microbial derived humic like component murphy et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 the sources of terrestrial humic like component are complex in addition to humic substances from terrestrial matter as the name indicates terrestrial humic like could be produced by some phytoplankton and microbial process of phytoplankton exudates fukuzaki et al 2014 kwon et al 2018 romera castillo et al 2011 in coastal area strong negative correlation between humic like components and salinity in waters shows terrestrial matter as a main controlling factor cao et al 2016 fellman et al 2010 kim and kim 2017 hence humic like components can even be used to track different freshwater end members in coastal waters mizuno et al 2018 bit index and humic like components can verify each other as proxies for terrestrial input however bit index is less available because extracting and analyzing gdgts is more complex to the best of our knowledge archaeal biomarkers and dom are rarely combined in the study of sediments although both are important for understanding the biogeochemical cycle of the sedimentary environment the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent sea the east china sea ecs are typical estuary marginal sea areas ecs has been considered as one of the most important sink of riverine terrestrial organic matter among the east asian margin seas yang et al 2011 about 4 8 1012 g of organic carbon is imported into ecs through the yangtze river each year ogawa et al 2003 the surface currents of ecs are composed of the northward taiwan warm current and the relatively colder fujian zhejiang coastal current in the southeastern china milliman et al 1985 the organic matter input from the yangtze river and other rivers is washed into the okinawa trench under the action of the near bottom stream which is then engulfed by the taiwan warm current and become part of organic matter cycle in ecs zhu et al 2008 in addition due to the input of terrestrial nutrients occasional red tide occur in this area which can affect the dynamic changes of dom liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2007 complex ocean currents strong ocean land interactions and active biological activities make ecs an ideal area for studying biogeochemical processes of dom in this study surface sediment samples from ecs were collected for measurement of fdom in pore waters and gdgts and other biochemical indicators in solid phases our main objectives were 1 to characterize pore water fdom of the study area 2 to elucidate the source and controlling factors for different fdom components and 3 to explore the relationship between archaeal biomarkers gdgts and fdom and try to suggest a fdom derived terrestrial proxy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the cruise was conducted in the coastal region of ecs from august to september 2015 the study area was located at longitudes of 122 0 e 124 0 e and latitudes of 29 12 n 32 26 n fig 1 the depth and the salinity of the bottom water near the surface sediments were measured with a ctd sea bird usa surface sediment samples were collected from forty two sides using a grab sampler the top layers ca 10 cm were carefully collected and stored at 20 c before further analysis around 20 g of each sediment sample were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to extract pore waters after the centrifugation all water samples were filtered using 0 2 μm polyethersulfone membranes millipore millex gp filtered samples were stored in amber glass vials at 80 c before subsequent analysis it was reported that freezing has little effect on fluorescence properties of extracted and filtered sediment pore water dom although alternation of fluorescence properties due to freezing thaw was observed in previous studies about rivers and grassland or forest soils otero et al 2007 spencer et al 2007 thieme et al 2016 furthermore thieme et al 2019 believed that freeze thaw has similar effect on all samples so freezing treatment did not hinder the comparability of dom quality between samples 2 2 fluorescence spectrum analysis optical indices and parafac modeling eems of pore waters were obtained with aqualog 800 fluorescence spectrophotometer horiba scientific usa after thaw the pore water samples were stand until room temperature and diluted table s1 before measurement all eems were generated over excitation wavelengths from 240 nm to 400 nm in 3 nm intervals and emission wavelengths from 246 nm to 827 nm in 2 35 nm intervals with an integration time of 5s milli q water milli q integral 10 millipore france was daily applied to check the stability of the instrument and its raman spectrum was collected for normalization of fluorescence intensity in further analysis in this study the implementation of parafac modeling relied on matlab vision 2018a mathworks usa and toolbox domfluor stedmon and bro 2008 the primary and secondary rayleigh scattering regions were firstly eliminated to improve the accuracy of subsequent processing outlier data with severe artificial error or systematic error were rejected using built in function outliertest to minimize the computation labor the part of eems with an emission wavelength greater than 570 nm was excised since only background was included there then through the steps of model validation split half analysis and random initialization a five component model was claimed to be valid and the three dimensional fluorescence data were characterized as five fdom components the modeled fluorescence intensity was normalized to the raman unit r u based on the area of the milli q water raman peak lawaetz and stedmon 2009 by multiplying the dilution factors the fluorescence intensity fmax of each fdom component was obtained and used to indicate the relative concentration of fdom components the humification index hix and fluorescence index fi are optical indices derived from the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum hix was calculated as the ratio of the integrated area of the fluorescence intensity in the region with emission wavelength of 435 480 nm to that in the region of 300 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm zsolnay et al 1999 higher values of hix indicate a higher degree of humidification fi was calculated as the method described by mcknight et al 2001 the value of fi can roughly indicate the sources of the dom with 1 3 1 4 for terrestrial dom and 1 7 2 0 for microbial derived dom mcknight et al 2001 2 3 the extract and measurement of chlorin in this study chlorin was employed as a proxy for paleo primary productivity in sediments harris et al 1996 about 200 mg of freeze dried and ground sediment sample was taken to ultrasonically extract twice with 90 acetone for 15 min and then centrifuge at 2500 r min for 5 min to collect the extract the extract was again extracted with 100 acetone after that the extract was taken up in a constant volume with 3 ml of methanol filtered through a 0 22 μm disposable filter and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc e600 waters usa 2 4 measurement of toc and carbon isotopes toc and carbon isotopes were measured to identify different sources of organic matter in sediments about 200 mg of freeze dried and ground sediment sample was placed in a teflon tube and an excess of 1 mol l of hcl was added to remove carbonates from samples after ultrasonication for 5 min and standing for 12 h ultrasonication was applied for another 5 min then the supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 3000 r min for 5 min the deionized water was repeatedly used for sonication and centrifugation until the supernatant was neutral after the sediment samples were freeze dried toc and carbon isotope analysis was performed using a thermo ne1112 carbon and nitrogen analyzer usa connected to a delta plus ad isotope mass spectrometer through a conflo iii thermo finnigan mat bremen germany 2 5 the extraction and measurement of gdgts about 5 g of freeze dried and ground sediment sample were placed in a 30 ml teflon tube the sample was extracted by adding 15 ml of dichloromethane sonicated for 10 min and then centrifuged at 3000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was placed in a glass bottle that was pre burned at 500 c to remove any organic carbon then the same extraction step was repeated once thereafter the sample was extracted another twice using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol 1 1 then methanol was used for the final extraction and was repeated twice a total of 60 ml of membrane lipid extract was obtained for the entire extraction after the membrane lipid extract was blown dry using mild nitrogen a silica gel column was used to separate the components within the extract hexane was used to soak the silica gel column the non polar component and the polar component were respectively rinsed using a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane 9 1 and a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol 1 1 the polar components were collected dried using gentle nitrogen and dissolved in a mixture of hexane and isopropanol 99 1 and then transferred to a 2 ml cell bottle high performance liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry hplc apci ms agilent usa was used to measure gdgts the

eems parafac five fluorescent components fig 2 table s1 were characterized from those 42 sediment pore water samples from ecs based on previous studies c1 excitation emission ex em maxima 277 327 nm and c4 ex em maxima 256 244 327 nm has been assigned as peak t and are identified as tryptophan like components coble 1996 coble et al 1998 which were commonly found in peptides or proteinaceous substances derived from fresh organic matter clark et al 2008 c5 ex em maxima 274 300 nm is a tyrosine component that conforms to the characteristics of peak b coble 1996 coble et al 1998 it is usually associated with biodegradable components of dom jamieson et al 2014 c2 ex em maxima 240 305 410 nm is consistent with the fluorescence spectra of the mixing of a and m peaks it is identified as a microbial marine derived humic like component coble 1996 coble et al 1998 however a study by stedmon et al showed that c2 like components were also present in samples dominated by terrestrial materials 2003 c3 ex em maxima 270 370 500 nm is also a humic like component peaks of similar fluorescence spectral properties have not been well defined yet santín et al characterized a component similar to c3 in the estuarine soil dominated by terrestrial matter ex em maxima 256 385 500 nm 2009 this component has also been reported in related studies on cdom in water and was considered to originate from terrestrial humic substances stedmon and markager 2005a stedmon et al 2003 or by microbial oxidation of organic matter yamashita et al 2010 3 2 distribution of the fdom intensities in sediment pore waters the spatial distribution of the fluorescence intensity of c1 c5 are shown fig 3 above in general the fluorescence intensity of c1 c5 showed an increasing trend from coastal area to ocean to varying degrees fmax of three protein like components showed obvious increasing trends from coastal area to the ocean the maximum and minimum intensities of c1 and c4 appeared at the same sites a8 7 and a7 2 respectively the ranges of intensity were 0 34 8 26 r u for c1 and 0 080 5 56 r u for c4 c5 reached its peak at site a4 8 with an intensity of 4 06 r u and its bottom at site a6 4 with an intensity of 0 92 r u according to figs 3 and 5 fmax of c2 and c3 distributed in roughly the same trend as protein like both c2 and c3 had an abnormal high intensity at site a3 3 suggesting the riverine terrestrial contribution however intensities of c2 and c3 at the near shore sites were generally lower than that at the far shore sites except for site a3 3 this suggests that humic like components had other contributions such as in situ microbial production e g arai et al 2017 besides terrestrial input implying poor relation between these components and terrestrial matter 3 3 distribution of the relative intensities of fdom in sediment pore waters for a more comprehensive understanding relative intensities of c1 c5 c1 c5 were defined as the ratio of their fluorescence intensity to the total fluorescence intensity fig 3 below shows the distributions of c1 c5 in sediment pore waters of marginal ecs comparing the two groups of humic like and protein like components 39 of the 42 sites were dominant in protein like components and only three sites with almost the same longitude of a6 5 a7 2 and a8 1 were humic like dominated among three protein like components c1 had highest fluorescence intensity of at most sites all three protein like components had the same increasing trend from the coastal water to the ocean between their intensities and relative intensities for humic like components c2 dominated and its fluorescence intensity reached 3 4 times that of c3 at site a4 6 the relative intensities of these two humic like components had opposite trend between their fluorescence intensities both c2 and c3 decreased with increasing distance from the coastal area which could be taken as a hint for exploring the relation between humic like components and terrestrial matter in sediment pore waters in ecs 3 4 factors controlling the distribution of fdom in sediment pore waters rda of the intensities of fdom components and other biochemical and environmental variables was carried out the results showed that rda1 and rda2 explained 81 1 and 17 2 of the variance respectively among c1 c5 bit vector was closest to rda1 axis suggesting that bit correlated strongly with rda1 both c2 and c3 were positively correlated with bit index chlorin and δ13c were identified as other two controlling factors fig 4 in correction matrix fig 5 among all variables significant correlations in intensity were frequently found among the five fdom components the intensity of c2 and c3 had a strong positive correlation r 0 93 p 0 005 fig s2 the intensities of all three protein like components were positively correlated with longitude but negatively with toc in addition to the relationships with latitude and longitude the intensities of c2 and c3 were lack of relationships with environmental parameters compared with the intensities of c2 and c3 the relative intensities of c2 and c3 had more complex correlations with environmental parameters c2 was positively correlated with hix r 0 92 p 0 005 toc r 0 37 p 0 05 bgdgts r 0 35 p 0 05 and bit index r 0 54 p 0 005 and negatively correlated with salinity r 0 47 p 0 005 longitude r 0 42 p 0 05 and water depth r 0 41 p 0 05 c3 was positively with hix r 0 90 p 0 005 and bit index r 0 48 p 0 005 and also negatively correlated with salinity r 0 39 p 0 05 longitude r 0 31 p 0 05 and water depth r 0 36 p 0 05 remarkably c2 and c3 of the pore water samples both showed positive correlations with the terrestrial proxy bit index that widely used to track the relative fluvial soil organic matter contribution to aquatic sediments hopmans et al 2004 sun et al 2011 xu et al 2020 yamamoto et al 2017 zhu et al 2011 the regression coefficient r between c2 and bit index was higher than that between c3 and bit index suggesting the more applicability of c2 than c3 in reflecting the terrestrial input in the ecs 4 discussion 4 1 sources of fdom in sediment pore waters in this study δ13c value in this study ranged from 25 95 to 23 17 the marine end member δ13c value was generally set as 20 hedges et al 1997 weijers et al 2009 and the terrestrial end member δ13c value referring to the riverbank of yangtze river was from 28 9 to 24 3 wu et al 2007 δ13c value fell between the two end members illustrating that the sedimentary organic matter originated from both sources moreover hix ranged from 0 32 to 3 61 and fi ranged from 1 07 to 2 08 preliminarily indicated that the fdom in study area was affected by both allochthonous terrestrial input and autochthonous biogenic production this inference is in line with the higher intensities of those fdom at offshore sites than near shore sites a previous study also showed that sediment pore water fdom in near area originated from both microbial activities and terrestrial matter using principal component analysis wang et al 2013 a total of 41 samples from the 42 sites had a bit index of less than 0 4 except for site a1 1 that was closest to the land the average value of bit index was 0 15 0 13 indicating a sedimentary environment in which ocean input dominated toc of the study area generally decreased from the nearshore to the ocean reflecting the terrestrial control of toc and that toc could serve as another terrestrial proxy in the correlation analysis between protein like components and other parameters the intensity of the protein like components was negatively correlated with toc it suggested that terrestrial matter contribution little to the protein like components and thus protein like components in this study was microbial derived in studies of fdom in the estuary and marginal sea areas the negative correlation between salinity and humic like components is often observed cao et al 2016 fellman et al 2010 kim and kim 2017 li et al 2015 also observed a significant negative correlation between salinity and humic components in the seawater of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent east china sea r 0 9 p 0 001 and the study area was basically the same as this study in this study however there was no significant correlation between salinity and c2 or c3 fig 5 to claim the terrestrial material as the main end member for the intensities of humic like components in ecs sediment pore water this could be attributed to the dual sources of riverine input and marine productivity of organic matter in ecs surface sediments xing et al 2011 in this study humic like components of sediment pore waters were increased from the nearshore sites to offshore sites in ecs thus the intensities of humic like components in sediment pore waters cannot indicate the input of terrestrial material as that in seawater this inference was further supported by the lack of correlations between the c2 or c3 with bit index to sum up the main contribution to fdom here was autochthonous production instead of allochthonous input terrestrial input for allochthonous input the overwhelming majority of terrestrial derived fluorescence was humic like stedmon and nelson 2015 these fluorescence signals may result from the terrestrial humic substances or humidification process of terrestrial organic matter mediated by microbes stevenson 1994 as for autochthonous production during the degradation of pom to inorganic matter mediated mainly by bacteria and archaea in sediments there was a net production of refractory pore water fdom and much of this production was considered as humic like signals arnosti 2004 burdige et al 2004 burdige and komada 2015 the significant autochthonous microbial production in sediments of humic like components have also been verified with isotopic method kim et al 2018 as the early diagenetic products of chlorophylls chlorin could indicate the abundance of pigment related organic matter in sediments schubert et al 2002 and its roughly increasing longitudinal distribution fig s3 may partially explain the increasing trend of fdom components considering only microbial degradation humic like components should have dominated the fluorescence signals however most of the sites 39 of 42 fig s4 was dominated by protein like components suggesting that protein like components may have other sources for example viral lysis of the microbes in sediments may contribute to pore water protein like components rowe and deming 2011 sipler and bronk 2015 also a study has shown that peaks responsible for protein like components were most remarkable in the sediment water interface coble 1996 this observation may imply the input of protein like signal from microbial activity in the water column although protein like components were generally considered to be more biological labile than the humic like pore water protein like components were reported to related closely with refractory dom burdige et al 2004 fellman et al 2009 hence the alteration of protein like components due to further microbial utilization could be fairly minor 4 2 relative intensity implication for a new terrestrial proxy the dual source of humic like components resulted in the loss of their indicator function of terrestrial input but the opposite distribution of their intensities and relative intensities provides an insight for exploring a new terrestrial proxy in sediments negative correlations between salinity and both c2 and c3 further illustrated that the contribution of terrestrial matter to the humic like components in sediments was preserved in the form of relative intensity terrestrial proxy bit also correlated with both c2 and c3 r 0 54 0 48 respectively p 0 005 and both had discrete values that were significantly different from the other 40 sites in site a1 1 and a6 5 fig s5 at site a1 1 bit index was too high but c2 and c3 were too low as can be seen from figure 2b in cheng et al 2019 toc of this site was the largest but the humic like components of this site were mainly controlled by microbial activities rather than terrestrial input which led to high terrestrial signals of bit index but low proportion of humic like components in this site the reason behind this needs to be further explored the situation of site a6 5 was opposite to that of site a1 1 its bit index was low while c2 and c3 were high site a6 5 was located in a special area in ecs called the estuarine turbidity maximum etm studies have shown that resuspension of sediments and photolysis of pom often occurred in etm li and zhang 1998 in the study of the overlying water on ecs sediment fdom fluorescence intensity of the bottom water was higher than that of the surface water and the increase of protein like components at this site was much more obvious than that of humic like components the study concluded that the resuspension at the etm drove sediment fdom to replenish the underlying water li et al 2015 the greater increase etm associated with protein like components than with humic like components indicated the uneven effect of resuspension on different fdom components and more protein like components may be input into overlaying water than the humic component leading to an increase in the proportion of humic like components in site a6 5 in addition the fdom produced by the photolysis of pom was believed to be mainly humic like component liu and shank 2015 pisani et al 2011 these humic like components may feed the sediment fdom back further increasing the proportion of humic like components discarding these two anomalies the correlations between bit index and relative intensity of humic like protein became more apparent r 0 79 for c2 and r 0 65 for c3 p 0 005 fig 6 these correlations indicated that c2 and c3 can serve as alternative indicators of bit to indicate the input of terrestrial matter and the humic like components retain the signals input by terrestrial matter through their relative intensity 4 3 possible mechanisms for c2 bit relationship two possible mechanisms may underpin the relationship between bit and humic like components one is that the trend of the humic like proportions decreased passively due to the increasing trend of protein like proportions which means there was only pseudo correlations between bit and humic like components the other one is that the trend of the humic like proportions decreased actively due to their decreasing terrestrial contribution as shown in fig 5 the relative intensity of humic like components c2 and c3 had stronger correlations between bit than that of protein like components c1 c4 and c5 thus c2 and c3 were more likely to be directly related to bit than those mediated by protein like components humic like proportions tended to decrease actively due to the seaward decreasing terrestrial input because of the release of organic material from the coastal sediments the humic like organic matter was always abundant in pore waters chen et al 2016 wang et al 2013 however poor correlation was found between the humic like components revealed by eems parafac and terrestrial input chen et al 2016 wang et al 2013 which might be due to their autochthonous microbial production in coastal sediments in this study the in situ microbial production was predominant over its terrestrial counterpart in contributing to c2 and c3 which led to the lack of the decreasing trend in the intensity of c2 and c3 here we assume that the contribution of overall autochthonous microbial production microbial degradation viral lysis and other possible processes in 4 1 to both humic like and protein like components was quite impartial although they may originated from different microbial pathways while the input of the terrestrial matter only contributed to humic like components this allochthonous contribution could either directly generate humic like signals or possibly enhance them indirectly by further microbial humidification of the part of relatively fresh terrestrial organic matter whether it was directly or indirectly both of them shared the same terrestrial end member and showed had a same tendency to weaken from the near shore to the ocean thus although fluorescence intensities of c2 and c3 had rough increasing trend from nearshore to ocean due to prevailing contribution from microbial production their relative intensities were determined by the amount of terrestrial matter input neither this study nor other studies could support quantitative analyses of a concrete mechanism researches on single end member to humic like components and on more specific chemical compounds may aid to the explanation from the above analysis it was found that the correlations between c2 and related indicators hix salinity bit index were stronger than c3 so its indication to terrestrial matter was stronger than c3 c3 has a maximum emission wavelength of up to 500 nm which was rarely reported in the study of fdom in waters stedmon and markager also found a component similar to c3 and believed that it could be rapidly generated by visible light and rapidly degraded 2005b making it difficult to detect in seawater both c2 and c3 have two peaks and both peaks of c3 were red shifted to those of c2 a longer emission wavelength within c3 indicates a larger size of aromatic compound and less energy difference between ground and excited states stedmon and nelson 2015 it was reported that the degradation and or aging of dom may response for the shift to longer wavelength komada et al 2002 which indicates that c3 may have experienced a higher degree of transformation from its origin and thereby the relationship between c3 and bit index has been weakened to some extent moreover humic like peaks were found to exist in pairs this is highly consistent with our results with one pair being peak a and peak m similar to c2 in this study and the other pair being peak a and peak c similar to c3 in this study peak a and peak c may result from the in situ transformation of peak a and peak m in addition to their terrestrial source burdige et al 2004 this suggests that the existence of humic like peaks in pairs may be a common feature of fdom in sediment pore waters and that c3 may have undergone a more complex and uncharacterized formation process compared with c2 studies of humic like fdom degradation state would be helpful to clarify the mechanism behind the relationship between c3 and bit overall c2 would be a more appropriate fdom derived terrestrial proxy than c3 considering that specific fdom component modeled by parafac relied on the dataset used it would be more practicable to suggest a more direct proxy from the eems data here the proportion of peak a the main peak corresponding to c2 is suggested as a new terrestrial proxy derived from fdom 5 conclusions by analyzing the characteristics of fdom in sediment pore waters from ecs combined with other environmental parameters biological parameters and chemical parameters five fdom components were characterized with eems parafac and they were believed to be controlled by both allochthonous terrestrial input and autochthonous microbial production and the latter dominated overall protein like components were primarily microbial derived while humic like components had mixing sources of terrestrial matter and microbial production the dual sources of humic like components led to their special spatial distribution and masked their indications to terrestrial matter however their relative intensities c2 and c3 still retained sensitivity to terrestrial input and could be used as a supplementary indicator of bit index for a better technical operation the proportion of the main peak of c2 peak a was suggested as a terrestrial proxy due to the lack of studies on planktonic organisms in sediments and overlaying waters concrete controlling mechanisms of biological effects on fdom have not been elucidated further study of the interaction between sediments and overlaying waters will help us to better understand the transformation and generation of fdom in sedimentary environments and thus more fully the role of fdom in biogeochemical cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17826,low cost green regenerable catalyst for persulfate activation is the popularly concerned topic for the degradation of persistent organic micropollutants in drinking water in this work natural montmorillonite mmt saturated with fe iii ions was used to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of atrazine in raw drinking water results showed that the adsorption of atrazine was quickly completed within 1 min and the percentage degradation was finally increased up to 94 1 in 60 min the d001 spacing of mmt was enlarged to 2 91 nm at the most by fe iii saturation atrazine was adsorbed into the nanoscale interlayer of fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt where the fe iii fe ii cycle was sustainably realized through the accelerated transformation of electrons between fe iii and pms meanwhile the in situ generated fe ii accelerated the decomposition of pms to further proceed the degradation of atrazine through the oxidation of ho and so4 radicals this nanoconfined effect of pms activation by fe iii was further confirmed through the degradation of various micropollutants in the backgrounds of river water the selective catalytic oxidation of micropollutants through pms activation was attributed to the 2d mesoporous structure of fe mmt inhibiting the interlayer adsorption of larger molecular backgrounds humic acids etc fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt provided a feasible and scalable method of pms activation by fe iii for the degradation of micropollutants in drinking water graphical abstract mechanisms of atrazine degradation through pms activation by fe mmt image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate activation fe iii saturated montmorillonite nanoconfined effect fe iii fe ii cycle micropollutant removal 1 introduction due to the high redox potential and longer half life period sulfate radical based advanced oxidation technologies have gained more concern on the degradation or mineralization of refractory organic micropollutants in drinking water and contaminated groundwater xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 sulfate radical so4 is commonly derived from the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds by different types of activators including metal ions rodríguez chueca et al 2019 metal oxides li et al 2019b ma et al 2019 carbon materials ozyildiz et al 2019 sun et al 2019 uv irradiation zhang et al 2018 and thermal activation zhu et al 2018 etc due to the asymmetric structure the activation of pms is usually considered to be easier than that of pds nevertheless a low cost catalyst with high efficiency of pms activation and regeneration is still needed fe ii ion has been popularly adopted as an effective activator of pms due to the cost effective and environmentally friendly properties zou et al 2013 however fe ii pms system has intrinsic drawbacks critically the slow transformation from fe iii to fe ii limits the reduction of in situ formed fe iii and results in a low efficiency of pms activation correspondingly rastogi et al 2009 as a result the degradation efficiency of micropollutants is also inhibited and the reaction would be even terminated when the addition of fe ii is not enough on the other hand the problems of fe ii residual and iron oxide sludge from the superfluous addition of fe ii also limit the widespread application of fe ii pms system to alleviate these drawbacks the addition of chelating and reducing agents was used to improve the degradation of micropollutants in fe ii pms system the chelating agents included citrate s s ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid trisodium salt edds pyrophosphate and tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand etc rastogi et al 2009 they could enhance the stability of iron ions in solution and accelerate the generation of sulfate and sulfate derived radicals in addition the reducing agent such as hydroxylamine ha facilitated the transformation from fe iii to fe ii and enhanced the activation of pms chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 meanwhile the production of iron oxide sludge was also alleviated it is indicated that the stability and recycle of fe iii fe ii would be of significant importance for the generation of so4 radical by pms activation iron based heterogeneous catalysts have also been widely adopted in the process of persulfate activation gao et al 2016 li et al 2018 2019a 2019c liu et al 2016 wu et al 2019 in which the release of fe ii ions still plays a dominant role on the generation of so4 and other derived radicals zero valent iron zvi and iron oxides were loaded onto the kaolinite and carbon supporting materials through a short time of thermal aging and then calcinated at high temperature gao et al 2016 guo et al 2019 these iron based nanocomposite catalysts could improve the degradation of organic pollutants by persulfate activation recently spinel catalysts were popularly adopted for the activation of pms due to the crystalline fe ii in the special structure the fe iii fe ii cycle was initiated through the reaction between fe ii and co existed metal ions co iii cu ii ag i in the crystalline structure of spinel catalysts guan et al 2013 xu et al 2018a b c zhao et al 2019 the efficiency of pms activation was increased by the synergistic cycles of fe ii and co existed metal ions in the crystalline structure of spinel although these active iron species were loaded on the surface of nanocatalysts the release of fe ii and recycle of fe iii fe ii were still not controlled furthermore these active nanocatalysts usually easy to be agglomerated are expensive in cost and complicated in the fabrication procedure clay as the constructive collector of various metal oxides is a kind of natural silicate mineral surface catalytic behaviors of clay minerals have been found to generate free radicals from the slow oxidation of environmentally persistent organic micropollutants jin et al 2019 xu et al 2019 it was contributed to the accelerated transformation of electrons between the adsorbed micropollutants and cationic metal ions cu ii fe iii ni iii etc in the nanoscale interlayers of clay sheets chen et al 2019 jia et al 2018 generally speaking generation of free radicals on clay surfaces is time consumed and recognized as an environmental phenomenon harmful to ecosystem boyd 1985 qin et al 2018 however the method of free radical formation on clay surface would be greatly expected to accelerate the electron transformation between fe iii and pms for the generation of so4 radicals in this work fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt was prepared through a series of cation exchange reactions for the first time the catalytic activity and stability of fe mmt on the pms activation were evaluated in the backgrounds of simulated raw water and river songhua water atrazine frequently detected in raw drinking water and groundwater was selected as the model micropollutant the degradation performance of atrazine through the pms activation by fe mmt was investigated and the kinetic behaviors were also analyzed dominant reactive species were identified by radical quenching experiments and by means of electron spinning resonance esr spectra effects of water matrix components on the removal of various kinds of micropollutants were studied in details 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents natural montmorillonite mmt with particle size of 2

in the experiments was produced by the milli q purification system 2 2 preparation of fe iii saturated montmorillonite firstly 10 g of natural montmorillonite mmt was dispersed into 400 ml of fecl3 6h2o solution 0 1 mol l the cation exchange reaction was conducted for 8 h under the magnetic stirring of 300 rpm and then fe iii exchanged mmt was obtained by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min after that the fe iii exchanged mmt was re dispersed into the fecl3 6h2o solution 0 1 mol l for another three times finally fe iii saturated mmt fe mmt was repeatedly washed and centrifugated 8000 rpm with deionized water until the conductivity of the centrifugated supernatant was less than 10 μs cm the purified fe iii saturated mmt was freeze dried and ground into powders for further experiments 2 3 characterization of fe iii saturated montmorillonite the microstructures of mmt and fe mmt were characterized by scanning electron spectroscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds su8010 hitachi and transmission electron spectroscopy tem jem1400 jeol the interlayer spacing of mmt and fe mmt was characterized by x ray diffractometer xrd d8 advance bruker chemical structure and composition of

size distribution of mmt and fe mmt were tested by the dynamical light scattering analyzer dls nano zs90 marvin 2 4 experimental procedures batch experiments were conducted in a series of 250 ml conical flasks with the magnetic stirring of 500 rpm under 20 0 1 c the reactions were initiated by adding the predetermined amounts of mmt or fe mmt and pms into the aqueous solution 100 ml of micropollutants atz bpa ba bps and smx in the cases of adsorption experiments the reactions were initiated by adding predetermined amounts of mmt or fe mmt into these aqueous solution without pms in the cases of factor experiments the ph values of aqueous solution of atrazine were modulated by adding naoh and hcl 0 01 mol l water matrix components were adjusted by adding inorganic ions such as nacl nahco3 na2so4 and humic acid into the aqueous solution of atrazine samples were collected at specified time intervals and pre filtered by a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size all the samples were quenched by methanol before they were analyzed by hplc and hplc esi ms ms 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of atrazine was determined through the high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2487 at λ 235 nm with mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min the mobile phase contained 0 1 of methanol and acetic acid with the ratio of 60 40 v v sample volume was 100 μl and the retention time of atrazine was 29 2 min the concentrations of bpa ba bps and smx were also identified by hplc in which the detecting wavelength composition of mobile phase and retention time were changed accordingly table s1 the intermediates and degradation products of atrazine were analyzed through hplc esi ms ms in full scale mode hplc esi ms ms analysis was conducted on an agilent 1260 hplc coupled to a sciex qtrap 5500 with esi source in the positive ion mode the injection volume of each sample solution was 20 μl the gradient mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and deionized water

the reaction solution electron spin resonance esr experiments were performed with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo which was used as the spin trapping agent in the esr spectrometer bruker a200 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe iii saturated mmt to demonstrate the success of modification procedure microstructures and chemical composition of montmorillonite mmt before and after fe iii saturation were characterized by sem tem and eds analyses observed from fig 1 a and b mmt possessed obviously stacked structure of lamellar sheets with smooth surfaces while fe iii saturated mmt fe mmt was curled and partially delaminated due to the larger hydration radium of fe iii in the interlayers compared to fig 1 c the existence state of the saturated fe iii ion were further characterized by tem in fig 1 d almost no particles were found in the interlayers of mmt whilst finely spindle like nanoparticles were observed in some parts of the interlayers of fe mmt according to the strong brönsted acid effect these amorphous nanoparticles were the partial hydrolyzed products of dissociation equilibrium of hydrated water molecules around fe iii ions in the interlayers of mmt nanosheets soma and soma 1989 these inserted fe iii and iron hydr oxides co contributed to the intercalation or exfoliation of mmt sheets observed from fig 1 e and f the increased contents of fe and o elements were obtained when the fe iii ion was saturated into the mmt sheets there was almost no eds signal of fe element in mmt while the fe content in fe mmt was improved up to 22 25 normalized by the atomic percentage of si the ratios of fe si and o si in fe mmt were 1 4 and 2 9 larger than the counterparts of mmt 0 and 1 8 these improvements of fe and o amounts further demonstrated the existence of fe iii and iron hydr oxides characteristic peaks of fe in eds were centered at 0 7 kev 6 4 kev and 7 1 kev respectively the inserted fe species with these characteristic peaks were reported to remove tetracycline efficiently by adsorption xu et al 2018a b c interlayer distance between clay sheets is of great importance for the adsorption behavior change of which depends on the d001 spacing characterized by sxrd in fig 2 a the diffraction angle of mmt was only centered at 6 9 and the d001 spacing was 1 26 nm according to the bragg equation similar with our previous report wang et al 2012 after fe iii saturation the diffraction angle became much smaller and divided into 5 6 and 3 0 the d001 spacing was enlarged to 2 91 nm at the most based on the cation exchange reaction with na i ion fe iii ions with larger hydration radium were inserted into the mmt interlayer and pillared up the d001 spacing in addition the iron hydr oxides observed in fig 1 d also enlarged the interlayer distance fig s1 a showed the wide angle x ray diffraction wxrd spectra of mmt and fe mmt the quartz structure of fe mmt was not destroyed although the intensities of characteristic peaks 19 7 and 27 of mmt were weakened however some characteristic peaks of mmt vanished after fe iii saturation due to the enlarged d001 spacing as a result the specific surface area according to the bet curves of n2 adsorption desorption in fig 2 b was improved from 27 9 m2 g of mmt to 38 5 m2 g of fe mmt these bet curves belonged to the iv type isotherm indicating the 2d mesoporous structures of mmt and fe mmt the h3 type of hysteresis loops of isotherms identified the slitting structures of the mesoporous pores in mmt and fe mmt the wide distribution of pore sizes in fig s1 b further showed the existence of inter pores of sheets and intra pores of interlayer in mmt and fe mmt in fig 2 c the less negatively charged property of fe mmt was found in different ph range which was in turn beneficial to the adsorption of micropollutants in water it was attributed to the insertion of fe iii ion and hydrolyzed iron hydr oxides into the mmt interlayer furthermore the small size of fe mmt particles in fig s1 c was the result of the partial exfoliation of mmt wang et al 2012 2013 for the chemical composition ftir results in fig 3 a showed that the bending vibrations of si o al and al2oh were completely kept at 520 cm 1 and 920 cm 1 the co3 stretching vibration of calcite component at 1395 cm 1 vanished in fe mmt representing the structure change of mmt after fe iii saturation the fe o stretching vibration at 470 cm 1 and fe o h bending vibration at 1000 cm 1 were not observed due to the overlapping between the characteristic peaks of iron hydr oxides and intrinsic iron species in the crystalline structure of mmt yuan et al 2008 however shown in fig 3 b the fe 2p signal was observed in the xps results of fe mmt according to the composition percentages iron content in fe mmt was 3 3 times than that counterpart in mmt this increased amount of iron component was contributed by the saturated fe iii species in the fe mmt interlayer the fe species in mmt and fe mmt were analyzed through the resolved results of fe 2p core level in fig 3 c d the fe 2p1 2 peak at 724 7 ev and fe 2p3 2 peak at 710 9 ev accompanying with their satellites were all observed in the xps results of mmt and fe mmt however the intensities of fe species in mmt derived from the intrinsic crystalline iron in fig 3 c were much less than those counterparts in fe mmt there was 94 fe iii ion in the interlayer of fe mmt some iron hydr oxides were also found in fig 3 d it was greatly different from the component of fe iii ion 100 in the crystal structure of mmt which demonstrated the successful fe iii saturation of mmt by cation exchange reaction 3 2 degradation performance of atrazine by fe iii saturated mmt atrazine as a typical pesticide detected in drinking source water was used to evaluate the catalytic capability of pms activators shown in fig 4 a there was almost no removal of atrazine by single pms in 60 min after the addition of mmt with pms 10 9 of atrazine was oxidized which was slightly higher than that by single pms mmt could not effectively activate pms for the degradation of atrazine interestingly fe mmt could obviously catalyze the activation of pms and improved the removal of atrazine with the percentage degradation up to 94 1 in 60 min to differentiate the contribution of adsorption and oxidation the removal efficiency of atrazine by adsorption was represented in fig 4 b at the beginning of 1 min 63 2 of atrazine was removed after the addition of fe mmt while the percentage removal was only 11 8 after the addition of mmt however the percentage degradation of atrazine in 1 min was reduced to 47 5 after the addition of fe mmt with pms in fig 4 a which was less than the single adsorptive removal by fe mmt it indicated that fe mmt had better adsorptive performance of atrazine than that of mmt but pms greatly inhibited the adsorption behavior of atrazine onto fe mmt with the increase of adsorption time the adsorbed atrazine was little released from fe mmt and the removal percentage of atrazine lowered down to 47 7 at the end of 60 min in fig 4 b the phenomenon of atrazine release was attributed to the release of fe iii ion from fe mmt interlayer it was concluded that atrazine was quickly adsorbed onto fe mmt and degraded by the pms activation this was also supported by the highest reaction kinetic constant of fe mmt with pms kobs 0 0361 min 1 in fig 4 c as shown in fig 5 the amount of pms was almost not consumed in fe iii pms system and the fe iii concentration remained the same as the initial amount of 1 mg l pms activation was not initiated by fe iii due to the slow electron transformation from fe iii to pms after the addition of mmt the percentage of pms consumption was only 8 2 in the fe iii mmt pms system the fe iii concentration was also not changed in the reaction time this pms consumption was attributed to the adsorption of mmt and pms could not be activated by fe iii in the presence of mmt differently the amount of pms was continuously consumed in the fe mmt pms system while the concentration of released fe iii increased with the reaction time correspondingly at the end of reaction the fe iii concentration approached up to 0 78 mg l it was believed that pms consumption was attributed to the pms activation by fe mmt accompanying with the release of fe iii it was reported that fe iii inserted into montmorillonite mmt could change the transformation of organic micropollutants in water by the catalytic oxidation in the interlayer surface qin et al 2015 this catalytically oxidative behavior emerged in the transformation and degradation of endocrine disrupting compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and tetracycline etc jia et al 2014 2018 the catalytic oxidation on clay surface was initiated by the electron transformation between fe iii and micropollutants in the nanoscale space of clay sheets even facilitated under simulated sunlight xu et al 2018a b c similarly it was deduced that electron transformation between fe iii and pms in the interlayer of fe mmt could also be accelerated to generate the active fe ii species for the enhancement of pms activation 3 2 1 kinetics of pms activation by fe mmt the observed reaction rate constants kobs of fe mmt were calculated to represent the efficiency of pms activation in fig s2 these activation processes were all pseudo first order kinetic reactions the kobs was not linearly increased with the dosage of pms the highest kobs 0 053 min 1 was obtained at the pms dosage of 0 4 mm differently the atrazine degradation was linearly increased with the decrease of atrazine concentration and the increase of fe mmt dosage these enhancements in the degradation were the synergistic results of immediate adsorption within 1 min and pms activation this phenomenon was also reported in the fenton like catalytic system under iron nanoconfinement yang et al 2019 the role of adsorption on the degradation kinetics of atz was also shown in fig 6 the kobs was significantly decreased when the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe increased from 0 27 μmol g to 1 48 μmol g in fig 6 a this reduction of kobs indicated the competitive activity between atrazine adsorption and pms activation on the active fe iii sites of fe mmt however when the pms dosage increased from 0 05 mm to 0 4 mm the kobs gradually increased at different qe of atrazine adsorption in fig 6 b this increase of kobs demonstrated the fe iii dependent adsorption and degradation processes of atrazine in the nanoscale interlayer of fe mmt the atrazine adsorbed on the fe iii sites was more quickly degraded by the higher dosage of pms and in turn the as occupied fe iii sites were regenerated for the atrazine adsorption and pms activation unfortunately the kobs decreased when the pms dosage increased from 0 4 mm to 1 mm it was attributed to the fe iii release from the interlayers of fe mmt through cation exchange effect the pms dosage was greatly important for the balance of atrazine adsorption and fe iii release 3 2 2 dominant reactive species the generation of radicals in the systems of fe iii mmt and fe mmt were identified by the electron spin resonance esr spectra in fig 7 using dmpo as a typical spin trapping agent typical quadruple peak signals of dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 and sext peak signals of dmpo so4 guo et al 2019 were observed in fig 7 a it demonstrated the generation of both ho and so4 radicals in the fe mmt system containing pms and atrazine the peak intensity of dmpo oh adduct gradually decreased and vanished until the reaction time of 5 min meanwhile the dmpo so4 adduct dominated the species of radicals in the system it confirmed the excellent catalytic ability of fe mmt on pms activation this was different from the fast transformation from dmpo so4 adduct to dmpo oh adduct by nucleophilic substitution zou et al 2013 in fig 7 b these signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were compared with the typical ho radical generated through h2o2 activation by fe ii ion the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh adduct in the system of fe mmt with pms were the same as those of typical ho radical derived from the fenton reaction however no signals of ho and so4 radicals emerged in the fe iii pms system and mmt pms system in fig 7 c as reported fe iii ion in aqueous solution is difficult to be reduced into fe ii ion and in turn limits the activation of pms rastogi et al 2009 the little amount of fe iii in the octahedral structure of mmt fig 3 c is also not able to activate pms it was convincing that fe iii saturated in mmt effectively catalyzed the activation of pms radical quenching experiments were also conducted in fig 8 the degradation efficiency of atrazine was both decreased from 94 1 to 51 9 whenever 10 mm or 100 mm of methanol was added into the fe mmt system with pms this quenching effect of methanol was not observed data shown in fig s3 in the control system of fe mmt without pms due to the single effect of adsorption this result indicated that one of ho or so4 radicals was at least generated in the fe mmt system containing pms and atrazine the contribution of so5 radical was negligible in the system since the methanol was inert to so5 radical zou et al 2013 however the degradation efficiency of atrazine was only decreased from 94 1 to 78 4 when 10 mm of turt butanol tba was added into the fe mmt system in the presence of pms the quenching effect of tba 2000 times of the initial concentration of atrazine was less than the counterpart of methanol due to the high rate constant of tba with ho radical it further demonstrated the existence of ho radical in the system with the increase of tba addition 100 mm the percentage degradation of atrazine was further inhibited down to 47 3 it was attributed to the inhibition of so4 radical in the system by the massive amounts of tba in addition the evolution of ho radical was gradually inhibited with the extension of reaction time and then the so4 radical dominated the active species in the system when the 1 4 dicarboxybenzene was used as the indicator in fig s3 these results demonstrated the co existence of ho and so4 radicals in the oxidation of atrazine by pms in the presence of fe mmt 3 3 effects of water matrix components 3 3 1 influence of ph inorganic ions and humic acids as reported the ph of solution affects the distribution of atrazine species iron precipitation and pms decomposition zou et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 9 a the highest percentage degradation of atrazine by pms in the presence of fe mmt was 94 1 at ph 6 the high concentration of proton at ph 3 consumed the most part of ho and so4 radicals hashikawa and murata 2019 and the degradation of atrazine was decreased to 74 5 the reduction of atrazine degradation at ph 9 was caused by the hydrolysis of fe iii ion in interlayer spaces of fe mmt and the as formed iron hydr oxides occupied the active sites for atrazine adsorption in addition the larger charge negativity of fe mmt at ph 9 in fig 3 c was also not beneficial for hso5 entering the fe mmt interlayers although the reaction rates of atrazine ho radical and atrazine so4 radical were similar in acidic condition the reactivity of ho radical decreased in basic condition and further reduced the percentage degradation of atrazine oppositely at ph 12 pms was further activated by the strong alkaline solution gao et al 2016 as a result almost 100 of atz was degraded in a pseudo first order kinetic reaction in fig 9 b the effect of humic acids on the degradation of atrazine by pms in the presence of fe mmt was negligible due to the relatively less reaction activity between humic acid and so4 radical lutze et al 2015 the saturated fe iii in the interlayer of fe mmt could selectively adsorb atrazine while the humic acids with large molecular weight were repelled away shown in fig s4 due to the selectivity of mesoporous structure of fe mmt in fig 9 c chloride ion greatly accelerated the degradation of atrazine and the percentage degradation quickly approached 100 within 1 min as reported previously so4 radical was capable of oxidizing chloride ion to generate chlorine radical and free chlorine species anipsitakis et al 2006 through the dual effects of chlorine and so4 radicals the chlorinated derivatives of atrazine were formed in the oxidation system by pms in the presence of fe mmt similar phenomenon of the enhanced degradation of micropollutants in the presence of chloride was also observed in the system of fe 0 with pms yang et al 2018 the evolutions of degradation efficiency of atrazine in the presence of hco3 and so4 2 were also provided in fig 9 d and e the percentage degradation of atrazine almost approached 100 within 30 min when 5 mm of nahco3 was added to facilitate the formation of iron hydr oxides with catalytic activity however the higher content of hco3 was apt to scavenging the radicals of ho and so4 due to the high second order rate constant 106 108 m 1s 1 ghauch et al 2017 the generated co3 radical was less active and decreased the degradation efficiency of atrazine in the presence of 10 mm nahco3 in addition so4 2 was generated by the pms decomposition the increase of so4 2 also inhibited the behavior of pms activation the atrazine degradation shown in fig 9 e was slowed down in the presence of na2so4 the degradation of atrazine was dependent on the water matrix during the pms activation by fe mmt except for the effects of humic acids 3 3 2 influence of river songhua water background the results on river songhua water spiked with micropollutants were shown in fig 10 differently the adsorptive removal of atrazine by fe mmt without pms was greatly decreased to 6 9 in fig 10 a it was much less than the adsorptive efficiency 47 7 of atrazine in the background of deionized water in fig 4 b the inorganic ions and dissolved organic matters doc with low molecular weight in river songhua water table s2 would enter the interlayer of fe mmt through cation exchange or adsorption reaction as a result the active sites for atrazine adsorption were occupied after the addition of pms the percentage removal of atrazine by fe mmt increased up to 90 under the comprehensive effects of ph chloride bicarbonate and sulfate in the backgrounds of river water the results indicated that pms activation by fe mmt dominated the degradation efficiency of atrazine in the background of songhua river water in fig 10 b the degradation percentages of ba bpa smx bps in river water by pms in the presence of fe mmt were 96 2 100 100 97 9 respectively the degradation kinetics were dependent on their molecular structures thereof smx was the most easily degradable pharmaceutical pms activation by fe mmt showed excellent ability of oxidation for these micropollutants in the backgrounds of river songhua water it was a selective oxidation process ignoring the effects of doc in the backgrounds of drinking source water 3 4 stability and activity of fe iii saturated mmt catalytic stability and iron release of fe mmt were of significant concerns in the application of drinking water treatment to differentiate the effects of fe mmt adsorption and fe mmt pms oxidation the stabilities of atrazine removal by fe mmt with and without pms were presented in fig 11 a the percentage removal of atrazine was 94 1 in the first run of pms oxidation in the presence of fe mmt after generation from simple freeze drying it was decreased to 84 1 in the second run due to the release of fe iii after that the removal efficiency of atrazine was only reduced by 1 and 4 in the following runs which demonstrated the excellent stability of fe mmt furthermore these reduction amplitudes of percentage degradation were similar with those of different runs in the system of fe mmt adsorption it indicated that the reduction of adsorption effects dominated the stability of fe mmt fig 11 b provided the effects of pms dosage on the release of fe iii and atrazine degradation in the fe mmt system without pms the release of fe iii ion in the 5 μm of atrazine solution was only 0 068 mg l while the percentage removal of atrazine was 47 7 due to the adsorption of fe mmt when the dosage of pms increased from 0 2 mm to 1 mm the release of fe iii ion was linearly aggravated and the largest value was up to 0 783 mg l this dependence of fe iii ion release on the concentration of pms was attributed to the cation exchange effect of potassium ions in pms fortunately the percentage removal of atrazine were always more than 94 the largest removal was 98 4 at the pms dosage of 0 4 mm the corresponding release of fe iii ion was only 0 289 mg l lower than the maximum concentration 0 3 mg l in the standard of drinking water in china it was concluded that the catalytic stability and activity of fe mmt could be modulated by the optimization of pms dosage 3 5 mechanisms of pms activation by fe mmt conventional pms activation by fe ii ion is the result of rapid o o bond fracture through electron transferring from fe ii ion to pms however the process of pms activation would be quickly terminated once the fe ii ion is completely oxidized to fe iii ion zou et al 2013 fe iii ion was difficult to be reduced by pms due to the great difficulty of opposite electron transferring from pms to fe o bond the lower redox potential efe iii fe ii 0 77 v is an importantly limited factor for the pms activation by fe iii ion recycling between fe ii and fe iii was reported to be a sustainable measurement for the high efficient activation of pms the saturated fe iii ion in fe mmt was reported to accelerate the transformation of electron from the diffused in micropollutants to fe iii ion in the nanoscale interlayers qin et al 2015 the transformation of micropollutants was dependent on the molecular ionization potential and clay surface property jia et al 2014 this confined transformation of electron in the interlayers would accelerate the reduction of fe iii by pms the decomposition and activation of pms was initiated in the interlayers of fe mmt as described in the following equations 1 4 1 f e i i i h s o 5 f e i i s o 5 h 2 f e i i h s o 5 f e i i i s o 4 o h 3 f e i i h s o 5 f e i i i s o 4 2 o h 4 f e i i i o h h s o 5 f e i i i o h s o 4 o h 5 f e i i i o h s o 4 h

easily exchanged into the interlayer of fe mmt and the complexity of fe iii pms was formed consequently the opposite transformation of electron from pms to fe o bond was accelerated in the nanoscale interlayer 2 91 nm shown in fig 2 and the reaction of equation 1 occurred this electron transformation was beneficial for the in situ recycling of fe iii fe ii which was responsible for the pms activation in the confined interlayers of fe mmt the reactions of equations 2 3 guaranteed the decomposition of pms to generate radicals of so4 and oh simultaneously in addition the iron hydr oxides were in situ formed during the saturation process although which were the little part of fe iii species in the interlayers of fe mmt surface electron transformation of iron hydr oxides was responsible for the pms activation pms was first coordinated with iron hydr oxides on the surface and decomposed to generate so5 equation 4 while fe iii was reduced into fe ii in the coordinated complexity of fe ii and pms equation 5 the so4 radical was released from the fe ii pms complexity part of which reacted with oh to generate oh radicals equations 6 7 finally the atrazine diffusing into the interlayers of fe mmt was degraded by the synergistical oxidation of so4 and oh radicals through equation 8 reaction 3 6 analysis of degradation pathway and intermediate products it was demonstrated that so4 and oh radicals were both primary active species for the degradation of atrazine the intermediate products of atrazine degradation by pms oxidation were detected and identified through lc ms ms analysis table s3 degradation of atrazine by so4 and oh radicals mainly experienced processes of dealkylation alkylic hydroxylation alkylic oxidation and dichlorination hydroxylation xu et al 2018a b c the so4 radical reacted with the alkylic groups of atrazine through h abstraction atrazine desethyl dea and atrazine desisopropyl dia were sequentially obtained due to the larger steric hindrance of isopropyl group the so4 radical further reacted with dea and dia to generate atrazine desethyl desisopropyl dedia direct hydroxylation of the isopropyl chain was observed through oh attack the formed hydroxyl in the isopropyl chain was then oxidized to carbonyl group followed by the dealkylation reactions in addition dechlorination was also an important pathway to replace the chlorine group in atrazine finally the oxidized products with low molecular weight were obtained 4 conclusions fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt showed high activity and stability during the process of pms activation for atrazine removal it was the synergistic result of quick adsorption and catalytic oxidation of fe mmt pms activation by fe mmt was most effective at ph 6 the release of fe iii ion could meet the need of drinking water standard through the modulation of pms dosage the so4 and oh radicals were the primary active species for the degradation of atrazine the dealkylated and hydroxylated intermediates were finally converted to oxidized products with low molecular weight the accelerated redox cycle of fe iii fe ii in the interlayer of fe mmt was mainly responsible for the pms activation and the in situ formation of iron hydr oxides on the interlayer surface also facilitated the activation process of pms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17826,low cost green regenerable catalyst for persulfate activation is the popularly concerned topic for the degradation of persistent organic micropollutants in drinking water in this work natural montmorillonite mmt saturated with fe iii ions was used to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of atrazine in raw drinking water results showed that the adsorption of atrazine was quickly completed within 1 min and the percentage degradation was finally increased up to 94 1 in 60 min the d001 spacing of mmt was enlarged to 2 91 nm at the most by fe iii saturation atrazine was adsorbed into the nanoscale interlayer of fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt where the fe iii fe ii cycle was sustainably realized through the accelerated transformation of electrons between fe iii and pms meanwhile the in situ generated fe ii accelerated the decomposition of pms to further proceed the degradation of atrazine through the oxidation of ho and so4 radicals this nanoconfined effect of pms activation by fe iii was further confirmed through the degradation of various micropollutants in the backgrounds of river water the selective catalytic oxidation of micropollutants through pms activation was attributed to the 2d mesoporous structure of fe mmt inhibiting the interlayer adsorption of larger molecular backgrounds humic acids etc fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt provided a feasible and scalable method of pms activation by fe iii for the degradation of micropollutants in drinking water graphical abstract mechanisms of atrazine degradation through pms activation by fe mmt image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate activation fe iii saturated montmorillonite nanoconfined effect fe iii fe ii cycle micropollutant removal 1 introduction due to the high redox potential and longer half life period sulfate radical based advanced oxidation technologies have gained more concern on the degradation or mineralization of refractory organic micropollutants in drinking water and contaminated groundwater xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 sulfate radical so4 is commonly derived from the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds by different types of activators including metal ions rodríguez chueca et al 2019 metal oxides li et al 2019b ma et al 2019 carbon materials ozyildiz et al 2019 sun et al 2019 uv irradiation zhang et al 2018 and thermal activation zhu et al 2018 etc due to the asymmetric structure the activation of pms is usually considered to be easier than that of pds nevertheless a low cost catalyst with high efficiency of pms activation and regeneration is still needed fe ii ion has been popularly adopted as an effective activator of pms due to the cost effective and environmentally friendly properties zou et al 2013 however fe ii pms system has intrinsic drawbacks critically the slow transformation from fe iii to fe ii limits the reduction of in situ formed fe iii and results in a low efficiency of pms activation correspondingly rastogi et al 2009 as a result the degradation efficiency of micropollutants is also inhibited and the reaction would be even terminated when the addition of fe ii is not enough on the other hand the problems of fe ii residual and iron oxide sludge from the superfluous addition of fe ii also limit the widespread application of fe ii pms system to alleviate these drawbacks the addition of chelating and reducing agents was used to improve the degradation of micropollutants in fe ii pms system the chelating agents included citrate s s ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid trisodium salt edds pyrophosphate and tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand etc rastogi et al 2009 they could enhance the stability of iron ions in solution and accelerate the generation of sulfate and sulfate derived radicals in addition the reducing agent such as hydroxylamine ha facilitated the transformation from fe iii to fe ii and enhanced the activation of pms chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 meanwhile the production of iron oxide sludge was also alleviated it is indicated that the stability and recycle of fe iii fe ii would be of significant importance for the generation of so4 radical by pms activation iron based heterogeneous catalysts have also been widely adopted in the process of persulfate activation gao et al 2016 li et al 2018 2019a 2019c liu et al 2016 wu et al 2019 in which the release of fe ii ions still plays a dominant role on the generation of so4 and other derived radicals zero valent iron zvi and iron oxides were loaded onto the kaolinite and carbon supporting materials through a short time of thermal aging and then calcinated at high temperature gao et al 2016 guo et al 2019 these iron based nanocomposite catalysts could improve the degradation of organic pollutants by persulfate activation recently spinel catalysts were popularly adopted for the activation of pms due to the crystalline fe ii in the special structure the fe iii fe ii cycle was initiated through the reaction between fe ii and co existed metal ions co iii cu ii ag i in the crystalline structure of spinel catalysts guan et al 2013 xu et al 2018a b c zhao et al 2019 the efficiency of pms activation was increased by the synergistic cycles of fe ii and co existed metal ions in the crystalline structure of spinel although these active iron species were loaded on the surface of nanocatalysts the release of fe ii and recycle of fe iii fe ii were still not controlled furthermore these active nanocatalysts usually easy to be agglomerated are expensive in cost and complicated in the fabrication procedure clay as the constructive collector of various metal oxides is a kind of natural silicate mineral surface catalytic behaviors of clay minerals have been found to generate free radicals from the slow oxidation of environmentally persistent organic micropollutants jin et al 2019 xu et al 2019 it was contributed to the accelerated transformation of electrons between the adsorbed micropollutants and cationic metal ions cu ii fe iii ni iii etc in the nanoscale interlayers of clay sheets chen et al 2019 jia et al 2018 generally speaking generation of free radicals on clay surfaces is time consumed and recognized as an environmental phenomenon harmful to ecosystem boyd 1985 qin et al 2018 however the method of free radical formation on clay surface would be greatly expected to accelerate the electron transformation between fe iii and pms for the generation of so4 radicals in this work fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt was prepared through a series of cation exchange reactions for the first time the catalytic activity and stability of fe mmt on the pms activation were evaluated in the backgrounds of simulated raw water and river songhua water atrazine frequently detected in raw drinking water and groundwater was selected as the model micropollutant the degradation performance of atrazine through the pms activation by fe mmt was investigated and the kinetic behaviors were also analyzed dominant reactive species were identified by radical quenching experiments and by means of electron spinning resonance esr spectra effects of water matrix components on the removal of various kinds of micropollutants were studied in details 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents natural montmorillonite mmt with particle size of 2

in the experiments was produced by the milli q purification system 2 2 preparation of fe iii saturated montmorillonite firstly 10 g of natural montmorillonite mmt was dispersed into 400 ml of fecl3 6h2o solution 0 1 mol l the cation exchange reaction was conducted for 8 h under the magnetic stirring of 300 rpm and then fe iii exchanged mmt was obtained by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min after that the fe iii exchanged mmt was re dispersed into the fecl3 6h2o solution 0 1 mol l for another three times finally fe iii saturated mmt fe mmt was repeatedly washed and centrifugated 8000 rpm with deionized water until the conductivity of the centrifugated supernatant was less than 10 μs cm the purified fe iii saturated mmt was freeze dried and ground into powders for further experiments 2 3 characterization of fe iii saturated montmorillonite the microstructures of mmt and fe mmt were characterized by scanning electron spectroscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds su8010 hitachi and transmission electron spectroscopy tem jem1400 jeol the interlayer spacing of mmt and fe mmt was characterized by x ray diffractometer xrd d8 advance bruker chemical structure and composition of

size distribution of mmt and fe mmt were tested by the dynamical light scattering analyzer dls nano zs90 marvin 2 4 experimental procedures batch experiments were conducted in a series of 250 ml conical flasks with the magnetic stirring of 500 rpm under 20 0 1 c the reactions were initiated by adding the predetermined amounts of mmt or fe mmt and pms into the aqueous solution 100 ml of micropollutants atz bpa ba bps and smx in the cases of adsorption experiments the reactions were initiated by adding predetermined amounts of mmt or fe mmt into these aqueous solution without pms in the cases of factor experiments the ph values of aqueous solution of atrazine were modulated by adding naoh and hcl 0 01 mol l water matrix components were adjusted by adding inorganic ions such as nacl nahco3 na2so4 and humic acid into the aqueous solution of atrazine samples were collected at specified time intervals and pre filtered by a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size all the samples were quenched by methanol before they were analyzed by hplc and hplc esi ms ms 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of atrazine was determined through the high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2487 at λ 235 nm with mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min the mobile phase contained 0 1 of methanol and acetic acid with the ratio of 60 40 v v sample volume was 100 μl and the retention time of atrazine was 29 2 min the concentrations of bpa ba bps and smx were also identified by hplc in which the detecting wavelength composition of mobile phase and retention time were changed accordingly table s1 the intermediates and degradation products of atrazine were analyzed through hplc esi ms ms in full scale mode hplc esi ms ms analysis was conducted on an agilent 1260 hplc coupled to a sciex qtrap 5500 with esi source in the positive ion mode the injection volume of each sample solution was 20 μl the gradient mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and deionized water

the reaction solution electron spin resonance esr experiments were performed with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo which was used as the spin trapping agent in the esr spectrometer bruker a200 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe iii saturated mmt to demonstrate the success of modification procedure microstructures and chemical composition of montmorillonite mmt before and after fe iii saturation were characterized by sem tem and eds analyses observed from fig 1 a and b mmt possessed obviously stacked structure of lamellar sheets with smooth surfaces while fe iii saturated mmt fe mmt was curled and partially delaminated due to the larger hydration radium of fe iii in the interlayers compared to fig 1 c the existence state of the saturated fe iii ion were further characterized by tem in fig 1 d almost no particles were found in the interlayers of mmt whilst finely spindle like nanoparticles were observed in some parts of the interlayers of fe mmt according to the strong brönsted acid effect these amorphous nanoparticles were the partial hydrolyzed products of dissociation equilibrium of hydrated water molecules around fe iii ions in the interlayers of mmt nanosheets soma and soma 1989 these inserted fe iii and iron hydr oxides co contributed to the intercalation or exfoliation of mmt sheets observed from fig 1 e and f the increased contents of fe and o elements were obtained when the fe iii ion was saturated into the mmt sheets there was almost no eds signal of fe element in mmt while the fe content in fe mmt was improved up to 22 25 normalized by the atomic percentage of si the ratios of fe si and o si in fe mmt were 1 4 and 2 9 larger than the counterparts of mmt 0 and 1 8 these improvements of fe and o amounts further demonstrated the existence of fe iii and iron hydr oxides characteristic peaks of fe in eds were centered at 0 7 kev 6 4 kev and 7 1 kev respectively the inserted fe species with these characteristic peaks were reported to remove tetracycline efficiently by adsorption xu et al 2018a b c interlayer distance between clay sheets is of great importance for the adsorption behavior change of which depends on the d001 spacing characterized by sxrd in fig 2 a the diffraction angle of mmt was only centered at 6 9 and the d001 spacing was 1 26 nm according to the bragg equation similar with our previous report wang et al 2012 after fe iii saturation the diffraction angle became much smaller and divided into 5 6 and 3 0 the d001 spacing was enlarged to 2 91 nm at the most based on the cation exchange reaction with na i ion fe iii ions with larger hydration radium were inserted into the mmt interlayer and pillared up the d001 spacing in addition the iron hydr oxides observed in fig 1 d also enlarged the interlayer distance fig s1 a showed the wide angle x ray diffraction wxrd spectra of mmt and fe mmt the quartz structure of fe mmt was not destroyed although the intensities of characteristic peaks 19 7 and 27 of mmt were weakened however some characteristic peaks of mmt vanished after fe iii saturation due to the enlarged d001 spacing as a result the specific surface area according to the bet curves of n2 adsorption desorption in fig 2 b was improved from 27 9 m2 g of mmt to 38 5 m2 g of fe mmt these bet curves belonged to the iv type isotherm indicating the 2d mesoporous structures of mmt and fe mmt the h3 type of hysteresis loops of isotherms identified the slitting structures of the mesoporous pores in mmt and fe mmt the wide distribution of pore sizes in fig s1 b further showed the existence of inter pores of sheets and intra pores of interlayer in mmt and fe mmt in fig 2 c the less negatively charged property of fe mmt was found in different ph range which was in turn beneficial to the adsorption of micropollutants in water it was attributed to the insertion of fe iii ion and hydrolyzed iron hydr oxides into the mmt interlayer furthermore the small size of fe mmt particles in fig s1 c was the result of the partial exfoliation of mmt wang et al 2012 2013 for the chemical composition ftir results in fig 3 a showed that the bending vibrations of si o al and al2oh were completely kept at 520 cm 1 and 920 cm 1 the co3 stretching vibration of calcite component at 1395 cm 1 vanished in fe mmt representing the structure change of mmt after fe iii saturation the fe o stretching vibration at 470 cm 1 and fe o h bending vibration at 1000 cm 1 were not observed due to the overlapping between the characteristic peaks of iron hydr oxides and intrinsic iron species in the crystalline structure of mmt yuan et al 2008 however shown in fig 3 b the fe 2p signal was observed in the xps results of fe mmt according to the composition percentages iron content in fe mmt was 3 3 times than that counterpart in mmt this increased amount of iron component was contributed by the saturated fe iii species in the fe mmt interlayer the fe species in mmt and fe mmt were analyzed through the resolved results of fe 2p core level in fig 3 c d the fe 2p1 2 peak at 724 7 ev and fe 2p3 2 peak at 710 9 ev accompanying with their satellites were all observed in the xps results of mmt and fe mmt however the intensities of fe species in mmt derived from the intrinsic crystalline iron in fig 3 c were much less than those counterparts in fe mmt there was 94 fe iii ion in the interlayer of fe mmt some iron hydr oxides were also found in fig 3 d it was greatly different from the component of fe iii ion 100 in the crystal structure of mmt which demonstrated the successful fe iii saturation of mmt by cation exchange reaction 3 2 degradation performance of atrazine by fe iii saturated mmt atrazine as a typical pesticide detected in drinking source water was used to evaluate the catalytic capability of pms activators shown in fig 4 a there was almost no removal of atrazine by single pms in 60 min after the addition of mmt with pms 10 9 of atrazine was oxidized which was slightly higher than that by single pms mmt could not effectively activate pms for the degradation of atrazine interestingly fe mmt could obviously catalyze the activation of pms and improved the removal of atrazine with the percentage degradation up to 94 1 in 60 min to differentiate the contribution of adsorption and oxidation the removal efficiency of atrazine by adsorption was represented in fig 4 b at the beginning of 1 min 63 2 of atrazine was removed after the addition of fe mmt while the percentage removal was only 11 8 after the addition of mmt however the percentage degradation of atrazine in 1 min was reduced to 47 5 after the addition of fe mmt with pms in fig 4 a which was less than the single adsorptive removal by fe mmt it indicated that fe mmt had better adsorptive performance of atrazine than that of mmt but pms greatly inhibited the adsorption behavior of atrazine onto fe mmt with the increase of adsorption time the adsorbed atrazine was little released from fe mmt and the removal percentage of atrazine lowered down to 47 7 at the end of 60 min in fig 4 b the phenomenon of atrazine release was attributed to the release of fe iii ion from fe mmt interlayer it was concluded that atrazine was quickly adsorbed onto fe mmt and degraded by the pms activation this was also supported by the highest reaction kinetic constant of fe mmt with pms kobs 0 0361 min 1 in fig 4 c as shown in fig 5 the amount of pms was almost not consumed in fe iii pms system and the fe iii concentration remained the same as the initial amount of 1 mg l pms activation was not initiated by fe iii due to the slow electron transformation from fe iii to pms after the addition of mmt the percentage of pms consumption was only 8 2 in the fe iii mmt pms system the fe iii concentration was also not changed in the reaction time this pms consumption was attributed to the adsorption of mmt and pms could not be activated by fe iii in the presence of mmt differently the amount of pms was continuously consumed in the fe mmt pms system while the concentration of released fe iii increased with the reaction time correspondingly at the end of reaction the fe iii concentration approached up to 0 78 mg l it was believed that pms consumption was attributed to the pms activation by fe mmt accompanying with the release of fe iii it was reported that fe iii inserted into montmorillonite mmt could change the transformation of organic micropollutants in water by the catalytic oxidation in the interlayer surface qin et al 2015 this catalytically oxidative behavior emerged in the transformation and degradation of endocrine disrupting compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and tetracycline etc jia et al 2014 2018 the catalytic oxidation on clay surface was initiated by the electron transformation between fe iii and micropollutants in the nanoscale space of clay sheets even facilitated under simulated sunlight xu et al 2018a b c similarly it was deduced that electron transformation between fe iii and pms in the interlayer of fe mmt could also be accelerated to generate the active fe ii species for the enhancement of pms activation 3 2 1 kinetics of pms activation by fe mmt the observed reaction rate constants kobs of fe mmt were calculated to represent the efficiency of pms activation in fig s2 these activation processes were all pseudo first order kinetic reactions the kobs was not linearly increased with the dosage of pms the highest kobs 0 053 min 1 was obtained at the pms dosage of 0 4 mm differently the atrazine degradation was linearly increased with the decrease of atrazine concentration and the increase of fe mmt dosage these enhancements in the degradation were the synergistic results of immediate adsorption within 1 min and pms activation this phenomenon was also reported in the fenton like catalytic system under iron nanoconfinement yang et al 2019 the role of adsorption on the degradation kinetics of atz was also shown in fig 6 the kobs was significantly decreased when the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe increased from 0 27 μmol g to 1 48 μmol g in fig 6 a this reduction of kobs indicated the competitive activity between atrazine adsorption and pms activation on the active fe iii sites of fe mmt however when the pms dosage increased from 0 05 mm to 0 4 mm the kobs gradually increased at different qe of atrazine adsorption in fig 6 b this increase of kobs demonstrated the fe iii dependent adsorption and degradation processes of atrazine in the nanoscale interlayer of fe mmt the atrazine adsorbed on the fe iii sites was more quickly degraded by the higher dosage of pms and in turn the as occupied fe iii sites were regenerated for the atrazine adsorption and pms activation unfortunately the kobs decreased when the pms dosage increased from 0 4 mm to 1 mm it was attributed to the fe iii release from the interlayers of fe mmt through cation exchange effect the pms dosage was greatly important for the balance of atrazine adsorption and fe iii release 3 2 2 dominant reactive species the generation of radicals in the systems of fe iii mmt and fe mmt were identified by the electron spin resonance esr spectra in fig 7 using dmpo as a typical spin trapping agent typical quadruple peak signals of dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 and sext peak signals of dmpo so4 guo et al 2019 were observed in fig 7 a it demonstrated the generation of both ho and so4 radicals in the fe mmt system containing pms and atrazine the peak intensity of dmpo oh adduct gradually decreased and vanished until the reaction time of 5 min meanwhile the dmpo so4 adduct dominated the species of radicals in the system it confirmed the excellent catalytic ability of fe mmt on pms activation this was different from the fast transformation from dmpo so4 adduct to dmpo oh adduct by nucleophilic substitution zou et al 2013 in fig 7 b these signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were compared with the typical ho radical generated through h2o2 activation by fe ii ion the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh adduct in the system of fe mmt with pms were the same as those of typical ho radical derived from the fenton reaction however no signals of ho and so4 radicals emerged in the fe iii pms system and mmt pms system in fig 7 c as reported fe iii ion in aqueous solution is difficult to be reduced into fe ii ion and in turn limits the activation of pms rastogi et al 2009 the little amount of fe iii in the octahedral structure of mmt fig 3 c is also not able to activate pms it was convincing that fe iii saturated in mmt effectively catalyzed the activation of pms radical quenching experiments were also conducted in fig 8 the degradation efficiency of atrazine was both decreased from 94 1 to 51 9 whenever 10 mm or 100 mm of methanol was added into the fe mmt system with pms this quenching effect of methanol was not observed data shown in fig s3 in the control system of fe mmt without pms due to the single effect of adsorption this result indicated that one of ho or so4 radicals was at least generated in the fe mmt system containing pms and atrazine the contribution of so5 radical was negligible in the system since the methanol was inert to so5 radical zou et al 2013 however the degradation efficiency of atrazine was only decreased from 94 1 to 78 4 when 10 mm of turt butanol tba was added into the fe mmt system in the presence of pms the quenching effect of tba 2000 times of the initial concentration of atrazine was less than the counterpart of methanol due to the high rate constant of tba with ho radical it further demonstrated the existence of ho radical in the system with the increase of tba addition 100 mm the percentage degradation of atrazine was further inhibited down to 47 3 it was attributed to the inhibition of so4 radical in the system by the massive amounts of tba in addition the evolution of ho radical was gradually inhibited with the extension of reaction time and then the so4 radical dominated the active species in the system when the 1 4 dicarboxybenzene was used as the indicator in fig s3 these results demonstrated the co existence of ho and so4 radicals in the oxidation of atrazine by pms in the presence of fe mmt 3 3 effects of water matrix components 3 3 1 influence of ph inorganic ions and humic acids as reported the ph of solution affects the distribution of atrazine species iron precipitation and pms decomposition zou et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 9 a the highest percentage degradation of atrazine by pms in the presence of fe mmt was 94 1 at ph 6 the high concentration of proton at ph 3 consumed the most part of ho and so4 radicals hashikawa and murata 2019 and the degradation of atrazine was decreased to 74 5 the reduction of atrazine degradation at ph 9 was caused by the hydrolysis of fe iii ion in interlayer spaces of fe mmt and the as formed iron hydr oxides occupied the active sites for atrazine adsorption in addition the larger charge negativity of fe mmt at ph 9 in fig 3 c was also not beneficial for hso5 entering the fe mmt interlayers although the reaction rates of atrazine ho radical and atrazine so4 radical were similar in acidic condition the reactivity of ho radical decreased in basic condition and further reduced the percentage degradation of atrazine oppositely at ph 12 pms was further activated by the strong alkaline solution gao et al 2016 as a result almost 100 of atz was degraded in a pseudo first order kinetic reaction in fig 9 b the effect of humic acids on the degradation of atrazine by pms in the presence of fe mmt was negligible due to the relatively less reaction activity between humic acid and so4 radical lutze et al 2015 the saturated fe iii in the interlayer of fe mmt could selectively adsorb atrazine while the humic acids with large molecular weight were repelled away shown in fig s4 due to the selectivity of mesoporous structure of fe mmt in fig 9 c chloride ion greatly accelerated the degradation of atrazine and the percentage degradation quickly approached 100 within 1 min as reported previously so4 radical was capable of oxidizing chloride ion to generate chlorine radical and free chlorine species anipsitakis et al 2006 through the dual effects of chlorine and so4 radicals the chlorinated derivatives of atrazine were formed in the oxidation system by pms in the presence of fe mmt similar phenomenon of the enhanced degradation of micropollutants in the presence of chloride was also observed in the system of fe 0 with pms yang et al 2018 the evolutions of degradation efficiency of atrazine in the presence of hco3 and so4 2 were also provided in fig 9 d and e the percentage degradation of atrazine almost approached 100 within 30 min when 5 mm of nahco3 was added to facilitate the formation of iron hydr oxides with catalytic activity however the higher content of hco3 was apt to scavenging the radicals of ho and so4 due to the high second order rate constant 106 108 m 1s 1 ghauch et al 2017 the generated co3 radical was less active and decreased the degradation efficiency of atrazine in the presence of 10 mm nahco3 in addition so4 2 was generated by the pms decomposition the increase of so4 2 also inhibited the behavior of pms activation the atrazine degradation shown in fig 9 e was slowed down in the presence of na2so4 the degradation of atrazine was dependent on the water matrix during the pms activation by fe mmt except for the effects of humic acids 3 3 2 influence of river songhua water background the results on river songhua water spiked with micropollutants were shown in fig 10 differently the adsorptive removal of atrazine by fe mmt without pms was greatly decreased to 6 9 in fig 10 a it was much less than the adsorptive efficiency 47 7 of atrazine in the background of deionized water in fig 4 b the inorganic ions and dissolved organic matters doc with low molecular weight in river songhua water table s2 would enter the interlayer of fe mmt through cation exchange or adsorption reaction as a result the active sites for atrazine adsorption were occupied after the addition of pms the percentage removal of atrazine by fe mmt increased up to 90 under the comprehensive effects of ph chloride bicarbonate and sulfate in the backgrounds of river water the results indicated that pms activation by fe mmt dominated the degradation efficiency of atrazine in the background of songhua river water in fig 10 b the degradation percentages of ba bpa smx bps in river water by pms in the presence of fe mmt were 96 2 100 100 97 9 respectively the degradation kinetics were dependent on their molecular structures thereof smx was the most easily degradable pharmaceutical pms activation by fe mmt showed excellent ability of oxidation for these micropollutants in the backgrounds of river songhua water it was a selective oxidation process ignoring the effects of doc in the backgrounds of drinking source water 3 4 stability and activity of fe iii saturated mmt catalytic stability and iron release of fe mmt were of significant concerns in the application of drinking water treatment to differentiate the effects of fe mmt adsorption and fe mmt pms oxidation the stabilities of atrazine removal by fe mmt with and without pms were presented in fig 11 a the percentage removal of atrazine was 94 1 in the first run of pms oxidation in the presence of fe mmt after generation from simple freeze drying it was decreased to 84 1 in the second run due to the release of fe iii after that the removal efficiency of atrazine was only reduced by 1 and 4 in the following runs which demonstrated the excellent stability of fe mmt furthermore these reduction amplitudes of percentage degradation were similar with those of different runs in the system of fe mmt adsorption it indicated that the reduction of adsorption effects dominated the stability of fe mmt fig 11 b provided the effects of pms dosage on the release of fe iii and atrazine degradation in the fe mmt system without pms the release of fe iii ion in the 5 μm of atrazine solution was only 0 068 mg l while the percentage removal of atrazine was 47 7 due to the adsorption of fe mmt when the dosage of pms increased from 0 2 mm to 1 mm the release of fe iii ion was linearly aggravated and the largest value was up to 0 783 mg l this dependence of fe iii ion release on the concentration of pms was attributed to the cation exchange effect of potassium ions in pms fortunately the percentage removal of atrazine were always more than 94 the largest removal was 98 4 at the pms dosage of 0 4 mm the corresponding release of fe iii ion was only 0 289 mg l lower than the maximum concentration 0 3 mg l in the standard of drinking water in china it was concluded that the catalytic stability and activity of fe mmt could be modulated by the optimization of pms dosage 3 5 mechanisms of pms activation by fe mmt conventional pms activation by fe ii ion is the result of rapid o o bond fracture through electron transferring from fe ii ion to pms however the process of pms activation would be quickly terminated once the fe ii ion is completely oxidized to fe iii ion zou et al 2013 fe iii ion was difficult to be reduced by pms due to the great difficulty of opposite electron transferring from pms to fe o bond the lower redox potential efe iii fe ii 0 77 v is an importantly limited factor for the pms activation by fe iii ion recycling between fe ii and fe iii was reported to be a sustainable measurement for the high efficient activation of pms the saturated fe iii ion in fe mmt was reported to accelerate the transformation of electron from the diffused in micropollutants to fe iii ion in the nanoscale interlayers qin et al 2015 the transformation of micropollutants was dependent on the molecular ionization potential and clay surface property jia et al 2014 this confined transformation of electron in the interlayers would accelerate the reduction of fe iii by pms the decomposition and activation of pms was initiated in the interlayers of fe mmt as described in the following equations 1 4 1 f e i i i h s o 5 f e i i s o 5 h 2 f e i i h s o 5 f e i i i s o 4 o h 3 f e i i h s o 5 f e i i i s o 4 2 o h 4 f e i i i o h h s o 5 f e i i i o h s o 4 o h 5 f e i i i o h s o 4 h s o 5 f e i i o o s o 3 s o 5 h 6 f e i i o o s o 3 h 2 o f e i i i o h s o 4 o h 7 s o 4 o h o h s o 4 2 8 s o 4 o h a t z b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o due to the cation exchange effect pms was easily exchanged into the interlayer of fe mmt and the complexity of fe iii pms was formed consequently the opposite transformation of electron from pms to fe o bond was accelerated in the nanoscale interlayer 2 91 nm shown in fig 2 and the reaction of equation 1 occurred this electron transformation was beneficial for the in situ recycling of fe iii fe ii which was responsible for the pms activation in the confined interlayers of fe mmt the reactions of equations 2 3 guaranteed the decomposition of pms to generate radicals of so4 and oh simultaneously in addition the iron hydr oxides were in situ formed during the saturation process although which were the little part of fe iii species in the interlayers of fe mmt surface electron transformation of iron hydr oxides was responsible for the pms activation pms was first coordinated with iron hydr oxides on the surface and decomposed to generate so5 equation 4 while fe iii was reduced into fe ii in the coordinated complexity of fe ii and pms equation 5 the so4 radical was released from the fe ii pms complexity part of which reacted with oh to generate oh radicals equations 6 7 finally the atrazine diffusing into the interlayers of fe mmt was degraded by the synergistical oxidation of so4 and oh radicals through equation 8 reaction 3 6 analysis of degradation pathway and intermediate products it was demonstrated that so4 and oh radicals were both primary active species for the degradation of atrazine the intermediate products of atrazine degradation by pms oxidation were detected and identified through lc ms ms analysis table s3 degradation of atrazine by so4 and oh radicals mainly experienced processes of dealkylation alkylic hydroxylation alkylic oxidation and dichlorination hydroxylation xu et al 2018a b c the so4 radical reacted with the alkylic groups of atrazine through h abstraction atrazine desethyl dea and atrazine desisopropyl dia were sequentially obtained due to the larger steric hindrance of isopropyl group the so4 radical further reacted with dea and dia to generate atrazine desethyl desisopropyl dedia direct hydroxylation of the isopropyl chain was observed through oh attack the formed hydroxyl in the isopropyl chain was then oxidized to carbonyl group followed by the dealkylation reactions in addition dechlorination was also an important pathway to replace the chlorine group in atrazine finally the oxidized products with low molecular weight were obtained 4 conclusions fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe mmt showed high activity and stability during the process of pms activation for atrazine removal it was the synergistic result of quick adsorption and catalytic oxidation of fe mmt pms activation by fe mmt was most effective at ph 6 the release of fe iii ion could meet the need of drinking water standard through the modulation of pms dosage the so4 and oh radicals were the primary active species for the degradation of atrazine the dealkylated and hydroxylated intermediates were finally converted to oxidized products with low molecular weight the accelerated redox cycle of fe iii fe ii in the interlayer of fe mmt was mainly responsible for the pms activation and the in situ formation of iron hydr oxides on the interlayer surface also facilitated the activation process of pms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17827,recent reports and experimental data closely indicate that bed sediment entrainment by debris flows strongly impacts the evolution of the topographic signature of a valley however it is difficult to constrain the physics of the entrainment process in numerical models the challenge is deeply embedded in the shape of the velocity profile whose knowledge is fundamental for estimating debris flow basal shear stress exerting on bed sediment most two dimensional models are restricted because the depth integrated shallow water assumption is problematic in this aspect one alternative is to combine a three dimensional particle based numerical model with a progressive entrainment law in this paper we propose a three dimensional surface cell sc based smooth particle hydrodynamics sph model for simulating bed sediment entrainment by viscous debris flows the dynamic behavior of a debris flow is simulated by the open source dualsphysics scheme into which the herschel bulkley papanastasiou hbp rheology model is incorporated subsequently the bed surface is meshed over which the particles belonging to a certain cell at each time step are identified to represent the basal velocity and flow depth using a novel sc based algorithm with the extracted velocities of these basal particles the sediment entrainment rate of each cell can be estimated using the optimized progressive entrainment law the proposed sc hbp sph method is tested by means of a full scale flume experiment carried out in a previous study the results show that the proposed model can adequately describe and reproduce the complex dynamic process of bed sediment entrainment by overriding debris flows graphical abstract image 1 keywords debris flow bed sediment entrainment sph simulation surface cell based algorithm integrated method 1 introduction debris flows which are mobilized mixtures of water and sediment in mountainous areas constitute a severe natural hazard for local society marchetti et al 2019 as indicated by reid et al 2016 the extension of the inundated area and deposit height in a debris flow event is closely connected with its volume however the probable volume of a debris flow event is usually much less predictable than that of an event such as a landslide or a rockfall which are more common evidence suggests that bed sediment entrainment is among the most important features in debris flows dynamics godt and coe 2007 breien et al 2008 han et al 2015a gregoretti et al 2019 generally owing to the inclusion of soil sediment and trees uprooted from the ground surface bed entrainment causes a dramatic increase in the volume gregoretti et al 2018 pudasaini and fishcer 2016a and therefore exerts a strong socioeconomic impact thiene et al 2017 chen et al 2019 nevertheless for many years debris flow research has suffered from a lack of consideration concerning bed entrainment processes as a consequence the volumes of debris flows are commonly underestimated resulting in the failure of implemented countermeasures the last two decades have seen a growing trend in research on the entrainment of bed sediment by debris flows many studies have been conducted to explore the governing factors and mechanisms responsible for entrainment processes according to in situ and laboratory experiments remarkable examples include the works of mangeney et al 2010 iverson et al 2011 berger et al 2011 and mccoy et al 2012 however given that very few observations are available to constrain these models the debate regarding the best model for reproducing the entrainment processes induced by overriding debris flows continues unabated entrainment rates are important for a wide range of geomorphological processes particularly for creating and maintaining the morphology of valleys the entrainment rate describes the instantaneous capability of an overriding flow to erode the bed surface over a unit of time previous studies have proposed a variety of empirical or theoretical approaches for calculating the entrainment rate these approaches can be majorly classified into three categories i e the physic based mechanic approaches considering the difference between the shear stress exerted by flow mass and basal resistance force e g medina et al 2008 iverson 2012 han et al 2015b ouyang et al 2015 han et al 2018 the transport capacity approaches based on the assumption that sediment concentration adapts to uniform flow condition with the local values of flow depth h and velocity v e g armanini et al 2009 and the empirical approach where entrainment rate e depends on the flow depth flow velocity sediment concentration and empirically calibrated coefficients e g mcdougall and hungr 2005 hungr et al 2005 christen et al 2010 frank et al 2015 gregoretti et al 2019 the abovementioned entrainment laws provide alternative solutions for estimating progressive bed sediment entrainment and can therefore be implemented in time elapsed numerical simulations e g hungr et al 2005 mangeney et al 2007 beguería et al 2009 christen et al 2010 pudasaini 2012 kafle et al 2016 mergili et al 2018 in fact most of these numerical models are based on eulerian descriptions in two dimensions these models use the finite volume method or the finite difference method to solve the navier stokes equations under the shallow water assumption thereby obtaining the debris flow flux for each cell over complex three dimensional topography nevertheless although two dimensional numerical models can conveniently incorporate these entrainment laws such solutions are unsatisfactory due to their depth integrated simplifications indicating that only the velocity averaged through the mass depth can be exported from the numerical simulation for a physics based entrainment law rather than the average velocity the basal velocity of the overriding mass is required consequently as a compromise assumed flow velocity profiles particularly linear profiles must be introduced to estimate the entrainment rate in the numerical model iverson 2012 han et al 2015b although some recent studies neglect the observed nonlinear complicated two phase behavior with depth e g domnik and pudasaini 2012 domnik et al 2013 to date little agreement has been reached and sparse data have been published regarding the quantitative analysis of the debris flow basal velocity recently three dimensional particle based numerical models e g the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method with the mature computational package dualsphysics crespo et al 2011 2015 have grown in importance with regard to the numerical modeling of fluid type phenomena pirulli and pastor 2012 pastor et al 2014 wang et al 2016 rahman and konagai 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 han et al 2019 one major advantage of the sph method is with respect to the ability of attaining velocity profile owing to that debris flow mass are treated as a set of discretized particles whose behavior can be described by directly solving the navier stokes equation without the depth integrated shallow water assumption there is a growing body of literatures that devotes to incorporate entrainment laws into the quasi 3d coupled sph schemes with different rheology models such as dan dan3d mcdougall and hungr 2005 hungr and mcdougall 2009 and geoflow sph pastor et al 2009 cuomo et al 2016 these former contributions attained continuing concern and laid a solid foundation for simulating entrainment process by debris flows based on sph schemes the purpose of this paper is to propose a three dimensional surface cell sc based sph numerical model for simulating bed sediment entrainment processes by viscous type debris flow the proposed model introduces a previous progressive entrainment model han et al 2015b 2018 into a sph numerical scheme for debris flows han et al 2019 by means of a novel sc based algorithm furthermore an analysis of a case study is presented to demonstrate and verify the capability of the proposed numerical model 2 the progressive entrainment model the debris flow entrainment process can be described through the entrainment rate as mentioned above a variety of studies have effectively established empirical methods to quantify the entrainment rate however the empirical laws ignore the physical mechanism of the entrainment process and thus many uncertainties remain for example a systematic understanding of how the sediment soil strength contributes to the entrainment rate is still lacking additionally the estimated entrainment rates increase linearly with respect to the empirically calibrated coefficient the rational value of which is currently debated unfortunately these problems within the empirical entrainment law have received scant attention hence physics based hydrodynamic models which must satisfy the boundary momentum jump condition ouyang et al 2015 constitute a continuing concern within research on debris flow entrainment a better understanding of the factors governing entrainment processes is instrumental for further analysis our previous study han et al 2015a summarized four dominant factors that play a crucial role in the entrainment process the topography of the subreach soil strength of the bed sediment magnitude and flow dynamics and recharge rate and sediment availability of the gully considering these dominant factors a physics based entrainment model was incorporated in the two dimensional depth integrated numerical model presented in our previous paper han et al 2015b following the basic assumptions of iverson 2012 this entrainment model can be commonly generalized into two layers namely a debris flow layer and a bed sediment layer as shown in fig 1 in the two layer model shown in fig 1 the momentum exchange between the debris flow mass and the bed sediment following the law of the conservation of momentum can be reduced to 1 e τ 1 b o t τ 2 t o p ρ v 1 b o t v 2 t o p where e is the entrainment rate of bed sediment ρ represents the density of the debris flow mass τ 1 b o t is the basal shear stress τ 2 t o p is the boundary resistance exerted by the bed sediment and v 1 b o t and v 2 t o p are the boundary velocities for the debris flow mass layer and bed sediment layer respectively eq 1 implies that an actively eroding bed exerts less shear resistance than a bed in the absence of entrainment which satisfies the jump condition of boundary shear traction presented by iverson and ouyang 2015 in eq 1 the terms τ 1 b o t and τ 2 t o p obey the mohr coulomb criterion expressed as 2a τ 1 b o t δ σ t a n ϕ d c 2b τ 2 t o p δ σ δ p w t a n ϕ b e d c where δ σ represents the increment in the undrained loading triggered by the overriding debris flow and can be calculated by ρ g h c o s θ c is the cohesion strength and t a n ϕ d is the bulk basal friction angle of the debris flow mass as introduced by hungr and mcdougall 2009 δ p w is the pore pressure response of the bed sediment and can be quantitatively analyzed by 3 δ p w b d δ σ a d δ τ where b d and a d are the pore pressure coefficients because undrained loading triggers mainly high pore pressures instead of shear deformation in saturated sediment iverson et al 2011 the a d δ τ term is negligible and thus the ratio b d controls the pore pressure response considering the complicated evolution of the pore pressure a simplified constant pore pressure ratio b d has commonly been used for dry granular flows and natural flows in previous studies medina et al 2008 luna et al 2012 ouyang et al 2015 with a suggested range between 0 5 and 0 8 however the adoption of this typical range sometimes leads to predicted e values that are an order of magnitude greater than the measured value iverson et al 2011 this could be explained in part by the fact that a high pore pressure response of bed sediment is not maintained throughout the entire debris flow process indicating that the evolution of the pore pressure should be taken into account in our previous studies han et al 2015b 2018 the pore pressure response was supposed to be the result of an instantaneous variation in b d which depends on the loading status on the bed sediment in the loading state h t 0 the pore pressure increases leading to a greater value of b d that is expressed as 4 b d r a n d o m b d b d m a x in contrast when the bed sediment is unloaded h t 0 the pore pressure dissipates in this case b d can be expressed as 5 b d r a n d o m b d m i n b d where b d m i n and b d m a x are the manipulated minimum and maximum pore pressure ratios respectively of the bed sediment with suggested values of 0 8 b d and 1 2 b d the top surface of bed sediment should be static prior to entrainment which indicates that v 2 t o p 0 incorporating eq 2 and eq 3 eq 1 becomes 6 e g h c o s θ t a n ϕ d 1 b d t a n ϕ b e d v 1 b o t where h denotes the flow depth and θ is the slope angle eq 6 indicates that e decreases as the basal velocity v 1 b o t increases contradicting the conventional wisdom that increasing flow velocity generally enhances the capacity for entrainment similar trend of e 1 v 1 b o t is also observed in some former entrainment models e g medina et al 2008 ouyang et al 2015 this conflict has been previously discussed by iverson 2012 that differing from the near equilibrium fluvial system the momentum of the flow mass should respond to sediment entrainment and evolve in the entrainment process one crucial and debated issue in eq 6 concerns the recognition of the debris flow basal velocity v 1 b o t on the bed surface determining this value remains a challenge among the scientific community the linear velocity profile that observed by lanzoni et al 2017 benefits to extract the basal velocity v 1 b o t in our previous studies han et al 2018 we employed a similar linear velocity profile and set v 1 b o t equal to 1 s 1 v m e a n where v m e a n denotes the velocity averaged through the depth and s 1 is a fitting parameter ranging from 0 to 1 fig 2 a however an examination of the experimental data reported by egashira et al 1989 and hotta and ohta 2000 in fig 2a and b reveals a disparity when applying the linear profile in eq 6 although the suggested value of s 1 0 5 generates the best fitting velocity profiles in both groups of data han et al 2015c the basal velocity is somewhat inaccurate this error poses a significant influence when estimating the entrainment rate because e is inversely proportional to v 1 b o t in eq 6 for instance the measured basal velocity in fig 2b approximates 0 35 m s however the basal velocity estimated by the linear profile s 1 0 5 could reach 0 45 m s leading to a decrease in e of 28 58 in this sense the knowledge on the shape of the velocity profile is fundamental for estimating debris flow basal shear stress exerting on bed sediment however most two dimensional numerical models are quasi 3d depth integrated which neglect the vertical dynamic behavior of debris flow under shallow water assumption e g hungr and mcdougall 2009 ouyang et al 2015 the inherent restriction of two dimensional numerical models indicates that the flow velocity is assumed constant with depth thereby the abovementioned linear velocity profile should be adopted to extract the basal velocity for estimating the entrainment rate e g han et al 2015b in this sense the simulated entrainment process is rather sensitive to the fitting parameter s 1 in velocity profile law in order to avoid the error introduced by the linear profile when estimating the basal velocity in the following section we choose a three dimensional sph method to simulate the debris flow process this three dimensional simulation benefits the recognition of the basal velocity in a rigorous way 3 hbp based sph model in sph scheme the continuum and the incompressible debris flow mass are treated as a set of discretized particles whose behavior can be described by solving the navier stokes equation providing a solution to recognize the basal velocity just above the bed surface to simulate the dynamic behavior of a debris flow an sph method that incorporates the herschel bulkley papanastasiou rheology model i e hbp sph model is implemented in this paper the fundamentals of the sph method and hbp rheology model have been described in detail in our recent work wang et al 2016 han et al 2019 assuming that a debris flow mass is an incompressible fluid the propagation of a debris flow can be effectively described by the navier stokes equations which consist of a mass continuity equation and a momentum conservation equation these equations can be expressed in the following lagrangian form

describing debris flow dynamics takahashi 2007 and stancanelli et al 2015 classified debris flows into two major kinds i e the quasi static debris flows in which coulomb friction stress dominates and dynamic debris flows including stony type and viscous type in our study we focus on the viscous type in which viscous stress dominates to calculate the viscous shear stress the hbp rheology model is adopted in the proposed method han et al 2019 in the hbp rheology model the shear stress tensor can be expressed as 10 τ α β 2 μ eff ε α β 11 ε α β 1 2 v α x β v β x α 12 μ eff k γ n 1 τ y 2 γ 1 e m γ

nonlinear rheological behavior of a debris flow e g the shear thickening and shear thinning phenomena observed in the experiments by jon and thomas 1992 and jeffrey et al 2001 respectively with a

2011 2015 which is robust for simulating newtonian fluids such as floods and water flows the capability of the proposed hbp sph model was tested in our recent study by considering a dam break experiment and a case study of the 2010 yohutagawa debris flow event in japan the results demonstrate that this hbp sph model can successfully describe the dynamic behavior of a debris flow to take sediment entrainment into account in the hbp sph model we propose a novel sc based algorithm to mesh the complex relief of the bed surface and precisely identify the particles and their dynamic variables close to the bed surface 4 sc based algorithm the dynamic entrainment law mentioned in section 2 provides a solution to estimate the time elapsed process of bed sediment erosion this physics based law requires two key variables namely the basal velocity v 1 b o t and flow depth h which describe the dynamic behavior of a debris flow these physical variables can be numerically solved by the hbp sph method as presented in section 3 to simulate the entrainment process the sc based algorithm illustrated in fig 3 is proposed 4 1 bed surface reproduction we first reproduce the complex relief of the bed surface by a series of regular cells i e the so called scs with a constant size of δ l in both the x direction and the y direction the format of these scs is in accordance with the raster data of the digital terrain model dtm in most geographic information system gis environments thereby the scs are compatible with the grid of the dtm θ x and θ y represent the slopes along the x and y directions respectively between the topography and the horizontal plane the entrainment rate e of each cell are separately estimated 4 2 coordinate system transformation the dynamic entrainment law is constructed in a topography linked coordinate system while the physical variables of the particles in the sph scheme are described by absolute coordinates hence a coordinate transformation should be implemented prior to estimating the entrainment rate we use the following formula to transform the absolute coordinate system x y z in the sph scheme to the topography linked coordinate system x y z 16a x y z r θ x r θ y r θ z x y z x c e l l y c e l l z c e l l where 16b r θ x cos θ x 0 sin θ x 0 1 0 sin θ x 0 cos θ x 16c r θ y 1 0 0 0 cos θ y sin θ y 0 sin θ y cos θ y 16d r θ z 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 4 3 particle filtering subsequently the sph particles representing the debris flow mass are filtered into different cells based on their transformed coordinates the ceil function rounds the inputs to the nearest integers in the direction of positive infinity or sets them equal to themselves it is adopted to determine the position of the cell that the sph particles belonging to the filtering operation can be expressed as follows 17a r o w c e i l x δ l 17b c o l c e i l y δ l 17c p a r t c l e x y c e l l r o w c o l where x y denotes the transformed coordinate of an sph particle and r o w c o l identifies the sc indicating the cell to which the particle for further clarification a schematic diagram is shown in fig 4 in which the transformed coordinate of the sph particle is 1 7 1 2 the size of the sc is defined as 0 5 m and the sc is identified by row ceil 1 7 0 5 ceil 3 4 4 col ceil 1 2 0 5 3 accordingly this particle should be classified into the cell 4 3 marked by the red line in fig 4 4 4 physical variable representation after particle filtering the key physical variables namely the flow depth h and basal velocity of the debris flow v 1 b o t and the pore pressure ratio b d of the selected cell can be represented by considering the dynamics of the particles belonging to that cell the so called cell linked particles we use the maximum z value of the cell linked particles and the velocity of the particle with the minimum z value to represent the flow depth h and basal velocity v 1 b o t of the corresponding cell respectively which can be expressed as follows 18a h c e l l i j m a x z 1 z 2 z n 18b v 1 b o t c e l l i j v m x 2 v m y 2 z m m i n z 1 z 2 z n the pore pressure coefficient b d is related to the variation in flow depth depending on the loading status of the bed sediment h t 0 or h t 0 in our previous study han et al 2015b the loading status of the bed sediment was ascertained by comparing the depth variation in the debris flow mass between neighboring time steps t and t δ t in this paper we provide a new method that better fits the particle features in the sph scheme to determine the loading status this approach employs the summation of the particles velocities in the z direction i 1 n v i z to reflect the depth variation as well as the loading status 19a i 1 n v i z 0 h t 0 19b i 1 n v i z 0 h t 0 accordingly the instantaneous variation in the pore pressure ratio b d can be estimated using the random functions in eq 4 and eq 5 4 5 entrainment implementation in addition to the flow depth h basal velocity v 1 b o t and pore pressure ratio b d the dynamic entrainment law in eq 6 requires to identifying the slope θ of the bed sediment along the debris flow propagation route however unlike two dimensional and mesh based simulations that involve only the x and y directions particles in the three dimensional sph scheme exhibit complicated flow directions to determine the adequate slope θ towards the particles direction the velocity vector of the cell linked particles and the cell relief should be comprehensively considered we propose a directional derivative method in this paper as shown in fig 5 the relief in an sc can be approximatively represented by a plane z f x y the partial derivative of z is expressed as 20a z x t a n θ x 20b z y t a n θ y a direction vector v div is defined to generalize the macroscopic motion tendency of the particles in this cell 21 v div i 1 n v i x i 1 n v i y where i is the identifier of the particle and n is the number of particles linked to this cell by normalization the angles between the direction vector v div and the x axis α and the y axis β can be obtained 22a c o s α c o s β i 1 n v i x v div i 1 n v i y v div where 22b v div i 1 n v i x 2 i 1 n v i x 2 in such way the slope θ that linked to the direction vector v div can be finally calculated by 23 θ arctan t a n θ x c o s α t a n θ y c o s β incorporating eq 23 and eq 18 into eq 6 the instantaneous entrainment rate e can be calculated and the development of erosion depth d s c in the debris flow process can be determined using the following equation 24 d s c 0 d s c t t d t t 0 e δ t the main processes composing the integrated method presented above for the dynamic simulation of debris flows and the estimation of entrainment rates are illustrated in fig 6 5 case study to illustrate its performance the proposed method is applied to a case study of the full scale flume experiment conducted by the united states geological survey usgs iverson et al 2011 the configuration of this flume experiment is shown in fig 7 in the experiment the straight concrete channel was 95 m in length and 2 m in width and the channel was inclined at an angle of 31 from the horizontal the bottom of the flume was covered with a 12 cm thick 47 m long tabular layer of sediment the water content of the sediment layer and the mudflow mass were manipulated at a proportion of 0 25 at the top of the flume the debris flow mass with a volume of 6 m3 was released from a triangular prism gate area to record the instantaneous variations in the flow depth and entrainment rate a laser sensor an erosion sensor and a pore pressure sensor were fixed at the measurement point which was established at x 32 m as marked in red in fig 7 the velocity distribution and development of the entrainment process were retrospectively analyzed using the semiempirical approach employed in our previous study han et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 the flume is treated as a boundary that consists of fixed particles and the debris flow mass in the gate area is also discretized into a large number of particles the initial particle distance in this case is adjusted to be 0 05 m accordingly 316 471 boundary particles and 43 258 fluid particles are generated a cell size of 0 2 m is set to mesh the flume into regular scs the influencing parameters in the dynamic simulation are listed in table 1 fig 9 presents the time elapsed simulation results of the dynamic behavior of the debris flow mass in the usgs flume experiment the results demonstrate that it takes approximately 10 s to travel 95 m along the flume with an average velocity of 9 5 m s given the key role of the mass velocity in estimating the entrainment process it is necessary to further verify the accuracy of the reproduced velocity in the numerical simulation regretfully detailed information regarding the variation in the mass velocity is not available in iverson et al 2011 as such to verify the accuracy of the velocity simulation we use an indirect method of comparing the time series of the simulated debris flow front positions with the experimental data that available in iverson et al 2011 the results of this comparison are presented in detail in fig 10 demonstrating that the propagation of the front in the numerical simulation nearly approximates the propagation in the experimental data well particularly along the entrainment section implying that the overall velocity of the debris flow mass in the numerical simulation is in good accordance with that in the experiment to verify the accuracy of the flow depth in numerical simulation we use the experimental data recorded at the measurement point x 32 m the results of the comparison between the simulated flow depths and experimental measurements are shown in fig 11 based on the dynamic variable representation from the sph simulation results the entrainment is subsequently estimated by using the sc method as mentioned in section 4 the key parameters of the entrainment calculation are listed in table 2 the key parameter namely the pore pressure ratio b d was not clearly given in the original experiment in our study we treat this ratio as the main parameter to be adjusted in the simulation and use a trial and error method to adjust it and obtain its best fitting value details are described in the discussion the best fitting value is subsequently determined to be 0 93 which is reasonable because the bed sediment was not completely saturated iverson et al 2011 it is worth mentioning that manipulating the pore pressure ratio b d will not significantly increase the consumption of computational resources because the sph simulation of debris flow behavior and the estimation of the entrainment process are implemented separately a plot of the estimated entrainment versus time is presented in fig 12 where the blue line represents the numerically simulated erosion depth and the red line refers to the experimental data the erosion depth at the measurement point x 32 m reaches 0 081 m after the debris flow mass passes this theoretically computed entrainment shows good agreement with the experimental data in which an entrainment depth of approximately 0 079 m was recorded nevertheless as indicated in fig 12 the experimental data reveal a greater entrainment rate than our simulation this discrepancy could be explained by the phase separation model proposed by pudasaini and fischer 2016b the debris flow front surge is dominated by solids which results in a mechanically stronger front and leads to a greater entrainment depth pudasaini and fischer 2016a however such an effect due to the separation of phases within the debris flow cannot be considered in the proposed method another highlight of this study is that the spatial distributions of the erosion depth flow depth and sediment surface velocity at different instants e g t 5 0 s 10 0 s 15 0 s and 20 0 s can be obtained by using the proposed method the results are illustrated in fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 momentum growth of debris flow triggered by entrainment process several studies have substantiated the significant role of entrainment process which provides positive feedback to increase the momentum of debris flow and its dynamic behavior iverson et al 2011 in two dimensional depth integrated models disagreement exists on whether boundary flux terms related to momentum growth should appear in the momentum conservation equations a recent study by iverson and ouyang 2015 concluded that three jump conditions provided a criterion for this issue in the case of the three dimensional sph based model this situation is much more complex ideally momentum growth due to sediment entrainment should be considered in the sph simulation of the debris flow process however in this study to reduce the computational complexity a compromise has been made such that the positive feedback on the debris flow momentum due to entrainment is not taken into account in this sense the additional term due to the entrainment in the momentum conservation equation is ignored in this study and the strong phase separation in debris flows is not thoroughly considered the effects of this limitation require further investigation 6 2 manipulation of the pore pressure ratio b d and the sc size δ l as discussed in our previous studies the estimated entrainment rate is rather sensitive to the pore pressure ratio b d nevertheless the value of b d is sometimes difficult to determine in the proposed method a trial and error method is used to calibrate the results and a best fitting value of 0 93 is suggested for different cases calibrations and comprehensive tests are essential in addition a random algorithm is incorporated into the proposed method to reflect rapid changes in the pore pressure within the bed sediment as these variations influence the entrainment rate although this method is effective and simplifies the complex variation process of the pore pressure it still lacks a physical foundation and is not reliable in addition we notice that the selection of the sc size δ l has a considerable influence on the estimated entrainment rate as shown in fig 14 a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact of the choice of δ l three different cell sizes i e 0 5 m 0 2 m and 0 1 m are adopted in fig 14a the pore pressure ratio b d remains constant b d 0 93 the results show that a larger cell size δ l generally attains a greater estimated entrainment rate this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that a relatively large cell linked flow depth under a small cell size condition can compensate for the smaller depths of the neighboring cells and represent the flow depth of the greater domain under a large cell size condition which might cause the erosion depth to become overestimated as shown in fig 14b the values of b d and δ l are comprehensively adjusted to obtain the best fitting results the combination of δ l 0 2 m and b d 0 93 generates the best fit with the experimental data in this study we recommend a preliminary and empirical criterion for determining the cell size such that δ l 4 0 10 0 d p where d p represents the initial sph particle distance however rigorous criteria for selecting the values of b d and δ l need to be evaluated further 6 3 overestimation of the flow depth a flow depth representation is critical for calculating the entrainment rate as described in section 4 the flow depth of a sc is equivalently replaced by the maximum z value of the particles belonging to the cell this approach is valid in most cases but might be challenged in some cases exhibiting extremely large deformation such as spattering surging and propagating over complex topography this problem is illustrated in detail in fig 15 a which demonstrates that the presented method might overestimate the height of the debris flow in a cell we are currently working on an enhanced statistical method to address this issue as shown in fig 15b in this method the frequency distribution histogram of particle heights is analyzed and a threshold is artificially selected to divide the area of the histogram into two parts subsequently the abscissa corresponding to the threshold can be determined to be the flow depth of the cell this threshold value can be regarded as an eigenvalue used to describe the height distribution of cell linked particles for example a threshold of 0 95 with a corresponding abscissa of 0 5 m denotes 95 of the particle heights below 0 5 m and thus the value of 0 5 m is used to represent the flow depth of this cell although this procedure increases the computational complexity it will benefit the rational representation of the flow depth improvements and further evaluations of this issue are ongoing 7 conclusion in this paper a three dimensional sc hbp sph method is proposed to model the occurrence of bed sediment entrainment by viscous type debris flow two pivotal issues are addressed regarding the simulation of the dynamic behavior of a debris flow and the representation of the physical variables in an improved bed sediment entrainment law the debris flow dynamic behavior is simulated by the open source dualsphysics scheme into which the hbp rheology model for viscous type debris flow is incorporated to implement the sediment entrainment we improve a previous physics based law for instantaneous entrainment rates and propose a novel sc based algorithm to extract the key physical variables from the particle based time elapsed sph simulation results the surface of the bed sediment is meshed and the particles belonging to a certain cell at each time step are identified to represent the basal velocity and flow depth of the sediment compared with the commonly used linear velocity profile in two dimensional depth integrated models the basal velocity evaluated by the sc sph method avoids any empirical coefficient that controls the velocity profile and therefore the proposed method is more rigorous in defining the momentum exchange between the overriding mass and bed sediment the method presented herein has been verified by a full scale debris flow flume experiment the simulation results reproduce the experimental measurements well demonstrating the capability and performance of the proposed method for estimating the entrainment process sensitivity analyses further show that the presented method is substantially sensitive to the pore pressure ratio and the configured cell size both of which require careful manipulation or trial and error adjustment the presented sc hbp sph method is currently challenged by the consideration of positive feedback from the sediment bed entrainment process to the momentum growth of the debris flow as well as the uncertainties in the debris flow hydrography due to strong phase separation efforts addressing such limitations will constitute future research towards improving the

17827,recent reports and experimental data closely indicate that bed sediment entrainment by debris flows strongly impacts the evolution of the topographic signature of a valley however it is difficult to constrain the physics of the entrainment process in numerical models the challenge is deeply embedded in the shape of the velocity profile whose knowledge is fundamental for estimating debris flow basal shear stress exerting on bed sediment most two dimensional models are restricted because the depth integrated shallow water assumption is problematic in this aspect one alternative is to combine a three dimensional particle based numerical model with a progressive entrainment law in this paper we propose a three dimensional surface cell sc based smooth particle hydrodynamics sph model for simulating bed sediment entrainment by viscous debris flows the dynamic behavior of a debris flow is simulated by the open source dualsphysics scheme into which the herschel bulkley papanastasiou hbp rheology model is incorporated subsequently the bed surface is meshed over which the particles belonging to a certain cell at each time step are identified to represent the basal velocity and flow depth using a novel sc based algorithm with the extracted velocities of these basal particles the sediment entrainment rate of each cell can be estimated using the optimized progressive entrainment law the proposed sc hbp sph method is tested by means of a full scale flume experiment carried out in a previous study the results show that the proposed model can adequately describe and reproduce the complex dynamic process of bed sediment entrainment by overriding debris flows graphical abstract image 1 keywords debris flow bed sediment entrainment sph simulation surface cell based algorithm integrated method 1 introduction debris flows which are mobilized mixtures of water and sediment in mountainous areas constitute a severe natural hazard for local society marchetti et al 2019 as indicated by reid et al 2016 the extension of the inundated area and deposit height in a debris flow event is closely connected with its volume however the probable volume of a debris flow event is usually much less predictable than that of an event such as a landslide or a rockfall which are more common evidence suggests that bed sediment entrainment is among the most important features in debris flows dynamics godt and coe 2007 breien et al 2008 han et al 2015a gregoretti et al 2019 generally owing to the inclusion of soil sediment and trees uprooted from the ground surface bed entrainment causes a dramatic increase in the volume gregoretti et al 2018 pudasaini and fishcer 2016a and therefore exerts a strong socioeconomic impact thiene et al 2017 chen et al 2019 nevertheless for many years debris flow research has suffered from a lack of consideration concerning bed entrainment processes as a consequence the volumes of debris flows are commonly underestimated resulting in the failure of implemented countermeasures the last two decades have seen a growing trend in research on the entrainment of bed sediment by debris flows many studies have been conducted to explore the governing factors and mechanisms responsible for entrainment processes according to in situ and laboratory experiments remarkable examples include the works of mangeney et al 2010 iverson et al 2011 berger et al 2011 and mccoy et al 2012 however given that very few observations are available to constrain these models the debate regarding the best model for reproducing the entrainment processes induced by overriding debris flows continues unabated entrainment rates are important for a wide range of geomorphological processes particularly for creating and maintaining the morphology of valleys the entrainment rate describes the instantaneous capability of an overriding flow to erode the bed surface over a unit of time previous studies have proposed a variety of empirical or theoretical approaches for calculating the entrainment rate these approaches can be majorly classified into three categories i e the physic based mechanic approaches considering the difference between the shear stress exerted by flow mass and basal resistance force e g medina et al 2008 iverson 2012 han et al 2015b ouyang et al 2015 han et al 2018 the transport capacity approaches based on the assumption that sediment concentration adapts to uniform flow condition with the local values of flow depth h and velocity v e g armanini et al 2009 and the empirical approach where entrainment rate e depends on the flow depth flow velocity sediment concentration and empirically calibrated coefficients e g mcdougall and hungr 2005 hungr et al 2005 christen et al 2010 frank et al 2015 gregoretti et al 2019 the abovementioned entrainment laws provide alternative solutions for estimating progressive bed sediment entrainment and can therefore be implemented in time elapsed numerical simulations e g hungr et al 2005 mangeney et al 2007 beguería et al 2009 christen et al 2010 pudasaini 2012 kafle et al 2016 mergili et al 2018 in fact most of these numerical models are based on eulerian descriptions in two dimensions these models use the finite volume method or the finite difference method to solve the navier stokes equations under the shallow water assumption thereby obtaining the debris flow flux for each cell over complex three dimensional topography nevertheless although two dimensional numerical models can conveniently incorporate these entrainment laws such solutions are unsatisfactory due to their depth integrated simplifications indicating that only the velocity averaged through the mass depth can be exported from the numerical simulation for a physics based entrainment law rather than the average velocity the basal velocity of the overriding mass is required consequently as a compromise assumed flow velocity profiles particularly linear profiles must be introduced to estimate the entrainment rate in the numerical model iverson 2012 han et al 2015b although some recent studies neglect the observed nonlinear complicated two phase behavior with depth e g domnik and pudasaini 2012 domnik et al 2013 to date little agreement has been reached and sparse data have been published regarding the quantitative analysis of the debris flow basal velocity recently three dimensional particle based numerical models e g the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method with the mature computational package dualsphysics crespo et al 2011 2015 have grown in importance with regard to the numerical modeling of fluid type phenomena pirulli and pastor 2012 pastor et al 2014 wang et al 2016 rahman and konagai 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 han et al 2019 one major advantage of the sph method is with respect to the ability of attaining velocity profile owing to that debris flow mass are treated as a set of discretized particles whose behavior can be described by directly solving the navier stokes equation without the depth integrated shallow water assumption there is a growing body of literatures that devotes to incorporate entrainment laws into the quasi 3d coupled sph schemes with different rheology models such as dan dan3d mcdougall and hungr 2005 hungr and mcdougall 2009 and geoflow sph pastor et al 2009 cuomo et al 2016 these former contributions attained continuing concern and laid a solid foundation for simulating entrainment process by debris flows based on sph schemes the purpose of this paper is to propose a three dimensional surface cell sc based sph numerical model for simulating bed sediment entrainment processes by viscous type debris flow the proposed model introduces a previous progressive entrainment model han et al 2015b 2018 into a sph numerical scheme for debris flows han et al 2019 by means of a novel sc based algorithm furthermore an analysis of a case study is presented to demonstrate and verify the capability of the proposed numerical model 2 the progressive entrainment model the debris flow entrainment process can be described through the entrainment rate as mentioned above a variety of studies have effectively established empirical methods to quantify the entrainment rate however the empirical laws ignore the physical mechanism of the entrainment process and thus many uncertainties remain for example a systematic understanding of how the sediment soil strength contributes to the entrainment rate is still lacking additionally the estimated entrainment rates increase linearly with respect to the empirically calibrated coefficient the rational value of which is currently debated unfortunately these problems within the empirical entrainment law have received scant attention hence physics based hydrodynamic models which must satisfy the boundary momentum jump condition ouyang et al 2015 constitute a continuing concern within research on debris flow entrainment a better understanding of the factors governing entrainment processes is instrumental for further analysis our previous study han et al 2015a summarized four dominant factors that play a crucial role in the entrainment process the topography of the subreach soil strength of the bed sediment magnitude and flow dynamics and recharge rate and sediment availability of the gully considering these dominant factors a physics based entrainment model was incorporated in the two dimensional depth integrated numerical model presented in our previous paper han et al 2015b following the basic assumptions of iverson 2012 this entrainment model can be commonly generalized into two layers namely a debris flow layer and a bed sediment layer as shown in fig 1 in the two layer model shown in fig 1 the momentum exchange between the debris flow mass and the bed sediment following the law of the conservation of momentum can be reduced to 1 e τ 1 b o t τ 2 t o p ρ v 1 b o t v 2 t o p where e is the entrainment rate of bed sediment ρ represents the density of the debris flow mass τ 1 b o t is the basal shear stress τ 2 t o p is the boundary resistance exerted by the bed sediment and v 1 b o t and v 2 t o p are the boundary velocities for the debris flow mass layer and bed sediment layer respectively eq 1 implies that an actively eroding bed exerts less shear resistance than a bed in the absence of entrainment which satisfies the jump condition of boundary shear traction presented by iverson and ouyang 2015 in eq 1 the terms τ 1 b o t and τ 2 t o p obey the mohr coulomb criterion expressed as 2a τ 1 b o t δ σ t a n ϕ d c 2b τ 2 t o p δ σ δ p w t a n ϕ b e d c where δ σ represents the increment in the undrained loading triggered by the overriding debris flow and can be calculated by ρ g h c o s θ c is the cohesion strength and t a n ϕ d is the bulk basal friction angle of the debris flow mass as introduced by hungr and mcdougall 2009 δ p w is the pore pressure response of the bed sediment and can be quantitatively analyzed by 3 δ p w b d δ σ a d δ τ where b d and a d are the pore pressure coefficients because undrained loading triggers mainly high pore pressures instead of shear deformation in saturated sediment iverson et al 2011 the a d δ τ term is negligible and thus the ratio b d controls the pore pressure response considering the complicated evolution of the pore pressure a simplified constant pore pressure ratio b d has commonly been used for dry granular flows and natural flows in previous studies medina et al 2008 luna et al 2012 ouyang et al 2015 with a suggested range between 0 5 and 0 8 however the adoption of this typical range sometimes leads to predicted e values that are an order of magnitude greater than the measured value iverson et al 2011 this could be explained in part by the fact that a high pore pressure response of bed sediment is not maintained throughout the entire debris flow process indicating that the evolution of the pore pressure should be taken into account in our previous studies han et al 2015b 2018 the pore pressure response was supposed to be the result of an instantaneous variation in b d which depends on the loading status on the bed sediment in the loading state h t 0 the pore pressure increases leading to a greater value of b d that is expressed as 4 b d r a n d o m b d b d m a x in contrast when the bed sediment is unloaded h t 0 the pore pressure dissipates in this case b d can be expressed as 5 b d r a n d o m b d m i n b d where b d m i n and b d m a x are the manipulated minimum and maximum pore pressure ratios respectively of the bed sediment with suggested values of 0 8 b d and 1 2 b d the top surface of bed sediment should be static prior to entrainment which indicates that v 2 t o p 0 incorporating eq 2 and eq 3 eq 1 becomes 6 e g h c o s θ t a n ϕ d 1 b d t a n ϕ b e d v 1 b o t where h denotes the flow depth and θ is the slope angle eq 6 indicates that e decreases as the basal velocity v 1 b o t increases contradicting the conventional wisdom that increasing flow velocity generally enhances the capacity for entrainment similar trend of e 1 v 1 b o t is also observed in some former entrainment models e g medina et al 2008 ouyang et al 2015 this conflict has been previously discussed by iverson 2012 that differing from the near equilibrium fluvial system the momentum of the flow mass should respond to sediment entrainment and evolve in the entrainment process one crucial and debated issue in eq 6 concerns the recognition of the debris flow basal velocity v 1 b o t on the bed surface determining this value remains a challenge among the scientific community the linear velocity profile that observed by lanzoni et al 2017 benefits to extract the basal velocity v 1 b o t in our previous studies han et al 2018 we employed a similar linear velocity profile and set v 1 b o t equal to 1 s 1 v m e a n where v m e a n denotes the velocity averaged through the depth and s 1 is a fitting parameter ranging from 0 to 1 fig 2 a however an examination of the experimental data reported by egashira et al 1989 and hotta and ohta 2000 in fig 2a and b reveals a disparity when applying the linear profile in eq 6 although the suggested value of s 1 0 5 generates the best fitting velocity profiles in both groups of data han et al 2015c the basal velocity is somewhat inaccurate this error poses a significant influence when estimating the entrainment rate because e is inversely proportional to v 1 b o t in eq 6 for instance the measured basal velocity in fig 2b approximates 0 35 m s however the basal velocity estimated by the linear profile s 1 0 5 could reach 0 45 m s leading to a decrease in e of 28 58 in this sense the knowledge on the shape of the velocity profile is fundamental for estimating debris flow basal shear stress exerting on bed sediment however most two dimensional numerical models are quasi 3d depth integrated which neglect the vertical dynamic behavior of debris flow under shallow water assumption e g hungr and mcdougall 2009 ouyang et al 2015 the inherent restriction of two dimensional numerical models indicates that the flow velocity is assumed constant with depth thereby the abovementioned linear velocity profile should be adopted to extract the basal velocity for estimating the entrainment rate e g han et al 2015b in this sense the simulated entrainment process is rather sensitive to the fitting parameter s 1 in velocity profile law in order to avoid the error introduced by the linear profile when estimating the basal velocity in the following section we choose a three dimensional sph method to simulate the debris flow process this three dimensional simulation benefits the recognition of the basal velocity in a rigorous way 3 hbp based sph model in sph scheme the continuum and the incompressible debris flow mass are treated as a set of discretized particles whose behavior can be described by solving the navier stokes equation providing a solution to recognize the basal velocity just above the bed surface to simulate the dynamic behavior of a debris flow an sph method that incorporates the herschel bulkley papanastasiou rheology model i e hbp sph model is implemented in this paper the fundamentals of the sph method and hbp rheology model have been described in detail in our recent work wang et al 2016 han et al 2019 assuming that a debris flow mass is an incompressible fluid the propagation of a debris flow can be effectively described by the navier stokes equations which consist of a mass continuity equation and a momentum conservation equation these equations can be expressed in the following lagrangian form

describing debris flow dynamics takahashi 2007 and stancanelli et al 2015 classified debris flows into two major kinds i e the quasi static debris flows in which coulomb friction stress dominates and dynamic debris flows including stony type and viscous type in our study we focus on the viscous type in which viscous stress dominates to calculate the viscous shear stress the hbp rheology model is adopted in the proposed method han et al 2019 in the hbp rheology model the shear stress tensor can be expressed as 10 τ α β 2 μ eff ε α β 11 ε α β 1 2 v α x β v β x α 12 μ eff k γ n 1 τ y 2 γ 1 e m γ

2011 2015 which is robust for simulating newtonian fluids such as floods and water flows the capability of the proposed hbp sph model was tested in our recent study by considering a dam break experiment and a case study of the 2010 yohutagawa debris flow event in japan the results demonstrate that this hbp sph model can successfully describe the dynamic behavior of a debris flow to take sediment entrainment into account in the hbp sph model we propose a novel sc based algorithm to mesh the complex relief of the bed surface and precisely identify the particles and their dynamic variables close to the bed surface 4 sc based algorithm the dynamic entrainment law mentioned in section 2 provides a solution to estimate the time elapsed process of bed sediment erosion this physics based law requires two key variables namely the basal velocity v 1 b o t and flow depth h which describe the dynamic behavior of a debris flow these physical variables can be numerically solved by the hbp sph method as presented in section 3 to simulate the entrainment process the sc based algorithm illustrated in fig 3 is proposed 4 1 bed surface reproduction we first reproduce the complex relief of the bed surface by a series of regular cells i e the so called scs with a constant size of δ l in both the x direction and the y direction the format of these scs is in accordance with the raster data of the digital terrain model dtm in most geographic information system gis environments thereby the scs are compatible with the grid of the dtm θ x and θ y represent the slopes along the x and y directions respectively between the topography and the horizontal plane the entrainment rate e of each cell are separately estimated 4 2 coordinate system transformation the dynamic entrainment law is constructed in a topography linked coordinate system while the physical variables of the particles in the sph scheme are described by absolute coordinates hence a coordinate transformation should be implemented prior to estimating the entrainment rate we use the following formula to transform the absolute coordinate system x y z in the sph scheme to the topography linked coordinate system x y z 16a x y z r θ x r θ y r θ z x y z x c e l l y c e l l z c e l l where 16b r θ x cos θ x 0 sin θ x 0 1 0 sin θ x 0 cos θ x 16c r θ y 1 0 0 0 cos θ y sin θ y 0 sin θ y cos θ y 16d r θ z 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 4 3 particle filtering subsequently the sph particles representing the debris flow mass are filtered into different cells based on their transformed coordinates the ceil function rounds the inputs to the nearest integers in the direction of positive infinity or sets them equal to themselves it is adopted to determine the position of the cell that the sph particles belonging to the filtering operation can be expressed as follows 17a r o w c e i l x δ l 17b c o l c e i l y δ l 17c p a r t c l e x y c e l l r o w c o l where x y denotes the transformed coordinate of an sph particle and r o w c o l identifies the sc indicating the cell to which the particle for further clarification a schematic diagram is shown in fig 4 in which the transformed coordinate of the sph particle is 1 7 1 2 the size of the sc is defined as 0 5 m and the sc is identified by row ceil 1 7 0 5 ceil 3 4 4 col ceil 1 2 0 5 3 accordingly this particle should be classified into the cell 4 3 marked by the red line in fig 4 4 4 physical variable representation after particle filtering the key physical variables namely the flow depth h and basal velocity of the debris flow v 1 b o t and the pore pressure ratio b d of the selected cell can be represented by considering the dynamics of the particles belonging to that cell the so called cell linked particles we use the maximum z value of the cell linked particles and the velocity of the particle with the minimum z value to represent the flow depth h and basal velocity v 1 b o t of the corresponding cell respectively which can be expressed as follows 18a h c e l l i j m a x z 1 z 2 z n 18b v 1 b o t c e l l i j v m x 2 v m y 2 z m m i n z 1 z 2 z n the pore pressure coefficient b d is related to the variation in flow depth depending on the loading status of the bed sediment h t 0 or h t 0 in our previous study han et al 2015b the loading status of the bed sediment was ascertained by comparing the depth variation in the debris flow mass between neighboring time steps t and t δ t in this paper we provide a new method that better fits the particle features in the sph scheme to determine the loading status this approach employs the summation of the particles velocities in the z direction i 1 n v i z to reflect the depth variation as well as the loading status 19a i 1 n v i z 0 h t 0 19b i 1 n v i z 0 h t 0 accordingly the instantaneous variation in the pore pressure ratio b d can be estimated using the random functions in eq 4 and eq 5 4 5 entrainment implementation in addition to the flow depth h basal velocity v 1 b o t and pore pressure ratio b d the dynamic entrainment law in eq 6 requires to identifying the slope θ of the bed sediment along the debris flow propagation route however unlike two dimensional and mesh based simulations that involve only the x and y directions particles in the three dimensional sph scheme exhibit complicated flow directions to determine the adequate slope θ towards the particles direction the velocity vector of the cell linked particles and the cell relief should be comprehensively considered we propose a directional derivative method in this paper as shown in fig 5 the relief in an sc can be approximatively represented by a plane z f x y the partial derivative of z is expressed as 20a z x t a n θ x 20b z y t a n θ y a direction vector v div is defined to generalize the macroscopic motion tendency of the particles in this cell 21 v div i 1 n v i x i 1 n v i y where i is the identifier of the particle and n is the number of particles linked to this cell by normalization the angles between the direction vector v div and the x axis α and the y axis β can be obtained 22a c o s α c o s β i 1 n v i x v div i 1 n v i y v div where 22b v div i 1 n v i x 2 i 1 n v i x 2 in such way the slope θ that linked to the direction vector v div can be finally calculated by 23 θ arctan t a n θ x c o s α t a n θ y c o s β incorporating eq 23 and eq 18 into eq 6 the instantaneous entrainment rate e can be calculated and the development of erosion depth d s c in the debris flow process can be determined using the following equation 24 d s c 0 d s c t t d t t 0 e δ t the main processes composing the integrated method presented above for the dynamic simulation of debris flows and the estimation of entrainment rates are illustrated in fig 6 5 case study to illustrate its performance the proposed method is applied to a case study of the full scale flume experiment conducted by the united states geological survey usgs iverson et al 2011 the configuration of this flume experiment is shown in fig 7 in the experiment the straight concrete channel was 95 m in length and 2 m in width and the channel was inclined at an angle of 31 from the horizontal the bottom of the flume was covered with a 12 cm thick 47 m long tabular layer of sediment the water content of the sediment layer and the mudflow mass were manipulated at a proportion of 0 25 at the top of the flume the debris flow mass with a volume of 6 m3 was released from a triangular prism gate area to record the instantaneous variations in the flow depth and entrainment rate a laser sensor an erosion sensor and a pore pressure sensor were fixed at the measurement point which was established at x 32 m as marked in red in fig 7 the velocity distribution and development of the entrainment process were retrospectively analyzed using the semiempirical approach employed in our previous study han et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 the flume is treated as a boundary that consists of fixed particles and the debris flow mass in the gate area is also discretized into a large number of particles the initial particle distance in this case is adjusted to be 0 05 m accordingly 316 471 boundary particles and 43 258 fluid particles are generated a cell size of 0 2 m is set to mesh the flume into regular scs the influencing parameters in the dynamic simulation are listed in table 1 fig 9 presents the time elapsed simulation results of the dynamic behavior of the debris flow mass in the usgs flume experiment the results demonstrate that it takes approximately 10 s to travel 95 m along the flume with an average velocity of 9 5 m s given the key role of the mass velocity in estimating the entrainment process it is necessary to further verify the accuracy of the reproduced velocity in the numerical simulation regretfully detailed information regarding the variation in the mass velocity is not available in iverson et al 2011 as such to verify the accuracy of the velocity simulation we use an indirect method of comparing the time series of the simulated debris flow front positions with the experimental data that available in iverson et al 2011 the results of this comparison are presented in detail in fig 10 demonstrating that the propagation of the front in the numerical simulation nearly approximates the propagation in the experimental data well particularly along the entrainment section implying that the overall velocity of the debris flow mass in the numerical simulation is in good accordance with that in the experiment to verify the accuracy of the flow depth in numerical simulation we use the experimental data recorded at the measurement point x 32 m the results of the comparison between the simulated flow depths and experimental measurements are shown in fig 11 based on the dynamic variable representation from the sph simulation results the entrainment is subsequently estimated by using the sc method as mentioned in section 4 the key parameters of the entrainment calculation are listed in table 2 the key parameter namely the pore pressure ratio b d was not clearly given in the original experiment in our study we treat this ratio as the main parameter to be adjusted in the simulation and use a trial and error method to adjust it and obtain its best fitting value details are described in the discussion the best fitting value is subsequently determined to be 0 93 which is reasonable because the bed sediment was not completely saturated iverson et al 2011 it is worth mentioning that manipulating the pore pressure ratio b d will not significantly increase the consumption of computational resources because the sph simulation of debris flow behavior and the estimation of the entrainment process are implemented separately a plot of the estimated entrainment versus time is presented in fig 12 where the blue line represents the numerically simulated erosion depth and the red line refers to the experimental data the erosion depth at the measurement point x 32 m reaches 0 081 m after the debris flow mass passes this theoretically computed entrainment shows good agreement with the experimental data in which an entrainment depth of approximately 0 079 m was recorded nevertheless as indicated in fig 12 the experimental data reveal a greater entrainment rate than our simulation this discrepancy could be explained by the phase separation model proposed by pudasaini and fischer 2016b the debris flow front surge is dominated by solids which results in a mechanically stronger front and leads to a greater entrainment depth pudasaini and fischer 2016a however such an effect due to the separation of phases within the debris flow cannot be considered in the proposed method another highlight of this study is that the spatial distributions of the erosion depth flow depth and sediment surface velocity at different instants e g t 5 0 s 10 0 s 15 0 s and 20 0 s can be obtained by using the proposed method the results are illustrated in fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 momentum growth of debris flow triggered by entrainment process several studies have substantiated the significant role of entrainment process which provides positive feedback to increase the momentum of debris flow and its dynamic behavior iverson et al 2011 in two dimensional depth integrated models disagreement exists on whether boundary flux terms related to momentum growth should appear in the momentum conservation equations a recent study by iverson and ouyang 2015 concluded that three jump conditions provided a criterion for this issue in the case of the three dimensional sph based model this situation is much more complex ideally momentum growth due to sediment entrainment should be considered in the sph simulation of the debris flow process however in this study to reduce the computational complexity a compromise has been made such that the positive feedback on the debris flow momentum due to entrainment is not taken into account in this sense the additional term due to the entrainment in the momentum conservation equation is ignored in this study and the strong phase separation in debris flows is not thoroughly considered the effects of this limitation require further investigation 6 2 manipulation of the pore pressure ratio b d and the sc size δ l as discussed in our previous studies the estimated entrainment rate is rather sensitive to the pore pressure ratio b d nevertheless the value of b d is sometimes difficult to determine in the proposed method a trial and error method is used to calibrate the results and a best fitting value of 0 93 is suggested for different cases calibrations and comprehensive tests are essential in addition a random algorithm is incorporated into the proposed method to reflect rapid changes in the pore pressure within the bed sediment as these variations influence the entrainment rate although this method is effective and simplifies the complex variation process of the pore pressure it still lacks a physical foundation and is not reliable in addition we notice that the selection of the sc size δ l has a considerable influence on the estimated entrainment rate as shown in fig 14 a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact of the choice of δ l three different cell sizes i e 0 5 m 0 2 m and 0 1 m are adopted in fig 14a the pore pressure ratio b d remains constant b d 0 93 the results show that a larger cell size δ l generally attains a greater estimated entrainment rate this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that a relatively large cell linked flow depth under a small cell size condition can compensate for the smaller depths of the neighboring cells and represent the flow depth of the greater domain under a large cell size condition which might cause the erosion depth to become overestimated as shown in fig 14b the values of b d and δ l are comprehensively adjusted to obtain the best fitting results the combination of δ l 0 2 m and b d 0 93 generates the best fit with the experimental data in this study we recommend a preliminary and empirical criterion for determining the cell size such that δ l 4 0 10 0 d p where d p represents the initial sph particle distance however rigorous criteria for selecting the values of b d and δ l need to be evaluated further 6 3 overestimation of the flow depth a flow depth representation is critical for calculating the entrainment rate as described in section 4 the flow depth of a sc is equivalently replaced by the maximum z value of the particles belonging to the cell this approach is valid in most cases but might be challenged in some cases exhibiting extremely large deformation such as spattering surging and propagating over complex topography this problem is illustrated in detail in fig 15 a which demonstrates that the presented method might overestimate the height of the debris flow in a cell we are currently working on an enhanced statistical method to address this issue as shown in fig 15b in this method the frequency distribution histogram of particle heights is analyzed and a threshold is artificially selected to divide the area of the histogram into two parts subsequently the abscissa corresponding to the threshold can be determined to be the flow depth of the cell this threshold value can be regarded as an eigenvalue used to describe the height distribution of cell linked particles for example a threshold of 0 95 with a corresponding abscissa of 0 5 m denotes 95 of the particle heights below 0 5 m and thus the value of 0 5 m is used to represent the flow depth of this cell although this procedure increases the computational complexity it will benefit the rational representation of the flow depth improvements and further evaluations of this issue are ongoing 7 conclusion in this paper a three dimensional sc hbp sph method is proposed to model the occurrence of bed sediment entrainment by viscous type debris flow two pivotal issues are addressed regarding the simulation of the dynamic behavior of a debris flow and the representation of the physical variables in an improved bed sediment entrainment law the debris flow dynamic behavior is simulated by the open source dualsphysics scheme into which the hbp rheology model for viscous type debris flow is incorporated to implement the sediment entrainment we improve a previous physics based law for instantaneous entrainment rates and propose a novel sc based algorithm to extract the key physical variables from the particle based time elapsed sph simulation results the surface of the bed sediment is meshed and the particles belonging to a certain cell at each time step are identified to represent the basal velocity and flow depth of the sediment compared with the commonly used linear velocity profile in two dimensional depth integrated models the basal velocity evaluated by the sc sph method avoids any empirical coefficient that controls the velocity profile and therefore the proposed method is more rigorous in defining the momentum exchange between the overriding mass and bed sediment the method presented herein has been verified by a full scale debris flow flume experiment the simulation results reproduce the experimental measurements well demonstrating the capability and performance of the proposed method for estimating the entrainment process sensitivity analyses further show that the presented method is substantially sensitive to the pore pressure ratio and the configured cell size both of which require careful manipulation or trial and error adjustment the presented sc hbp sph method is currently challenged by the consideration of positive feedback from the sediment bed entrainment process to the momentum growth of the debris flow as well as the uncertainties in the debris flow hydrography due to strong phase separation efforts addressing such limitations will constitute future research towards improving the

styrene type weakly basic anion exchange resins wa20 and wa30 for simultaneous removal of various kinds of radionuclides in river water were successfully synthesized the adsorption behavior of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 on these composite adsorbents has been studied in real river water at room temperature pa316tas adsorbents showed much higher distribution coefficients k d for all metal ions tas structure has more selective adsorption ability for mn co sr y cs ba eu and io3 on the other hand y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 were adsorbed on both pa316 and tas structures to evaluate the validity of these mechanistic expectations the respective chemical adsorption behaviors of mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent were examined in river water ranging in temperature from 278 to 333 k as was expected one adsorption mechanism for mn co sr cs and ba systems and two types of adsorption mechanisms for y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 systems were observed on the other hand the precipitation of mn co y ru rh te and eu was formed by ozonation for river water that is ozone can transform mn co y ru rh te and eu ions into the insoluble precipitates hence one straight line for sr cs ba systems and two types of straight lines for sb i i and io3 systems were obtained in river water treated with ozone the chromatography experiments of cs sr i i and io3 were carried out to calculate their maximum adsorption capacities the obtained maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr and i mixed with io3 were 1 7 10 4 cs 1 8 10 3 cs o3 7 8 10 5 sr 5 6 10 4 sr o3 5 4 10 2 i and io3 3 1 10 2 i and io3 o3 mol g pa316tas it was discovered that the maximum adsorption capacities of i and io3 for the composite adsorbent is unprecedented high and the capacity become much greater than an order of magnitude compared with those of previous reports this phenomenon suggests the formation of electron donor acceptor eda complexes or pseudo eda complex based on these results it was concluded that the combined use of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents and ozone made it possible to remove simultaneously and effectively various kinds of radionuclides in river water in the wide ph and temperature ranges graphical abstract image 1 keywords tannic acid type organic composite adsorbent radionuclide ozone river water simultaneous removal adsorption behavior 1 introduction triggered by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku m w 9 0 great earthquake and the subsequent tsunami a large amount of contaminated water with radioactive nuclides such as cesium 137 strontium 90 and iodine 131 was generated by means of sustained injections of seawater and desalinated water for emergency core cooling risen in temperature due to the disappearance of all cooling functions in fukushima daiichi nuclear power station since the severe accident various decontamination systems have been proposed these decontamination systems are smoothly in operation without serious troubles now however their systems are individually focused on different target elements which should be removed from contaminated water besides the radioactive solid wastes produced from the present decontamination equipment combined with precipitation and adsorption processes of radionuclides have been increasing day by day moreover it is predicted that the disposal of radioactive solid wastes involves immeasurable cost at this time recently the latest system without a precipitation process has been developed to overcome this cost problem however a number of adsorption towers embedded with many kinds of adsorbents are used in this system because these adsorbents cannot simultaneously remove many kinds of radionuclides the contaminants after the conventional decontamination processes include activation products manganese 54 cobalt 60 etc derived from nuclear reactor materials and fission products strontium 89 strontium 90 yttrium 90 ruthenium 106 rhodium 106 antimony 125 tellurium 125m cesium 134 cesium 137 etc from the damaged nuclear fuels tachibana et al 2018 europium a 154 155 which is one of main fission products has also more of academic interest from the viewpoint of the chemical similarity with trivalent actinides such as americium and curium tomobuchi et al 2015 iodine is regarded as one of important fission products released from nuclear accidents into the environment particularly iodine 129 which is a beta gamma emitting radioisotope 29 5 kev 20 4 and 29 8 kev 37 7 for x ray 39 6 kev 7 5 for gamma ray to stable xenon 129 is considered to be one possible candidate of environmental tracer nuclides because of the very long half life 1 57 107 years hou and hou 2012 ohno et al 2013a 2014b steinhauser 2014 stan sion et al 2015 xu et al 2015 owing to an extremely long radioactive half life it has been well known that iodine 129 poses virtually little radiological hazard to the human body tumey et al 2013 reversely iodine 131 having the physical properties of half life 8 021 days energy of gamma ray 364 kev 10 and energy of beta ray 606 kev 90 mody et al 2015 is one of the most harmful radionuclides in other words iodine 131 causes pediatric thyroid cancer through contaminated food and breathing in contaminated air because it has the highest radioactivity among radionuclides released immediately into the environment by nuclear severe accidents miyake et al 2012 ohno et al 2013b xu et al 2013b 2015 on the other hand i 131 can be used to cure pediatric thyroid cancer as a medicine the amount of contaminated water containing radionuclides has been increasing with each passing day and the total volume of contaminated water has been estimated to approximately 1 100 000 m3 indicating that the volume exceeds ca 80 of the total storage capacity prepared for the solution of fukushima issues it has been widely accepted that tannic acid ta has the high adsorption ability for many kinds of metal ions such as cesium gurung et al 2013 strontium tachibana et al 2014a b uranium yamazaki et al 2015 manganese üçer et al 2006 lanthanides tachibana et al 2014a b etc in aqueous solutions however the adsorption ability for iodine is not so high tachibana et al 2016 especially it has been known that the chemical structure has the high adsorption ability for uranium in seawater because the adsorption mechanism is the electrostatic interaction between uo2 11 co3 6 oh 12 2 and the single chemical bond between the oxygen and carbon atom with higher positive charge caused by the electronegativity in hydroxyl groups in bisphenol a tachibana et al 2019 ta is also regarded as the property of cheap and easy to obtain high scalability high safety possible to incinerate additionally it can be expected that ta has the sufficient radiation and heat resistance tachibana et al 2014a b however even if the difficult issues of tritium decontamination is excluded it is recognized that the simultaneous removal capability for specific metal ions such as manganese cobalt strontium yttrium ruthenium rhodium antimony tellurium cesium barium europium iodine etc using an operating adsorption separation technology is not necessarily met for the water quality standards for ocean release the innovative decontamination technology to meet environmental criteria and to reduce drastically these radioactive liquid wastes will be requested in the near future apropos some radionuclides produced from nuclear fuels were released into the environment by sudden hydrogen explosion in the nuclear power station in the metropolitan area in japan the latest water purification plants using ozone and biological activated carbon are in operation and the countermeasure against iodine contamination from the severe accident was associated with a threefold increase in an amount of activated carbon in those days however a small amount of radioactive iodine was detected regardless of the above countermeasure although the detected radioactivity was very low and did not have an effect on the human body judging from the negative effect of radionuclides on the human body and environment the noteworthy radionuclides from the severe accident are iodine 131 cesium 134 secium 137 and strontium 90 hence it is needed to develop alternatives to activated carbon and the required adsorption ability is to remove several types of radionuclides simultaneously from contaminated river water ozone o3 is known as one of high powered oxidants with selective reactivity the purification and disinfection of drinking water deodorization of stench in air detoxification of hazardous pesticides released into the environment and organic syntheses have been broadly applied by means of unique nature of o3 hoigné 1998 ikehata et al 2006 tachibana et al 2012a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 advanced oxidation process aop and catalytic ozonation are often used to decompose hard to degrade compounds rapidly in the water purification plants el raady 2005 tachibana et al 2012b the main aop methods are based on free radical reactions and are classified as homogeneous and heterogeneous systems hoigné 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 on the other hand catalytic ozonation has been classified into two categories i e one is a heterogeneous catalyst system and the other is a homogeneous one el raady 2005 tachibana et al 2012b however the chemical behavior of the specific metal ions contained in spent nuclear fuels during ozonation has not been widely discussed in the literatures because these metal ions are faced with constant and complicated change concretely the valence state and chemical structure of these metal ions can be changed by ozonation el raady 2005 in brief the adsorption behavior between adsorbents and these metal ions will become altered hence it is very important to evaluate the adsorption ability for these metal ions before and after ozonation two kinds of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents have been previously developed for simultaneous removal of these radionuclides in diluted normal and concentrated seawater one composite adsorbent named ar 01tas is chemically combined with benzimidazole type anion exchange resin which is embedded in high porous silica beads ar 01 and tas by using paraformaldehyde as one of cross linking reagents in mixed acid containing sulfuric acid and trichloroacetic acid the other is a composite adsorbent composed of a porous type strongly basic anion exchange resin pa316 and tas called pa316tas adsorbent the adsorption ability of ar 01tas and pa316tas adsorbents for various kinds of metal ions has been checked in seawater at room temperature tachibana et al 2016 2018 in these manuscripts it has been reported that ar 01tas adsorbent can strongly adsorb transition metals lanthanides actinides and iodine species to the contrary it was also revealed that ar 01tas adsorbent has much lower adsorption ability for cesium strontium and barium in seawater the adsorption ability for cesium strontium and barium were relatively improved only in case of pa316tas adsorbent and pa316tas adsorbent demonstrated excellence in the simultaneous adsorption ability for metal ions in seawater thus a novel composite adsorbent such as pa316tas adsorbent which allows for simultaneous removal of various kinds of radionuclides under any circumstances must be required for nuclear severe accidents on the basis of the background described above six kinds of novel tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents abbreviated as pa316tas ar 01tas pyrtas wa10tas wa20tas and wa30tas adsorbents respectively combined with pa316 ar 01 pyridine type anion exchange resin pyr acrylic type weakly basic anion exchange resin wa10 or styrene type weakly basic anion exchange resins wa20 and wa30 and tas see fig 1 and the composite adsorbents with the different mixture ratio of the anion exchange resin to ta have been synthesized and the adsorption behavior of manganese cobalt strontium etc on these composite adsorbents has been studied to find the optimized adsorbent for simultaneous removal of twelve kinds of radionuclides in real river water at room temperature in addition the effect of the mixing ratio of the anion exchange resin and ta ph value concentration factor of river water reaction temperature and ozone on the adsorption behavior of the metal ions using the selected adsorbent has been examined to reveal their adsorption mechanisms in river water moreover the maximum adsorption capacities and the endurance tests of the optimized adsorbent for the selected metal ions in river water and river water treated with ozone were performed to evaluate the practicality of the optimized adsorbent in the present water purification plants using ozone and biological activated carbon and or to confirm the validity to apply to the decontamination plants of radionuclides without a precipitation process under the severe accidents 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and river water samples hno3 solutions of 0 10 m m mol dm3 dm3 l with 1 0 g l elements mn

type anion exchange resins were purchased from mitsubishi chemical co ltd and their structural details and chemical properties have been described elsewhere the initial forms of these resins were noted in brackets ar 01 type anion exchange resin was provided from tokyo institute of technology pyr type anion exchange resin was prepared by using the synthetic method reported in the previous work tachibana et al 2014b the real river water was sampled from shinano river in ojiya niigata japan on september 23 2017 and the sampling spot was located at northern latitude of 37 20 50 9 and longitude 138 49 23 8 degrees east all reagents for analyses were of special pure grade 2 2 sample preparation the fine particles contained in the water sampled from shinano river were removed using a borosilicate glass fiber filter whose pore size and thickness were 2 μm and 1200 μm made by merck kgaa before all adsorption experiments river water has the possibility that natural organic matter nom is contained the nom in river water can potentially affect the removal efficiency of the examined metal ions by the adsorbents due to the interaction of the nom with adsorbent surfaces and or the examined metal ions such as complex reactions and or redox reactions the detection of the nom using an uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu co japan equipped with a quartz cell optical path length 1 00 0 01 cm was attempted at room temperature the spectra obtained from ultrapure water and the river water were slightly different around the ultraviolet region concretely the absorbance of the river water increased gradually with a decrease in wavelength from ca 360 nm 190 nm this implies that metal ions contained originally and or the nom are contained in the river water subsequently the detection of the decomposition products of the nom formic acid oxalic acid etc produced by ozone was examined using an ion chromatograph ic made by tosoh ic 2001 because humic acid and fulvic acid which are classified as the nom have amorphous structure and they are very hard to analyze them qualitatively and quantitatively the following measurement condition of ic was used a mixture of 0 2 mm nahco3 15 mm h3bo3 and 6 0 mm na2b4o7 as a mobile phase was supplied at 0 8 ml min into tskgel superic anion type column made by tosoh id 4 6 mm 150 mm length whose temperature was kept constant at 313 k by using a column oven 5 μm spherical particles packed in the column are modified with a quaternary ammonium group an electrical conductivity detector was used however as a result it was hard to detect the formic acid and oxalic acid in the river water in addition the detection of the other decomposition products was also performed using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc made by shimadzu co japan the measurement condition of the hplc was set as follows a mixture of meoh and h2o volume ratio 9 1 as a mobile phase was supplied at 1 5 ml min using a lc 6ad type pump a silica 2 column made of phenomenex id 4 6 mm 150 mm length packed with 5 μm spherical particles was used the column temperature was kept constant at 323 k by using a column oven cto 10asvp and an uv detector at 210 nm was used as a result any peaks were not observed on the other hand the detection of mn and fe elements in the river water was possible therefore it can be estimated that the concentration of the nom in the river water is extremely low and the influence of the nom for the removal efficiency of the examined metals is in a small degree then it was attempted to adjust the concentrations of the examined metal ions in river water to approximately 1 0 10 5 m and an uc 0515 type ultrasonic apparatus made by tocho was used to dissolve the metal salts into river water however the finally confirmed concentrations of mn co te sb ru rh y and eu were somewhat lower than 1 0 10 5 m by their precipitation formation hence the precipitates were also cleared by using the same glass fiber filter next the diluted river water was prepared by mixing ultrapure water with normal river water while the concentrated river water was obtained by evaporating river water slowly at about 373 k using the same hotplate and infrared heating and drying lamp it took at least a couple of days to evaporation of the river water its concentration factor cf was 1 10 1 5 1 2 1 2 3 and 5 respectively the initial concentrations in river water were individually 7 8 0 1 10 6 m mn 8 5 0 1 10 6 m co 1 2 0 0 10 5 m sr 4 7 0 1 10 6 m y 5 5 0 0 10 7 m ru 6 1 0 1 10 6 m rh 2 2 0 0 10 6 m sb 2 5 0 0 10 7 m

water are comparatively higher than those in seawater tachibana et al 2018 the adjustment of the initial ph of river water was performed using hcl and naoh and the corresponding ph values were checked using a ph tester with 0 1 ph resolution hi98103s hanna all sample solutions were prepared by mixing ultrapure water produced with a milli q integral 3 type water purification system made by merck millipore before use it was confirmed that the values of specific electrical resistance and concentration of total organic carbon are more than 18 2 mωcm and less than 3 ppb ppb ng g respectively o3 gas was generated from o2 gas with the purity of 99 5 using an ed og r6 type o3 generator made by ecodesign inc the o2 gas was provided from shimakyu co ltd 2 3 syntheses of composite adsorbents six kinds of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents were synthesized as following ta mw 1701 8 g mol 1 41 10 2 mol was added into the six 0 5 l recovery flasks with 0 1 l h2so4 respectively each mixture was sufficiently stirred using a rv 10 digital v type rotary evaporator made by ika for 3 days at 358 k until ta was completely dissolved in the acid solutions it was observed that the color of the solutions became black after the hydrolysis and sulfonation reactions of ta the product of hydrolyzed and sulfonated ta tas was obtained see fig 1 then ar 01 cl form pyr cl form pa316 cl form wa10 oh form wa20 oh form or wa30 oh form resins 50 0 g as dry resin paraformaldehyde 7 05 10 2 mol as 1 3 5 trioxane and trichloroacetic acid 9 80 10 2 mol were sequentially and individually mixed into the six mixtures and the temperature was kept constant at ca 273 k in the bath with ice water to prevent the thermal decomposition of these adsorbents under the same temperature condition the six mixtures were stirred by using the bar made of polytetrafluoroethylene these mixtures were slowly warmed to 333 k in the oil bath based on the previous information that the operational temperature limit of pa316 wa10 wa20 and wa30 resins is lower than 333 373 k in case of cl and oh forms although ar 01 and pyr type anion exchange resins have the enough thermal stability nomura et al 1996 sato et al 2009 the temperature limit was set to 333 k in common with other resins the reaction temperature was kept constant at 333 k for 2 days at this stage each tas structure was chemically combined with pa316 ar 01 pyr wa10 wa20 and wa30 resins through the cross linking reactions by paraformaldehyde in the concentrated acid solution at 333 k the unreacted tas unreacted paraformaldehyde trichloroacetic acid and sulfuric acid contained in all composite adsorbents were rinsed with 1 0 l h2o 0 25 l methanol and 0 25 l acetone the series of washing procedures were repeated until the filtrate is colorless this procedure was repeated three times under this condition the most suitable form of hydroxyl and sulfo groups contained in all composite adsorbents will be h form therefore h form in all composite adsorbents was exchanged with na form using a saturated nacl solution of 500 ml this ion exchange method was repeated more than three times the removal of residual nacl on the composite adsorbents was carried out using ultrapure water all composite adsorbents were dried on a plastic tray using a vacuum drying equipment at 333 k for a night subsequently all the composite adsorbents were dried naturally without vacuum drying process for another overnight finally the six kinds of composite adsorbents pa316tas wa10tas wa20tas wa30tas ar 01tas and pyrtas adsorbents were obtained and the calculated yields were found to be 95 3 53 2 79 8 68 4 84 0 and 84 3 respectively tas adsorbent yield 82 6 was also synthesized by the similar method for the above composite adsorbents in addition pa316s resin was prepared through the treatment of pa316 resin by h2so4 moreover ta 2 82 10 5 1 41 10 2 mol was added into the respective 0 5 l recovery flasks with 0 1 l h2so4 and five types of pa316tas adsorbents with the different mixture ratios of pa316 ta 2 1 10 1 50 1 100 1 and 1000 1 were synthesized using paraformaldehyde in trichloroacetic acid and sulfuric acid solutions at 333 k the average yield of the synthesized composite adsorbents was found to be approximately 86 95 this synthetic method was based on the results of our previous work tachibana et al 2018 as a result of sieving the five kinds of pa316tas adsorbents it was found that the particle size is distributed in two kinds of ranges between 300 600 μm and 600 1180 μm the surface condition of all pa316tas adsorbents were observed by a ve 8800 type sem made by keyence and an iraffinity 1s type ft ir analyzer made by shimadzu combined with a well known kbr or kcl pellet method these sample pellets were prepared by grinding pa316tas adsorbents and kbr or kcl on an agate mortar the weight ratio of each pa316tas adsorbents and kbr or kcl in the sample pellets was adjusted to 1 500 in this paper most of these data were not shown because the similar data have already been reported in our previous work tachibana et al 2018 2 4 adsorption experiments using composite adsorbents in the adsorption experiments a batch wise method was used in order to evaluate the distribution coefficients k d of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 using the prepared adsorbents in various kinds of river water and in a wide temperature range all experiments were repeated more than three times and the levels of confidence of the error bar and standard derivation in the figures and tables represent 1σ the initial chemical forms of counter cation and anion of tas adsorbent pa316 resin and all composite adsorbents were composed of na and cl ions two types of vials made of polypropylene and borosilicate glass were prepared generally an inner surface of glass vial can adsorb a metal ion through an ion exchange reaction and or a hydrophobic interaction on the other hand some adsorption ability of a metal ion for an inner surface of polypropylene tube via a hydrophobic interaction can also be confirmed therefore before measurements methanol were added into the vial and tube with river water to confirm the degree of the adsorption ability by the hydrophobic interaction and the ion exchange reaction among them the concentrations of the added metal ions were preliminarily checked before and after experiments under the condition temp 278 333 k no adsorbents the significant difference of concentrations of metal ions before and after experiments was not able to be observed as a result of the experiments from this result the adsorption behavior between the inner surface of materials and the added metal ions can be almost negligible in the experimental condition each river water with the examined metal ions 10 ml was added into the containers containing the adsorbents 100 or 250 mg as dry weight the data summarized in table 1 were obtained using 250 mg adsorbents while the experiments in table 2 were done using 100 mg and 250 mg adsorbents as a result it was found that the k d values between 100 and 250 mg adsorbents are very similar under equilibrium conditions even in case that the both adsorbents were not sieved therefore the subsequent adsorption experiments were carried out using the preliminarily sieved 100 mg pa316tas adsorbent in many other experiments because of saving the usage of the adsorbent then the containers were sufficiently stirred using a rotary shaker at room temperature or in a shaking water bath kept constant at 278 333 k the shaking time was more than 24 h each concentration of the examined metal ions in aqueous solutions before and after adsorption tests was measured using a 7700x type icp ms analyzer made by agilent and or an aa 6200 type aas analyzer made by shimadzu before these measurements the aqueous solutions were filtered using a regenerated cellulose fiber filter whose pore size was 0 45 μm provided from sartorious stedim to remove the adsorbents in the samples or the adsorbents and solutions were separated by using a h 36α type centrifuge separator made by kokusan these parameters were set to 3500 rpm and 30 min some of these procedures have been previously mentioned in the ref tachibana et al 2018 the solution environment of river water after adsorption experiments was checked using an uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu co japan at room temperature the quartz cell with optical path length of 1 00 0 01 cm was used 2 5 chromatography experiments one glass column made by nihon seimitsu kagaku co ltd was used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr2 i i and io3 on pa316tas adsorbent in river water at 298 k before and after ozonation using a typical chromatographic technique the glass column was equipped with the water jacket made of glass this jacket was used to maintain the constant temperature in the column the length of glass column was 10 cm and its id was 10 mm each apparatus was connected in series with a polytetrafluoroethylene tube id 2 mm and outer diameter od of 3 mm see fig 2 then the above mentioned pa316tas adsorbent was packed into the column each total weight of the adsorbents added into the column was 1 05 g for cs sr2 pa316tas and 1 01 g for cs sr2 pa316tas o3 systems for i i and io3 pa316tas and i i and io3 pa316tas o3 systems each total weight of the embedded adsorbents was 1 01 g and 1 00 g respectively by using a ltci 150hp type circulator and air conditioner the reaction temperature was kept constant at 298 k after the form of pa316tas adsorbent was preliminarily conditioned to na and cl forms by using a saturated nacl solution pa316tas adsorbent was rinsed using ultrapure water completely to remove free nacl and visible bubble of air in the column before experiments the dissolved air in the mobile phase was certainly deaerated using an ultrasonic apparatus the column chromatography experiments of cs sr2 i with io3 ions whose concentrations are 7 7 10 3 m cs 3 9 10 3 m sr and 3 5 10 2 m i and io3 in river water and 7 1 10 3 m cs 3 4 10 3 m sr and 3 1 10 2 m i and io3 in river water treated with ozone were performed under the constant flow rate of 1 3 ml min for cs and sr system and 2 2 ml min for i and io3 system in the pressure below 2 0 mpa the individual effluent volume of the river water without and with o3 was 457 ml and 387 ml for cs and sr test and 429 ml and 382 ml for i and io3 test respectively in all tests the flow rate of the mobile phase was controlled by a high pressure fixed displacement plunger pump equipped with an analogue pressure gauge np kx 210 nihon seimitsu kagaku the column eluate was regularly collected using a chf100aa type fraction collector made by advantech each eluent volume in the tube was ca 5 0 or 2 5 ml for cs and sr2 system and 5 0 or 4 5 ml for i i and io3 system the ph values of each collected sample solution were measured using the same ph tester the concentrations of cs sr2 i i and io3 were measured by using the icp ms analyzer the aqueous solutions containing 1 wt hno3 were used as a diluent for all icp ms and aas measurements pa316tas adsorbent do not strongly adsorb na ion which exists in river water as cationic species if pa316tas adsorbent has some adsorption ability for na ion the concentration contained in river water is large excess compared with that of the adsorption capacity of pa316tas adsorbent for na ion as a result the adsorption effect for the dead volume can be vanishingly small hence the dead volume was estimated by measuring the concentration of na ion in the eluents each dead volume from cs and sr systems without and with o3 was 12 2 ml and 12 5 ml on the other hand both dead volume for i and io3 systems without or with o3 was 13 0 ml the slight difference is attributable to the different sampling intervals each concentration of na ion in samples was measured by using the icp ms and aas analyzers 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption behavior of mn co sr etc on tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents in river water at room temperature the adsorption experiments of twelve kinds of metal ions mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 using six kinds of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents pa316tas ar 01tas pyrtas wa10tas wa20tas and wa30tas adsorbents were performed by a well known batch wise method and their adsorption behavior was evaluated using the distribution coefficients k d a u values of these twelve kinds of metal ions in river water at room temperature the calculation of all k d values was performed using the following eq 1 1 k d c r c s v s v r c 0 c s c s v s v r where each symbol with a subscript c 0 c s c r v s and v r indicates initial concentration of mn co sr etc in solution concentration of mn co sr etc in solution after adsorption equilibrium concentration of mn co sr etc on an adsorbent after adsorption equilibrium volume of sample solution and volume of resin table 1 shows the comparison of the k d values of mn co sr etc for these composite adsorbents in river water at room temperature pyrtas ar 01tas wa10tas and wa20tas adsorbents had a little or little adsorption ability of mn and cs k d 102 a little adsorption ability for co and sr using pyrtas ar 01tas and wa10tas adsorbents was observed k d 102 pyrtas wa10tas and wa20tas adsorbents had a little adsorption ability for i in particular pyrtas adsorbent did not adsorb selectively y ba and eu from river water k d 102 on the other hand wa30tas and pa316tas adsorbents showed much higher k d values for all metal ions particularly most of the k d values for pa316tas adsorbent were higher than those of wa30tas adsorbent in limited case of cs sr and i which are frequently discussed in decontamination process in the environment from these results we have chosen pa316tas adsorbent as one of promising adsorbents for simultaneous removal of these radionuclides in river water in table 2 it was confirmed that the k d values between pa316 adsorbent and these metal ions are very similar to those of pa316s adsorbent this tendency implies that pa316 adsorbent is not mostly sulfonated by the treatment of h2so4 at 333 k however ta can react with h2so4 to form tas adsorbent even at room temperature it was confirmed that the color of sample solutions became yellow slightly after experiments using tas adsorbent and the adsorption ability of tas adsorbent for i i and io3 has comparatively lower than that of the other examined metal ions i species in soils are considered to be bound predominantly to soil organic matter som xu et al 2011 2012 the som contains mainly humic acid and fulvic acid and it can be regarded that the chemical structures of humic acid and fulvic acid are similar to those of ta and tas from the viewpoint of the aromatic structures with many functional groups hence this result indicates that a part of tas adsorbent with i i and io3 was dissolved into the river water moreover tas adsorbent and pa316 adsorbent were simultaneously added into the river water containing these metal ions as a result the simply mixed tas and pa316 adsorbents had a little or little adsorption ability for mn sr rh sb cs ba and i i and io3 the dissolved tas adsorbent adsorbed preferentially on pa316 adsorbent indicating that the adsorption reactions between tas adsorbent and metal ions were inhibited this result was very different from that of pa316tas adsorbent although the fact that ar 01 pa316 and tas adsorbents have no adsorption ability for io3 ion in seawater was previously reported ar 01tas and pa316tas adsorbents had comparatively higher adsorption ability for both i and io3 ions in various types of seawater and in the wide temperature range tachibana et al 2016 2018 however the reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is a matter for speculation that the change of the electron density of the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent and or the different effect of steric hindrance in adsorption processes were caused by the chemical combination of pa316 and tas adsorbents by the chemical combination of both adsorbents compared with those of individual pa316 and tas adsorbents furthermore it can be predicted that the dissolution of a part of tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent into the river water may be prevented by the polymerization reactions between pa316 and tas adsorbents table 3 offers the comparison data of the k d values of the metal ions for various pa316tas adsorbents in river water at room temperature as seen from this continuous change the k d values of mn co sr y cs ba eu and io3 decreased sharply or gradually with an increase in the mixing ratio of pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbents furthermore pa316tas adsorbents combined chemically with the weight ratios of pa316 ta 10 1 50 1 100 1 and 1000 1 have exceptionally low or no adsorption ability for mn co sr cs and ba in river water at room temperature these k d values also decrease gradually in order of pa316 ta 2 1 10 1 50 1 100 1 and 1000 1 basically this phenomenon implies that tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent has the selective adsorption ability for these metal ions on the other hand y eu and io3 were adsorbed on both pa316 and tas structures because the corresponding k d values did not become zero in the mixing ratio from 2 1 to 1000 1 as a mixing ratio of pa316 to ta these metal ions have the possibility for existence as a few chemical species subsequently the k d values of ru rh sb te and i were compared when the mixing ratio of pa316 to ta is adjusted between 2 1 and 1000 1 it was found that these k d values share similar values in brief pa316 structure in pa316 adsorbents had very high adsorption ability for ru rh sb te and i eventually the optimized mixing ratio of pa316 to ta was 2 to 1 even in case of river water system in analogy with the result of seawater table 3 most of the k d values for river water system were a few orders of magnitude greater than those for seawater system table 3 this main difference is caused by a high salt concentration in seawater therefore the above adsorption behavior of the target metal ions has been examined in order to understand the adsorption equilibrium mechanisms in river water in more depth under the conditions ph 1 9 7 6 after adsorption equilibrium temp room temperature and cf of river water 0 10 0 20 0 50 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 fig 3 provides the data plotting the k d values of the target metal ions using pa316tas adsorbent against the final ph values in river water at room temperature as a result it was revealed that the k d values of mn co ba cs and sr increase linearly with increasing ph values in river water it is instructive to recognize that the hydroxyl group modified in pa316tas adsorbent is scarcely dissociated in higher acidic region however it is gradually dissociated from the weak acid concentration range in short the cation exchange reactions between mn ii co ii ba ii cs i or sr ii ions and the hydroxyl group substituted by na ion in pa316tas adsorbent occurred preferentially in river water the adsorption behavior of k d of ru and rh y and eu was very similar respectively the plots with the maximum values were observed in case of ru rh y eu sb and te systems the plots of i i and io3 were almost parallel to the axis of ph values these phenomena can be explained as follows rh element can exist as rh i rh ii and rh iii ions in acid solutions in the presence of complexing agents or chemicals colom 1985 the most stable and important oxidation state of rh is considered as trivalent although rh takes up a variety of oxidation states there is cl ion ranging in concentration from ca 1 47 10 4 to 2 91 10 4 m in river water hirayama 1992 fujinaga et al 2017 therefore the chemical form of rh iii ion was estimated using the following stability constants β 1 2 45 β 2 4 54 β 3 5 92 β 4 7 08 β 5 8 68 β 6 8 36 temp 298 k ionic strength 1 0 m cozzi and pantani 1958 as a result it can be estimated that rh3 and rhcl2 are main species see fig 4 however pa316 adsorbent which is one of anion exchange resins adsorbed rh in river water as shown in table 2 the portion of rh should be anionic chemical forms the sulfate ion is generally contained in river water for example rh so4 2 may be dominantly formed as a result it can be predicted that tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent simultaneously adsorbs rh iii and rh so4 2 with increasing ph values while pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent selectively adsorbs rh so4 2 with decreasing ph values by the competition reaction between the pa316 structure and oh it can be reasonably accepted that ru ii and ru iii tend to form stable complex ions such as ru h2o 6 2 ru h2o 5cl ru h2o 6 3 and ru h2o 5cl2 in river water whereas ru iv is more stable oxidation state in non complexing aqueous solutions colom 1985 ru iii will be more stable than ru ii from their redox potentials ru vi and ru viii such as ruo4 2 and ruo4 aq are more stable oxidation states in neutral and basic solutions but the structure of these ions depends on the ph values of solutions colom 1985 hence it can be estimated that tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent simultaneously adsorbs ru iii and ru vi with increasing ph values of river water while the k d values of ru vi for pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent decreases gradually with an increase in the ph values because of the adsorption reaction between the pa316 structure and oh in analogy with the rh iii system the rare earth elements rees such as y iii and eu iii can form rees iii rees iii so4 rees iii co3 rees iii co3 2 and rees iii oh2 in an aqueous solution see fig 4 mironov et al 1982 millero 1992 liu and byrne 1998 the k d values of the rees for pa316tas adsorbent increased sharply with an increase in the ph values until about ph 4 this result means that the cation exchange reactions between rees such as rees iii and rees iii so4 and tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent occur preferentially on the other hand the fraction of rees iii co3 2 increased gradually in the ph range between 6 and 9 indicating that the anion exchange reactions between rees iii co3 2 and pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent proceeded dominantly however the k d values in the ph range decreased obviously this phenomenon suggests the possibility that pa316tas adsorbent adsorbs more selectively rees iii rather than rees iii co3 2 te element can take some valence states ii i iv vi in an aqueous solution d c mcphail has already provided the stability constants between these te species and o2 g h in the wide temperature range mcphail 1995 hence the chemical forms of these te species dissolved in river water at 298 k were predicted using these data the total concentration of dissolved oxygen gas o2 g t in river water was referred from the database of japanese industrial standard for testing methods for industrial wastewater jis k 0102 2016 there are no cationic te species in the examined ph range as shown in fig 4 h6teo6 aq and h2teo3 aq were main te species in the range from ph 3 to 7 while the fractions of h3teo3 h5teo6 and h4teo6 2 increased at the both ends of the examined ph range strangely this implies that pa316tas adsorbent can adsorb neutral species such as h6teo6 aq and h2teo3 aq although the adsorption of these neutral te species for simple pa316 and tas adsorbents could not be clearly confirmed because of lower ph values moreover the potential diagram of sb has been provided from the literature past 1985 in brief it is reported that sb can exist as sb v 2o5 aq sb iv 2o4 aq sb iii 4o6 aq etc in acid and neutral solutions while sb v oh 6 sb iii oh 4 sb iii o2 etc can form in a basic solution in addition single sb iii ion can exist in very small concentration in an aqueous solution for a wide interval of ph value from 2 to 10 4 solubility of sb iii 4o6 aq does not depend on the ph value indicating a nonionic solute which is considered as meta antimonious acid hsb v o2 aq or sb iii o oh aq past 1985 there are neutral species e g sb iii 4o6 aq in the weak acid solution and anionic species e g sb v oh 6 in the weak basic solution the k d values of sb became constant between ph 2 to 5 and the k d values of sb decreased gradually with an increase in the ph values in more than ph 5 see fig 3 as well as h3teo3 h5teo6 and h4teo6 2 anionic species such as sb v oh 6 etc were not strongly adsorbed on pa316tas adsorbent hence the plots of two bent straight lines were obtained from te and sb systems compared with those of pa316 resin and tas adsorbent as well as the previously reported result tachibana et al 2018 the electron density of functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent and or the different effect of steric hindrance in adsorption processes may be changed by the chemical combination of both adsorbents the further effort to reveal this adsorption behavior will be required i element has various kinds of chemical forms in an aqueous solution as well as te it has been already reported that i element can exist as neutral i2 aq i2o2 aq hoi aq and anionic species i i3 io3 i2oh io i2o2 buxton and mulazzani 2007 the neutral species form through the radical and disproportion reactions such as i i i2 aq 2io i2o2 aq i2oh hoi aq i in addition the production of i3 i2oh io i2o2 is incomplete without i2 production however the oxidizing agents such as o3 and h2o2 were not added into the river water under the experimental condition the pk a values of hi and hio3 were 0 78 vanýsek 2014 and 10 brownstein and stillman 1959 respectively therefore it can be considered that i element keeps the chemical forms of i and io3 in river water the k d values of i i and io3 became almost constant in the ph range between 1 9 and 7 6 shown in fig 3 the simple tas adsorbent has little adsorption ability for i and io3 ions see table 2 hence this phenomenon means that pa316 structure and tas structure near pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent adsorb selectively i and io3 ions in river water in the wide ph value range it was also found that the adsorption of i element i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent is difficult to be interrupted by the ph values of river water the result of plots of k d values vs cf was arranged in fig 3 as seen in this figure the k d values of sr ii cs i ba ii i i v decreased gradually with increasing concentration factor cf of river water in order of 0 10 0 20 0 50 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 because of an increase in concentration of the elements contained originally in river water the k d values of mn ii co ii y iii ru iii vi rh iii sb iii v and eu iii except for te iv vi also decreased with increasing concentration factor cf up to 1 0 due to the completion reactions by the elements contained originally in river water then these k d values became almost constant between cf 1 0 and 5 0 especially the k d values of ru and rh were very similar between these cfs in short the adsorption species between ru iii vi and rh iii on pa316tas adsorbent may have very similar conformation indicating that the formation of unique complexes containing ru and rh separately manbeck et al 2017 ghosh et al 2019 on the other hand the k d values for te iv vi were almost constant in the cf range this means that pa316tas adsorbent has massively higher selectivity for te iv vi in river water it can be seen that pa316tas adsorbent has high adsorption ability for all metal ions even in cf 5 0 3 2 thermodynamic evaluation between mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent in river water and ozone treated river water milonjić sk has mentioned that the equilibrium constant k is improperly presented with a certain unit in many manuscripts in spite of the fact that the unit of g is j mol and the unit of r t is also j mol in gibbs equation milonjić 2007 this means that the k variable must be absolutely dimensionless in the case when k is given in l g the k can be easily recalculated to become dimensionless by multiplying it by 1000 g l which is equal to the solution density of h2o milonjić 2007 for example the recalculation of k l mol as dimensionless by multiplying the k by 55 5 number of moles per liter of h2o solution mol l has been suggested anastropoulos and kyzas 2016 for the adsorption system based on langmuir model the respective correct values can be obtained by multiplying langmuir equilibrium constant b m with 55 5 because of b m unit l mol anastropoulos and kyzas 2016 hence the converted gibbs equation can take the following form g r t ln 55 5 k r t ln 55 5 b m respectively to the contrary if the k d value has a dimensionless unit the k d value can be directly used in place of dimensionless k based on this analysis approach the respective chemical surroundings of mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent were examined in river water and river water treated with ozone to evaluate experimentally the validity of aforesaid discussions the apparent thermodynamic parameters which are h s and g values for the adsorption of mn co sr etc on pa316tas adsorbent mixing ratio of pa316 ta 2 1 were calculated from the linear plots of ln k versus 1 t using the following van t hoff equation 2 under the following condition pa316tas adsorbent 100 mg temperature range 278 333 k initial ph 7 6 cf 1 0 see figs 6 and 7 2 ln k g r t h r t s r k d is converted into k where the respective notations of r and t are corresponding to gas constant and absolute temperature the experimental condition of ozonation of river water containing the metal ions was adjusted to ozone partial pressure 6 3 10 1 kpa flow rate 250 ml min and time of ozonation 3 h if our assumption that the cation exchange reactions between these metal ions and the hydroxyl groups substituted by na ion in tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent occur mainly is reasonable the plots of ln k vs 1 t should be a straight line for the adsorption mechanisms between mn ii co ii sr ii cs i or ba ii and pa316tas adsorbent judging from the results in table 3 as a result the straight lines were obtained as shown in fig 5 on the other hand two bent or step straight lines were observed only in y iii ru iii vi rh iii sb iii v eu iii and te iv vi in the same figure these results indicate that at least two adsorption mechanisms proceed under the experimental condition the above elements through the formation of anionic and cationic species or neutral species can be simultaneously adsorbed on pa316 and tas structures in pa316tas adsorbent as mentioned in the previous section the calculated thermodynamic parameters were arranged in table 4 the negative δg values imply that the thermodynamically favorable adsorption processes between pa316tas adsorbent and mn co sr etc proceed in two kinds of river water the positive δs values suggest that the degree of randomness increases because the destruction of hydration shell of the metal ions and the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent are far superior to the adsorption between the metal ions and the surface of pa316tas adsorbent the two kinds of δs values obtained from of y iii rh iii and eu iii were roughly similar because of the slight change among some types of conformations of y iii rh iii and eu iii during the adsorption processes in the previous section it was mentioned that ru can exist as trivalent and hexavalent ru under the examined condition for example it has been reported that the hydration number of fe2 and fe3 ions is 6 0 0 1 and 6 0 0 2 whereas the ion radii of fe2 and fe3 are 0 077 and 0 063 nm yokoyama 1995 this means that the variation of δs values depends strongly on the chemical forms of ru superior to the difference of valence state of ru that is the fact that ru can exist as oxidation products such as ruo4 2 during the adsorption processes seems to be more important parameter as a result the difference of δs values between ru iii and ruo4 2 was clearly generated te has two kinds of valence states i e tetravalent and hexavalent te which are based on the adsorption reactions between pa316tas adsorbent and neutral species such as h6teo6 aq and h2teo3 aq showed almost same δs values because the fraction of h6teo6 aq is very high in the ph value the adsorption of h6teo6 aq on the both structures in pa316tas adsorbent occurred as with te there are trivalent and pentavalent sb species in aqueous solutions in case of the condition main sb species will be sb iii 4o6 aq rather than sb v oh 6 hence the adsorption reaction between sb iii 4o6 aq and the both of structures in pa316tas adsorbent proceeded this result may also suggest the formation of electron donor acceptor eda complexes between aromatic rings of pa316tas adsorbent and neutral te or sb species compared with that of other chemical bonds the strength of interaction due to the eda complexes became very low this phenomenon is reasonable because the difference of δs values is comparatively small the δh and δs values of mn ii and co ii were quite similar to each other besides the δh and δs values of sr ii were also almost equivalent to those of ba ii respectively because of an analogous chemical property in alkaline earth metals the difference between δs values of cs i and sr ii will attribute to the hydration numbers of cs i nh2o 7 0 1 0 and sr ii nh2o 8 1 1 0 yokoyama 1995 judging from the results of δh values see table 4 and table 3 the adsorption mechanisms of mn ii co ii cs i sr ii and ba ii can be regarded as the similar one there are two kinds of δh and δs values of i i and i v respectively and their values were very different it is estimated that simple i and io3 exist in river water without the exogenous effect by any ligands and redox reactions in addition both of i and io3 can be simultaneously adsorbed by pa316 and tas structures in pa316tas adsorbent see table 3 in this case the degree of dehydration processes of respective functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent will depend strongly on each of molecular volume it can be assumed that the molecular volume of i is smaller than that of io3 as a result this factor causes the difference of δh and δs values between i and io3 using pa316tas adsorbent after ozonation of river water containing twelve kinds of metal ions mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu i i and io3 it was found that mn co y ru rh te and eu precipitate selectively while the precipitation phenomena of sr sb cs ba i i and io3 are not caused by ozone treatment fig 8 hence the candidate metal ions which should be removed in the river water treated with ozone were chosen before and after ozonation δh and δs values of sr ii cs i and ba ii did not change while δh and δs values of sb iii v and i i changed clearly indicating the change of valence states of sb iii v by ozone ozone can generally produce more hydrophilic substances compared with the degree of hydrophilicity of its original substances tachibana et al 2012a sb iii v and i i with higher hydrophobicity resulted in the increase of δs values there is one reasonable point of view that quaternary ammonium and hydroxyl groups in pa316tas adsorbent and mn co sr etc are surrounded by a lot of water in river water hence if mn co sr etc adsorb chemically on the surface of pa316tas adsorbent the destruction of the hydration shell of these functional groups and mn co sr etc will be required before the adsorption reactions of mn co sr etc against the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent occur in river water therefore some energy is required by these dehydration processes to the contrary the specific energy has been emitted to stabilize optimally the adsorptive conformation between mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent in river water in brief the δh values can be defined as the difference of released and absorbed energy between mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent in river water most of δh values were found to be slightly positive in the river system while all δh values became somewhat negative in the seawater system table 4 this describes that mn co sr etc in river water and seawater are primarily surrounded by h2o and inorganic salts in h2o respectively the δg values in the river water system were the same or smaller than those in the seawater system table 4 indicating that the adsorption reactions in river water occur easier 3 3 chromatography of cs sr2 and i a mixture of i and io3 ions on pa316tas adsorbent in river water and river water treated with ozone the apparatus for the chromatographic experiments of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions using pa316tas adsorbent was set up as illustrated in fig 2 the cs sr2 and i i and io3 chromatographic concentration curves were shown in fig 9 the saturated concentrations of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions were compatible with the initial ones indicating that the experimental breakthrough curves were appropriately obtained each concentration of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions was gradually saturated their effluent volumes of saturated points were 26 26 and 172 ml for cs sr2 and i i and io3 systems in river water respectively on the other hand the saturated points obtained from cs sr2 and i i and io3 systems in river water treated with ozone were 64 67 and 154 ml respectively the dead volume was also calculated and their volumes were found to be 12 12 and 16 ml in order of cs sr2 and i i and io3 in river water in case of river water treated with ozone the dead volume for cs sr2 and i i and io3 was 12 12 and 13 ml respectively the small difference among the dead volume was simply caused by exchanging the used ptfe tube with a new one based on the quantitative relationship between these concentration curves and the initial concentrations of feed solutions of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions the maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr2 and i i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent in the respective river water systems were calculated these data were summarized in table 5 and were compared with those reported mainly in the review articles liu et al 2014 olatunji et al 2015 alby et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the calculated maximum adsorption capacities were 1 7 10 4 and 1 8 10 3 for cs 7 8 10 5 and 5 6 10 4 for sr2 5 4 10 2 and 3 1 10 2 mol g pa316tas for i i and io3 in river water and river water treated with ozone respectively the shape of particles of pa316tas adsorbent did not change entirely after experiments see fig 10 the maximum adsorption capacities of cs in both river water systems were comparatively larger than those of sr2 it has been known that the ion radius of cs rion 0 168 nm rm o 0 307 nm rh2o 0 139 nm is larger than that of sr2 rion 0 125 nm rm o 0 264 nm rh2o 0 139 nm yokoyama 1995 basically the hydration number decreases gradually with an increase in the ion radius in alkali metals or alkaline earth metals in fact each hydration number of cs and sr2 are nh2o 7 0 1 0 and 8 1 0 1 in first hydration shell yokoyama 1995 and the binding force between cs and h2o is larger than that between sr2 and h2o lee 1977 moreover it is reasonable to consider that the dissociated hydroxyl carboxyl and sulfo groups have a stronger affinity in order of li na k rb and cs or mg2 ca2 sr2 ba2 following the order of hydration number caused by ion radius lee 1977 hence the maximum adsorption capacities of cs on pa316tas adsorbent became larger compared with those of sr2 apropos the larger maximum adsorption capacities of cs and sr2 on pa316tas adsorbent were obtained by ozonation of river water shinano river water contains dissolved fe and mn at the level of ppb mn2 and fe2 are interfering cations against cs and sr2 adsorption mn2 can precipitate as mno2 and the produced mno2 is also oxidized to mno4 by ozonation fe2 can transform into fe3 using ozone this fe3 can spontaneously react with h2o to be fe oh 3 which is a precipitation this means that these cationic species transform into anionic species or insoluble precipitation by ozone as a consequence the initial concentrations of the elements such as mn2 and fe2 decreased as a result of ozonation reactions the maximum adsorption capacity of cs for pa316tas adsorbent was even equal to the values among organic adsorbents including bio adsorbents or structurally unique adsorbents lu et al 2019 james et al 2019 as shown in table 5 moreover the maximum adsorption capacity of cs for pa316tas adsorbent was broadly similar to those of the promising prussian blue type adsorbents lee and streat 1983 ishfaq et al 1997 nilchi et al 2007 sangvanich et al 2010 torad et al 2012 du et al 2013 chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 hwang et al 2019 in spite of the existence of the elements contained originally in river water treated with ozone nevertheless the capacity of cs for pa316tas adsorbent were about five times as small as that in the literature sheha and el khouly 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity of sr2 for pa316tas adsorbent was much smaller than those of many other adsorbents even in ozone treated river water see table 5 the largest value refers to fe3o4 rgo adsorbent minitha et al 2018 thus the use of inorganic adsorbents may be more suitable for the simultaneous removal of cs and sr2 ions in aqueous solutions on the other hand it was found that the maximum adsorption capacity of i i and io3 in river water is larger than that in river water treated with ozone table 5 ozone can oxidize i to io3 in aqueous solutions in brief the dominant chemical form of i i and io3 is io3 in river water treated with ozone pa316tas adsorbent can simultaneously adsorb i and io3 in river water hence the difference of the maximum adsorption capacities between i i and io3 in river water and i i and io3 in river water treated with ozone was mainly caused by different adsorption mechanisms between i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent concretely i can directly bind pa316tas adsorbent while the chemical bond between the o in io3 and pa316tas adsorbent can be formed in case of io3 compared with those of i the k d values of io3 for pa316tas adsorbents were found to be higher table 1 this result is reasonable because i is able to bind selectively and weakly pa316tas adsorbent while pa316tas adsorbent has the selective and strong adsorption binding for io3 moreover the number of adsorption sites in pa316tas adsorbent for i is more than those for io3 especially it can be estimated that most of i and a portion of io3 may be adsorbed on the different adsorption sites in pa316tas adsorbent it has been known that the iodine benzene complex which is expected as a candidate for a real time of a bimolecular reaction is regarded as one of eda complexes kiviniemi et al 2009 pa316tas adsorbent has a number of hydroxyl groups and quaternary ammonium groups and moreover it has a few ether oxygen atoms carbonyl groups sulfo groups the frameworks composed of aromatic compounds in pa316tas adsorbent take on the characteristics of partial positive charge following the results from previous reports benesi and hildebrand 1949 on the other hand i and io3 assume originally the character of negative charge it is no wonder that there are any electrostatic interactions between i i and io3 and pa316tas adsorbent as seen from table 2 the k d values of i i and io3 for single tas adsorbent were very low in brief this means that the degree of electrostatic interactions is amplified after forming the bridge between pa316 resin and tas adsorbent using paraformaldehyde one research group suggests that the incorporation of i species into the som via covalent aromatic c i bond is the key mechanism controlling the adsorption behavior of i species xu et al 2011 they also showed the indirect evidence that the macro molecular conformation hydrophobic aliphatic periphery hindering the active aromatic cores and hydrophilic polysaccharides favoring the access by hydrophilic i species influences the interactions between i species and the som xu et al 2012 in conclusion it can be estimated that the eda complex or pseudo eda complex forms in the adsorption behavior between i i and io3 and pa316tas adsorbent if so the maximum adsorption capacities of i i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent should be much larger as it is to be expected the maximum adsorption capacities for i i and io3 in river water and river water treated with ozone were found to be 5 4 10 2 and 3 1 10 2 mol g pa316tas respectively in addition the structural change of aromatic c h bond based on i i and io3 adsorption onto pa316tas adsorbent was observed see fig 11 surprisingly these types of maximum adsorption ability were about twelve times as large as those which were way ahead of the published ones in the literature yang et al 2011 bo et al 2013 it has been known that io3 is likely reduced to reactive i species if the lignin and tannin like compounds or the carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules were contained in the system xu et al 2013a there is the potential for the decomposition of pa316tas adsorbent by reactive i species and the condensed aromatics and tannin like compounds may be generated hence the endurance tests of pa316tas adsorbent for cs sr2 i and io3 adsorption were performed in river water and river water treated with ozone as shown in fig 12 it was found that the retention capability of pa316tas adsorbent for these metal ions can be kept for at least 30 days the intensities of uv vis adsorption spectra of samples were drastically decreased before and after adsorption experiments indicating that the adsorption reactions between some metal ions and pa316tas adsorbent are maintained in the period see fig 13 s1 3 4 conclusion the syntheses of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents combined with tas induced from ta and pa316 ar 01 pyr wa10 wa20 and wa30 resins which are one of familiar anion exchange resins were successfully carried out to remove simultaneously various kinds of radionuclides in river water and ozone treated river water the adsorption behavior of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 on these composite adsorbents has been studied in real river water at room temperature pa316tas adsorbent showed much higher k d for all metal ions the k d values of pa316tas adsorbent were very different from those of the mixed adsorbents which are contained individually pa316s and tas adsorbents this result suggests that the change of electron density of the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent and or the different effect of steric hindrance in adsorption processes may be caused by the chemical combination between both adsorbents compared with those of individual tas and pa316 adsorbents in addition it can be considered that the dissolution of a part of tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent into river water may be prevented by cross linkage the k d values of mn co sr y cs ba eu and io3 decreased with increasing mixing ratio of pa316 structure this phenomenon means that tas adsorbent has more selective adsorption ability for these metal ions on the other hand it was found that y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 are adsorbed on both tas and pa316 adsorbents the optimized mixing ratio of pa316 to ta was 2 to 1 to evaluate the validity of these mechanistic expectations the respective chemical surroundings of pa316tas adsorbent and mn co sr etc were examined in river water ranging in temperature from 278 to 333 k as it is to be expected one straight line for mn co sr cs and ba systems and two types of straight lines for y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 systems were observed on the other hand the precipitation of mn co y ru rh te and eu was produced by ozonation of river water i e ozone can transform mn co y ru rh te and eu ions into the insoluble precipitates as a result one straight line for sr cs ba systems and two types of straight lines for sb i i and io3 systems were obtained in river water treated with ozone the number of straight line was compatible with the number of adsorption mechanism the chromatography experiments of cs sr and i i and io3 were carried out to obtain their maximum adsorption capacities the obtained maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr and i i mixed with io3 were 1 7 10 4 cs 1 8 10 3 cs o3 7 8 10 5 sr 5 6 10 4 sr o3 5 4 10 2 i and io3 3 1 10 2 i and io3 o3 mol g pa316tas it was discovered that the maximum adsorption capacity of i i and io3 for the composite adsorbent is unprecedented high and the capacity becomes larger more than one order of magnitude compared with those of previous reports this phenomenon indicates the formation of eda complex or pseudo eda complex in consideration of these results it was concluded that the combined use of pa316tas adsorbent and ozone made it possible to remove simultaneously and effectively various kinds of radionuclides in river water and ozone treated river water in the wide ph and temperature ranges declaration of competing interest to the best of

water ranging in temperature from 278 to 333 k as was expected one adsorption mechanism for mn co sr cs and ba systems and two types of adsorption mechanisms for y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 systems were observed on the other hand the precipitation of mn co y ru rh te and eu was formed by ozonation for river water that is ozone can transform mn co y ru rh te and eu ions into the insoluble

capacity become much greater than an order of magnitude compared with those of previous reports this phenomenon suggests the formation of electron donor acceptor eda complexes or pseudo eda complex based on these results it was concluded that the combined use of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents and ozone made it possible to remove simultaneously and effectively various kinds of radionuclides in river water in the wide ph and temperature ranges graphical abstract image 1 keywords tannic acid type organic composite adsorbent radionuclide ozone river water simultaneous removal adsorption behavior 1 introduction triggered by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku m w 9 0 great earthquake and the subsequent tsunami a large amount of contaminated water with radioactive nuclides such as cesium 137 strontium 90 and iodine 131 was generated by means of sustained injections of seawater and desalinated water for emergency core cooling risen in temperature due to the disappearance of all cooling functions in fukushima daiichi nuclear power station since the severe accident various decontamination systems have been proposed these decontamination systems are smoothly in operation without serious troubles now however their systems are individually focused on different target elements which should be removed from contaminated water besides the radioactive solid wastes produced from the present decontamination equipment combined with precipitation and adsorption processes of radionuclides have been increasing day by day moreover it is predicted that the disposal of radioactive solid wastes involves immeasurable cost at this time recently the latest system without a precipitation process has been developed to overcome this cost problem however a number of adsorption towers embedded with many kinds of adsorbents are used in this system because these adsorbents cannot simultaneously remove many kinds of radionuclides the contaminants after the conventional decontamination processes include activation products manganese 54 cobalt 60 etc derived from nuclear reactor materials and fission products strontium 89 strontium 90 yttrium 90 ruthenium 106 rhodium 106 antimony 125 tellurium 125m cesium 134 cesium 137 etc from the damaged nuclear fuels tachibana et al 2018 europium a 154 155 which is one of main fission products has also more of academic interest from the viewpoint of the chemical similarity with trivalent actinides such as americium and curium tomobuchi et al 2015 iodine is regarded as one of important fission products released from nuclear accidents into the environment particularly iodine 129 which is a beta gamma emitting radioisotope 29 5 kev 20 4 and 29 8 kev 37 7 for x ray 39 6 kev 7 5 for gamma ray to stable xenon 129 is considered to be one possible candidate of environmental tracer nuclides because of the very long half life 1 57 107 years hou and hou 2012 ohno et al 2013a 2014b steinhauser 2014 stan sion et al 2015 xu et al 2015 owing to an extremely long radioactive half life it has been well known that iodine 129 poses virtually little radiological hazard to the human body tumey et al 2013 reversely iodine 131 having the physical properties of half life 8 021 days energy of gamma ray 364 kev 10 and energy of beta ray 606 kev 90 mody et al 2015 is one of the most harmful radionuclides in other words iodine 131 causes pediatric thyroid cancer through contaminated food and breathing in contaminated air because it has the highest radioactivity among radionuclides released immediately into the environment by nuclear severe accidents miyake et al 2012 ohno et al 2013b xu et al 2013b 2015 on the other hand i 131 can be used to cure pediatric thyroid cancer as a medicine the amount of contaminated water containing radionuclides has been increasing with each passing day and the total volume of contaminated water has been estimated to approximately 1 100 000 m3 indicating that the volume exceeds ca 80 of the total storage capacity prepared for the solution of fukushima issues it has been widely accepted that tannic acid ta has the high adsorption ability for many kinds of metal ions such as cesium gurung et al 2013 strontium tachibana et al 2014a b uranium yamazaki et al 2015 manganese üçer et al 2006 lanthanides tachibana et al 2014a b etc in aqueous solutions however the adsorption ability for iodine is not so high tachibana et al 2016 especially it has been known that the chemical structure has the high adsorption ability for uranium in seawater because the adsorption mechanism is the electrostatic interaction between uo2 11 co3 6 oh 12 2 and the single chemical bond between the oxygen and carbon atom with higher positive charge caused by the electronegativity in hydroxyl groups in bisphenol a tachibana et al 2019 ta is also regarded as the property of cheap and easy to obtain high scalability high safety possible to incinerate additionally it can be expected that ta has the sufficient radiation and heat resistance tachibana et al 2014a b however even if the difficult issues of tritium decontamination is excluded it is recognized that the simultaneous removal capability for specific metal ions such as manganese cobalt strontium yttrium ruthenium rhodium antimony tellurium cesium barium europium iodine etc using an operating adsorption separation technology is not necessarily met for the water quality standards for ocean release the innovative decontamination technology to meet environmental criteria and to reduce drastically these radioactive liquid wastes will be requested in the near future apropos some radionuclides produced from nuclear fuels were released into the environment by sudden hydrogen explosion in the nuclear power station in the metropolitan area in japan the latest water purification plants using ozone and biological activated carbon are in operation and the countermeasure against iodine contamination from the severe accident was associated with a threefold increase in an amount of activated carbon in those days however a small amount of radioactive iodine was detected regardless of the above countermeasure although the detected radioactivity was very low and did not have an effect on the human body judging from the negative effect of radionuclides on the human body and environment the noteworthy radionuclides from the severe accident are iodine 131 cesium 134 secium 137 and strontium 90 hence it is needed to develop alternatives to activated carbon and the required adsorption ability is to remove several types of radionuclides simultaneously from contaminated river water ozone o3 is known as one of high powered oxidants with selective reactivity the purification and disinfection of drinking water deodorization of stench in air detoxification of hazardous pesticides released into the environment and organic syntheses have been broadly applied by means of unique nature of o3 hoigné 1998 ikehata et al 2006 tachibana et al 2012a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 advanced oxidation process aop and catalytic ozonation are often used to decompose hard to degrade compounds rapidly in the water purification plants el raady 2005 tachibana et al 2012b the main aop methods are based on free radical reactions and are classified as homogeneous and heterogeneous systems hoigné 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 on the other hand catalytic ozonation has been classified into two categories i e one is a heterogeneous catalyst system and the other is a homogeneous one el raady 2005 tachibana et al 2012b however the chemical behavior of the specific metal ions contained in spent nuclear fuels during ozonation has not been widely discussed in the literatures because these metal ions are faced with constant and complicated change concretely the valence state and chemical structure of these metal ions can be changed by ozonation el raady 2005 in brief the adsorption behavior between adsorbents and these metal ions will become altered hence it is very important to evaluate the adsorption ability for these metal ions before and after ozonation two kinds of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents have been previously developed for simultaneous removal of these radionuclides in diluted normal and concentrated seawater one composite adsorbent named ar 01tas is chemically combined with benzimidazole type anion exchange resin which is embedded in high porous silica beads ar 01 and tas by using paraformaldehyde as one of cross linking reagents in mixed acid containing sulfuric acid and trichloroacetic acid the other is a composite adsorbent composed of a porous type strongly basic anion exchange resin pa316 and tas called pa316tas adsorbent the adsorption ability of ar 01tas and pa316tas adsorbents for various kinds of metal ions has been checked in seawater at room temperature tachibana et al 2016 2018 in these manuscripts it has been reported that ar 01tas adsorbent can strongly adsorb transition metals lanthanides actinides and iodine species to the contrary it was also revealed that ar 01tas adsorbent has much lower adsorption ability for cesium strontium and barium in seawater the adsorption ability for cesium strontium and barium were relatively improved only in case of pa316tas adsorbent and pa316tas adsorbent demonstrated excellence in the simultaneous adsorption ability for metal ions in seawater thus a novel composite adsorbent such as pa316tas adsorbent which allows for simultaneous removal of various kinds of radionuclides under any circumstances must be required for nuclear severe accidents on the basis of the background described above six kinds of novel tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents abbreviated as pa316tas ar 01tas pyrtas wa10tas wa20tas and wa30tas adsorbents respectively combined with pa316 ar 01 pyridine type anion exchange resin pyr acrylic type weakly basic anion exchange resin wa10 or styrene type weakly basic anion exchange resins wa20 and wa30 and tas see fig 1 and the composite adsorbents with the different mixture ratio of the anion exchange resin to ta have been synthesized and the adsorption behavior of manganese cobalt strontium etc on these composite adsorbents has been studied to find the optimized adsorbent for simultaneous removal of twelve kinds of radionuclides in real river water at room temperature in addition the effect of the mixing ratio of the anion exchange resin and ta ph value concentration factor of river water reaction temperature and ozone on the adsorption behavior of the metal ions using the selected adsorbent has been examined to reveal their adsorption mechanisms in river water moreover the maximum adsorption capacities and the endurance tests of the optimized adsorbent for the selected metal ions in river water and river water treated with ozone were performed to evaluate the practicality of the optimized adsorbent in the present water purification plants using ozone and biological activated carbon and or to confirm the validity to apply to the decontamination plants of radionuclides without a precipitation process under the severe accidents 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and river water samples hno3 solutions of 0 10 m m mol dm3 dm3 l with 1 0 g l elements mn

borosilicate glass fiber filter whose pore size and thickness were 2 μm and 1200 μm made by merck kgaa before all adsorption experiments river water has the possibility that natural organic matter nom is contained the nom in river water can potentially affect the removal efficiency of the examined metal ions by the adsorbents due to the interaction of the nom with adsorbent surfaces and or the examined metal ions such as complex reactions and or redox reactions the detection of the nom using an uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu co japan equipped with a quartz cell optical path length 1 00 0 01 cm was attempted at room temperature the spectra obtained from ultrapure water and the river water were slightly different around the ultraviolet region concretely the absorbance of the river water increased gradually with a decrease in wavelength from ca 360 nm 190 nm this implies that metal ions contained originally and or the nom are contained in the river water subsequently the detection of the decomposition products of the nom formic acid oxalic acid etc produced by ozone was examined using an ion chromatograph ic made by tosoh ic 2001 because humic acid and fulvic acid which are classified as the nom have amorphous structure and they are very hard to analyze them qualitatively and quantitatively the following measurement condition of ic was used a mixture of 0 2 mm nahco3 15 mm h3bo3 and 6 0 mm na2b4o7 as a mobile phase was supplied at 0 8 ml min into tskgel superic anion type column made by tosoh id 4 6 mm 150 mm length whose temperature was kept constant at 313 k by using a column oven 5 μm spherical particles packed in the column are modified with a quaternary ammonium group an electrical conductivity detector was used however as a result it was hard to detect the formic acid and oxalic acid in the river water in addition the detection of the other decomposition products was also performed using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc made by shimadzu co japan the measurement condition of the hplc was set as follows a mixture of meoh and h2o volume ratio 9 1 as a mobile phase was supplied at 1 5 ml min using a lc 6ad type pump a silica 2 column made of phenomenex id 4 6 mm 150 mm length packed with 5 μm spherical particles was used the column temperature was kept constant at 323 k by using a column oven cto 10asvp and an uv detector at 210 nm was used as a result any peaks were not observed on the other hand the detection of mn and fe elements in the river water was possible therefore it can be estimated that the concentration of the nom in the river water is extremely low and the influence of the nom for the removal efficiency of the examined metals is in a small degree then it was attempted to adjust the concentrations of the examined metal ions in river water to approximately 1 0 10 5 m and an uc 0515 type ultrasonic apparatus made by tocho was used to dissolve the metal salts into river water however the finally confirmed concentrations of mn co te sb ru rh y and eu were somewhat lower than 1 0 10 5 m by their precipitation formation hence the precipitates were also cleared by using the same glass fiber filter next the diluted river water was prepared by mixing ultrapure water with normal river water while the concentrated river water was obtained by evaporating river water slowly at about 373 k using the same hotplate and infrared heating and drying lamp it took at least a couple of days to evaporation of the river water its concentration factor cf was 1 10 1 5 1 2 1 2 3 and 5 respectively the initial concentrations in river water were individually 7 8 0 1 10 6 m mn 8 5 0 1 10 6 m co 1 2 0 0 10 5 m sr 4 7 0 1 10 6 m y 5 5 0 0 10 7 m ru 6 1 0 1 10 6 m rh 2 2 0 0 10 6 m sb 2 5 0 0 10 7 m te 9 6 0 0 10 6 m cs 9 9 0 1 10 6 m ba 1 8 0 0 10 6 m eu 2 0 0 0 10 5 m i i and io3 at a maximum it can be reasonably confirmed that the concentrations of most of the dissolved metal ions in river water are comparatively higher than those in seawater tachibana et al 2018 the adjustment of the initial ph of river water was performed using hcl and naoh and the corresponding ph values were checked using a ph tester with 0 1 ph resolution hi98103s hanna all sample solutions were prepared by mixing ultrapure water produced with a milli q integral 3 type water purification system made by merck millipore before use it was confirmed that the values of specific electrical resistance and concentration of total organic carbon are more than 18 2 mωcm and less than 3 ppb ppb ng g respectively o3 gas was generated from o2 gas with the purity of 99 5 using an ed og r6 type o3 generator made by ecodesign inc the o2 gas was provided from shimakyu co ltd 2 3 syntheses of composite adsorbents six kinds of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents were synthesized as following ta mw 1701 8 g mol 1 41 10 2 mol was added into the six 0 5 l recovery flasks with 0 1 l h2so4 respectively each mixture was sufficiently stirred using a rv 10 digital v type rotary evaporator made by ika for 3 days at 358 k until ta was completely dissolved in the acid solutions it was observed that the color of the solutions became black after the hydrolysis and sulfonation reactions of ta the product of hydrolyzed and sulfonated ta tas was obtained see fig 1 then ar 01 cl form pyr cl form pa316 cl form wa10 oh form wa20 oh form or wa30 oh form resins 50 0 g as dry resin paraformaldehyde 7 05 10 2 mol as 1 3 5 trioxane and trichloroacetic acid 9 80 10 2 mol were sequentially and individually mixed into the six mixtures and the temperature was kept constant at ca 273 k in the bath with ice water to prevent the thermal decomposition of these adsorbents under the same temperature condition the six mixtures were stirred by using the bar made of polytetrafluoroethylene these mixtures were slowly warmed to 333 k in the oil bath based on the previous information that the operational temperature limit of pa316 wa10 wa20 and wa30 resins is lower than 333 373 k in case of cl and oh forms although ar 01 and pyr type anion exchange resins have the enough thermal stability nomura et al 1996 sato et al 2009 the temperature limit was set to 333 k in common with other resins the reaction temperature was kept constant at 333 k for 2 days at this stage each tas structure was chemically combined with pa316 ar 01 pyr wa10 wa20 and wa30 resins through the cross linking reactions by paraformaldehyde in the concentrated acid solution at 333 k the unreacted tas unreacted paraformaldehyde trichloroacetic acid and sulfuric acid contained in all composite adsorbents were rinsed with 1 0 l h2o 0 25 l methanol and 0 25 l acetone the series of washing procedures were repeated until the filtrate is colorless this procedure was repeated three times under this condition the most suitable form of hydroxyl and sulfo groups contained in all composite adsorbents will be h form therefore h form in all composite adsorbents was exchanged with na form using a saturated nacl solution of 500 ml this ion exchange method was repeated more than three times the removal of residual nacl on the composite adsorbents was carried out using ultrapure water all composite adsorbents were dried on a plastic tray using a vacuum drying equipment at 333 k for a night subsequently all the composite adsorbents were dried naturally without vacuum drying process for another overnight finally the six kinds of composite adsorbents pa316tas wa10tas wa20tas wa30tas ar 01tas and pyrtas adsorbents were obtained and the calculated yields were found to be 95 3 53 2 79 8 68 4 84 0 and 84 3 respectively tas adsorbent yield 82 6 was also synthesized by the similar method for the above composite adsorbents in addition pa316s resin was prepared through the treatment of pa316 resin by h2so4 moreover ta 2 82 10 5 1 41 10 2 mol was added into the respective 0 5 l recovery flasks with 0 1 l h2so4 and five types of pa316tas adsorbents with the different mixture ratios of pa316 ta 2 1 10 1 50 1 100 1 and 1000 1 were synthesized using paraformaldehyde in trichloroacetic acid and sulfuric acid solutions at 333 k the average yield of the synthesized composite adsorbents was found to be approximately 86 95 this synthetic method was based on the results of our previous work tachibana et al 2018 as a result of sieving the five kinds of pa316tas adsorbents it was found that the particle size is distributed in two kinds of ranges between 300 600 μm and 600 1180 μm the surface condition of all pa316tas adsorbents were observed by a ve 8800 type sem made by keyence and an iraffinity 1s type ft ir analyzer made by shimadzu combined with a well known kbr or kcl pellet method these sample pellets were prepared by grinding pa316tas adsorbents and kbr or kcl on an agate mortar the weight ratio of each pa316tas adsorbents and kbr or kcl in the sample pellets was adjusted to 1 500 in this paper most of these data were not shown because the similar data have already been reported in our previous work tachibana et al 2018 2 4 adsorption experiments using composite adsorbents in the adsorption experiments a batch wise method was used in order to evaluate the distribution coefficients k d of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 using the prepared adsorbents in various kinds of river water and in a wide temperature range all experiments were repeated more than three times and the levels of confidence of the error bar and standard derivation in the figures and tables represent 1σ the initial chemical forms of counter cation and anion of tas adsorbent pa316 resin and all composite adsorbents were composed of na and cl ions two types of vials made of polypropylene and borosilicate glass were prepared generally an inner surface of glass vial can adsorb a metal ion through an ion exchange reaction and or a hydrophobic interaction on the other hand some adsorption ability of a metal ion for an inner surface of polypropylene tube via a hydrophobic interaction can also be confirmed therefore before measurements methanol were added into the vial and tube with river water to confirm the degree of the adsorption ability by the hydrophobic interaction and the ion exchange reaction among them the concentrations of the added metal ions were preliminarily checked before and after experiments under the condition temp 278 333 k no adsorbents the significant difference of concentrations of metal ions before and after experiments was not able to be observed as a result of the experiments from this result the adsorption behavior between the inner surface of materials and the added metal ions can be almost negligible in the experimental condition each river water with the examined metal ions 10 ml was added into the containers containing the adsorbents 100 or 250 mg as dry weight the data summarized in table 1 were obtained using 250 mg adsorbents while the experiments in table 2 were done using 100 mg and 250 mg adsorbents as a result it was found that the k d values between 100 and 250 mg adsorbents are very similar under equilibrium conditions even in case that the both adsorbents were not sieved therefore the subsequent adsorption experiments were carried out using the preliminarily sieved 100 mg pa316tas adsorbent in many other experiments because of saving the usage of the adsorbent then the containers were sufficiently stirred using a rotary shaker at room temperature or in a shaking water bath kept constant at 278 333 k the shaking time was more than 24 h each concentration of the examined metal ions in aqueous solutions before and after adsorption tests was measured using a 7700x type icp ms analyzer made by agilent and or an aa 6200 type aas analyzer made by shimadzu before these measurements the aqueous solutions were filtered using a regenerated cellulose fiber filter whose pore size was 0 45 μm provided from sartorious stedim to remove the adsorbents in the samples or the adsorbents and solutions were separated by using a h 36α type centrifuge separator made by kokusan these parameters were set to 3500 rpm and 30 min some of these procedures have been previously mentioned in the ref tachibana et al 2018 the solution environment of river water after adsorption experiments was checked using an uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu co japan at room temperature the quartz cell with optical path length of 1 00 0 01 cm was used 2 5 chromatography experiments one glass column made by nihon seimitsu kagaku co ltd was used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr2 i i and io3 on pa316tas adsorbent in river water at 298 k before and after ozonation using a typical chromatographic technique the glass column was equipped with the water jacket made of glass this jacket was used to maintain the constant temperature in the column the length of glass column was 10 cm and its id was 10 mm each apparatus was connected in series with a polytetrafluoroethylene tube id 2 mm and outer diameter od of 3 mm see fig 2 then the above mentioned pa316tas adsorbent was packed into the column each total weight of the adsorbents added into the column was 1 05 g for cs sr2 pa316tas and 1 01 g for cs sr2 pa316tas o3 systems for i i and io3 pa316tas and i i and io3 pa316tas o3 systems each total weight of the embedded adsorbents was 1 01 g and 1 00 g respectively by using a ltci 150hp type circulator and air conditioner the reaction temperature was kept constant at 298 k after the form of pa316tas adsorbent was preliminarily conditioned to na and cl forms by using a saturated nacl solution pa316tas adsorbent was rinsed using ultrapure water completely to remove free nacl and visible bubble of air in the column before experiments the dissolved air in the mobile phase was certainly deaerated using an ultrasonic apparatus the column chromatography experiments of cs sr2 i with io3 ions whose concentrations are 7 7 10 3 m cs 3 9 10 3 m sr and 3 5 10 2 m i and io3 in river water and 7 1 10 3 m cs 3 4 10 3 m sr and 3 1 10 2 m i and io3 in river water treated with ozone were performed under the constant flow rate of 1 3 ml min for cs and sr system and 2 2 ml min for i and io3 system in the pressure below 2 0 mpa the individual effluent volume of the river water without and with o3 was 457 ml and 387 ml for cs and sr test and 429 ml and 382 ml for i and io3 test respectively in all tests the flow rate of the mobile phase was controlled by a high pressure fixed displacement plunger pump equipped with an analogue pressure gauge np kx 210 nihon seimitsu kagaku the column eluate was regularly collected using a chf100aa type fraction collector made by advantech each eluent volume in the tube was ca 5 0 or 2 5 ml for cs and sr2 system and 5 0 or 4 5 ml for i i and io3 system the ph values of each collected sample solution were measured using the same ph tester the concentrations of cs sr2 i i and io3 were measured by using the icp ms analyzer the aqueous solutions containing 1 wt hno3 were used as a diluent for all icp ms and aas measurements pa316tas adsorbent do not strongly adsorb na ion which exists in river water as cationic species if pa316tas adsorbent has some adsorption ability for na ion the concentration contained in river water is large excess compared with that of the adsorption capacity of pa316tas adsorbent for na ion as a result the adsorption effect for the dead volume can be vanishingly small hence the dead volume was estimated by measuring the concentration of na ion in the eluents each dead volume from cs and sr systems without and with o3 was 12 2 ml and 12 5 ml on the other hand both dead volume for i and io3 systems without or with o3 was 13 0 ml the slight difference is attributable to the different sampling intervals each concentration of na ion in samples was measured by using the icp ms and aas analyzers 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption behavior of mn co sr etc on tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents in river water at room temperature the adsorption experiments of twelve kinds of metal ions mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 using six kinds of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents pa316tas ar 01tas pyrtas wa10tas wa20tas and wa30tas adsorbents were performed by a well known batch wise method and their adsorption behavior was evaluated using the distribution coefficients k d a u values of these twelve kinds of metal ions in river water at room temperature the calculation of all k d values was performed using the following eq 1 1 k d c r c s v s v r c 0 c s c s v s v r where each symbol with a subscript c 0 c s c r v s and v r indicates initial concentration of mn co sr etc in solution concentration of mn co sr etc in solution after adsorption equilibrium concentration of mn co sr etc on an adsorbent after adsorption equilibrium volume of sample solution and volume of resin table 1 shows the comparison of the k d values of mn co sr etc for these composite adsorbents in river water at room temperature pyrtas ar 01tas wa10tas and wa20tas adsorbents had a little or little adsorption ability of mn and cs k d 102 a little adsorption ability for co and sr using pyrtas ar 01tas and wa10tas adsorbents was observed k d 102 pyrtas wa10tas and wa20tas adsorbents had a little adsorption ability for i in particular pyrtas adsorbent did not adsorb selectively y ba and eu from river water k d 102 on the other hand wa30tas and pa316tas adsorbents showed much higher k d values for all metal ions particularly most of the k d values for pa316tas adsorbent were higher than those of wa30tas adsorbent in limited case of cs sr and i which are frequently discussed in decontamination process in the environment from these results we have chosen pa316tas adsorbent as one of promising adsorbents for simultaneous removal of these radionuclides in river water in table 2 it was confirmed that the k d values between pa316 adsorbent and these metal ions are very similar to those of pa316s adsorbent this tendency implies that pa316 adsorbent is not mostly sulfonated by the treatment of h2so4 at 333 k however ta can react with h2so4 to form tas adsorbent even at room temperature it was confirmed that the color of sample solutions became yellow slightly after experiments using tas adsorbent and the adsorption ability of tas adsorbent for i i and io3 has comparatively lower than that of the other examined metal ions i species in soils are considered to be bound predominantly to soil organic matter som xu et al 2011 2012 the som contains mainly humic acid and fulvic acid and it can be regarded that the chemical structures of humic acid and fulvic acid are similar to those of ta and tas from the viewpoint of the aromatic structures with many functional groups hence this result indicates that a part of tas adsorbent with i i and io3 was dissolved into the river water moreover tas adsorbent and pa316 adsorbent were simultaneously added into the river water containing these metal ions as a result the simply mixed tas and pa316 adsorbents had a little or little adsorption ability for mn sr rh sb cs ba and i i and io3 the dissolved tas adsorbent adsorbed preferentially on pa316 adsorbent indicating that the adsorption reactions between tas adsorbent and metal ions were inhibited this result was very different from that of pa316tas adsorbent although the fact that ar 01 pa316 and tas adsorbents have no adsorption ability for io3 ion in seawater was previously reported ar 01tas and pa316tas adsorbents had comparatively higher adsorption ability for both i and io3 ions in various types of seawater and in the wide temperature range tachibana et al 2016 2018 however the reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is a matter for speculation that the change of the electron density of the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent and or the different effect of steric hindrance in adsorption processes were caused by the chemical combination of pa316 and tas adsorbents by the chemical combination of both adsorbents compared with those of individual pa316 and tas adsorbents furthermore it can be predicted that the dissolution of a part of tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent into the river water may be prevented by the polymerization reactions between pa316 and tas adsorbents table 3 offers the comparison data of the k d values of the metal ions for various pa316tas adsorbents in river water at room temperature as seen from this continuous change the k d values of mn co sr y cs ba eu and io3 decreased sharply or gradually with an increase in the mixing ratio of pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbents furthermore pa316tas adsorbents combined chemically with the weight ratios of pa316 ta 10 1 50 1 100 1 and 1000 1 have exceptionally low or no adsorption ability for mn co sr cs and ba in river water at room temperature these k d values also decrease gradually in order of pa316 ta 2 1 10 1 50 1 100 1 and 1000 1 basically this phenomenon implies that tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent has the selective adsorption ability for these metal ions on the other hand y eu and io3 were adsorbed on both pa316 and tas structures because the corresponding k d values did not become zero in the mixing ratio from 2 1 to 1000 1 as a mixing ratio of pa316 to ta these metal ions have the possibility for existence as a few chemical species subsequently the k d values of ru rh sb te and i were compared when the mixing ratio of pa316 to ta is adjusted between 2 1 and 1000 1 it was found that these k d values share similar values in brief pa316 structure in pa316 adsorbents had very high adsorption ability for ru rh sb te and i eventually the optimized mixing ratio of pa316 to ta was 2 to 1 even in case of river water system in analogy with the result of seawater table 3 most of the k d values for river water system were a few orders of magnitude greater than those for seawater system table 3 this main difference is caused by a high salt concentration in seawater therefore the above adsorption behavior of the target metal ions has been examined in order to understand the adsorption equilibrium mechanisms in river water in more depth under the conditions ph 1 9 7 6 after adsorption equilibrium temp room temperature and cf of river water 0 10 0 20 0 50 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 fig 3 provides the data plotting the k d values of the target metal ions using pa316tas adsorbent against the final ph values in river water at room temperature as a result it was revealed that the k d values of mn co ba cs and sr increase linearly with increasing ph values in river water it is instructive to recognize that the hydroxyl group modified in pa316tas adsorbent is scarcely dissociated in higher acidic region however it is gradually dissociated from the weak acid concentration range in short the cation exchange reactions between mn ii co ii ba ii cs i or sr ii ions and the hydroxyl group substituted by na ion in pa316tas adsorbent occurred preferentially in river water the adsorption behavior of k d of ru and rh y and eu was very similar respectively the plots with the maximum values were observed in case of ru rh y eu sb and te systems the plots of i i and io3 were almost parallel to the axis of ph values these phenomena can be explained as follows rh element can exist as rh i rh ii and rh iii ions in acid solutions in the presence of complexing agents or chemicals colom 1985 the most stable and important oxidation state of rh is considered as trivalent although rh takes up a variety of oxidation states there is cl ion ranging in concentration from ca 1 47 10 4 to 2 91 10 4 m in river water hirayama 1992 fujinaga et al 2017 therefore the chemical form of rh iii ion was estimated using the following stability constants β 1 2 45 β 2 4 54 β 3 5 92 β 4 7 08 β 5 8 68 β 6 8 36 temp 298 k ionic strength 1 0 m cozzi and pantani 1958 as a result it can be estimated that rh3 and rhcl2 are main species see fig 4 however pa316 adsorbent which is one of anion exchange resins adsorbed rh in river water as shown in table 2 the portion of rh should be anionic chemical forms the sulfate ion is generally contained in river water for example rh so4 2 may be dominantly formed as a result it can be predicted that tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent simultaneously adsorbs rh iii and rh so4 2 with increasing ph values while pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent selectively adsorbs rh so4 2 with decreasing ph values by the competition reaction between the pa316 structure and oh it can be reasonably accepted that ru ii and ru iii tend to form stable complex ions such as ru h2o 6 2 ru h2o 5cl ru h2o 6 3 and ru h2o 5cl2 in river water whereas ru iv is more stable oxidation state in non complexing aqueous solutions colom 1985 ru iii will be more stable than ru ii from their redox potentials ru vi and ru viii such as ruo4 2 and ruo4 aq are more stable oxidation states in neutral and basic solutions but the structure of these ions depends on the ph values of solutions colom 1985 hence it can be estimated that tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent simultaneously adsorbs ru iii and ru vi with increasing ph values of river water while the k d values of ru vi for pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent decreases gradually with an increase in the ph values because of the adsorption reaction between the pa316 structure and oh in analogy with the rh iii system the rare earth elements rees such as y iii and eu iii can form rees iii rees iii so4 rees iii co3 rees iii co3 2 and rees iii oh2 in an aqueous solution see fig 4 mironov et al 1982 millero 1992 liu and byrne 1998 the k d values of the rees for pa316tas adsorbent increased sharply with an increase in the ph values until about ph 4 this result means that the cation exchange reactions between rees such as rees iii and rees iii so4 and tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent occur preferentially on the other hand the fraction of rees iii co3 2 increased gradually in the ph range between 6 and 9 indicating that the anion exchange reactions between rees iii co3 2 and pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent proceeded dominantly however the k d values in the ph range decreased obviously this phenomenon suggests the possibility that pa316tas adsorbent adsorbs more selectively rees iii rather than rees iii co3 2 te element can take some valence states ii i iv vi in an aqueous solution d c mcphail has already provided the stability constants between these te species and o2 g h in the wide temperature range mcphail 1995 hence the chemical forms of these te species dissolved in river water at 298 k were predicted using these data the total concentration of dissolved oxygen gas o2 g t in river water was referred from the database of japanese industrial standard for testing methods for industrial wastewater jis k 0102 2016 there are no cationic te species in the examined ph range as shown in fig 4 h6teo6 aq and h2teo3 aq were main te species in the range from ph 3 to 7 while the fractions of h3teo3 h5teo6 and h4teo6 2 increased at the both ends of the examined ph range strangely this implies that pa316tas adsorbent can adsorb neutral species such as h6teo6 aq and h2teo3 aq although the adsorption of these neutral te species for simple pa316 and tas adsorbents could not be clearly confirmed because of lower ph values moreover the potential diagram of sb has been provided from the literature past 1985 in brief it is reported that sb can exist as sb v 2o5 aq sb iv 2o4 aq sb iii 4o6 aq etc in acid and neutral solutions while sb v oh 6 sb iii oh 4 sb iii o2 etc can form in a basic solution in addition single sb iii ion can exist in very small concentration in an aqueous solution for a wide interval of ph value from 2 to 10 4 solubility of sb iii 4o6 aq does not depend on the ph value indicating a nonionic solute which is considered as meta antimonious acid hsb v o2 aq or sb iii o oh aq past 1985 there are neutral species e g sb iii 4o6 aq in the weak acid solution and anionic species e g sb v oh 6 in the weak basic solution the k d values of sb became constant between ph 2 to 5 and the k d values of sb decreased gradually with an increase in the ph values in more than ph 5 see fig 3 as well as h3teo3 h5teo6 and h4teo6 2 anionic species such as sb v oh 6 etc were not strongly adsorbed on pa316tas adsorbent hence the plots of two bent straight lines were obtained from te and sb systems compared with those of pa316 resin and tas adsorbent as well as the previously reported result tachibana et al 2018 the electron density of functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent and or the different effect of steric hindrance in adsorption processes may be changed by the chemical combination of both adsorbents the further effort to reveal this adsorption behavior will be required i element has various kinds of chemical forms in an aqueous solution as well as te it has been already reported that i element can exist as neutral i2 aq i2o2 aq hoi aq and anionic species i i3 io3 i2oh io i2o2 buxton and mulazzani 2007 the neutral species form through the radical and disproportion reactions such as i i i2 aq 2io i2o2 aq i2oh hoi aq i in addition the production of i3 i2oh io i2o2 is incomplete without i2 production however the oxidizing agents such as o3 and h2o2 were not added into the river water under the experimental condition the pk a values of hi and hio3 were 0 78 vanýsek 2014 and 10 brownstein and stillman 1959 respectively therefore it can be considered that i element keeps the chemical forms of i and io3 in river water the k d values of i i and io3 became almost constant in the ph range between 1 9 and 7 6 shown in fig 3 the simple tas adsorbent has little adsorption ability for i and io3 ions see table 2 hence this phenomenon means that pa316 structure and tas structure near pa316 structure in pa316tas adsorbent adsorb selectively i and io3 ions in river water in the wide ph value range it was also found that the adsorption of i element i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent is difficult to be interrupted by the ph values of river water the result of plots of k d values vs cf was arranged in fig 3 as seen in this figure the k d values of sr ii cs i ba ii i i v decreased gradually with increasing concentration factor cf of river water in order of 0 10 0 20 0 50 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 because of an increase in concentration of the elements contained originally in river water the k d values of mn ii co ii y iii ru iii vi rh iii sb iii v and eu iii except for te iv vi also decreased with increasing concentration factor cf up to 1 0 due to the completion reactions by the elements contained originally in river water then these k d values became almost constant between cf 1 0 and 5 0 especially the k d values of ru and rh were very similar between these cfs in short the adsorption species between ru iii vi and rh iii on pa316tas adsorbent may have very similar conformation indicating that the formation of unique complexes containing ru and rh separately manbeck et al 2017 ghosh et al 2019 on the other hand the k d values for te iv vi were almost constant in the cf range this means that pa316tas adsorbent has massively higher selectivity for te iv vi in river water it can be seen that pa316tas adsorbent has high adsorption ability for all metal ions even in cf 5 0 3 2 thermodynamic evaluation between mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent in river water and ozone treated river water milonjić sk has mentioned that the equilibrium constant k is improperly presented with a certain unit in many manuscripts in spite of the fact that the unit of g is j mol and the unit of r t is also j mol in gibbs equation milonjić 2007 this means that the k variable must be absolutely dimensionless in the case when k is given in l g the k can be easily recalculated to become dimensionless by multiplying it by 1000 g l which is equal to the solution density of h2o milonjić 2007 for example the recalculation of k l mol as dimensionless by multiplying the k by 55 5 number of moles per liter of h2o solution mol l has been suggested anastropoulos and kyzas 2016 for the adsorption system based on langmuir model the respective correct values can be obtained by multiplying langmuir equilibrium constant b m with 55 5 because of b m unit l mol anastropoulos and kyzas 2016 hence the converted gibbs equation can take the following form g r t ln 55 5 k r t ln 55 5 b m respectively to the contrary if the k d value has a dimensionless unit the k d value can be directly used in place of dimensionless k based on this analysis approach the respective chemical surroundings of mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent were examined in river water and river water treated with ozone to evaluate experimentally the validity of aforesaid discussions the apparent thermodynamic parameters which are h s and g values for the adsorption of mn co sr etc on pa316tas adsorbent mixing ratio of pa316 ta 2 1 were calculated from the linear plots of ln k versus 1 t using the following van t hoff equation 2 under the following condition pa316tas adsorbent 100 mg temperature range 278 333 k initial ph 7 6 cf 1 0 see figs 6 and 7 2 ln k g r t h r t s r k d is converted into k where the respective notations of r and t are corresponding to gas constant and absolute temperature the experimental condition of ozonation of river water containing the metal ions was adjusted to ozone partial pressure 6 3 10 1 kpa flow rate 250 ml min and time of ozonation 3 h if our assumption that the cation exchange reactions between these metal ions and the hydroxyl groups substituted by na ion in tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent occur mainly is reasonable the plots of ln k vs 1 t should be a straight line for the adsorption mechanisms between mn ii co ii sr ii cs i or ba ii and pa316tas adsorbent judging from the results in table 3 as a result the straight lines were obtained as shown in fig 5 on the other hand two bent or step straight lines were observed only in y iii ru iii vi rh iii sb iii v eu iii and te iv vi in the same figure these results indicate that at least two adsorption mechanisms proceed under the experimental condition the above elements through the formation of anionic and cationic species or neutral species can be simultaneously adsorbed on pa316 and tas structures in pa316tas adsorbent as mentioned in the previous section the calculated thermodynamic parameters were arranged in table 4 the negative δg values imply that the thermodynamically favorable adsorption processes between pa316tas adsorbent and mn co sr etc proceed in two kinds of river water the positive δs values suggest that the degree of randomness increases because the destruction of hydration shell of the metal ions and the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent are far superior to the adsorption between the metal ions and the surface of pa316tas adsorbent the two kinds of δs values obtained from of y iii rh iii and eu iii were roughly similar because of the slight change among some types of conformations of y iii rh iii and eu iii during the adsorption processes in the previous section it was mentioned that ru can exist as trivalent and hexavalent ru under the examined condition for example it has been reported that the hydration number of fe2 and fe3 ions is 6 0 0 1 and 6 0 0 2 whereas the ion radii of fe2 and fe3 are 0 077 and 0 063 nm yokoyama 1995 this means that the variation of δs values depends strongly on the chemical forms of ru superior to the difference of valence state of ru that is the fact that ru can exist as oxidation products such as ruo4 2 during the adsorption processes seems to be more important parameter as a result the difference of δs values between ru iii and ruo4 2 was clearly generated te has two kinds of valence states i e tetravalent and hexavalent te which are based on the adsorption reactions between pa316tas adsorbent and neutral species such as h6teo6 aq and h2teo3 aq showed almost same δs values because the fraction of h6teo6 aq is very high in the ph value the adsorption of h6teo6 aq on the both structures in pa316tas adsorbent occurred as with te there are trivalent and pentavalent sb species in aqueous solutions in case of the condition main sb species will be sb iii 4o6 aq rather than sb v oh 6 hence the adsorption reaction between sb iii 4o6 aq and the both of structures in pa316tas adsorbent proceeded this result may also suggest the formation of electron donor acceptor eda complexes between aromatic rings of pa316tas adsorbent and neutral te or sb species compared with that of other chemical bonds the strength of interaction due to the eda complexes became very low this phenomenon is reasonable because the difference of δs values is comparatively small the δh and δs values of mn ii and co ii were quite similar to each other besides the δh and δs values of sr ii were also almost equivalent to those of ba ii respectively because of an analogous chemical property in alkaline earth metals the difference between δs values of cs i and sr ii will attribute to the hydration numbers of cs i nh2o 7 0 1 0 and sr ii nh2o 8 1 1 0 yokoyama 1995 judging from the results of δh values see table 4 and table 3 the adsorption mechanisms of mn ii co ii cs i sr ii and ba ii can be regarded as the similar one there are two kinds of δh and δs values of i i and i v respectively and their values were very different it is estimated that simple i and io3 exist in river water without the exogenous effect by any ligands and redox reactions in addition both of i and io3 can be simultaneously adsorbed by pa316 and tas structures in pa316tas adsorbent see table 3 in this case the degree of dehydration processes of respective functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent will depend strongly on each of molecular volume it can be assumed that the molecular volume of i is smaller than that of io3 as a result this factor causes the difference of δh and δs values between i and io3 using pa316tas adsorbent after ozonation of river water containing twelve kinds of metal ions mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu i i and io3 it was found that mn co y ru rh te and eu precipitate selectively while the precipitation phenomena of sr sb cs ba i i and io3 are not caused by ozone treatment fig 8 hence the candidate metal ions which should be removed in the river water treated with ozone were chosen before and after ozonation δh and δs values of sr ii cs i and ba ii did not change while δh and δs values of sb iii v and i i changed clearly indicating the change of valence states of sb iii v by ozone ozone can generally produce more hydrophilic substances compared with the degree of hydrophilicity of its original substances tachibana et al 2012a sb iii v and i i with higher hydrophobicity resulted in the increase of δs values there is one reasonable point of view that quaternary ammonium and hydroxyl groups in pa316tas adsorbent and mn co sr etc are surrounded by a lot of water in river water hence if mn co sr etc adsorb chemically on the surface of pa316tas adsorbent the destruction of the hydration shell of these functional groups and mn co sr etc will be required before the adsorption reactions of mn co sr etc against the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent occur in river water therefore some energy is required by these dehydration processes to the contrary the specific energy has been emitted to stabilize optimally the adsorptive conformation between mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent in river water in brief the δh values can be defined as the difference of released and absorbed energy between mn co sr etc and pa316tas adsorbent in river water most of δh values were found to be slightly positive in the river system while all δh values became somewhat negative in the seawater system table 4 this describes that mn co sr etc in river water and seawater are primarily surrounded by h2o and inorganic salts in h2o respectively the δg values in the river water system were the same or smaller than those in the seawater system table 4 indicating that the adsorption reactions in river water occur easier 3 3 chromatography of cs sr2 and i a mixture of i and io3 ions on pa316tas adsorbent in river water and river water treated with ozone the apparatus for the chromatographic experiments of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions using pa316tas adsorbent was set up as illustrated in fig 2 the cs sr2 and i i and io3 chromatographic concentration curves were shown in fig 9 the saturated concentrations of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions were compatible with the initial ones indicating that the experimental breakthrough curves were appropriately obtained each concentration of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions was gradually saturated their effluent volumes of saturated points were 26 26 and 172 ml for cs sr2 and i i and io3 systems in river water respectively on the other hand the saturated points obtained from cs sr2 and i i and io3 systems in river water treated with ozone were 64 67 and 154 ml respectively the dead volume was also calculated and their volumes were found to be 12 12 and 16 ml in order of cs sr2 and i i and io3 in river water in case of river water treated with ozone the dead volume for cs sr2 and i i and io3 was 12 12 and 13 ml respectively the small difference among the dead volume was simply caused by exchanging the used ptfe tube with a new one based on the quantitative relationship between these concentration curves and the initial concentrations of feed solutions of cs sr2 and i i and io3 ions the maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr2 and i i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent in the respective river water systems were calculated these data were summarized in table 5 and were compared with those reported mainly in the review articles liu et al 2014 olatunji et al 2015 alby et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the calculated maximum adsorption capacities were 1 7 10 4 and 1 8 10 3 for cs 7 8 10 5 and 5 6 10 4 for sr2 5 4 10 2 and 3 1 10 2 mol g pa316tas for i i and io3 in river water and river water treated with ozone respectively the shape of particles of pa316tas adsorbent did not change entirely after experiments see fig 10 the maximum adsorption capacities of cs in both river water systems were comparatively larger than those of sr2 it has been known that the ion radius of cs rion 0 168 nm rm o 0 307 nm rh2o 0 139 nm is larger than that of sr2 rion 0 125 nm rm o 0 264 nm rh2o 0 139 nm yokoyama 1995 basically the hydration number decreases gradually with an increase in the ion radius in alkali metals or alkaline earth metals in fact each hydration number of cs and sr2 are nh2o 7 0 1 0 and 8 1 0 1 in first hydration shell yokoyama 1995 and the binding force between cs and h2o is larger than that between sr2 and h2o lee 1977 moreover it is reasonable to consider that the dissociated hydroxyl carboxyl and sulfo groups have a stronger affinity in order of li na k rb and cs or mg2 ca2 sr2 ba2 following the order of hydration number caused by ion radius lee 1977 hence the maximum adsorption capacities of cs on pa316tas adsorbent became larger compared with those of sr2 apropos the larger maximum adsorption capacities of cs and sr2 on pa316tas adsorbent were obtained by ozonation of river water shinano river water contains dissolved fe and mn at the level of ppb mn2 and fe2 are interfering cations against cs and sr2 adsorption mn2 can precipitate as mno2 and the produced mno2 is also oxidized to mno4 by ozonation fe2 can transform into fe3 using ozone this fe3 can spontaneously react with h2o to be fe oh 3 which is a precipitation this means that these cationic species transform into anionic species or insoluble precipitation by ozone as a consequence the initial concentrations of the elements such as mn2 and fe2 decreased as a result of ozonation reactions the maximum adsorption capacity of cs for pa316tas adsorbent was even equal to the values among organic adsorbents including bio adsorbents or structurally unique adsorbents lu et al 2019 james et al 2019 as shown in table 5 moreover the maximum adsorption capacity of cs for pa316tas adsorbent was broadly similar to those of the promising prussian blue type adsorbents lee and streat 1983 ishfaq et al 1997 nilchi et al 2007 sangvanich et al 2010 torad et al 2012 du et al 2013 chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 hwang et al 2019 in spite of the existence of the elements contained originally in river water treated with ozone nevertheless the capacity of cs for pa316tas adsorbent were about five times as small as that in the literature sheha and el khouly 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity of sr2 for pa316tas adsorbent was much smaller than those of many other adsorbents even in ozone treated river water see table 5 the largest value refers to fe3o4 rgo adsorbent minitha et al 2018 thus the use of inorganic adsorbents may be more suitable for the simultaneous removal of cs and sr2 ions in aqueous solutions on the other hand it was found that the maximum adsorption capacity of i i and io3 in river water is larger than that in river water treated with ozone table 5 ozone can oxidize i to io3 in aqueous solutions in brief the dominant chemical form of i i and io3 is io3 in river water treated with ozone pa316tas adsorbent can simultaneously adsorb i and io3 in river water hence the difference of the maximum adsorption capacities between i i and io3 in river water and i i and io3 in river water treated with ozone was mainly caused by different adsorption mechanisms between i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent concretely i can directly bind pa316tas adsorbent while the chemical bond between the o in io3 and pa316tas adsorbent can be formed in case of io3 compared with those of i the k d values of io3 for pa316tas adsorbents were found to be higher table 1 this result is reasonable because i is able to bind selectively and weakly pa316tas adsorbent while pa316tas adsorbent has the selective and strong adsorption binding for io3 moreover the number of adsorption sites in pa316tas adsorbent for i is more than those for io3 especially it can be estimated that most of i and a portion of io3 may be adsorbed on the different adsorption sites in pa316tas adsorbent it has been known that the iodine benzene complex which is expected as a candidate for a real time of a bimolecular reaction is regarded as one of eda complexes kiviniemi et al 2009 pa316tas adsorbent has a number of hydroxyl groups and quaternary ammonium groups and moreover it has a few ether oxygen atoms carbonyl groups sulfo groups the frameworks composed of aromatic compounds in pa316tas adsorbent take on the characteristics of partial positive charge following the results from previous reports benesi and hildebrand 1949 on the other hand i and io3 assume originally the character of negative charge it is no wonder that there are any electrostatic interactions between i i and io3 and pa316tas adsorbent as seen from table 2 the k d values of i i and io3 for single tas adsorbent were very low in brief this means that the degree of electrostatic interactions is amplified after forming the bridge between pa316 resin and tas adsorbent using paraformaldehyde one research group suggests that the incorporation of i species into the som via covalent aromatic c i bond is the key mechanism controlling the adsorption behavior of i species xu et al 2011 they also showed the indirect evidence that the macro molecular conformation hydrophobic aliphatic periphery hindering the active aromatic cores and hydrophilic polysaccharides favoring the access by hydrophilic i species influences the interactions between i species and the som xu et al 2012 in conclusion it can be estimated that the eda complex or pseudo eda complex forms in the adsorption behavior between i i and io3 and pa316tas adsorbent if so the maximum adsorption capacities of i i and io3 for pa316tas adsorbent should be much larger as it is to be expected the maximum adsorption capacities for i i and io3 in river water and river water treated with ozone were found to be 5 4 10 2 and 3 1 10 2 mol g pa316tas respectively in addition the structural change of aromatic c h bond based on i i and io3 adsorption onto pa316tas adsorbent was observed see fig 11 surprisingly these types of maximum adsorption ability were about twelve times as large as those which were way ahead of the published ones in the literature yang et al 2011 bo et al 2013 it has been known that io3 is likely reduced to reactive i species if the lignin and tannin like compounds or the carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules were contained in the system xu et al 2013a there is the potential for the decomposition of pa316tas adsorbent by reactive i species and the condensed aromatics and tannin like compounds may be generated hence the endurance tests of pa316tas adsorbent for cs sr2 i and io3 adsorption were performed in river water and river water treated with ozone as shown in fig 12 it was found that the retention capability of pa316tas adsorbent for these metal ions can be kept for at least 30 days the intensities of uv vis adsorption spectra of samples were drastically decreased before and after adsorption experiments indicating that the adsorption reactions between some metal ions and pa316tas adsorbent are maintained in the period see fig 13 s1 3 4 conclusion the syntheses of tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents combined with tas induced from ta and pa316 ar 01 pyr wa10 wa20 and wa30 resins which are one of familiar anion exchange resins were successfully carried out to remove simultaneously various kinds of radionuclides in river water and ozone treated river water the adsorption behavior of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides mn co sr y ru rh sb te cs ba eu and i i and io3 on these composite adsorbents has been studied in real river water at room temperature pa316tas adsorbent showed much higher k d for all metal ions the k d values of pa316tas adsorbent were very different from those of the mixed adsorbents which are contained individually pa316s and tas adsorbents this result suggests that the change of electron density of the functional groups in pa316tas adsorbent and or the different effect of steric hindrance in adsorption processes may be caused by the chemical combination between both adsorbents compared with those of individual tas and pa316 adsorbents in addition it can be considered that the dissolution of a part of tas structure in pa316tas adsorbent into river water may be prevented by cross linkage the k d values of mn co sr y cs ba eu and io3 decreased with increasing mixing ratio of pa316 structure this phenomenon means that tas adsorbent has more selective adsorption ability for these metal ions on the other hand it was found that y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 are adsorbed on both tas and pa316 adsorbents the optimized mixing ratio of pa316 to ta was 2 to 1 to evaluate the validity of these mechanistic expectations the respective chemical surroundings of pa316tas adsorbent and mn co sr etc were examined in river water ranging in temperature from 278 to 333 k as it is to be expected one straight line for mn co sr cs and ba systems and two types of straight lines for y ru rh sb te eu i i and io3 systems were observed on the other hand the precipitation of mn co y ru rh te and eu was produced by ozonation of river water i e ozone can transform mn co y ru rh te and eu ions into the insoluble precipitates as a result one straight line for sr cs ba systems and two types of straight lines for sb i i and io3 systems were obtained in river water treated with ozone the number of straight line was compatible with the number of adsorption mechanism the chromatography experiments of cs sr and i i and io3 were carried out to obtain their maximum adsorption capacities the obtained maximum adsorption capacities of cs sr and i i mixed with io3 were 1 7 10 4 cs 1 8 10 3 cs o3 7 8 10 5 sr 5 6 10 4 sr o3 5 4 10 2 i and io3 3 1 10 2 i and io3 o3 mol g pa316tas it was discovered that the maximum adsorption capacity of i i and io3 for the composite adsorbent is unprecedented high and the capacity becomes larger more than one order of magnitude compared with those of previous reports this phenomenon indicates the formation of eda complex or pseudo eda complex in consideration of these results it was concluded that the combined use of pa316tas adsorbent and ozone made it possible to remove simultaneously and effectively various kinds of radionuclides in river water and ozone treated river water in the wide ph and temperature ranges declaration of competing interest to the best of

17829,the removal efficiency of nine pharmaceutical compounds from primary sludge was evaluated in two different operating conditions i in conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad alone and ii in a co treatment process combining mesophilic anaerobic digestion and a thermophilic aerobic reactor mad tar the pilot scale reactors were fed with primary sludge obtained after decantation of urban wastewater concerning the biodegradation of organic matter thermophilic aeration increased solubilization and hydrolysis yields of digestion resulting in a further 26 supplementary removal of chemical oxygen demand cod in mad tar process compared to the conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion the highest removal rate of target micropollutants were observed for caffeine caf and sulfamethoxazole smx 89 with no substantial differences between both processes furthermore mad tar process showed a significant increase of removal efficiency for oxazepam oxa 73 propranolol pro 61 and ofloxacine ofl 41 and a slight increase for diclofenac dic 4 and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 2oh ibp 5 however ibuprofen ibp and carbamazepine cbz were not degraded during both processes anaerobic digestion affected the liquid solid partition of most target compounds sorbed fraction of pharmaceutical compounds on the sludge tend to decrease after digestion this tendency being more pronounced in the case of the mad tar process due to much lower concentration of solids graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical compounds thermophilic aerobic reactor mesophilic anaerobic digestion reduction of sludge

sludge srt sludge retention time tss total suspended solids vss volatile suspended solids wwtps wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction over the last twenty years various studies have quantified concentrations and occurrences of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plants wwtps data reported generally refers to the removal from aqueous phase without distinguishing between sorption of compounds onto sludge and or biodegradation processes verlicchi et al 2012 however a significant fraction of pollutants can be sorbed onto the sludge depending on the respective physicochemical properties of molecules and sludge as well as on operating conditions the main mechanisms for the removal of organic compounds from wastewater are sorption and biodegradation volatilization mechanism could be neglected due to small henry s law constants of most pharmaceutical compounds joss et al 2006 sorption onto sludge follows two mechanisms absorption and adsorption on the one hand hydrophobic interactions absorption occurs between the aliphatic and aromatic groups of a compound with the lipophilic cell membrane of the microorganisms or the lipid fractions of the suspended solids on the other hand the electrostatic interactions adsorption take place because of interactions of positively charged groups of chemicals with the negatively charged surfaces of the microorganisms verlicchi et al 2012 in this study we considered nine molecules based on their variety of physicochemical properties their prevalence in wwtp effluents their uses for different pathologies and as a marker of human activity these criteria led us to choose carbamazepine cbz anticonvulsant diclofenac dic ibuprofen ibp and 2 hydroxyibuprofen 2oh ibp analgesics sulfamethoxazole smx and ofloxacin ofl antibiotics propranolol pro beta bloquer oxazepam oxa psycholeptic and caffeine caf stimulant table s1 shows their therapeutic class chemical structure henry s law constant pka and logkow values it can be noticed that besse et al 2008 included ofloxacin propranolol carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac in their preliminary risk assessment of pharmaceuticals showing high risk quotient ratios one extended approach to evaluate the sorption of hydrophobic substances is the octanol water partition coefficient kow that indicates the lipophilicity of the sorbed compound however some studies revealed that sorption behavior present significant deviations from log kow for pharmaceuticals golet et al 2003 urase and kikuta 2005 carballa et al 2008 kümmerer 2009 indicating that polar and ionic interactions contribute to sorption behavior overall phase distribution of a pollutant depends on the physicochemical properties of the molecule such as stereo chemical structure pka solubility polarity or log kow and the external conditions including ph redox potential and temperature kümmerer 2009 finally solid liquid partition coefficient kd provides distribution behavior of the compounds between liquid and solid phases few authors have studied solid liquid coefficient during anaerobic digestion table 1 summarizes kd coefficients found in literature for primary sludge ofloxacin and propranolol have the highest expected sorption potential while ibuprofen and caffeine have the lowest one the rest of the molecules would be distributed in relatively same percentages in liquid and solid phases as we will discuss in 3 3 section kd is not enough to evaluate the distribution of the molecules total suspended solids tss concentration should be added for a complete characterization however kd can help to compare qualitatively the sorption of target molecules in sludge when determined in the same conditions anaerobic digestion process involves hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis phases generally the hydrolysis of organic matter is considered as the limiting step in anaerobic digestion nguyen and khanal 2018 chen et al 2020 various thermal chemical and enzymatic processes are known to improve the removal of recalcitrant organic matter paul and liu 2012 among all these processes micro aeration has drawn attention in recent years because of its positive impacts as enhancing hydrolysis dealing with overloads ramos and fdz polanco 2013 or enhancing biogas quality by reducing the concentrations of h2s díaz et al 2010 giordano et al 2019 aeration could be implemented intermittently or continuously in different stages of anaerobic digestion as pre treatment co treatment or post treatment nguyen and khanal 2018 as pre treatment johansen and bakke 2006 found a positive effect on the hydrolysis of proteins and carbohydrates during anaerobic digestion of primary sludge montalvo et al 2016 found an increase of protein and total sugars solubilization cods and methane production associated to a 27 cod removal increase charles et al 2009 observed cellulase and protease activities after aeration pre treatment of organic fraction of municipal solids waste confirming the hydrolytic capacities of exo enzymes excreted by aerobic bacteria three full scale systems have implemented microaeration in anaerobic digestion with positive effects in h2s removal kobayashi et al 2012 jeníček et al 2017 giordano et al 2019 as post treatment 47 of cod removal in mad and 28 in tar was obtained in a system formed by two stages mad tar mad followed of tar without recirculation park et al 2014 as co treatment micro aeration has also shown positive effects xu et al 2014 studied the effect of intermittent micro aeration rates of anaerobic digestion of food waste they concluded that adequate micro aeration rate can enhanced the hydrolysis of solid organic waste and methane yield by 16 9 and 18 respectively thermophilic aerobic treatment coupled to conventional mesophilic digestion as a co treatment has not been yet extendedly studied compare to a single mesophilic digestion coupled process can get an additional solid removals and cod solubilization dumas et al 2010 park et al 2014 fu et al 2015 fu et al 2015 improved the methane yield and enhanced the hydrolysis step in the digestion of corn straw by microaeration pre treatment at thermophilic temperature 55 c with tar as a co treatment dumas et al 2010 obtained a 30 supplementary increase of cod removal in lab scale mesophilic anaerobic combined with a thermophilic aerobic reactor mad tar treating secondary sludge anaerobic digestion is the most widely used method for treating with valorisation sludge produced in wwtps gherghel et al 2019 and the evaluation of the degradability of pharmaceutical molecules during digestion may be a key point to evaluate the ecotoxicological risks of digestate disposal table s2 summarizes the concentration of target micropollutants found in the literature during mesophilic anaerobic digestion and thermophilic anaerobic digestion tad some of molecules as ibp and ofl still had a high concentration in sludge after mad the additional reduction of organic matter expected during coupled mad tar digestion could be critically important as treatment of sludge represents approximately 50 of the total running cost of wwtps gherghel et al 2019 although various studies have investigated the fate of pharmaceutical compounds in the anaerobic digestion carballa et al 2007 narumiya et al 2013 samaras et al 2013 malmborg and magnér 2015 martín et al 2015 gonzalez gil et al 2016 2017 2018 removal of some persistent micropollutants remains contradictory i e removal of cbz was reported from 85 malmborg and magnér 2015 to 0 narumiya et al 2013 in addition their behaviour under thermophilic digestion has been little studied and never for a co treatment such as mad tar though it gives very promising results in this work the degradation of nine selected compounds caffeine ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole propranolol carbamazepine oxazepam diclofenac ibuprofen and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen and their sorption behavior was evaluated

conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad was compared to a system coupling a thermophilic aerobic reactor with mad mad tar 2 material and methods 2 1 analytical standards and reagents analytical standards of 98 purity of nine selected molecules were purchased from sigma aldrich saint quentin fallavier france with the exception of oxazepam and is for ofloxacin propranolol

in two different configurations i a conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad and i mesophilic anaerobic digestion combined with a thermophilic aerobic reactor as a co treatment process mad tar the mad was a stirred tank reactor with an effective volume of 260 l equipped with an agitator and a double jacket the tar with a liquid volume of 40 l was also equipped with an agitator and a double jacket the aeration was operated discontinuously in the tar compartment to provide a dissolved oxygen concentration measured by visiferm do optical sensor hamilton between 0 2 and 0 5 mg l 1 with an air flowrate of 300 l h 1 mad was connected to the tar by means of an albin peristaltic recirculation pump type alh15 its flow rate was fixed at 100 l h 1 and 15 l were recirculated from one compartment to the other three times per day corresponding to a retention time of 0 9 days in the tar the two compartments were heated by two independent cryostats in order to maintain the temperatures suitable for aerobic thermophilic 60 c and anaerobic mesophilic 35 c processes for the mad campaign the 40 l compartment was maintained at 35 c without aeration to be in fully mad conditions while maintaining all other operating conditions similar biogas composition ch4 co2 and o2 in mad outlet was measured online x stream x2gp continuous gas analyzer after inoculation by the secondary sludge from cugnaux wwtp the digester was fed with primary sludge from our pilot scale settling tanks digester was operated semi continuously by feeding the primary sludge automatically once

details of analytical conditions are presented in supplementary information table s3 performance characteristics of the method were evaluated by accuracy and precision on total fraction of primary sludge and digestate method accuracy estimated by means of relative recovery rr experiments and precision expressed as intra day repeatability in terms of relative standard deviation rsd were studied by spiking samples at different concentrations according to the concentration levels found in real samples rr of the analytes ranged within 90 120 and the intra day rsd values were found to be lower than 20 indicating a satisfactory accuracy and precision for all matrixes primary sludge and digestate total and liquid fractions limit of detection ld was calculated according to the epa s method by considering 3 times the standard deviation determined by analyzing 8 blank samples or spiked samples at low levels when it is necessary therefore it is a robust and reliable method for complex and simple matrices which makes it possible to study the performances of the mad and mad tar processes for each campaign 13 samples were taken and analyzed in duplicate by adding internal standards for each targeted molecule targeted prior to extraction for each samples and analytes standard deviations of less than 10 were obtained 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 mass balances and pharmaceuticals removal

cod and micropollutants statistical analysis was carried out following sperling et al 2020 recommendations linearity of the regression was confirmed for all parameters by ensuring that the linear model was satisfying the assumptions of linearity independence normality of residuals and homogeneity of variances furthermore calculations of the 95 confidence interval of the slope of linear model obtained for mad and mad tar campaign allowed evaluating if performances were significantly different not overlap of the confidence interval this analysis was performed with r software 2 4 2 distribution of target molecules between solid and liquid phases of sludge solid liquid partition coefficient kd l kgtss 1 of target molecules in sludge and supernatants of each sample was calculated

with real influent the vss and codt concentrations after digestion remained constant with standard deviation below 4 considering comparable operating conditions see table 2 higher elimination of solid organic matter was achieved in the hybrid mad tar system around 76 for vss compared to the mesophilic one around 47 confirming lab results obtained a few years ago dumas et al 2010 during mad tar campaign cod balances were performed to estimate the fate of transformed cod collected grab samples at the inlet and outlet of the tar compartment allowed estimating that 26 6 of the total removed cod was eliminated in this thermophilic compartment the additional cod removal compared to mad campaign being eliminated in the aerated compartment no additional methane recovery in the mad compartment was allowed furthermore the average our in the tar was 7 5 0 8 mgo2 l 1 h 1 that corresponds only to 3 9 of the total removed cod that was degraded in aerobic conditions even if volatilization of certain substances such as volatile fatty acids could occur this observation tends to show that the thermophilic condition could have more effect than the aeration two main mechanisms could be associated with this temperature effect on the one hand the microbial activity could be directly positively affected indeed several authors reported a significant increase in hydrolysis rate in thermophilic compared to mesophilic conditions siegrist et al 2002 lynd et al 2002 ge et al 2011 even demonstrated that this rate strongly follow the arrhenius relationship with nearly a doubled value when increasing the temperature by 20 c on the other hand temperature may play a role in physical phenomena in particular on mass transfer and solubility even if their effect on the rate of microbial utilization remains to confirm lynd et al 2002 3 2 fate of pharmaceutical compounds during anaerobic digestion the total concentration μg l 1 of the nine selected compounds is illustrated in fig 1 for both primary sludge and digestate from mad fig 1a and mad tar fig 1b processes all the target molecules were detected and quantified in the primary sludge see table s4 for limit of detection even if some variations in the concentrations have been observed between the two experimental campaigns 23 in average during the mad tar experiment the order of magnitude was the same allowing for a relevant comparison of performances between the two operating conditions the highest concentrations of targeted compounds were observed for ofl and caf more than 40 μg l 1 while medium to low concentrations were reported for smx cbz pro dic oxa ibp and 2oh ibp around 1 0 10 0 μg l 1 the comparison of removal efficiencies in mad and mad tar are reported in fig 2 compounds placed above the dotted line show better removal efficiency by the innovative process mad tar compared to conventional process mad the highest removal yields were obtained for caf and smx 89 with slight increase in mad tar campaign for caf but with no significant differences between both processes for smx the removal of several other target compounds was significantly improved by mad tar process moderate removal ranging between 54 and 75 were observed for ofl and oxa respectively in mad tar compared to only 9 and 49 in mad moreover while pro was not removed at all during mad process a rate of 69 was achieved in mad tar dic and 2oh ibp presented low removal during mad tar 6 10 while they were accumulated in mad finally a negative removal rate was observed for ibp and cbz in both processes mad 30 and 71 respectively and mad tar 35 and 91 underlining that concentrations were higher in the digestate than in primary sludge in mad conditions similar removal efficiencies were reported in the literature for ofl pro narumiya et al 2013 caf narumiya et al 2013 and smx carballa et al 2007 narumiya et al 2013 alvarino et al 2014 falas et al 2016 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 ibuprofen is generally well removed under aerobic conditions alvarino et al 2018 but the removal under anaerobic conditions remained controversial carballa et al 2007 martín et al 2012 samaras et al 2013 showed a moderately high removal but recent studies found a recalcitrant behaviour after anaerobic processes alvarino et al 2014 phan et al 2018 as underlined in our results dic is generally persistent with low removal efficiencies alvarino et al 2014 ghattas et al 2017 phan et al 2018 gonzalez gil et al 2019 whereas moderate removal was showed in some lab scale data carballa et al 2007 malmborg and magnér 2015 cbz is also recalcitrant in wastewater treatments low or negligible removal was reported in the studies of ghattas et al 2017 alvarino et al 2018 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 phan et al 2018 kent and tay 2019 redox conditions played an important role conditioning the development of microbial populations and thus on biodegradation pathways thanks to the complementary hydrolytic capacities of external enzymes excreted by thermophilic aerobic bacteria some molecules are only degraded under specific aerobic anaerobic or both conditions stadler et al 2015 and alvarino et al 2018 studied the influence of redox potential in the removal of organic compounds showing that in the case of smx the microaerobic conditions increased their removal phan et al 2018 reported that molecules containing only electron donating functional groups nh2 oh ch3 och3 in their structure are more susceptible to biodegradation as it is the case of smx in anaerobic digestion ghattas et al 2017 proposed a degradation pathway via reduction of the electron withdrawing sulfonyl group in the case of ibp this molecule contains three electron donating functional groups and it should be biotransformed but it remains recalcitrant after anaerobic digestion maybe because their substitutions in their aromatic ring in the case of dic a possible pathway could be the reductive dichlorination phan et al 2018 or a biodegradation catalysed by decarboxylases or acetate kinases gonzalez gil et al 2019 concerning smx they reported that most probably pathway was the abiotic reduction of the ne o bond mediated by microbial reaction about dic they proposed that their biodegradation may be catalysed by decarboxylases or acetate kinases gonzalez gil et al 2019 microaeration on anaerobic digestion affects microbial communities by increasing the diversity and activity of hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms nguyen and khanal 2018 chen et al 2020 comparing microaeration to strict anaerobic condition an increase of phylum firmicutes class clostridia which is related to hydrolysis step was found in addition microaeration also affects the methane producing archaea presented in anaerobic digestion methanosarcina slightly aerotolerant and methanobacterium both doubled fu et al 2016 cometabolism is considered the main mechanism of pharmaceutical degradation during biological wastewater treatments gonzalez gil et al 2017 2018 further research is necessary to understand the degradation pathway attributed to co metabolism during hybrid digestion process and the additional degradation of some targeted micropollutants during mad tar therefore mad tar process allows the exposure of compounds to different redox and temperature conditions improving significantly the removal efficiency of oxa pro and ofl and slightly dic and 2oh ibp concomitantly with the improvement of overall organic matter degradation these are very positive results considering the ecotoxicological risks of oxa pro and ofl as underlined by besse et al 2008 however ibp and cbz even show more negative efficiencies and the mechanisms involved need further investigations the negative removal or apparent production of some molecules have already been reported in the literature explained by the transformation back of their metabolites to their parent compounds indeed parent chemicals are often excreted from the human body with a number of associated metabolites in the case of ibp it is excreted as the unchanged drug in 1 and 76 as metabolites petrie et al 2015 there is a general lack of data about metabolite concentrations and biotransformation during wastewater treatments but some authors reported higher metabolites concentrations than parent compound in urban wastewater for ibp brezinova et al 2018 in the case of cbz the negative removal or apparent production was also reported narumiya et al 2013 falas et al 2016 he et al 2019 reported the quantification of some phase i and phase ii metabolites of cbz showing that cbz n glucuronide cbz glu concentration 59 4 ng l 1 was higher than cbz 53 8 ng l 1 in wastewater influent from kyoto wwtp japan in their effluent cbz concentration increased by 15 and cbz glu decreased by 19 they attributed the increase of cbz to the deconjugation of cbz glu further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis in ibp and cbz as some metabolites may be biologically active and have similar pharmacological activity than parent compound besse et al 2008 3 3 partitioning pharmaceutical compounds considering the possible relation between sorption on solids and inaccessibility for biodegradation distribution of compounds was studied based on measured concentration in total and soluble phases as described in section 2 4 from eq 1 it is obvious that a single value of log kd is not enough to evaluate the partition of the compounds between solid and liquid phases and that this partitioning constant should be always given together with the tss concentration indeed in the case of primary sludge of mad campaign which presented the highest tss concentration a log kd value below 1 73 and 0 78 indicates that the percentage of compound in the liquid phase is above 50 and 90 respectively fig 3 a at the opposite when considering the lowest concentrated sludge i e the digestate during mad tar campaign log kd values below 2 31 and 1 36 indicate a percentage above 50 and 90 respectively fig 3b thus even if the partition coefficients were not greatly modified during digestion the significant decrease in tss in the mad tar campaign leads to higher fractions in the liquid fig 3a compared to the mad campaign fig 3b the distribution of targeted compounds between the particulate and liquid phases are presented in fig 4 primary sludge presented similar sorption behavior for the two campaigns ofl and pro showed the highest sorption 90 followed by oxa 71 ibp smx dic and cbz range of 35 63 finally a low sorption is found for 2oh ibp 20 and 24 mad and mad tar respectively and caf 21 and 34 mad and mad tar respectively the liquid fraction of smx 2oh ibp and pro increased slightly after digestion in mad 3 5 and moderately in mad tar 11 19 cbz and oxa increased moderately in mad 7 13 and significantly in mad tar 27 39 ibp and dic increased significantly in mad 23 34 and in mad tar 22 28 only caf presented a contradictory behaviour liquid fraction increased in mad tar 16 and decreased in mad 8 only ofl showed no significant change in sorption after digestion 0 and 2 in mad and mad tar respectively as indicated in table s5 for a same affinity constant the fraction in liquid after digestion is significantly different in mad and mad tar due to drastic changes in tss indeed the suspended solid concentration dropped from 18 5 3 4 to 11 7 0 5 g l 1 during the mad experiment and from 15 4 2 1 to 4 8 0 7 g l 1 during the mad tar campaign the difference in phase distribution after digestion can partly be attributed to the different ph value of primary and digested sludge because of the presence of compounds containing functional groups which can be protonated and deprotonated ternes et al 2004 in function of ph the compound can be neutral cationic anionic or zwitterionic consequently its physical chemical and biological properties may be affected verlicchi et al 2012 by inducing positively charged compounds that are likely to interact with the negatively charged surface of sludge or at the contrary anions inducing hydrophilic behaviour alvarino et al 2018 among the compounds mostly present in liquid phase after digestion ph 7 5 in mad 7 4 in mad tar ibp 2oh ibp and dic have a carboxylic acid group pka 4 15 4 63 for a ph higher than pka value the fraction of anionic species increased initial ph of the primary sludge was 6 1 6 2 after digestion of the organic matter the ph increased resulting in an increase of hydrophilicity of the compounds in line with our results for instance in the case of ibp the liquid fraction in primary sludge was 65 mad and 59 mad tar and it increased to 87 mad and 92 mad tar after digestion similar increase of liquid partition was found in dic and 2oh ibp the same partitioning behaviour was also expected in smx pka 1 8 and 5 6 at the range of ph in anaerobic digestion the fraction of anionic species should also increase due to the dissociation pathway of sulfonamides and consequently an increase of hydrophilicity is likely to occur ma et al 2015 confirmed in their study of oxidation of smx that the dissociation of smx increases with increasing ph consequently deprotonated compounds were more readily to oxidation in our study partition behaviour of smx remained almost constant before and after digestion liquid fraction slightly increased 5 11 among the compounds present mostly in solid phase ofl has a zwitterion structure with a basic amino group pka 9 28 and an acid carboxylic group pka 5 97 between ph 6 0 and 9 3 cationic protonated amino group anionic deprotonated carboxyl group and zwitterion species would be present at ph of digestion 7 4 7 5 zwitterions should be dominant in accordance with narumiya et al 2013 due to the increase of zwitterionic species the hydrophobicity of ofl would also increase this fact may explain the tendency to sorb in our study sorption behaviour of ofl did not significantly change and remained at high level with more than 99 of the molecule located in the particulate compartment oxa is uncharged under normal ph conditions svahn and björklund 2015 it has also a zwitterion structure pka 1 55 10 9 between ph 6 and 11 zwitterion and anionic species would be predominant with increasing ph during digestion anionic species would also increase resulting in higher hydrophilicity in agreement with our results the liquid fraction of oxa in primary sludge was 28 29 mad and mad tar and it increased to 65 67 mad and mad tar after digestion caf pka 10 40 and pro pka 9 42 are cationic species when ph is lower than pka value due to their protonated amino group during the digestion ph increased and the fraction of cationic species would decrease in favour to their neutral conjugates the increase in the neutral fraction would decrease the hydrophilicity of the molecules and hence liquid fraction would decrease narumiya et al 2013 we found this behaviour for caf during mad campaign where the liquid fraction decreased from 79 in primary sludge to 70 after digestion however liquid fraction of caf increased after digestion in mad tar campaign in the case of pro there was not a significant increase of hydrophilicity in mad campaign liquid fraction only increased 3 after digestion but the liquid fraction increased from 10 in primary sludge to 22 after digestion during mad tar experiment consequently a parameter other than ph influenced their solid liquid partition during mad tar campaign cbz pka 3 8 13 9 is a neutral compound and hence sorption should be governed by hydrophobic interactions hai et al 2018 without influence of ph urase and kikuta 2005 carballa et al 2008 svahn and björklund 2015 also suggested that hydrophobic adsorption would predominate because of the high apolar to polar surface ratio of the cbz according to our results liquid fraction of cbz increased after digestion in mad and mad tar process and hence a parameter other than ph should influence cbz partitioning behaviour during anaerobic digestion when considering the compounds that suffered a biodegradation during digestion results tend to show an improvement of biodegradation in mad tar that may be associated with the increase of the fraction in the liquid phase in the case of dic oxa and 2 oh ibp fig 5 the increase of the removal of ofl and pro may be linked to the increase of solid reduction in mad tar because of the fact that these molecules are largely sorbed in solids indeed the concentration of solids in mad tar decrease down to 4 9 mg l 1 compared to 11 7 mg l 1 in mad campaign resulting in an increased availability of compounds in the liquid phase smx and caf are widely removed in mad and mad tar campaigns so a clear link between liquid fraction and removal cannot be established furthermore liquid fraction of ibp decreased and cbz increased during mad tar campaign and both components showed more negative efficiencies during this campaign thus bioavailability cannot be the only mechanism driving the biodegradation and reversibility of the biological reactions has to be considered 4 conclusions the removal efficiency of nine pharmaceutical compounds in conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad was compared with mesophilic anaerobic digestion combined with a thermophilic aerobic reactor mad tar in addition to a significant improvement in the degradation of solid organic matter 76 vs 47 for mad tar and mad respectively interesting results were also obtained on the targeted compounds moderate dic 2oh ibp to high oxa pro ofl improvement of removal was observed in mad tar while removal higher than 90 was found for caf and smx whatever the process even if the mechanisms implied in the fate of ibp and cbz need further investigation hybrid process mad tar that combines two redox conditions anaerobic and micro aeration presents a feasible alternative to improve not only the removal a wide number of pollutants but also overall organic matter degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

17829,the removal efficiency of nine pharmaceutical compounds from primary sludge was evaluated in two different operating conditions i in conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad alone and ii in a co treatment process combining mesophilic anaerobic digestion and a thermophilic aerobic reactor mad tar the pilot scale reactors were fed with primary sludge obtained after decantation of urban wastewater concerning the biodegradation of organic matter thermophilic aeration increased solubilization and hydrolysis yields of digestion resulting in a further 26 supplementary removal of chemical oxygen demand cod in mad tar process compared to the conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion the highest removal rate of target micropollutants were observed for caffeine caf and sulfamethoxazole smx 89 with no substantial differences between both processes furthermore mad tar process showed a significant increase of removal efficiency for oxazepam oxa 73 propranolol pro 61 and ofloxacine ofl 41 and a slight increase for diclofenac dic 4 and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 2oh ibp 5 however ibuprofen ibp and carbamazepine cbz were not degraded during both processes anaerobic digestion affected the liquid solid partition of most target compounds sorbed fraction of pharmaceutical compounds on the sludge tend to decrease after digestion this tendency being more pronounced in the case of the mad

sludge srt sludge retention time tss total suspended solids vss volatile suspended solids wwtps wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction over the last twenty years various studies have quantified concentrations and occurrences of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plants wwtps data reported generally refers to the removal from aqueous phase without distinguishing between sorption of compounds onto sludge and or biodegradation processes verlicchi et al 2012 however a significant fraction of pollutants can be sorbed onto the sludge depending on the respective physicochemical properties of molecules and sludge as well as on operating conditions the main mechanisms for the removal of organic compounds from wastewater are sorption and biodegradation volatilization mechanism could be neglected due to small henry s law constants of most pharmaceutical compounds joss et al 2006 sorption onto sludge follows two mechanisms absorption and adsorption on the one hand hydrophobic interactions absorption occurs between the aliphatic and aromatic groups of a compound with the lipophilic cell membrane of the microorganisms or the lipid fractions of the suspended solids on the other hand the electrostatic interactions adsorption take place because of interactions of positively charged groups of chemicals with the negatively charged surfaces of the microorganisms verlicchi et al 2012 in this study we considered nine molecules based on their variety of physicochemical properties their prevalence in wwtp effluents their uses for different pathologies and as a marker of human activity these criteria led us to choose carbamazepine cbz anticonvulsant diclofenac dic ibuprofen ibp and 2 hydroxyibuprofen 2oh ibp analgesics sulfamethoxazole smx and ofloxacin ofl antibiotics propranolol pro beta bloquer oxazepam oxa psycholeptic and caffeine caf stimulant table s1 shows their therapeutic class chemical structure henry s law constant pka and logkow values it can be noticed that besse et al 2008 included ofloxacin propranolol carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac in their preliminary risk assessment of pharmaceuticals showing high risk quotient ratios one extended approach to evaluate the sorption of hydrophobic substances is the octanol water partition coefficient kow that indicates the lipophilicity of the sorbed compound however some studies revealed that sorption behavior present significant deviations from log kow for pharmaceuticals golet et al 2003 urase and kikuta 2005 carballa et al 2008 kümmerer 2009 indicating that polar and ionic interactions contribute to sorption behavior overall phase distribution of a pollutant depends on the physicochemical properties of the molecule such as stereo chemical structure pka solubility polarity or log kow and the external conditions including ph redox potential and temperature kümmerer 2009 finally solid liquid partition coefficient kd provides distribution behavior of the compounds between liquid and solid phases few authors have studied solid liquid coefficient during anaerobic digestion table 1 summarizes kd coefficients found in literature for primary sludge ofloxacin and propranolol have the highest expected sorption potential while ibuprofen and caffeine have the lowest one the rest of the molecules would be distributed in relatively same percentages in liquid and solid phases as we will discuss in 3 3 section kd is not enough to evaluate the distribution of the molecules total suspended solids tss concentration should be added for a complete characterization however kd can help to compare qualitatively the sorption of target molecules in sludge when determined in the same conditions anaerobic digestion process involves hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis phases generally the hydrolysis of organic matter is considered as the limiting step in anaerobic digestion nguyen and khanal 2018 chen et al 2020 various thermal chemical and enzymatic processes are known to improve the removal of recalcitrant organic matter paul and liu 2012 among all these processes micro aeration has drawn attention in recent years because of its positive impacts as enhancing hydrolysis dealing with overloads ramos and fdz polanco 2013 or enhancing biogas quality by reducing the concentrations of h2s díaz et al 2010 giordano et al 2019 aeration could be implemented intermittently or continuously in different stages of anaerobic digestion as pre treatment co treatment or post treatment nguyen and khanal 2018 as pre treatment johansen and bakke 2006 found a positive effect on the hydrolysis of proteins and carbohydrates during anaerobic digestion of primary sludge montalvo et al 2016 found an increase of protein and total sugars solubilization cods and methane production associated to a 27 cod removal increase charles et al 2009 observed cellulase and protease activities after aeration pre treatment of organic fraction of municipal solids waste confirming the hydrolytic capacities of exo enzymes excreted by aerobic bacteria three full scale systems have implemented microaeration in anaerobic digestion with positive effects in h2s removal kobayashi et al 2012 jeníček et al 2017 giordano et al 2019 as post treatment 47 of cod removal in mad and 28 in tar was obtained in a system formed by two stages mad tar mad followed of tar without recirculation park et al 2014 as co treatment micro aeration has also shown positive effects xu et al 2014 studied the effect of intermittent micro aeration rates of anaerobic digestion of food waste they concluded that adequate micro aeration rate can enhanced the hydrolysis of solid organic waste and methane yield by 16 9 and 18 respectively thermophilic aerobic treatment coupled to conventional mesophilic digestion as a co treatment has not been yet extendedly studied compare to a single mesophilic digestion coupled process can get an additional solid removals and cod solubilization dumas et al 2010 park et al 2014 fu et al 2015 fu et al 2015 improved the methane yield and enhanced the hydrolysis step in the digestion of corn straw by microaeration pre treatment at thermophilic temperature 55 c with tar as a co treatment dumas et al 2010 obtained a 30 supplementary increase of cod removal in lab scale mesophilic anaerobic combined with a thermophilic aerobic reactor mad tar treating secondary sludge anaerobic digestion is the most widely used method for treating with valorisation sludge produced in wwtps gherghel et al 2019 and the evaluation of the degradability of pharmaceutical molecules during digestion may be a key point to evaluate the ecotoxicological risks of digestate disposal table s2 summarizes the concentration of target micropollutants found in the literature during mesophilic anaerobic digestion and thermophilic anaerobic digestion tad some of molecules as ibp and ofl still had a high concentration in sludge after mad the additional reduction of organic matter expected during coupled mad tar digestion could be critically important as treatment of sludge represents approximately 50 of the total running cost of wwtps gherghel et al 2019 although various studies have investigated the fate of pharmaceutical compounds in the anaerobic digestion carballa et al 2007 narumiya et al 2013 samaras et al 2013 malmborg and magnér 2015 martín et al 2015 gonzalez gil et al 2016 2017 2018 removal of some persistent micropollutants remains contradictory i e removal of cbz was reported from 85 malmborg and magnér 2015 to 0 narumiya et al 2013 in addition their behaviour under thermophilic digestion has been little studied and never for a co treatment such as mad tar though it gives very promising results in this work the degradation of nine selected compounds caffeine ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole propranolol carbamazepine oxazepam diclofenac ibuprofen and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen and their sorption behavior was evaluated

in two different configurations i a conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad and i mesophilic anaerobic digestion combined with a thermophilic aerobic reactor as a co treatment process mad tar the mad was a stirred tank reactor with an effective volume of 260 l equipped with an agitator and a double jacket the tar with a liquid volume of 40 l was also equipped with an agitator and a double jacket the aeration was operated discontinuously in the tar compartment to provide a dissolved oxygen concentration measured by visiferm do optical sensor hamilton between 0 2 and 0 5 mg l 1 with an air flowrate of 300 l h 1 mad was connected to the tar by means of an albin peristaltic recirculation pump type alh15 its flow rate was fixed at 100 l h 1 and 15 l were recirculated from one compartment to the other three times per day corresponding to a retention time of 0 9 days in the tar the two compartments were heated by two independent cryostats in order to maintain the temperatures suitable for aerobic thermophilic 60 c and anaerobic mesophilic 35 c processes for the mad campaign the 40 l compartment was maintained at 35 c without aeration to be in fully mad

details of analytical conditions are presented in supplementary information table s3 performance characteristics of the method were evaluated by accuracy and precision on total fraction of primary sludge and digestate method accuracy estimated by means of relative recovery rr experiments and precision expressed as intra day repeatability in terms of relative standard deviation rsd were studied by spiking samples at different concentrations according to the concentration levels found in real samples rr of the analytes ranged within 90 120 and the intra day rsd values were found to be lower than 20 indicating a satisfactory accuracy and precision for all matrixes primary sludge and digestate total and liquid fractions limit of detection ld was calculated according to the epa s method by considering 3 times the standard deviation determined by analyzing 8 blank samples or spiked samples at low levels when it is necessary therefore it is a robust and reliable method for complex and simple matrices which makes it possible to study the performances of the mad and mad tar processes for each campaign 13 samples were taken and analyzed in duplicate by adding internal standards for each targeted molecule targeted prior to extraction for each samples and analytes standard deviations of less than 10 were obtained 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 mass balances and pharmaceuticals removal

cod and micropollutants statistical analysis was carried out following sperling et al 2020 recommendations linearity of the regression was confirmed for all parameters by ensuring that the linear model was satisfying the assumptions of linearity independence normality of residuals and homogeneity of variances furthermore calculations of the 95 confidence interval of the slope of linear model obtained for mad and mad tar campaign allowed evaluating if performances were significantly different not overlap of the confidence interval this analysis was performed with r software 2 4 2 distribution of target molecules between solid and liquid phases of sludge solid liquid partition coefficient kd l kgtss 1 of target molecules in sludge and supernatants of each sample was calculated

oxygen consumption in tar reactor in order to evaluate the fate of organic matter i e removal in aerobic or anaerobic conditions the oxygen uptake rate our in the tar was calculated from the decrease

with real influent the vss and codt concentrations after digestion remained constant with standard deviation below 4 considering comparable operating conditions see table 2 higher elimination of solid organic matter was achieved in the hybrid mad tar system around 76 for vss compared to the mesophilic one around 47 confirming lab results obtained a few years ago dumas et al 2010 during mad tar campaign cod balances were performed to estimate the fate of transformed cod collected grab samples at the inlet and outlet of the tar compartment allowed estimating that 26 6 of the total removed cod was eliminated in this thermophilic compartment the additional cod removal compared to mad campaign being eliminated in the aerated compartment no additional methane recovery in the mad compartment was allowed furthermore the average our in the tar was 7 5 0 8 mgo2 l 1 h 1 that corresponds only to 3 9 of the total removed cod that was degraded in aerobic conditions even if volatilization of certain substances such as volatile fatty acids could occur this observation tends to show that the thermophilic condition could have more effect than the aeration two main mechanisms could be associated with this temperature effect on the one hand the microbial activity could be directly positively affected indeed several authors reported a significant increase in hydrolysis rate in thermophilic compared to mesophilic conditions siegrist et al 2002 lynd et al 2002 ge et al 2011 even demonstrated that this rate strongly follow the arrhenius relationship with nearly a doubled value when increasing the temperature by 20 c on the other hand temperature may play a role in physical phenomena in particular on mass transfer and solubility even if their effect on the rate of microbial utilization remains to confirm lynd et al 2002 3 2 fate of pharmaceutical compounds during anaerobic digestion the total concentration μg l 1 of the nine selected compounds is illustrated in fig 1 for both primary sludge and digestate from mad fig 1a and mad tar fig 1b processes all the target molecules were detected and quantified in the primary sludge see table s4 for limit of detection even if some variations in the concentrations have been observed between the two experimental campaigns 23 in average during the mad tar experiment the order of magnitude was the same allowing for a relevant comparison of performances between the two operating conditions the highest concentrations of targeted compounds were observed for ofl and caf more than 40 μg l 1 while medium to low concentrations were reported for smx cbz pro dic oxa ibp and 2oh ibp around 1 0 10 0 μg l 1 the comparison of removal efficiencies in mad and mad tar are reported in fig 2 compounds placed above the dotted line show better removal efficiency by the innovative process mad tar compared to conventional process mad the highest removal yields were obtained for caf and smx 89 with slight increase in mad tar campaign for caf but with no significant differences between both processes for smx the removal of several other target compounds was significantly improved by mad tar process moderate removal ranging between 54 and 75 were observed for ofl and oxa respectively in mad tar compared to only 9 and 49 in mad moreover while pro was not removed at all during mad process a rate of 69 was achieved in mad tar dic and 2oh ibp presented low removal during mad tar 6 10 while they were accumulated in mad finally a negative removal rate was observed for ibp and cbz in both processes mad 30 and 71 respectively and mad tar 35 and 91 underlining that concentrations were higher in the digestate than in primary sludge in mad conditions similar removal efficiencies were reported in the literature for ofl pro narumiya et al 2013 caf narumiya et al 2013 and smx carballa et al 2007 narumiya et al 2013 alvarino et al 2014 falas et al 2016 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 ibuprofen is generally well removed under aerobic conditions alvarino et al 2018 but the removal under anaerobic conditions remained controversial carballa et al 2007 martín et al 2012 samaras et al 2013 showed a moderately high removal but recent studies found a recalcitrant behaviour after anaerobic processes alvarino et al 2014 phan et al 2018 as underlined in our results dic is generally persistent with low removal efficiencies alvarino et al 2014 ghattas et al 2017 phan et al 2018 gonzalez gil et al 2019 whereas moderate removal was showed in some lab scale data carballa et al 2007 malmborg and magnér 2015 cbz is also recalcitrant in wastewater treatments low or negligible removal was reported in the studies of ghattas et al 2017 alvarino et al 2018 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 phan et al 2018 kent and tay 2019 redox conditions played an important role conditioning the development of microbial populations and thus on biodegradation pathways thanks to the complementary hydrolytic capacities of external enzymes excreted by thermophilic aerobic bacteria some molecules are only degraded under specific aerobic anaerobic or both conditions stadler et al 2015 and alvarino et al 2018 studied the influence of redox potential in the removal of organic compounds showing that in the case of smx the microaerobic conditions increased their removal phan et al 2018 reported that molecules containing only electron donating functional groups nh2 oh ch3 och3 in their structure are more susceptible to biodegradation as it is the case of smx in anaerobic digestion ghattas et al 2017 proposed a degradation pathway via reduction of the electron withdrawing sulfonyl group in the case of ibp this molecule contains three electron donating functional groups and it should be biotransformed but it remains recalcitrant after anaerobic digestion maybe because their substitutions in their aromatic ring in the case of dic a possible pathway could be the reductive dichlorination phan et al 2018 or a biodegradation catalysed by decarboxylases or acetate kinases gonzalez gil et al 2019 concerning smx they reported that most probably pathway was the abiotic reduction of the ne o bond mediated by microbial reaction about dic they proposed that their biodegradation may be catalysed by decarboxylases or acetate kinases gonzalez gil et al 2019 microaeration on anaerobic digestion affects microbial communities by increasing the diversity and activity of hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms nguyen and khanal 2018 chen et al 2020 comparing microaeration to strict anaerobic condition an increase of phylum firmicutes class clostridia which is related to hydrolysis step was found in addition microaeration also affects the methane producing archaea presented in anaerobic digestion methanosarcina slightly aerotolerant and methanobacterium both doubled fu et al 2016 cometabolism is considered the main mechanism of pharmaceutical degradation during biological wastewater treatments gonzalez gil et al 2017 2018 further research is necessary to understand the degradation pathway attributed to co metabolism during hybrid digestion process and the additional degradation of some targeted micropollutants during mad tar therefore mad tar process allows the exposure of compounds to different redox and temperature conditions improving significantly the removal efficiency of oxa pro and ofl and slightly dic and 2oh ibp concomitantly with the improvement of overall organic matter degradation these are very positive results considering the ecotoxicological risks of oxa pro and ofl as underlined by besse et al 2008 however ibp and cbz even show more negative efficiencies and the mechanisms involved need further investigations the negative removal or apparent production of some molecules have already been reported in the literature explained by the transformation back of their metabolites to their parent compounds indeed parent chemicals are often excreted from the human body with a number of associated metabolites in the case of ibp it is excreted as the unchanged drug in 1 and 76 as metabolites petrie et al 2015 there is a general lack of data about metabolite concentrations and biotransformation during wastewater treatments but some authors reported higher metabolites concentrations than parent compound in urban wastewater for ibp brezinova et al 2018 in the case of cbz the negative removal or apparent production was also reported narumiya et al 2013 falas et al 2016 he et al 2019 reported the quantification of some phase i and phase ii metabolites of cbz showing that cbz n glucuronide cbz glu concentration 59 4 ng l 1 was higher than cbz 53 8 ng l 1 in wastewater influent from kyoto wwtp japan in their effluent cbz concentration increased by 15 and cbz glu decreased by 19 they attributed the increase of cbz to the deconjugation of cbz glu further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis in ibp and cbz as some metabolites may be biologically active and have similar pharmacological activity than parent compound besse et al 2008 3 3 partitioning pharmaceutical compounds considering the possible relation between sorption on solids and inaccessibility for biodegradation distribution of compounds was studied based on measured concentration in total and soluble phases as described in section 2 4 from eq 1 it is obvious that a single value of log kd is not enough to evaluate the partition of the compounds between solid and liquid phases and that this partitioning constant should be always given together with the tss concentration indeed in the case of primary sludge of mad campaign which presented the highest tss concentration a log kd value below 1 73 and 0 78 indicates that the percentage of compound in the liquid phase is above 50 and 90 respectively fig 3 a at the opposite when considering the lowest concentrated sludge i e the digestate during mad tar campaign log kd values below 2 31 and 1 36 indicate a percentage above 50 and 90 respectively fig 3b thus even if the partition coefficients were not greatly modified during digestion the significant decrease in tss in the mad tar campaign leads to higher fractions in the liquid fig 3a compared to the mad campaign fig 3b the distribution of targeted compounds between the particulate and liquid phases are presented in fig 4 primary sludge presented similar sorption behavior for the two campaigns ofl and pro showed the highest sorption 90 followed by oxa 71 ibp smx dic and cbz range of 35 63 finally a low sorption is found for 2oh ibp 20 and 24 mad and mad tar respectively and caf 21 and 34 mad and mad tar respectively the liquid fraction of smx 2oh ibp and pro increased slightly after digestion in mad 3 5 and moderately in mad tar 11 19 cbz and oxa increased moderately in mad 7 13 and significantly in mad tar 27 39 ibp and dic increased significantly in mad 23 34 and in mad tar 22 28 only caf presented a contradictory behaviour liquid fraction increased in mad tar 16 and decreased in mad 8 only ofl showed no significant change in sorption after digestion 0 and 2 in mad and mad tar respectively as indicated in table s5 for a same affinity constant the fraction in liquid after digestion is significantly different in mad and mad tar due to drastic changes in tss indeed the suspended solid concentration dropped from 18 5 3 4 to 11 7 0 5 g l 1 during the mad experiment and from 15 4 2 1 to 4 8 0 7 g l 1 during the mad tar campaign the difference in phase distribution after digestion can partly be attributed to the different ph value of primary and digested sludge because of the presence of compounds containing functional groups which can be protonated and deprotonated ternes et al 2004 in function of ph the compound can be neutral cationic anionic or zwitterionic consequently its physical chemical and biological properties may be affected verlicchi et al 2012 by inducing positively charged compounds that are likely to interact with the negatively charged surface of sludge or at the contrary anions inducing hydrophilic behaviour alvarino et al 2018 among the compounds mostly present in liquid phase after digestion ph 7 5 in mad 7 4 in mad tar ibp 2oh ibp and dic have a carboxylic acid group pka 4 15 4 63 for a ph higher than pka value the fraction of anionic species increased initial ph of the primary sludge was 6 1 6 2 after digestion of the organic matter the ph increased resulting in an increase of hydrophilicity of the compounds in line with our results for instance in the case of ibp the liquid fraction in primary sludge was 65 mad and 59 mad tar and it increased to 87 mad and 92 mad tar after digestion similar increase of liquid partition was found in dic and 2oh ibp the same partitioning behaviour was also expected in smx pka 1 8 and 5 6 at the range of ph in anaerobic digestion the fraction of anionic species should also increase due to the dissociation pathway of sulfonamides and consequently an increase of hydrophilicity is likely to occur ma et al 2015 confirmed in their study of oxidation of smx that the dissociation of smx increases with increasing ph consequently deprotonated compounds were more readily to oxidation in our study partition behaviour of smx remained almost constant before and after digestion liquid fraction slightly increased 5 11 among the compounds present mostly in solid phase ofl has a zwitterion structure with a basic amino group pka 9 28 and an acid carboxylic group pka 5 97 between ph 6 0 and 9 3 cationic protonated amino group anionic deprotonated carboxyl group and zwitterion species would be present at ph of digestion 7 4 7 5 zwitterions should be dominant in accordance with narumiya et al 2013 due to the increase of zwitterionic species the hydrophobicity of ofl would also increase this fact may explain the tendency to sorb in our study sorption behaviour of ofl did not significantly change and remained at high level with more than 99 of the molecule located in the particulate compartment oxa is uncharged under normal ph conditions svahn and björklund 2015 it has also a zwitterion structure pka 1 55 10 9 between ph 6 and 11 zwitterion and anionic species would be predominant with increasing ph during digestion anionic species would also increase resulting in higher hydrophilicity in agreement with our results the liquid fraction of oxa in primary sludge was 28 29 mad and mad tar and it increased to 65 67 mad and mad tar after digestion caf pka 10 40 and pro pka 9 42 are cationic species when ph is lower than pka value due to their protonated amino group during the digestion ph increased and the fraction of cationic species would decrease in favour to their neutral conjugates the increase in the neutral fraction would decrease the hydrophilicity of the molecules and hence liquid fraction would decrease narumiya et al 2013 we found this behaviour for caf during mad campaign where the liquid fraction decreased from 79 in primary sludge to 70 after digestion however liquid fraction of caf increased after digestion in mad tar campaign in the case of pro there was not a significant increase of hydrophilicity in mad campaign liquid fraction only increased 3 after digestion but the liquid fraction increased from 10 in primary sludge to 22 after digestion during mad tar experiment consequently a parameter other than ph influenced their solid liquid partition during mad tar campaign cbz pka 3 8 13 9 is a neutral compound and hence sorption should be governed by hydrophobic interactions hai et al 2018 without influence of ph urase and kikuta 2005 carballa et al 2008 svahn and björklund 2015 also suggested that hydrophobic adsorption would predominate because of the high apolar to polar surface ratio of the cbz according to our results liquid fraction of cbz increased after digestion in mad and mad tar process and hence a parameter other than ph should influence cbz partitioning behaviour during anaerobic digestion when considering the compounds that suffered a biodegradation during digestion results tend to show an improvement of biodegradation in mad tar that may be associated with the increase of the fraction in the liquid phase in the case of dic oxa and 2 oh ibp fig 5 the increase of the removal of ofl and pro may be linked to the increase of solid reduction in mad tar because of the fact that these molecules are largely sorbed in solids indeed the concentration of solids in mad tar decrease down to 4 9 mg l 1 compared to 11 7 mg l 1 in mad campaign resulting in an increased availability of compounds in the liquid phase smx and caf are widely removed in mad and mad tar campaigns so a clear link between liquid fraction and removal cannot be established furthermore liquid fraction of ibp decreased and cbz increased during mad tar campaign and both components showed more negative efficiencies during this campaign thus bioavailability cannot be the only mechanism driving the biodegradation and reversibility of the biological reactions has to be considered 4 conclusions the removal efficiency of nine pharmaceutical compounds in conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad was compared with mesophilic anaerobic digestion combined with a thermophilic aerobic reactor mad tar in addition to a significant improvement in the degradation of solid organic matter 76 vs 47 for mad tar and mad respectively interesting results were also obtained on the targeted compounds moderate dic 2oh ibp to high oxa pro ofl improvement of removal was observed in mad tar while removal higher than 90 was found for caf and smx whatever the process even if the mechanisms implied in the fate of ibp and cbz need further investigation hybrid process mad tar that combines two redox conditions anaerobic and micro aeration presents a feasible alternative to improve not only the removal a wide number of pollutants but also overall organic matter degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared
