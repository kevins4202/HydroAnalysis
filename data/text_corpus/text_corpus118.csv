590,the analysis of concentration discharge c q relationships provides useful information on the processes controlling the mobilization and delivery of chemical elements into streams as well as biogeochemical transformations in river networks previous metrics developed to characterize export regimes seldom considered the possibility for the c response to q dynamics to differ between short term q variations during storm events and seasonal q variations during baseflow periods here we present the c qquick slow model which considers the possibility for c q relationships to vary across temporal scales this model was applied in 219 french catchments with various sizes 11 2500 km² land use and hydrological contexts we evidenced contrasting export regimes for nitrate no3 total phosphorus tp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp and surprisingly consistent c q patterns at the seasonal scale for each parameter for instance no3 q relationships were positive at the seasonal scale in 75 cases and relationships during storms showed either a dilution pattern 24 cases a non significant pattern 50 or a mobilization pattern 12 tp and srp relationships with q at the seasonal scale were almost systematically negative 95 and patterns during storm events were in most cases mobilization for tp 77 or non significant for srp 69 we linked the different c q relationships with catchment descriptors and found that indicators of diffuse source loading determined no3 seasonal amplitudes and hydrological drivers could explain the behavior during storms by contrast point sources determined p seasonal amplitudes and diffuse sources controlled p dynamics during storms the c qquick slow model has the potential to improve nutrient load estimations because of the good

2009 moatar et al 2017 musolff et al 2017 2015 export regimes have been classified as chemostatic when concentrations vary little compared to discharge or chemodynamic when concentrations variability is larger musolff et al 2015 export regimes have generally been interpreted in terms of spatial distribution of sources in three spatial dimensions vertically in depth abbott et al 2018 dupas et al 2016 musolff et al 2016 laterally along hillslopes musolff et al 2017 and longitudinally from upstream to downstream reaches dupas et al 2019a 2017 tiwari et al 2017 homogeneously distributed sources mainly lead to chemostatic export regimes whereas heterogeneously distributed sources mainly lead to chemodynamic export regimes basu et al 2011 dupas et al 2016 godsey et al 2009 moatar et al 2017 musolff et al 2015 temporally variable biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems may also enhance or attenuate the chemostatic and chemodynamic character of export regimes minaudo et al 2015 different metrics and thresholds have been used to characterize export regimes on the one hand several authors have compared the coefficient of variation of concentration cvc to the coefficient of variation of discharge cvq dupas et al 2019b musolff et al 2017 2015 thompson et al 2011 underwood et al 2017 or investigated the so called temporal lorenz inequality gini coefficients jawitz and mitchell 2011 williams et al 2016 on the other hand other authors have used the slope of c q relationships in logarithmic domain as a metric of export regimes if the slope coefficient is non significantly different from zero the export regime is considered chemostatic while slopes significantly different from zero characterize a chemodynamic export regime ameli et al 2017 basu et al 2011 diamond and cohen 2018 godsey et al 2009 kim et al 2017 koenig et al 2017 moatar et al 2017 this second approach allows not only to characterize export regimes as chemostatic and chemodynamic but also to describe observed patterns as dilution constant and mobilization archetypes musolff et al 2017 however fitting a single linear regression on c q plots is sometimes questionable due to large dispersion in c q plots even log transformed many factors cause this dispersion i hysteresis and non linearity effects due to source and transport limitations benettin et al 2017 ii instream biogeochemical transformations on nutrient concentration without temporal correlation with hydrological variations bieroza and heathwaite 2015 moatar et al 2017 iii seasonal and long term variations in c q relationships hirsch 2014 zhang et al 2016 this dispersion in c q plots is a manifestation of ambivalent situations where the same q corresponds to different ecohydrological conditions in the catchment and thus produces different c bol et al 2018 ambivalent situations have been highlighted by several authors who found opposite c q patterns dilution versus mobilization at seasonal and storm event time scales duncan et al 2017a dupas et al 2017 li et al 2019 possibly leading to zero c q slopes on average although both seasonal and storm event slopes were significantly different from zero fig 1 is an illustrative example showing two c q relationships subject to high dispersion effects in these examples discharge during a summer storm event is comparable with discharge during winter baseflow but ecohydrological conditions differ considerably leading to different concentrations nitrate tended to be highest during winter baseflow observation a whereas p tended to be highest during a summer storm event observation d these examples suggest that considering both slow and quick flow components has the potential to improve c q models and this is the main hypothesis of this paper these examples also show that c observations during storm events overlap with values measured during baseflow periods therefore splitting the c q diagram based on a percentile of discharge diamond and cohen 2018 moatar et al 2017 does not necessarily separate storm events from seasonal variations and cannot possibly solve the dispersion effect commonly observed in c q plots the approach developed in the wrtds model weighted regression on time discharge and season hirsch 2014 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhang and ball 2017 addresses most of the dispersion issues listed above and efficiently interpolates low frequency time series unfortunately the wrtds model includes four parameters and therefore cannot be considered a parsimonious approach these coefficients are calibrated at each time step which makes difficult to interpret what drives the heterogeneity often observed in terms of catchment behavior this guided us towards the formulation of a double c q relationship the model named hereafter c qquick slow which enables seasonal slow c q slopes to differ from storm event quick c q slopes firstly we assessed the skills of our c qquick slow model to fit observations and characterize nutrient export regimes at both temporal scales secondly we explored the spatial variability of the different c q archetypes encountered across diverse physical and ecological contexts we expected variability in these c q relationships to be primarily controlled by land use and hydrological flow paths to test this hypothesis we established statistical links between a set of catchment descriptors e g land use cover and morphological hydrological and geological attributes and the c qquick slow model parameters this was achieved using a large database comprising 219 independent catchments 11 2500 km² where nitrate total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations have been monitored monthly and discharge measured daily within a french national program for water quality monitoring over the period 2008 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 c q analysis we assumed that c q relationships are the combination of the c response to seasonal slow q variations with the c response to storm event quick q variations and this constituted the essence of the c qquick slow model it does not necessarily mean that q variations are the cause of c variations but only that they covary or anti covary in time the seasonal and storm event variations in discharge were estimated from hydrograph separation into slow and quick components eq 1 1 c t β 0 β 1 l o g q s l o w t β 2 l o g q q u i c k t ε where all β i are adjusted coefficients and ε represents the residuals to estimate qslow and qquick we normalized discharge by interannual median flow and used the baseflow recursive filter method lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 with 3 passes and a filter parameter set at 0 925 this method separates total flow into a seasonal component and a short term component called hereafter storm event in the manuscript seasonality of the slow component was verified by computing autocorrelation curves of qslow at all sites figure s 1 in supplement file model outputs consisted in the fitted coefficients β0 β1 β2 and performance indicators the root mean squared error normalized by the standard deviation of observations nrmse adjusted explained variance r² adj and p values for each coefficient in eq 1 a linearity test was computed on residuals to verify that 95 of studentized residuals lied within the interval 2 2 for both the seasonal and the storm event scales the relationship between c and q variations could either be positive covariation or mobilization negative anti covariation or dilution or non significant chemostasis for nearly constant c or neutrality when c variations exist that are not driven by q fluctuations we considered a relationship to be non significant when the associated p value exceeded 0 05 the sign of the c q relationship at the seasonal scale β1 could be different from the sign of the c q relationship at the storm event scale β2 thus three possibilities negative non significant and positive for two temporal scales slow and quick led to consider that only 9 different c q archetypes theoretically exist 2 2 dataset for c q analysis water quality parameters included in this analysis were nitrate no3 total phosphorus tp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations were measured on grab samples collected for physico chemical analysis every other month on average across approximately 10 000 water quality stations present in the french national public database http www naiades eaufrance fr we selected stations meeting all the following criteria i c station can be paired with a q station data from http www hydro eaufrance fr when their catchments share at least 90 surface area ii all c catchments are independent iii c data contains at least 50 observations after outliers removal i e values over 200 mgn l 1 and 5 gp l 1 over the period 2008 2015 iv at least 30 of c observations occurred during major hydrological events defined here as q t 1 5 x qslow v trends on c are non significant over the period p value of sen s slope test 0 05 following hipel and mcleod 1994 to avoid penalizing the model finally stations where a single concentration value was observed more than 15 of the time were removed from the selection a situation often seen in p surveys when concentrations are below quantification limits this resulted in 219 catchments with respectively 179 138 and 107 individual time series for no3 tp and srp 2 3 relationships with catchment descriptors the selected catchments encompassed contrasting physical contexts in terms of morphology nutrient diffuse and point sources and hydrological and geological properties see table 1 and fig 2 for data description catchment size ranged from 11 to 2500 km² with 87 of catchments 500 km² approximately 55 of the catchments had at least 1 3 of their total area covered by arable land p arable indicating potentially high n and p surplus and thus stream water quality likely to be significantly impacted by diffuse agricultural sources most catchments received limited n and p point sources only 10 received over 10 kg n ha 1 y 1 and only 2 received over 0 1 kg p ha 1 y 1 lithological contexts included both sedimentary and crystalline bedrocks dominancy as shown by bimodal density plot on the percentage of catchment over a sedimentary bedrock p sedim on fig 2 hydrological descriptors covered a large climatic gradient mean standard deviation of effective rainfall base flow index bfi and index of hydrological reactivity w2 descriptions in table 1 were respectively 700 160 mm y 1 55 9 and 17 5 we investigated the link between fitted coefficients of the fitted c qquick slow model with a set of catchment descriptors table 1 and fig 2 using pearson correlation coefficients assuming linear relationships and associated p values we considered correlations as significant when p value 0 05 we conducted this correlation analysis on a subset of c q fitted coefficients that exhibited reasonable goodness of fit nrmse 200 all analyses were conducted with r r core team 2016 with ecohydrology lubridate hydrogof trend ggally and ggplot2 packages 3 results 3 1 c q model performances the nrmse was under 200 for 81 78 and 65 of catchments for no3 tp and srp respectively fig 3 the median r² adj value was 0 39 0 28 and 0 30 for no3 tp and srp respectively and 10th percentile 90th percentile ranges of r² adj were 0 12 0 63 0 11 0 43 and 0 07 0 60 approximately 80 of model fits passed the linearity test results not shown in the examples of fig 3 seasonal variations were well reproduced and concentration dynamics during short term storm events seemed to be correctly modeled for both dilution and mobilization processes even if some storm events were sometimes underestimated c q behaviors in a logscale c q diagram showed contrasting patterns and dispersion in these plots varied depending on which component slow or quick dominated the total flow 3 2 c q typologies for n and p interestingly only 2 or 3 c q archetypes among the nine possibilities were observed for each parameter fig 4 for no3 the seasonal component covaried positively in most cases with baseflow seasonality β1 0 for 86 of the catchments and the dynamics during storm were either non significant 52 cases showing a dilution pattern β2 0 28 of cases or a mobilization pattern β2 0 20 thus the most represented archetype was a positive c q slope at the seasonal scale combined with a non significant storm component 50 cases for tp 95 of catchments displayed seasonal variations opposite to baseflow seasonality β1 0 the remaining 5 presented a non significant seasonal component the tp dynamics during storm events were a mobilization pattern in most cases β2 0 for 81 and the remaining 19 presented non significant dynamics during storms the most represented c q archetype for tp was a negative c q slope at the seasonal scale combined with a mobilization storm component 77 for srp seasonality was similar to tp i e a negative c q slope at the seasonal scale for 96 of the catchments β1 0 compared to tp a larger proportion of catchments presented a non significant storm event component this concerned 69 catchments and represented the most observed c q archetype as 23 presented a mobilization pattern and only 4 a dilution pattern these nine different c q archetypes were highly contrasted when presented in a classic logscale c q diagram fig 4c dilution or mobilization patterns were clearly represented and dispersion in the plots depended on which component slow or quick dominated points corresponding to a quick component dominating the total flow were found on top or bottom of the cloud of points depending on the sign of β2 as expected from our c q model design negative β2 produced a larger dispersion towards lower c values and positive β2 produced a larger dispersion towards higher c values 3 3 linking c q relationships with catchment descriptors the link between c q fitted coefficients calibrated with eq 1 and a set of catchment descriptors was assessed based on linear pearson correlations we computed correlation values for the c q types encountered more than 10 of the time in the database section 3 1 the coefficient β0 represented the background pollution β1 was associated with seasonal variations and β2 the variations in storms for no3 fig 5 the background pollution β0 was highly correlated with diffuse agricultural sources r correlation coefficients ranged from 0 6 to 1 with n surplus and the proportion of arable land in the catchment for all c q types identified the seasonal component β1 was highly linked with β0 correlation was over 0 9 indicating larger seasonal magnitude in the most polluted catchments the magnitude of the storm component β2 was linked to diffuse sources significant correlation coefficients were found between β2 and p arable n surplus and erosion rate depending on the c q type hydrological descriptors erosion rate and lithology classes differentiated the catchments presenting contrasting c q archetypes dilution patterns in storms β2 0 were associated with high bfi values low w2 values low values of erosion rate and mostly located on crystalline bedrock by contrast mobilization patterns in storms β2 0 were associated with catchments presenting low bfi high w2 and high erosion rate and mostly located on sedimentary rocks for tp fig 6 the coefficient β0 was highly and positively correlated with point p sources r was 0 6 1 seasonal dynamic was always opposite to the baseflow q seasonality β1 0 fig 4 the amplitude of the seasonal component β1 was clearly anti correlated with p point sources r was 1 to 0 8 we found that compared to catchments where behavior in storms was not significant catchments with significant mobilization storm event component presented higher ranges of p surplus soil p content erosion rate effective rainfall and bfi and lower range of w2 in the case of significant mobilization pattern during storm events the highest correlations with β2 were found with p point sources r was 0 7 in the case of significant mobilization pattern during storm events rainfall bfi and w2 presented strong correlations with β0 r were respectively 0 9 0 6 and 0 7 for srp fig 7 although correlations between srp c q coefficients and catchment descriptors were lower or less significant than the correlation found for the analysis on tp similar interpretation could be made β0 and β2 were positively linked with point sources while seasonality β1 was anti correlated with point sources compared to catchments with a non significant storm component catchments with mobilization storm event components presented higher ranges of p surplus soil p content and lower erosion rate 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient export regimes at seasonal and storm event scales the c qquick slow model revealed different export regimes for nitrate and phosphorus forms at both seasonal and storm event time scales nutrient concentration responses to storm events were sometimes opposite to seasonal responses to q variations resulting in large dispersion in c q plots as is usually observed this supports the observations from previous studies duncan et al 2017b 2017a li et al 2019 showing that c q relationships may vary across different time scales because the different processes shaping c q curves have different temporalities despite the diversity of catchment characteristics in our analysis only two or three c q archetypes were observed among nine theoretical possibilities this supports the idea developed in moatar et al 2017 that the same processes control respectively n and p transfers across a wide range of environmental conditions seasonal variations displayed consistent patterns across the entire database we observed positive slow component for nitrate β1 0 and negative slow component for phosphorus β1 0 the processes responsible for seasonal covariation between nitrate and baseflow are either associated with connectivity fluctuation between the stream and the groundwater table curie et al 2011 duncan et al 2015 pinay et al 1993 or with riparian and in stream denitrification and biological assimilation uptake disentangling these different processes is challenging because they often occur at the same time biogeochemical transformations often take place in conditions with high temperature and or light conditions and long residence times which coincides with periods of low hydrological connectivity and thus low transport capacity opposite seasonality variations between phosphorus concentration and discharge probably result from point sources and their degree of dilution controlling seasonal variations however recent studies have found that summer reductive dissolution of iron oxy hydroxide could also mimic this point source signal dupas et al 2018 smolders et al 2017 it is however noteworthy to remind that in large eutrophic rivers srp seasonality can covary with baseflow seasonality due to large algae uptake when low flow coincides with long transit time optimal light and temperature conditions minaudo et al 2018 2015 this particular pattern was not observed in the present study and we would argue that the selected catchments were too small for algal uptake to become a dominant driver of srp seasonality storm components for nitrate were in most cases non significant suggesting almost unlimited n supply due to large legacy effects van meter and basu 2015 this storm component was sometimes negative indicating dilution effects of diffuse sources by overland flow dupas et al 2016 fovet et al 2018 the storm component was sometimes positive indicating a temporary reconnection between surface and sub surface waters in catchments likely presenting a vertical gradient of n sources storms likely flush n stored in the vadose zone bende michl et al 2013 for p when significant the storm component was in most cases positive indicating the mobilization of both particulate and dissolved phosphorus this may occur near agricultural areas with potential interactions with sub surface water dupas et al 2015c gu et al 2018 2017 minaudo et al 2017 or in stream by simply re mobilizing fine sediments stored in the river bed or stored in the river banks jarvie et al 2012 powers et al 2016 4 2 what determines c q relationships at the seasonal and storm event scales other studies have looked at potential links between c q parameters and catchment descriptors in most cases correlations were poor diamond and cohen 2018 godsey et al 2009 but these works evidenced relationships with catchment size land use and lithology in our study and for all three no3 tp and srp we found strong correlations between c q coefficients βi and readily available catchment variables derived from open access gis databases we found that the magnitude of the background pollution β0 is determined by diffuse sources intensity n surplus or p arable for nitrate and by point sources inputs p point for tp and srp interestingly and for all three parameters the absolute magnitude of the seasonal component β1 was positively correlated with higher background pollution concentration β0 suggesting that diffuse sources and point sources respectively control seasonal amplitudes of nitrate and phosphorus concentrations this implies that the most polluted catchments are also the ones with the highest seasonal amplitudes different reasons can explain this observation for nitrate baseflow concentrations during winter high flow varied more than during summer low flow among the catchments see supplementary figure s 2 arguably because stoichiometric controls during the summer period lead to similar concentrations in different types of catchments whereas winter concentration better reflects n sources intensity among catchments fovet et al 2018 this supports some recent findings showing that spatial stability for nitrate concentrations is higher over winter months dupas et al 2019b for phosphorus we showed that point sources largely control the background pollution in the catchments studied here thus higher loads discharged constantly throughout the year in rivers where flow variations are seasonal is likely to result in limited dilution capacity during low flows producing large seasonal variations in concentrations during storm events we found that the dynamics of both nitrate and phosphorus were linked to both nutrient source indicators and hydrological properties for instance we found for no3 that high bfi values low w2 and low erosion differentiated c q dilution patterns from non significant and mobilization types this suggested that catchments where shallow groundwater flow contribution dominates are likely to display dilution patterns in storm events due to a sudden increased contribution of young age water benettin et al 2017 hrachowitz et al 2016 for tp and srp we found that wet catchments with high diffuse p sources and high erosion rates were likely to display a significant mobilization storm event component this supported the idea that dissolved and particulate p flush during a short term storm event is the consequence of re mobilization of particles from the river bed or from the streams bank sides fox et al 2016 or the result of an increased connectivity between groundwater and streamflow ali et al 2017 dupas et al 2015c gu et al 2017 rose et al 2018 4 3 potential use of this approach for load estimations in most countries water quality monitoring strategies rely on low frequency surveys typically executed monthly dupas et al 2019b these surveys are used to determine the water quality status of streams based on a set of simple metrics such as the interannual 90th percentile concentration or interannual fluxes the validity of these estimations derived from low frequency data has largely been questioned e g audet et al 2014 cassidy and jordan 2011 johnes 2007 moatar et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 rozemeijer et al 2010 and raises some major management issues where the assessment of water quality indicators is critical when applicable the c qquick slow model has the potential for interpolating low frequency c time series based on daily q and therefor decreases uncertainties in water quality indicators we illustrated this potential with data from one water quality station located in brittany where nitrate was monitored daily between 2007 and 2011 see supplement file first we subsampled the data to simulate a monthly survey and then interpolated the subsampled data using the c qquick slow model and compared the reconstructed daily concentration and loads to the observations results with this example were promising no3 annual load errors remained under 5 instead of 10 with a discharge weighted method commonly used in the literature moatar and meybeck 2005 and average standard deviation errors on monthly loads were 8 6 additionally the high correlations observed between c q coefficients and catchment descriptors suggest that it is possible to predict the most likely c q archetype for any catchment and then estimate annual and seasonal loads applications are numerous and might be the key to empirical estimation of loads in catchments where discharge is measured or can be modelled but not water quality predicting c q relationships based on our formulation has to be tested on a large database that covers a large diversity of local contexts in terms of catchment morphology geology land use climate and hydrology 4 4 limits and perspectives although the c qquick slow model provided good results for a majority of catchments c q fits were poor for another significant proportion of them this failure to fit the c qquick slow model to these catchments means that they do not match one or several of the hypothesis of the model they could display more complex patterns than what the model can describe or be too chemostatic for a c q model to perform well for example the c qquick slow model does not consider hysteresis effects at both seasonal and storm event times scales although these are commonly observed bieroza and heathwaite 2015 dupas et al 2015b minaudo et al 2017 rose et al 2018 besides the slow and quick components defined based on baseflow separation techniques represent in reality more a separation of responses in time to streamflow variations than a water source separation mcdonnell and beven 2014 in the particular case of nitrate we assumed that a concentration gradient across the subsurface to groundwater layer would be enough to explain slow and quick variations in time but a non significant quick component in 52 cases in our study may indicate a conceptual limitation of our model indeed the c qquick slow model does not allow storm event responses to vary across seasons although several studies have documented these variations dupas et al 2016 fovet et al 2018 in our approach the magnitude of c variations among events as a linear function of log transformed quickflow variations but the sign of the c q coefficient β2 or its intensity across a succession of similar q events could not change thus the c q relationship could only be poorly adjusted to the observations for catchments where the behavior for summer storms is for instance inverted compared to the behavior for winter storms or where c supply is easily depleted an interaction term between the two temporal scales could be added to the equation but this would result in an additional coefficient that would increase the risk of overfitting the model finally we assumed in this study that grab samples could represent a daily mean concentration which is not verified in several studies in small catchments showing large sub daily variations halliday et al 2015 minaudo et al 2017 rode et al 2016 thus increasing uncertainty of the model calibration data although this certainly limits the use of the c qquick slow model with grab sample data in small and hydrologically reactive catchments the model could be tested with sub daily probe data where they exist 5 conclusions the c qquick slow model is a new c q model that considers the possibility for different c q relationships at the storm event scale and at the seasonal scale results showed that the slopes of c q relationships can be different or even opposite at storm event time and seasonal scales which explains a large part of the dispersion commonly observed in c q plots we showed that no3 q relationships at the seasonal scale were in 75 cases positive and relationships in storms were either showing dilution pattern 24 cases a non significant pattern 50 or a mobilization pattern 12 tp and srp relationships with q at the seasonal scale were almost systematically negative 95 and patterns during storm events were in most cases showing a mobilization for tp 77 or were non significant for srp 69 we have linked the different c q relationships with catchment descriptors and found that indicators of diffuse sources loads determined no3 seasonal amplitudes and hydrological drivers could explain the behavior during storms in contrast point sources determined p seasonal amplitudes and diffuse sources combined with erosion rate likely controlled p behavior during storm events the c qquick slow model has the potential to improve nutrient load estimations because of the good predictability of appropriate c q archetypes and the possibility to interpolate low frequency concentration data to a daily frequency

in the wrtds model weighted regression on time discharge and season hirsch 2014 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhang and ball 2017 addresses most of the dispersion issues listed above and efficiently interpolates low frequency time series unfortunately the wrtds model includes four parameters and therefore cannot be considered a parsimonious approach these coefficients are calibrated at each time step which makes difficult to interpret what drives the heterogeneity often observed in terms of catchment behavior this guided us towards the formulation of a double c q relationship the model named hereafter c qquick slow which enables seasonal slow c q slopes to differ from storm event quick c q slopes firstly we assessed the skills of our c qquick slow model to fit observations and characterize nutrient export regimes at both temporal scales secondly we explored the spatial variability of the different c q archetypes encountered across diverse physical and ecological contexts we expected variability in these c q relationships to be primarily controlled by land use and hydrological flow paths to test this hypothesis we established statistical links between a set of catchment descriptors e g land use cover and morphological hydrological and geological attributes and the c qquick slow model parameters this was achieved using a large database comprising 219 independent catchments 11 2500 km² where nitrate total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations have been monitored monthly and discharge measured daily within a french national program for water quality monitoring over the period 2008 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 c q analysis we assumed that c q relationships are the combination of the c response to seasonal slow q variations with the c response to storm event quick q variations and this constituted the essence of the c qquick slow model it does not necessarily mean that q variations are the cause of c variations but only that they covary or anti covary in time the seasonal and storm event variations in discharge were estimated from hydrograph separation into slow and quick components eq 1 1 c t β 0 β 1 l o g q s l o w t β 2 l o g q q u i c k t ε where all β i are adjusted coefficients and ε represents the residuals to estimate qslow and qquick we normalized discharge by interannual median flow and used the baseflow recursive filter method lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 with 3 passes and a filter parameter set at 0 925 this method separates total flow into a seasonal component and a short term component called hereafter storm event in the manuscript seasonality of the slow component was verified by computing autocorrelation curves of qslow at all sites figure s 1 in supplement file model outputs consisted in the fitted coefficients β0 β1 β2 and performance indicators the root mean squared error normalized by the standard deviation of observations nrmse adjusted explained variance r² adj and p values for each coefficient in eq 1 a linearity test was computed on residuals to verify that 95 of studentized residuals lied within the interval 2 2 for both the seasonal and the storm event scales the relationship between c and q variations could either be positive covariation or mobilization negative anti covariation or dilution or non significant chemostasis for nearly constant c or neutrality when c variations exist that are not driven by q fluctuations we considered a relationship to be non significant when the associated p value exceeded 0 05 the sign of the c q relationship at the seasonal scale β1 could be different from the sign of the c q relationship at the storm event scale β2 thus three possibilities negative non significant and positive for two temporal scales slow and quick led to consider that only 9 different c q archetypes theoretically exist 2 2 dataset for c q analysis water quality parameters included in this analysis were nitrate no3 total phosphorus tp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations were measured on grab samples collected for physico chemical analysis every other month on average across approximately 10 000 water quality stations present in the french national public database http www naiades eaufrance fr we selected stations meeting all the following criteria i c station can be paired with a q station data from http www hydro eaufrance fr when their catchments share at least 90 surface area ii all c catchments are independent iii c data contains at least 50 observations after outliers removal i e values over 200 mgn l 1 and 5 gp l 1 over the period 2008 2015 iv at least 30 of c observations occurred during major hydrological events defined here as q t 1 5 x qslow v trends on c are non significant over the period p value of sen s slope test 0 05 following hipel and mcleod 1994 to avoid penalizing the model finally stations where a single concentration value was observed more than 15 of the time were removed from the selection a situation often seen in p surveys when concentrations are below quantification limits this resulted in 219 catchments with respectively 179 138 and 107 individual time series for no3 tp and srp 2 3 relationships with catchment descriptors the selected catchments encompassed contrasting physical contexts in terms of morphology nutrient diffuse and point sources and hydrological and geological properties see table 1 and fig 2 for data description catchment size ranged from 11 to 2500 km² with 87 of catchments 500 km² approximately 55 of the catchments had at least 1 3 of their total area covered by arable land p arable indicating potentially high n and p surplus and thus stream water quality likely to be significantly impacted by diffuse agricultural sources most catchments received limited n and p point sources only 10 received over 10 kg n ha 1 y 1 and only 2 received over 0 1 kg p ha 1 y 1 lithological contexts included both sedimentary and crystalline bedrocks dominancy as shown by bimodal density plot on the percentage of catchment over a sedimentary bedrock p sedim on fig 2 hydrological descriptors covered a large climatic gradient mean standard deviation of effective rainfall base flow index bfi and index of hydrological reactivity w2 descriptions in table 1 were respectively 700 160 mm y 1 55 9 and 17 5 we investigated the link between fitted coefficients of the fitted c qquick slow model with a set of catchment descriptors table 1 and fig 2 using pearson correlation coefficients assuming linear relationships and associated p values we considered correlations as significant when p value 0 05 we conducted this correlation analysis on a subset of c q fitted coefficients that exhibited reasonable goodness of fit nrmse 200 all analyses were conducted with r r core team 2016 with ecohydrology lubridate hydrogof trend ggally and ggplot2 packages 3 results 3 1 c q model performances the nrmse was under 200 for 81 78 and 65 of catchments for no3 tp and srp respectively fig 3 the median r² adj value was 0 39 0 28 and 0 30 for no3 tp and srp respectively and 10th percentile 90th percentile ranges of r² adj were 0 12 0 63 0 11 0 43 and 0 07 0 60 approximately 80 of model fits passed the linearity test results not shown in the examples of fig 3 seasonal variations were well reproduced and concentration dynamics during short term storm events seemed to be correctly modeled for both dilution and mobilization processes even if some storm events were sometimes underestimated c q behaviors in a logscale c q diagram showed contrasting patterns and dispersion in these plots varied depending on which component slow or quick dominated the total flow 3 2 c q typologies for n and p interestingly only 2 or 3 c q archetypes among the nine possibilities were observed for each parameter fig 4 for no3 the seasonal component covaried positively in most cases with baseflow seasonality β1 0 for 86 of the catchments and the dynamics during storm were either non significant 52 cases showing a dilution pattern β2 0 28 of cases or a mobilization pattern β2 0 20 thus the most represented archetype was a positive c q slope at the seasonal scale combined with a non significant storm component 50 cases for tp 95 of catchments displayed seasonal variations opposite to baseflow seasonality β1 0 the remaining 5 presented a non significant seasonal component the tp dynamics during storm events were a mobilization pattern in most cases β2 0 for 81 and the remaining 19 presented non significant dynamics during storms the most represented c q archetype for tp was a negative c q slope at the seasonal scale combined with a mobilization storm component 77 for srp seasonality was similar to tp i e a negative c q slope at the seasonal scale for 96 of the catchments β1 0 compared to tp a larger proportion of catchments presented a non significant storm event component this concerned 69 catchments and represented the most observed c q archetype as 23 presented a mobilization pattern and only 4 a dilution pattern these nine different c q archetypes were highly contrasted when presented in a classic logscale c q diagram fig 4c dilution or mobilization patterns were clearly represented and dispersion in the plots depended on which component slow or quick dominated points corresponding to a quick component dominating the total flow were found on top or bottom of the cloud of points depending on the sign of β2 as expected from our c q model design negative β2 produced a larger dispersion towards lower c values and positive β2 produced a larger dispersion towards higher c values 3 3 linking c q relationships with catchment descriptors the link between c q fitted coefficients calibrated with eq 1 and a set of catchment descriptors was assessed based on linear pearson correlations we computed correlation values for the c q types encountered more than 10 of the time in the database section 3 1 the coefficient β0 represented the background pollution β1 was associated with seasonal variations and β2 the variations in storms for no3 fig 5 the background pollution β0 was highly correlated with diffuse agricultural sources r correlation coefficients ranged from 0 6 to 1 with n surplus and the proportion of arable land in the catchment for all c q types identified the seasonal component β1 was highly linked with β0 correlation was over 0 9 indicating larger seasonal magnitude in the most polluted catchments the magnitude of the storm component β2 was linked to diffuse sources significant correlation coefficients were found between β2 and p arable n surplus and erosion rate depending on the c q type hydrological descriptors erosion rate and lithology classes differentiated the catchments presenting contrasting c q archetypes dilution patterns in storms β2 0 were associated with high bfi values low w2 values low values of erosion rate and mostly located on crystalline bedrock by contrast mobilization patterns in storms β2 0 were associated with catchments presenting low bfi high w2 and high erosion rate and mostly located on sedimentary rocks for tp fig 6 the coefficient β0 was highly and positively correlated with point p sources r was 0 6 1 seasonal dynamic was always opposite to the baseflow q seasonality β1 0 fig 4 the amplitude of the seasonal component β1 was clearly anti correlated with p point sources r was 1 to 0 8 we found that compared to catchments where behavior in storms was not significant catchments with significant mobilization storm event component presented higher ranges of p surplus soil p content erosion rate effective rainfall and bfi and lower range of w2 in the case of significant mobilization pattern during storm events the highest correlations with β2 were found with p point sources r was 0 7 in the case of significant mobilization pattern during storm events rainfall bfi and w2 presented strong correlations with β0 r were respectively 0 9 0 6 and 0 7 for srp fig 7 although correlations between srp c q coefficients and catchment descriptors were lower or less significant than the correlation found for the analysis on tp similar interpretation could be made β0 and β2 were positively linked with point sources while seasonality β1 was anti correlated with point sources compared to catchments with a non significant storm component catchments with mobilization storm event components presented higher ranges of p surplus soil p content and lower erosion rate 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient export regimes at seasonal and storm event scales the c qquick slow model revealed different export regimes for nitrate and phosphorus forms at both seasonal and storm event time scales nutrient concentration responses to storm events were sometimes opposite to seasonal responses to q variations resulting in large dispersion in c q plots as is usually observed this supports the observations from previous studies duncan et al 2017b 2017a li et al 2019 showing that c q relationships may vary across different time scales because the different processes shaping c q curves have different temporalities despite the diversity of catchment characteristics in our analysis only two or three c q archetypes were observed among nine theoretical possibilities this supports the idea developed in moatar et al 2017 that the same processes control respectively n and p transfers across a wide range of environmental conditions seasonal variations displayed consistent patterns across the entire database we observed positive slow component for nitrate β1 0 and negative slow component for phosphorus β1 0 the processes responsible for seasonal covariation between nitrate and baseflow are either associated with connectivity fluctuation between the stream and the groundwater table curie et al 2011 duncan et al 2015 pinay et al 1993 or with riparian and in stream denitrification and biological assimilation uptake disentangling these different processes is challenging because they often occur at the same time biogeochemical transformations often take place in conditions with high temperature and or light conditions and long residence times which coincides with periods of low hydrological connectivity and thus low transport capacity opposite seasonality variations between phosphorus concentration and discharge probably result from point sources and their degree of dilution controlling seasonal variations however recent studies have found that summer reductive dissolution of iron oxy hydroxide could also mimic this point source signal dupas et al 2018 smolders et al 2017 it is however noteworthy to remind that in large eutrophic rivers srp seasonality can covary with baseflow seasonality due to large algae uptake when low flow coincides with long transit time optimal light and temperature conditions minaudo et al 2018 2015 this particular pattern was not observed in the present study and we would argue that the selected catchments were too small for algal uptake to become a dominant driver of srp seasonality storm components for nitrate were in most cases non significant suggesting almost unlimited n supply due to large legacy effects van meter and basu 2015 this storm component was sometimes negative indicating dilution effects of diffuse sources by overland flow dupas et al 2016 fovet et al 2018 the storm component was sometimes positive indicating a temporary reconnection between surface and sub surface waters in catchments likely presenting a vertical gradient of n sources storms likely flush n stored in the vadose zone bende michl et al 2013 for p when significant the storm component was in most cases positive indicating the mobilization of both particulate and dissolved phosphorus this may occur near agricultural areas with potential interactions with sub surface water dupas et al 2015c gu et al 2018 2017 minaudo et al 2017 or in stream by simply re mobilizing fine sediments stored in the river bed or stored in the river banks jarvie et al 2012 powers et al 2016 4 2 what determines c q relationships at the seasonal and storm event scales other studies have looked at potential links between c q parameters and catchment descriptors in most cases correlations were poor diamond and cohen 2018 godsey et al 2009 but these works evidenced relationships with catchment size land use and lithology in our study and for all three no3 tp and srp we found strong correlations between c q coefficients βi and readily available catchment variables derived from open access gis databases we found that the magnitude of the background pollution β0 is determined by diffuse sources intensity n surplus or p arable for nitrate and by point sources inputs p point for tp and srp interestingly and for all three parameters the absolute magnitude of the seasonal component β1 was positively correlated with higher background pollution concentration β0 suggesting that diffuse sources and point sources respectively control seasonal amplitudes of nitrate and phosphorus concentrations this implies that the most polluted catchments are also the ones with the highest seasonal amplitudes different reasons can explain this observation for nitrate baseflow concentrations during winter high flow varied more than during summer low flow among the catchments see supplementary figure s 2 arguably because stoichiometric controls during the summer period lead to similar concentrations in different types of catchments whereas winter concentration better reflects n sources intensity among catchments fovet et al 2018 this supports some recent findings showing that spatial stability for nitrate concentrations is higher over winter months dupas et al 2019b for phosphorus we showed that point sources largely control the background pollution in the catchments studied here thus higher loads discharged constantly throughout the year in rivers where flow variations are seasonal is likely to result in limited dilution capacity during low flows producing large seasonal variations in concentrations during storm events we found that the dynamics of both nitrate and phosphorus were linked to both nutrient source indicators and hydrological properties for instance we found for no3 that high bfi values low w2 and low erosion differentiated c q dilution patterns from non significant and mobilization types this suggested that catchments where shallow groundwater flow contribution dominates are likely to display dilution patterns in storm events due to a sudden increased contribution of young age water benettin et al 2017 hrachowitz et al 2016 for tp and srp we found that wet catchments with high diffuse p sources and high erosion rates were likely to display a significant mobilization storm event component this supported the idea that dissolved and particulate p flush during a short term storm event is the consequence of re mobilization of particles from the river bed or from the streams bank sides fox et al 2016 or the result of an increased connectivity between groundwater and streamflow ali et al 2017 dupas et al 2015c gu et al 2017 rose et al 2018 4 3 potential use of this approach for load estimations in most countries water quality monitoring strategies rely on low frequency surveys typically executed monthly dupas et al 2019b these surveys are used to determine the water quality status of streams based on a set of simple metrics such as the interannual 90th percentile concentration or interannual fluxes the validity of these estimations derived from low frequency data has largely been questioned e g audet et al 2014 cassidy and jordan 2011 johnes 2007 moatar et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 rozemeijer et al 2010 and raises some major management issues where the assessment of water quality indicators is critical when applicable the c qquick slow model has the potential for interpolating low frequency c time series based on daily q and therefor decreases uncertainties in water quality indicators we illustrated this potential with data from one water quality station located in brittany where nitrate was monitored daily between 2007 and 2011 see supplement file first we subsampled the data to simulate a monthly survey and then interpolated the subsampled data using the c qquick slow model and compared the reconstructed daily concentration and loads to the observations results with this example were promising no3 annual load errors remained under 5 instead of 10 with a discharge weighted method commonly used in the literature moatar and meybeck 2005 and average standard deviation errors on monthly loads were 8 6 additionally the high correlations observed between c q coefficients and catchment descriptors suggest that it is possible to predict the most likely c q archetype for any catchment and then estimate annual and seasonal loads applications are numerous and might be the key to empirical estimation of loads in catchments where discharge is measured or can be modelled but not water quality predicting c q relationships based on our formulation has to be tested on a large database that covers a large diversity of local contexts in terms of catchment morphology geology land use climate and hydrology 4 4 limits and perspectives although the c qquick slow model provided good results for a majority of catchments c q fits were poor for another significant proportion of them this failure to fit the c qquick slow model to these catchments means that they do not match one or several of the hypothesis of the model they could display more complex patterns than what the model can describe or be too chemostatic for a c q model to perform well for example the c qquick slow model does not consider hysteresis effects at both seasonal and storm event times scales although these are commonly observed bieroza and heathwaite 2015 dupas et al 2015b minaudo et al 2017 rose et al 2018 besides the slow and quick components defined based on baseflow separation techniques represent in reality more a separation of responses in time to streamflow variations than a water source separation mcdonnell and beven 2014 in the particular case of nitrate we assumed that a concentration gradient across the subsurface to groundwater layer would be enough to explain slow and quick variations in time but a non significant quick component in 52 cases in our study may indicate a conceptual limitation of our model indeed the c qquick slow model does not allow storm event responses to vary across seasons although several studies have documented these variations dupas et al 2016 fovet et al 2018 in our approach the magnitude of c variations among events as a linear function of log transformed quickflow variations but the sign of the c q coefficient β2 or its intensity across a succession of similar q events could not change thus the c q relationship could only be poorly adjusted to the observations for catchments where the behavior for summer storms is for instance inverted compared to the behavior for winter storms or where c supply is easily depleted an interaction term between the two temporal scales could be added to the equation but this would result in an additional coefficient that would increase the risk of overfitting the model finally we assumed in this study that grab samples could represent a daily mean concentration which is not verified in several studies in small catchments showing large sub daily variations halliday et al 2015 minaudo et al 2017 rode et al 2016 thus increasing uncertainty of the model calibration data although this certainly limits the use of the c qquick slow model with grab sample data in small and hydrologically reactive catchments the model could be tested with sub daily probe data where they exist 5 conclusions the c qquick slow model is a new c q model that considers the possibility for different c q relationships at the storm event scale and at the seasonal scale results showed that the slopes of c q relationships can be different or even opposite at storm event time and seasonal scales which explains a large part of the dispersion commonly observed in c q plots we showed that no3 q relationships at the seasonal scale were in 75 cases positive and relationships in storms were either showing dilution pattern 24 cases a non significant pattern 50 or a mobilization pattern 12 tp and srp relationships with q at the seasonal scale were almost systematically negative 95 and patterns during storm events were in most cases showing a mobilization for tp 77 or were non significant for srp 69 we have linked the different c q relationships with catchment descriptors and found that indicators of diffuse sources loads determined no3 seasonal amplitudes and hydrological drivers could explain the behavior during storms in contrast point sources determined p seasonal amplitudes and diffuse sources combined with erosion rate likely controlled p behavior during storm events the c qquick slow model has the potential to improve nutrient load estimations because of the good predictability of appropriate c q archetypes and the possibility to interpolate low frequency concentration data to a daily frequency

591,with the aim of better understand and parameterize the physical processes involved in flow mangrove interaction wave attenuation and drag forces along a 1 6 scale fringe rhizophora mangrove forest are studied experimentally the 26 m long forest is composed by 135 models built reproducing mature rhizophora mangrove trees with 24 prop roots hydrodynamic conditions are scaled using froude similarity based on values collected in nature regular and random waves are tested and three water depths are considered to account for the influence of variable mangroves frontal area along the vertical wave decay analysis highlights the importance of considering the effect of flume bottom and walls friction neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove dissipation capacity it is proven that water depth and the associated mangroves frontal area and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves the slope seaward the forest induces wave shoaling leading to an increase of wave steepness accordingly the exerted forces on the mangroves also increase along the first 3 4 m of the forest smaller forces are recorded further into the forest where wave decay formulations fit well to the recorded wave heights in general analytical drag forces obtained by using mangrove trees induced damping coefficients compare well to the forces measured within the forest however analytical drag forces can lead to overestimations of up to double in some cases this aspect is very important when experimental results are used to feed numerical or analytical models based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation these models should be calibrated using whenever possible direct force measurements keywords rhizophora mangrove forest large scale 3 d model wave attenuation damping coefficient drag force experimental analysis 1 introduction mangrove forests grow in intertidal and coastal areas in the tropical and subtropical zones and they are characterized by their complex root system specially red mangroves as rhizophora species the capacity of these ecosystems to reduce the incoming flow energy has already been proven e g mazda et al 1997a vo luong and massel 2008 narayan et al 2016 additionally these ecosystems can be resilient to climate change and provide with additional ecosystem services such us to build and bind soils increasing biodiversity improving water quality housing nursery areas and fish production providing with raw materials and recreation services to local populations and acting as co2 sinks are also among the services they provide barbier et al 2011 mitsh and gosselink 2015 their capacity to protect coastal areas is of great interest since the most vulnerable countries to natural hazards in the world are all tropical coastal developing nations bündnis entwicklung hilft 2017 where mangrove forests can play a crucial role in reducing risk to population it has been proven that mangroves reduce annual flooding to millions of people menéndez et al 2018 and mangrove restoration can be a highly cost effective strategy for risk reduction however most of the investments in coastal protection are intended for traditional or gray structures such as breakwaters or seawalls rather than for nature based solutions nbs mccreless and beck 2016 an engineering approach is needed to move forward in the implementation of nbs in coastal protection practices to ensure that this engineering approach is set in place the first step is to better understand and parameterize the basic physical processes involved in flow ecosystem interaction to accurately estimate the ecosystem attenuation capacity considering different environmental conditions and ecosystem properties besides wave damping induced by the mangrove trees it is also important to consider other factors that may affect the resultant wave attenuation and may have confounding effects on experimental studies for fringe mangroves seaward bathymetry may be a key factor affecting the incoming waves fringe mangroves grow along the coast are directly exposed to the tides and sea waves and characterized by a seaward slope lugo and snedaker 1974 ewel et al 1998 this seaward slope can modify the incoming waves due to processes such as shoaling or breaking vo luong and massel 2006 measured wave attenuation in a mangrove forest with a 1 2 m high margin edge in south vietnam the scarp changed the incident wave conditions producing breaking when the water depth was high enough and reflection for lower water levels for cases where the edge is not so steep the slope can lead to shoaling effects and then to an increase of the incident wave height möller and spencer 2002 reported those effects across margins between mudflats and landward saltmarsh surfaces consequently bathymetric changes have to be taken into account when characterizing the incident flow conditions affecting the forest most of the studies in the literature have been performed considering flat bottom e g irtem et al 2009 huang et al 2011 ismail et al 2012 maza et al 2016 tognin et al 2019 and the effects on the forest wave attenuation capacity produced by a seaward slope has been neglected another important factor influencing the resultant wave attenuation is the wave damping induced by bottom friction that not only depends on the local bathymetry but also on soil properties several studies in the literature have reported friction factors for different types of soils and wave conditions e g jensen et al 1989 myrhaug 1995 zou 2004 however friction values obtained from experimental studies with properly scaled sediment and mangrove characteristics are not available instead the few experiments in the literature accounting for short waves forest attenuation capacity such as hashim et al 2013 report values without considering the effect of the facility bottom and walls friction this additional friction contributes to the total dissipation induced by the forest and as it will be shown it should be considered when parameterizing the effect of the mangrove trees to well characterize the energy dissipation produced by the mangrove trees it is crucial to well reproduce their complex geometry in the last decade some studies have been carried out using mimics accounting for that among them the following stand out when it comes to reproducing the three dimensional layout of the red mangroves root system strusinska correia et al 2013 parameterized mature rhizophora replacing the complex root system by a group of cylinders of different height considering a 1 20 scale solitary and tsunami bores were tested analyzing wave damping and forces exerted on the models that were located after a 1 20 slope that modified the incident flow conditions similar damping rates were found for solitary waves and tsunami bores reporting a wave height enhancement at the seaward edge of the forest the highest forces were always measured at the first rows of the 3 m long forest zhang et al 2015 tested model rhizophora mangroves reproducing their prop roots using aluminum rods the 1 7 5 scale forest was formed by aligned trees without any overlapping between the roots this layout created preferable channels between the models the 6 m long forest was tested under unidirectional flow conditions and velocity profiles were recorded revealing an enhancement of turbulent kinetic energy tke above the roots level this increase in tke was also reported by maza et al 2017 where 1 12 mature rhizophora models were created using acrylic rods for the trunks and brass rods for the roots following a parameterization given by ohira et al 2013 the forest 2 5 m long was created following density values in the literature and considering overlapping between the roots of the different elements unidirectional flow conditions were tested and recorded forces and velocity profiles along the forest revealed a strong leading edge effect where forces were the highest all these studies were performed at small scales and using forests a few meters in length where a huge portion of the forest was identified as the leading edge where wave heights or mean water level were increased in addition in most of the cases hydrodynamic conditions were defined without considering realistic conditions and testing unidirectional flow and solitary waves thus further study of realistic wave conditions at a much larger scale and using a long forest is needed to quantify the wave damping capacity of these ecosystems additionally forces exerted under those conditions need to be studied to better parameterize the drag force exerted on the trees most of meso and macro scale models in the literature used to study the attenuation capacity of mangrove forests are based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation to induce loss of momentum in the vegetated area then it is crucial to well characterize this drag force to feed prediction models for nbs to further investigate the processes inducing flow attenuation and the forces exerted by the flow on the individual mangroves we take advantage of a realistic physical modeling approach by designing a series of model tests using scale rhizophora trees and realistic wave conditions the experimental set up description including the definition of the mangrove models the hydrodynamic conditions and the measurements taken is presented in section 2 results of wave attenuation and forces and their relationship with flow and mangroves properties are given in section 3 section 4 discusses the differences between the measured forces and the ones that can be obtained analytically from wave damping finally the most important conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 experimental set up experiments are run in the cantabria wave current tsunami flume cocotsu at ihcantabria the flume is 56 m long 2 m wide and equipped with a piston wave paddle of 2 m stroke and active wave absorption a current recirculation system and a dissipation area featuring a gravel beach in these experiments the study area is located on a flat bottom starting at a distance of 23 m from the wave paddle and the fringe forest model starts at 24 m from the same position a 1 13 5 slope 4 70 m long is located 5 5 m before the beginning of the study area featuring the seaward slope in front of the forest panels d and e in fig 1 2 1 mangrove models mangrove mimics are built following ohira et al 2013 parameterization previously used by maza et al 2017 models are designed considering a mature rhizophora forest with a main trunk diameter equal to 0 20 m alongi 2008 following ohira et al 2013 this main trunk diameter at breast height dbh leads to a model formed by 24 roots connected to the main trunk at different heights with the highest root at 2 012 m the diameter of these roots ranges from 0 033 to 0 042 m to facilitate the construction of the models a mean diameter equal to 0 036 m is considered the three dimensional distribution of these roots is carried out using 8 different angles thus three roots every 45 fig 1 based on the flume dimensions the chosen scale is 1 6 this scale allows a forest width compound of 2 individuals minimum number to keep the three dimensionality of the experiments models are built using pvc for the main trunk and aluminum rods for the roots these materials are chosen to be rigid enough to avoid deformations under flow action and suitable in terms of materials costs and handling roots are built following templates for each one of the 24 parabolas that define their shape these roots are attached to the main trunk by using screws forest density at real scale is 625 trees ha distributed following a staggered arrangement as described in maza et al 2017 a total of 135 trees are built being 56 half models located adjacent to the flume walls to avoid preferable flow channels this leads to a model mangrove forest 26 m long 156 m long at prototype scale as displayed in fig 1 models are attached to the flume using water proof wood baseboards where holes slightly smaller than the diameter of the models main trunk are drilled the models are built giving an extra length to the main trunk to allow introducing them into the baseboard until the roots touch the bottom the mangrove model frontal area varies along the vertical plane as can be observed in panels b and c in fig 1 and in fig 2 to quantify this variability 8 pictures are taken rotating the model to capture the variability of the roots layout the left panel in fig 2 shows the superposition of these pictures while the right panel displays the frontal area every centimeter along the vertical black dots and its variability depending on the rotation angle horizontal bars the three water levels tested are represented in the figure by horizontal dashed lines h 0 17 m in red h 0 33 m in black and h 0 50 m in blue these water levels vary from mild conditions to more severe events considering water depths equal to half of the elevation of the highest root equal to the level of the highest root and above that level these three water depths help to study the influence of the variable frontal area along the vertical an equivalent mean diameter d is obtained by vertically integrating the frontal area distribution shown in fig 2 for each water depth the resultant d is equal to 0 186 0 150 and 0 110 m for h 0 17 0 33 and 0 50 m respectively these d values are displayed in fig 2 by dotted vertical lines the obtained d are used to compute the submerged solid volume fraction svf as 1 s v f solid volume water volume h π d 2 4 n a h h where n is the number of mangroves per unit area and ah is the horizontal unit area the resultant svf is equal to 0 0272 0 0177 and 0 0095 for h 0 17 0 33 and 0 50 m respectively 2 2 measurements free surface evolution is measured along the 26 m long forest a total of 31 capacitive free surface gauges are used locating 4 gauges offshore the forest and another 3 behind right before the gravel beach panel e in fig 1 shows these locations forces exerted on 9 mangroves located at the first half of the forest are also recorded these models are chosen to analyze the force evolution along the first meters of the forest fig 3 displays these 9 mangroves in black seven of these mangroves are located along the central line of the forest at distances x 0 462 1 386 2 310 3 234 5 082 6 930 8 810 m from the beginning of the forest two additional mangroves are monitored at the second and fourth rows x 0 924 1 848 m to better analyze the effects on the first rows of the forest fig 3 forces are measured using an innovative design based on a frictionless pivot arm fig 4 the arm is located horizontally holding the mangrove to eliminate its weight using a square a compression traction load cell is located at one side of the frictionless rotating point that is composed by two frictionless swivel joints at the other side the model is held allowing its free motion with respect to the rotation point under the flow action the 9 arms are calibrated once they are located inside the flume by applying known forces on the mangrove at different heights and recording the transmitted force in the load cell dynamic loads are also applied to verify the good performance of the load cell by using a second load cell located at half the height of the mangrove roots and comparing both signals fig 4 shows a sketch of this new arm right panels and a photo of the load cell location the frictionless rotating point and how the arm is placed in the flume are shown in the left panels dynamic forces recorded by the different force arms are filtered using a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency smaller than the self oscillation frequency of the model this cutoff frequency is set to 5 hz based on estimations made before starting the experiments where self oscillation frequency was analyzed an example of the force time series originally recorded by one of the load cells and the one obtained after applying this filter is shown in the top panel of fig 5 for a random wave train with root mean square wave height hrms equal to 0 05 m peak period tp equal to 1 44 s over h 0 17 m fig 5 also displays the times series recorded by the nine load cells and a 40 s window at the beginning of the wave train for forces exerted on mangroves 1 2 and 9 free surface time series recorded at gauges 4 5 and 16 located immediately upstream of mangroves 1 2 and 9 are also shown in the figure as can be observed in the two lower panels of fig 5 force peaks are associated with wave crests wave height dissipation produced between gauges 4 and 16 is also evident in forces exerted on mangroves 1 and 9 the time lag between free surface and force measures is due to the location of the free surface gauges 0 462 m upstream of the mangrove models fig 1 2 3 hydrodynamic conditions froude similarity is considered when defining the hydrodynamic conditions following wave conditions reported in mangrove environments by previous studies i e bao 2011 brinkman 2006 a range of wave heights and periods are chosen at prototype scale wave heights between 0 24 and 0 90 m are considered and wave periods ranging from 3 0 to 6 5 s water levels representative of mild conditions and more severe events are equal to 1 006 2 012 and 3 018 m at the flat study area table 1 regular and random waves are considered regular waves are generated using stokes ii stokes iii and cnoidal theory depending on their characteristics defined using froude similarity random waves are generated considering a jonswap spectrum with enhancement factor equal to 3 3 and taking as significant wave height the same value as the one for regular waves and the peak period equal to 1 2 times the wave period for regular waves 300 waves are tested for each random wave train a summary of scaled conditions in front of the forest i e measured at free surface gauge 4 shown in fig 1 and prototype conditions are displayed in table 1 to have a benchmark case for each test all hydrodynamic conditions are tested before mangroves are introduced into the channel i e having only the baseboards inside the channel this benchmark cases allow analyzing the friction produced by the flume bottom and walls and the effect of the bottom slope seaward the forest wave breaking along the beach slope was avoided to get maximum incident conditions into the forest a total of 44 random wave trains and 40 regular ones are tested the reynolds number is also considered to ensure similarity in the boundary layer and the wake structures produced in the laboratory and under real conditions the reynolds number is computed considering the trunk retrunk and root diameter reroots and the maximum and minimum velocities for the tested wave conditions under real conditions retrunk and reroots are high enough to lead to a completely turbulent wake and in all cases the boundary layer remains laminar for scaled conditions using froude similarity both re are leading to a laminar boundary layer and they are large enough to ensure a turbulent wake since the minimum retrunk and reroots obtained at laboratory scale are 8000 and 600 respectively 3 experimental results and discussion wave damping and forces evolution along the forest are analyzed in this section the goal is to understand their evolution along the forest and how these processes are related to the flow conditions and the model characteristics 3 1 wave damping coefficient a parameter of interest when analyzing an ecosystem protection capacity is the induced wave attenuation attenuation is studied here following previous works in the literature assessing this capacity by fitting a damping coefficient e g orezen et al 2013 anderson and smith 2014 maza et al 2015 dalrymple et al 1984 formulation eq 2 is used for regular waves and mendez and losada 2004 eq 3 for random waves 2 h h i 1 1 β x 3 h r m s h r m s i 1 1 β x where h is the wave height for regular waves hrms is the root mean square wave height for random waves β is the damping coefficient x is the position along the forest and the sub index i denotes incident values β is fitted for each test using as incident wave height the one recorded by free surface gauge 4 benchmark cases i e cases without the mangrove models are also considered in this analysis to quantify the influence of the bottom and walls friction and the effect of the seaward slope consequently β is obtained for both tests with and without mangroves in the flume this allows obtaining the difference between both cases to derive a new β coefficient isolating the effect of the mangroves by disregarding any other source of damping in the flow as follows 4 1 1 β m x 1 1 β m b x 1 1 β b x where β m b is the damping coefficient recorded during the experiments with the flume full of mangroves β b is the damping coefficient for the benchmark cases performed with the empty flume and β m is the resultant damping coefficient for mangrove trees only fig 6 shows three examples for regular left panels and three for random waves right panels wave heights along the forest center line are displayed for tests with gray dots and without gray squares mangroves the corresponding fittings following eqs 2 and 3 are shown in gray solid lines for tests including mangroves and gray dashed lines for empty flume cases the black solid line in each panel of fig 6 represents the difference between the two fittings the associated β m coefficient is shown in the upper right corner the highest damping induced by bottom and walls friction is observed for the smallest water depth h 0 17 m whereas the associated damping coefficient β b for similar wave conditions decreases as water depth increases the overall damping coefficient obtained for the tests carried out with the flume full of mangroves β m b follows the same trend the damping coefficient due to the action of the mangrove trees only β m decreases with water depth this decrease in wave damping is not only due to the change in water level and the associated change in the waves velocity profile it is also due to the variable frontal area of the models tested here fig 2 for the highest water depth the maximum wave velocities next to the free surface are affected by the smallest frontal area i e the model trunk and the smallest wave damping coefficient is found the influence of the water depth and frontal area is further analyzed in the next section fig 6 also reveals an increase in wave height at the beginning of the forest this effect is also observed for cases without mangroves as a result of wave shoaling produced by the seaward bottom slope shoaling effects are the highest for the smallest water depth as observed in fig 6 the ursell number which indicates the non linearity of the waves reaches values up to 100 for the smallest water depth and the longest wave period then waves are highly non linear in those cases this aspect is important since fringe mangrove forests can be preceded by a slope leading to this increase in wave steepness and consequently wave height is enhanced along the first meters of the forest this leads to an increase in the exerted forces as it will be discussed in section 3 3 after the first 3 4 m of the forest the fitting curves adjust well to the measured data as can be observed in the high correlation coefficients wave attenuation can be expressed as wave height reduction per meter or per 100 m as reported in some studies in the literature e g mazda et al 1997a 2006 quartel et al 2007 brinkman et al 1997 reported results for a forest where rhizophora stylosa is the dominant species at cocoa creek in australia normalized energy enorm at different locations inside the forest is quantified this enorm is the ratio between the wave energy at a distance x from the mangrove front σ2 x and the incident wave energy σ i 2 massel et al 1999 reveals enorm values ranging from 0 66 till more than 1 at 80 m inside the forest rates higher than 1 are explained by the wave transformation produced by the gradually sloping mudflat present in the area enorm values at 160 m within the forest varies between 0 22 and 0 63 these results can be compared to the dissipation rates obtained here enorm can be computed as hrms h rms i 2 then hrms h rms i is obtained for all random wave cases tested in these experiments by using β m the resultant enorm ranges from 0 70 to 0 94 at 80 m inside the forest 13 3 m at laboratory scale and from 0 50 to 0 90 at 156 m 26 m at laboratory scale normalized energy reported by massel et al 1999 is smaller than the one obtained here that is higher dissipation is recorded this difference can be attributed to the bottom friction produced by the natural soil included in their field observations but not considered in this analysis since bottom and walls flume friction are eliminated in wave damping analysis 3 2 key variables in wave energy damping it is well known that wave damping strongly depends on the mangrove field characteristics and water depth previous studies have reported that wave damping also depends on wave height e g anderson and smith 2014 maza et al 2016 however dependence of damping on wave period is not well established with studies reporting higher attenuation for shorter waves and others showing a higher attenuation for longer waves in addition most studies reporting wave period influence on wave damping were carried out with flexible vegetation e g dubi and torum 1996 infantes et al 2012 it should be noted that vegetation response to wave excursion is very important to determine the influence of wave period to further explore the influence of water depth wave height and period on wave damping damping coefficients are obtained considering the effect of the mangrove models i e β m damping coefficients for regular and random waves are related to relative wave height h h and wave steepness h l where l is the wave length for random waves root mean square wave height hrms and the wave length associated to the peak period lp are used fig 7 shows in the three upper panels β m as a function of the relative wave height for different water depths for both regular and random waves the two lower panels show a common fitting for the three water depths by introducing mangrove field properties by multiplying the relative wave height by svf a linear relationship between β m and the relative wave height is found for regular and random waves different fittings are obtained for each water depth highlighting the influence of the frontal area of the models which varies in the vertical thus for the same relative wave height the highest β m is obtained for the smallest water depth when the frontal area of the mangroves is the largest to introduce the effect of the frontal area in the analysis the relative wave height is multiplied by the svf the new data setup allows a common fitting for the three water depths obtaining a high correlation coefficient as shown in the two lower panels in fig 7 to explore the influence of the wave period the wave length is introduced in the analysis the influence of wave steepness is studied for the three water depths and svf is used to introduce the effect of the variable submerged vegetation volume fig 8 shows β m as a function of wave steepness as it can be observed linear fittings result in poor correlation coefficients especially for h 0 17 and 0 33 m a second order polynomial is used in order to obtain a better fitting although this second fitting leads to higher correlation coefficients they are still small for h 0 17 m and h 0 33 m for regular waves cases where data show a high dispersion and wave damping is not determined by wave steepness for the other cases including the common fitting a general trend can be shown revealing higher damping coefficients for higher wave heights as observed in fig 7 and shorter wave lengths i e shorter wave periods correlation coefficients obtained when relating β m to wave steepness are smaller than those found when β m is related to the relative wave height this reveals that for short waves such as those tested in these experiments wave height is dominant over wave period for wave damping 3 3 wave induced forces wave forces are measured in nine mangroves distributed along the first 9 m of the forest dynamic forces are recorded by the load cells located in the forces arms fig 4 and then filtered following the procedure described in fig 5 for regular waves filtered load cell records are processed to get the maximum force exerted on each mangrove as the mean of the maximum load recorded for 50 waves for random waves an extensive analysis is performed to get different statistical values by assessing forces recorded for each of the wave crests of the random wave train the maximum and root mean square forces are obtained fig 9 shows the maximum force f d m a x evolution along the 9 model mangroves for a regular wave train h 0 05 m and t 1 2 s and the three water depths fig 10 displays the maximum and root mean square f d r m s forces evolution along the 9 models for a random wave train hrms 0 05 m and tp 1 44 s and the three water depths figs 9 and 10 show an increase of the exerted forces along the first meters of the forest this force increase is consistent with the growth in wave steepness at the beginning of the forest as can be observed both in fig 6 and in the bottom panel of fig 5 where higher wave heights are shown in gauge 5 than in gauge 4 further into the forest force values do not vary as much as seen from the comparison between values in mangroves rows 7 and 9 the increase in wave steepness and consequent rise in the forces exerted on the mangroves can be explained due to the shoaling produced by the seaward slope as discussed in section 3 1 the resultant non linear waves concentrate their mass in the wave crest where maximum velocities are produced and the maximum drag forces are recorded in the direction of wave propagation the analysis of figs 9 and 10 also shows that for a given wave train propagating at different water depths the maximum force values are reached for the smallest water depth for h 0 17 m the frontal area of the model is the largest and waves are highly non linear leading to a depth averaged velocity greater than that of higher water depths drag forces are commonly expressed as a function of the square of the incident velocity e g dalrymple et al 1984 mazda et al 1997b chapman et al 2015 plotting the forces measured as a function of the square of the incident velocity leads to a linear relationship as can be observed in fig 11 where drag forces measured in mangrove tree 1 are displayed as a function of u 2 to check the relationship between measured forces and square velocity for a case where waves are highly non linear the incident velocity is calculated here as the depth averaged velocity under the wave crest using linear theory for random wave trains u is obtained considering hmax and hrms when analyzing f d m a x and f d r m s respectively the right panel in fig 11 shows the results for regular waves and the three water depths displayed in red h 0 17 m black h 0 33 m and blue h 0 50 solid circles and stars in the left panel correspond to f d m a x and f d r m s calculated as a function of u 2 obtained by using hmax and hrms respectively the window at the bottom right corner shows a greater detail of f d r m s for low velocities linear fittings and correlation coefficients are also displayed in fig 11 for all cases fittings shown in fig 11 reveal a linear relationship between measured forces and square incident velocities with high correlation coefficients ρ2 0 97 for all cases fig 11 also shows higher forces for higher velocities and water depths forces obtained under regular waves for h 0 33 and h 0 50 m fit to almost the same equation i e similar forces are obtained for both water depths if the depth averaged velocity is the same this effect is also observed for random waves when analyzing f d r m s this result highlights that a smaller frontal area and its distribution have a different effect for h 0 50 m than for h 0 33 m the frontal area per unit height next to the free surface for h 0 50 m equals the value of the mangrove trunk thus the smallest area is encountered where maximum velocities are interacting with the mangrove this can explain that similar forces are observed for h 0 50 and 0 33 m another aspect that should be considered is that u 2 is evaluated by using linear theory which cannot well represent the actual incident velocities especially for highly nonlinear waves linear theory provides velocity values till the free surface level but velocities at the wave crest are not evaluated wave crest velocities have an effect on the exerted forces especially for the maximum wave in random wave trains this may explain the larger difference found in the forces obtained for h 0 50 and 0 33 m when analyzing f d m a x for random waves however despite this approximation the obtained linear fittings support the quadratic relationship between fd and u consequently this relationship is used in the next section 4 comparison of forces obtained analytically from wave damping and measured values in this section analytical drag forces applied in the physical formulation of wave damping by vegetation are compared to the experimental measurements in order to explore the accuracy of analytical expressions in predicting the actual force experienced by mangroves once the quadratic relationship between fd and u in the measured forces is proven the most commonly used formula to predict wave damping due to vegetation in meso scale and macro scale numerical models is used this force can be evaluated analytically by using the following equation 5 f d 1 2 ρ a f c d u u where ρ is the fluid density af is the frontal area of the element cd is the drag coefficient and u is the depth averaged flow velocity when dealing with a mangrove field this force is multiplied by the number of mangroves per square meter n to account for the contribution of all individuals cd can be obtained analytically as a function of β using dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 formulations for regular and random waves respectively 6 c d 9 π 4 d n h i k sin h 2 k h 2 k h sin h k h sin h 3 k l 3 sin h k l β 7 c d 3 π d n h r m s i k sin h 2 k h 2 k h sin h k h sin h 3 k l 3 sin h k l β where d is the mangrove area per unit height k is the wave number and l is the submerged length of the mangroves these formulations are derived under several assumptions including irrotational flow and linear wave theory that usually are not satisfied analytical drag forces are obtained using eqs 5 7 to get cd for regular and random waves in this analysis d d is used as the mean model area per unit height n is equal to 2 mangroves m2 incident wave conditions are considered to evaluate k and l h since vegetation is always emerged β used in eqs 6 and 7 are β m obtained from wave decay analysis after subtracting the bottom and walls friction effect in fig 12 the drag coefficient cd is presented for regular and random waves as a function of the reynolds number re re is obtained using the depth averaged velocity u and d cd for a smooth cylinder is also displayed by a dashed line in the re range of these experiments results reveal that drag coefficient obtained using the analytical expression do not show significant differences between water depths if d is used in its calculation a higher dispersion of values is found for regular than for random waves cd ranges from 0 3 to 2 4 for regular waves and from 0 5 to 1 5 for random waves the higher dispersion found for regular cases can be ascribed to the presence of standing waves along the forest generated by their own reflection as observed in previous works such as asano et al 1988 or maza et al 2013 reflection contributes to the modulation of the wave height along the wave propagation direction affecting the β value and consequently cd once cd is obtained for all cases eq 5 is used to compute the analytical drag forces af is calculated by multiplying d times the water depth plus half of the incident wave height hi 2 and h rms i 2 for regular and random waves respectively since forces associated to the wave crest are later compared u is evaluated in random waves trains as the depth averaged value under the wave crest associated to h rms i then both frontal area and flow velocities are depth averaged values these analytical drag forces are compared to the values recorded in the laboratory for random waves f d r m s is considered since mendez and losada 2004 formulation is expressed in terms of hrms due to the shoaling effect increasing the wave height and nonlinearity of the waves and consequently the exerted forces in the first meters of the forest forces recorded in mangrove tree 9 are considered for comparison this choice is supported by the performance of eqs 2 and 3 to fit wave decay as can be observed in fig 6 the increase of wave steepness leads to a bad agreement between the fitting and the wave height values in those first meters of the forest however beyond that point wave decay is well reproduced by eqs 2 and 3 therefore it is to be expected that analytical drag forces obtained from β coefficients fit better to the ones recorded inside the forest the wave damping analysis carried out in the previous section led to two different damping coefficients β m b and β m consequently analytical drag forces can be obtained using both sets of β coefficients fig 13 shows fd obtained using β m b squares and β m solid circles respectively as a function of re as expected forces calculated with β m b are larger than those obtained by using β m with mean values around twice the values obtained considering the isolated effect of mangroves therefore including the contribution of the flume boundaries to the damping has a relevant effect on the resultant fd this conclusion has important consequences for numerical modeling numerical models formulating wave attenuation by vegetation in terms of fd can significantly overestimate the dissipation produced by vegetation if they are feed with experimental results where bottom and walls friction are not excluded analytical drag forces are then compared to measured values fig 14 shows this comparison for analytical drag forces obtained using β m since forces obtained by using β b m result in a worse agreement with measured values analytical drag forces are displayed in solid circles and measured values using stars quadratic fittings are also shown using dashed and solid lines for analytical and measured forces respectively analytical drag forces both overestimate and underestimate measured forces depending on the case the highest differences are obtained for regular waves where overestimations can lead to forces that double the measured values these discrepancies are not surprising since analytical drag forces are obtained under several assumptions that are not satisfied in the experiments neither in real mangrove fields however the discrepancies between the fittings obtained for analytical and measured forces are leading to maximum relative errors of 38 and 12 for regular and random waves respectively these errors shed light on the uncertainty that should be considered when using models based on depth integrated potential flow to quantify momentum decay due to vegetation using a fd obtained analytically from wave damping analysis the errors increase with re as can be observed in fig 14 that is with wave velocity 5 conclusions an experimental study performed using a 1 6 scale fringe mangrove forest of 26 m composed by 135 models built reproducing mature rhizophora mangroves with 24 aerial roots has been presented here regular and random waves scaled using froude similarity are used for the simulation of the hydrodynamics different water depths are tested to account for the influence of the variable frontal area of the mangroves along the vertical free surface measurements are taken along the forest allowing the analysis of wave decay produced under different flow conditions forces measured along the first 9 m of the forest enable on the one hand to analyze their evolution at the beginning of the forest and on the other hand to compare them with forces obtained analytically from wave damping wave attenuation analysis highlights the importance of considering wave damping produced by bottom walls and any other element inducing friction in the flume damping coefficients obtained directly from experimental measurements can show high differences with coefficients calculated by subtracting the damping induced by the flume boundaries neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove forest capacity to dissipate flow energy therefore it is strongly recommended that when laboratory experiments are performed to analyze wave damping due to a coastal ecosystem hydrodynamic conditions should be tested with and without the vegetation system in the flume it has been observed that for a fringe mangrove the seaward slope influences the incident wave conditions leading to an enhancement of wave height due to shoaling when waves do not break along the slope this increase in wave steepness induces the highest drag forces in the direction of waves propagation along the first meters of the forest in accordance with the increase in wave height and nonlinearity it has been also proven that for a given mangrove field water depth and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves in addition the consideration of the svf for each water depth allows relating the attenuation coefficients found for the different water depths accounting for the different frontal area associated to each one of them measured forces relate well to the square depth averaged velocity confirming the quadratic relationship between fd and u for a given wave train tested over three different water depths the maximum dynamic force is obtained for the smallest water depth corresponding to the largest frontal area of the mangroves and highly nonlinear waves however for the same depth averaged velocity the highest forces are recorded as expected for the largest water depth dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 equations that relate wave damping to the drag coefficient are used to obtain cd depth averaged frontal area and velocities using linear theory are then used to get an analytical value of fd the comparison of analytical and experimental forces shows a better agreement between analytical drag forces obtained considering β m than β m b confirming that wave energy attenuation induced by the mangrove trees is better reproduced once the damping associated to any other sources of dissipation is eliminated the discrepancies found between measured and analytical drag forces reveal the deviations produced when using wave damping to define fd that can lead to overestimations of up to double it is worth mentioning that these results have important implications on numerical modeling of wave attenuation by coastal ecosystems analytical or numerical models based on equations formulated in terms of wave damping coefficients should be used with experimental coefficients obtained subtracting the dissipation attributed to the boundaries of the experimental facilities bottom and walls then the effect of bottom friction due to natural soil in the vegetated area should be always considered as an additional source of damping and modeled accordingly this separation of wave decay produced by the ecosystem elements and the bottom cannot be performed when measuring in the field in those cases the measured wave decay rates account for the combined effect of both sources of dissipation and they should be used in prediction models accordingly finally analytical or numerical models based on the introduction of fd in the momentum equation should be calibrated with measurements of the actual force exerted on the vegetation since estimating this force analytically from wave damping coefficients can lead to large over or underestimations acknowledgments this work has been funded under the retos investigacion 2014 grant bia2014

591,with the aim of better understand and parameterize the physical processes involved in flow mangrove interaction wave attenuation and drag forces along a 1 6 scale fringe rhizophora mangrove forest are studied experimentally the 26 m long forest is composed by 135 models built reproducing mature rhizophora mangrove trees with 24 prop roots hydrodynamic conditions are scaled using froude similarity based on values collected in nature regular and random waves are tested and three water depths are considered to account for the influence of variable mangroves frontal area along the vertical wave decay analysis highlights the importance of considering the effect of flume bottom and walls friction neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove dissipation capacity it is proven that water depth and the associated mangroves frontal area and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves the slope seaward the forest induces wave shoaling leading to an increase of wave steepness accordingly the exerted forces on the mangroves also increase along the first 3 4 m of the forest smaller forces are recorded further into the forest where wave decay formulations fit well to the recorded wave heights in general analytical drag forces obtained by using mangrove trees induced damping coefficients compare well to the forces measured within the forest however analytical drag forces can lead to overestimations of up to double in some cases this aspect is very important when experimental results are used to feed numerical or analytical models based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation these models should be calibrated using whenever possible direct force measurements keywords rhizophora mangrove forest large scale 3 d model wave attenuation damping coefficient drag force experimental analysis 1 introduction mangrove forests grow in intertidal and coastal areas in the tropical and subtropical zones and they are characterized by their complex root system specially red mangroves as rhizophora species the capacity of these ecosystems to reduce the incoming flow energy has already been proven e g mazda et al 1997a vo luong and massel 2008 narayan et al 2016 additionally these ecosystems can be resilient to climate change and provide with additional ecosystem services such us to build and bind soils increasing biodiversity improving water quality housing nursery areas and fish production providing with raw materials and recreation services to local populations and acting as co2 sinks are also among the services they provide barbier et al 2011 mitsh and gosselink 2015 their capacity to protect coastal areas is of great interest since the most vulnerable countries to natural hazards in the world are all tropical coastal developing nations bündnis entwicklung hilft 2017 where mangrove forests can play a crucial role in reducing risk to population it has been proven that mangroves reduce annual flooding to millions of people menéndez et al 2018 and mangrove restoration can be a highly cost effective strategy for risk reduction however most of the investments in coastal protection are intended for traditional or gray structures such as breakwaters or seawalls rather than for nature based solutions nbs mccreless and beck 2016 an engineering approach is needed to move forward in the implementation of nbs in coastal protection practices to ensure that this engineering approach is set in place the first step is to better understand and parameterize the basic physical processes involved in flow ecosystem interaction to accurately estimate the ecosystem attenuation capacity considering different environmental conditions and ecosystem properties besides wave damping induced by the mangrove trees it is also important to consider other factors that may affect the resultant wave attenuation and may have confounding effects on experimental studies for fringe mangroves seaward bathymetry may be a key factor affecting the incoming waves fringe mangroves grow along the coast are directly exposed to the tides and sea waves and characterized by a seaward slope lugo and snedaker 1974 ewel et al 1998 this seaward slope can modify the incoming waves due to processes such as shoaling or breaking vo luong and massel 2006 measured wave attenuation in a mangrove forest with a 1 2 m high margin edge in south vietnam the scarp changed the incident wave conditions producing breaking when the water depth was high enough and reflection for lower water levels for cases where the edge is not so steep the slope can lead to shoaling effects and then to an increase of the incident wave height möller and spencer 2002 reported those effects across margins between mudflats and landward saltmarsh surfaces consequently bathymetric changes have to be taken into account when characterizing the incident flow conditions affecting the forest most of the studies in the literature have been performed considering flat bottom e g irtem et al 2009 huang et al 2011 ismail et al 2012 maza et al 2016 tognin et al 2019 and the effects on the forest wave attenuation capacity produced by a seaward slope has been neglected another important factor influencing the resultant wave attenuation is the wave damping induced by bottom friction that not only depends on the local bathymetry but also on soil properties several studies in the literature have reported friction factors for different types of soils and wave conditions e g jensen et al 1989 myrhaug 1995 zou 2004 however friction values obtained from experimental studies with properly scaled sediment and mangrove characteristics are not available instead the few experiments in the literature accounting for short waves forest attenuation capacity such as hashim et al 2013 report values without considering the effect of the facility bottom and walls friction this additional friction contributes to the total dissipation induced by the forest and as it will be shown it should be considered when parameterizing the effect of the mangrove trees to well characterize the energy dissipation produced by the mangrove trees it is crucial to well reproduce their complex geometry in the last decade some studies have been carried out using mimics accounting for that among them the following stand out when it comes to reproducing the three dimensional layout of the red mangroves root system strusinska correia et al 2013 parameterized mature rhizophora replacing the complex root system by a group of cylinders of different height considering a 1 20 scale solitary and tsunami bores were tested analyzing wave damping and forces exerted on the models that were located after a 1 20 slope that modified the incident flow conditions similar damping rates were found for solitary waves and tsunami bores reporting a wave height enhancement at the seaward edge of the forest the highest forces were always measured at the first rows of the 3 m long forest zhang et al 2015 tested model rhizophora mangroves reproducing their prop roots using aluminum rods the 1 7 5 scale forest was formed by aligned trees without any overlapping between the roots this layout created preferable channels between the models the 6 m long forest was tested under unidirectional flow conditions and velocity profiles were recorded revealing an enhancement of turbulent kinetic energy tke above the roots level this increase in tke was also reported by maza et al 2017 where 1 12 mature rhizophora models were created using acrylic rods for the trunks and brass rods for the roots following a parameterization given by ohira et al 2013 the forest 2 5 m long was created following density values in the literature and considering overlapping between the roots of the different elements unidirectional flow conditions were tested and recorded forces and velocity profiles along the forest revealed a strong leading edge effect where forces were the highest all these studies were performed at small scales and using forests a few meters in length where a huge portion of the forest was identified as the leading edge where wave heights or mean water level were increased in addition in most of the cases hydrodynamic conditions were defined without considering realistic conditions and testing unidirectional flow and solitary waves thus further study of realistic wave conditions at a much larger scale and using a long forest is needed to quantify the wave damping capacity of these ecosystems additionally forces exerted under those conditions need to be studied to better parameterize the drag force exerted on the trees most of meso and macro scale models in the literature used to study the attenuation capacity of mangrove forests are based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation to induce loss of momentum in the vegetated area then it is crucial to well characterize this drag force to feed prediction models for nbs to further investigate the processes inducing flow attenuation and the forces exerted by the flow on the individual mangroves we take advantage of a realistic physical modeling approach by designing a series of model tests using scale rhizophora trees and realistic wave conditions the experimental set up description including the definition of the mangrove models the hydrodynamic conditions and the measurements taken is presented in section 2 results of wave attenuation and forces and their relationship with flow and mangroves properties are given in section 3 section 4 discusses the differences between the measured forces and the ones that can be obtained analytically from wave damping finally the most important conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 experimental set up experiments are run in the cantabria wave current tsunami flume cocotsu at ihcantabria the flume is 56 m long 2 m wide and equipped with a piston wave paddle of 2 m stroke and active wave absorption a current recirculation system and a dissipation area featuring a gravel beach in these experiments the study area is located on a flat bottom starting at a distance of 23 m from the wave paddle and the fringe forest model starts at 24 m from the same position a 1 13 5 slope 4 70 m long is located 5 5 m before the beginning of the study area featuring the seaward slope in front of the forest panels d and e in fig 1 2 1 mangrove models mangrove mimics are built following ohira et al 2013 parameterization previously used by maza et al 2017 models are designed considering a mature rhizophora forest with a main trunk diameter equal to 0 20 m alongi 2008 following ohira et al 2013 this main trunk diameter at breast height dbh leads to a model formed by 24 roots connected to the main trunk at different heights with the highest root at 2 012 m the diameter of these roots ranges from 0 033 to 0 042 m to facilitate the construction of the models a mean diameter equal to 0 036 m is considered the three dimensional distribution of these roots is carried out using 8 different angles thus three roots every 45 fig 1 based on the flume dimensions the chosen scale is 1 6 this scale allows a forest width compound of 2 individuals minimum number to keep the three dimensionality of the experiments models are built using pvc for the main trunk and aluminum rods for the roots these materials are chosen to be rigid enough to avoid deformations under flow action and suitable in terms of materials costs and handling roots are built following templates for each one of the 24 parabolas that define their shape these roots are attached to the main trunk by using screws forest density at real scale is 625 trees ha distributed following a staggered arrangement as described in maza et al 2017 a total of 135 trees are built being 56 half models located adjacent to the flume walls to avoid preferable flow channels this leads to a model mangrove forest 26 m long 156 m long at prototype scale as displayed in fig 1 models are attached to the flume using water proof wood baseboards where holes slightly smaller than the diameter of the models main trunk are drilled the models are built giving an extra length to the main trunk to allow introducing them into the baseboard until the roots touch the bottom the mangrove model frontal area varies along the vertical plane as can be observed in panels b and c in fig 1 and in fig 2 to quantify this variability 8 pictures are taken rotating the model to capture the variability of the roots layout the left panel in fig 2 shows the superposition of these pictures while the right panel displays the frontal area every centimeter along the vertical black dots and its variability depending on the rotation angle horizontal bars the three water levels tested are represented in the figure by horizontal dashed lines h 0 17 m in red h 0 33 m in black and h 0 50 m in blue these water levels vary from mild conditions to more severe events considering water depths equal to half of the elevation of the highest root equal to the level of the highest root and above that level these three water depths help to study the influence of the variable frontal area along the vertical an equivalent mean diameter d is obtained by vertically integrating the frontal area distribution shown in fig 2 for each water depth the resultant d is equal to 0 186 0 150 and 0 110 m for h 0 17 0 33 and 0 50 m respectively these d values are displayed in fig 2 by dotted vertical lines the obtained d are used to compute the submerged solid volume fraction svf as 1 s v f solid volume water volume h π d 2 4 n a h h where n is the number of mangroves per unit area and ah is the horizontal unit area the resultant svf is equal to 0 0272 0 0177 and 0 0095 for h 0 17 0 33 and 0 50 m respectively 2 2 measurements free surface evolution is measured along the 26 m long forest a total of 31 capacitive free surface gauges are used locating 4 gauges offshore the forest and another 3 behind right before the gravel beach panel e in fig 1 shows these locations forces exerted on 9 mangroves located at the first half of the forest are also recorded these models are chosen to analyze the force evolution along the first meters of the forest fig 3 displays these 9 mangroves in black seven of these mangroves are located along the central line of the forest at distances x 0 462 1 386 2 310 3 234 5 082 6 930 8 810 m from the beginning of the forest two additional mangroves are monitored at the second and fourth rows x 0 924 1 848 m to better analyze the effects on the first rows of the forest fig 3 forces are measured using an innovative design based on a frictionless pivot arm fig 4 the arm is located horizontally holding the mangrove to eliminate its weight using a square a compression traction load cell is located at one side of the frictionless rotating point that is composed by two frictionless swivel joints at the other side the model is held allowing its free motion with respect to the rotation point under the flow action the 9 arms are calibrated once they are located inside the flume by applying known forces on the mangrove at different heights and recording the transmitted force in the load cell dynamic loads are also applied to verify the good performance of the load cell by using a second load cell located at half the height of the mangrove roots and comparing both signals fig 4 shows a sketch of this new arm right panels and a photo of the load cell location the frictionless rotating point and how the arm is placed in the flume are shown in the left panels dynamic forces recorded by the different force arms are filtered using a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency smaller than the self oscillation frequency of the model this cutoff frequency is set to 5 hz based on estimations made before starting the experiments where self oscillation frequency was analyzed an example of the force time series originally recorded by one of the load cells and the one obtained after applying this filter is shown in the top panel of fig 5 for a random wave train with root mean square wave height hrms equal to 0 05 m peak period tp equal to 1 44 s over h 0 17 m fig 5 also displays the times series recorded by the nine load cells and a 40 s window at the beginning of the wave train for forces exerted on mangroves 1 2 and 9 free surface time series recorded at gauges 4 5 and 16 located immediately upstream of mangroves 1 2 and 9 are also shown in the figure as can be observed in the two lower panels of fig 5 force peaks are associated with wave crests wave height dissipation produced between gauges 4 and 16 is also evident in forces exerted on mangroves 1 and 9 the time lag between free surface and force measures is due to the location of the free surface gauges 0 462 m upstream of the mangrove models fig 1 2 3 hydrodynamic conditions froude similarity is considered when defining the hydrodynamic conditions following wave conditions reported in mangrove environments by previous studies i e bao 2011 brinkman 2006 a range of wave heights and periods are chosen at prototype scale wave heights between 0 24 and 0 90 m are considered and wave periods ranging from 3 0 to 6 5 s water levels representative of mild conditions and more severe events are equal to 1 006 2 012 and 3 018 m at the flat study area table 1 regular and random waves are considered regular waves are generated using stokes ii stokes iii and cnoidal theory depending on their characteristics defined using froude similarity random waves are generated considering a jonswap spectrum with enhancement factor equal to 3 3 and taking as significant wave height the same value as the one for regular waves and the peak period equal to 1 2 times the wave period for regular waves 300 waves are tested for each random wave train a summary of scaled conditions in front of the forest i e measured at free surface gauge 4 shown in fig 1 and prototype conditions are displayed in table 1 to have a benchmark case for each test all hydrodynamic conditions are tested before mangroves are introduced into the channel i e having only the baseboards inside the channel this benchmark cases allow analyzing the friction produced by the flume bottom and walls and the effect of the bottom slope seaward the forest wave breaking along the beach slope was avoided to get maximum incident conditions into the forest a total of 44 random wave trains and 40 regular ones are tested the reynolds number is also considered to ensure similarity in the boundary layer and the wake structures produced in the laboratory and under real conditions the reynolds number is computed considering the trunk retrunk and root diameter reroots and the maximum and minimum velocities for the tested wave conditions under real conditions retrunk and reroots are high enough to lead to a completely turbulent wake and in all cases the boundary layer remains laminar for scaled conditions using froude similarity both re are leading to a laminar boundary layer and they are large enough to ensure a turbulent wake since the minimum retrunk and reroots obtained at laboratory scale are 8000 and 600 respectively 3 experimental results and discussion wave damping and forces evolution along the forest are analyzed in this section the goal is to understand their evolution along the forest and how these processes are related to the flow conditions and the model characteristics 3 1 wave damping coefficient a parameter of interest when analyzing an ecosystem protection capacity is the induced wave attenuation attenuation is studied here following previous works in the literature assessing this capacity by fitting a damping coefficient e g orezen et al 2013 anderson and smith 2014 maza et al 2015 dalrymple et al 1984 formulation eq 2 is used for regular waves and mendez and losada 2004 eq 3 for random waves 2 h h i 1 1 β x 3 h r m s h r m s i 1 1 β x where h is the wave height for regular waves hrms is the root mean square wave height for random waves β is the damping coefficient x is the position along the forest and the sub index i denotes incident values β is fitted for each test using as incident wave height the one recorded by free surface gauge 4 benchmark cases i e cases without the mangrove models are also considered in this analysis to quantify the influence of the bottom and walls friction and the effect of the seaward slope consequently β is obtained for both tests with and without mangroves in the flume this allows obtaining the difference between both cases to derive a new β coefficient isolating the effect of the mangroves by disregarding any other source of damping in the flow as follows 4 1 1 β m x 1 1 β m b x 1 1 β b x where β m b is the damping coefficient recorded during the experiments with the flume full of mangroves β b is the damping coefficient for the benchmark cases performed with the empty flume and β m is the resultant damping coefficient for mangrove trees only fig 6 shows three examples for regular left panels and three for random waves right panels wave heights along the forest center line are displayed for tests with gray dots and without gray squares mangroves the corresponding fittings following eqs 2 and 3 are shown in gray solid lines for tests including mangroves and gray dashed lines for empty flume cases the black solid line in each panel of fig 6 represents the difference between the two fittings the associated β m coefficient is shown in the upper right corner the highest damping induced by bottom and walls friction is observed for the smallest water depth h 0 17 m whereas the associated damping coefficient β b for similar wave conditions decreases as water depth increases the overall damping coefficient obtained for the tests carried out with the flume full of mangroves β m b follows the same trend the damping coefficient due to the action of the mangrove trees only β m decreases with water depth this decrease in wave damping is not only due to the change in water level and the associated change in the waves velocity profile it is also due to the variable frontal area of the models tested here fig 2 for the highest water depth the maximum wave velocities next to the free surface are affected by the smallest frontal area i e the model trunk and the smallest wave damping coefficient is found the influence of the water depth and frontal area is further analyzed in the next section fig 6 also reveals an increase in wave height at the beginning of the forest this effect is also observed for cases without mangroves as a result of wave shoaling produced by the seaward bottom slope shoaling effects are the highest for the smallest water depth as observed in fig 6 the ursell number which indicates the non linearity of the waves reaches values up to 100 for the smallest water depth and the longest wave period then waves are highly non linear in those cases this aspect is important since fringe mangrove forests can be preceded by a slope leading to this increase in wave steepness and consequently wave height is enhanced along the first meters of the forest this leads to an increase in the exerted forces as it will be discussed in section 3 3 after the first 3 4 m of the forest the fitting curves adjust well to the measured data as can be observed in the high correlation coefficients wave attenuation can be expressed as wave height reduction per meter or per 100 m as reported in some studies in the literature e g mazda et al 1997a 2006 quartel et al 2007 brinkman et al 1997 reported results for a forest where rhizophora stylosa is the dominant species at cocoa creek in australia normalized energy enorm at different locations inside the forest is quantified this enorm is the ratio between the wave energy at a distance x from the mangrove front σ2 x and the incident wave energy σ i 2 massel et al 1999 reveals enorm values ranging from 0 66 till more than 1 at 80 m inside the forest rates higher than 1 are explained by the wave transformation produced by the gradually sloping mudflat present in the area enorm values at 160 m within the forest varies between 0 22 and 0 63 these results can be compared to the dissipation rates obtained here enorm can be computed as hrms h rms i 2 then hrms h rms i is obtained for all random wave cases tested in these experiments by using β m the resultant enorm ranges from 0 70 to 0 94 at 80 m inside the forest 13 3 m at laboratory scale and from 0 50 to 0 90 at 156 m 26 m at laboratory scale normalized energy reported by massel et al 1999 is smaller than the one obtained here that is higher dissipation is recorded this difference can be attributed to the bottom friction produced by the natural soil included in their field observations but not considered in this analysis since bottom and walls flume friction are eliminated in wave damping analysis 3 2 key variables in wave energy damping it is well known that wave damping strongly depends on the mangrove field characteristics and water depth previous studies have reported that wave damping also depends on wave height e g anderson and smith 2014 maza et al 2016 however dependence of damping on wave period is not well established with studies reporting higher attenuation for shorter waves and others showing a higher attenuation for longer waves in addition most studies reporting wave period influence on wave damping were carried out with flexible vegetation e g dubi and torum 1996 infantes et al 2012 it should be noted that vegetation response to wave excursion is very important to determine the influence of wave period to further explore the influence of water depth wave height and period on wave damping damping coefficients are obtained considering the effect of the mangrove models i e β m damping coefficients for regular and random waves are related to relative wave height h h and wave steepness h l where l is the wave length for random waves root mean square wave height hrms and the wave length associated to the peak period lp are used fig 7 shows in the three upper panels β m as a function of the relative wave height for different water depths for both regular and random waves the two lower panels show a common fitting for the three water depths by introducing mangrove field properties by multiplying the relative wave height by svf a linear relationship between β m and the relative wave height is found for regular and random waves different fittings are obtained for each water depth highlighting the influence of the frontal area of the models which varies in the vertical thus for the same relative wave height the highest β m is obtained for the smallest water depth when the frontal area of the mangroves is the largest to introduce the effect of the frontal area in the analysis the relative wave height is multiplied by the svf the new data setup allows a common fitting for the three water depths obtaining a high correlation coefficient as shown in the two lower panels in fig 7 to explore the influence of the wave period the wave length is introduced in the analysis the influence of wave steepness is studied for the three water depths and svf is used to introduce the effect of the variable submerged vegetation volume fig 8 shows β m as a function of wave steepness as it can be observed linear fittings result in poor correlation coefficients especially for h 0 17 and 0 33 m a second order polynomial is used in order to obtain a better fitting although this second fitting leads to higher correlation coefficients they are still small for h 0 17 m and h 0 33 m for regular waves cases where data show a high dispersion and wave damping is not determined by wave steepness for the other cases including the common fitting a general trend can be shown revealing higher damping coefficients for higher wave heights as observed in fig 7 and shorter wave lengths i e shorter wave periods correlation coefficients obtained when relating β m to wave steepness are smaller than those found when β m is related to the relative wave height this reveals that for short waves such as those tested in these experiments wave height is dominant over wave period for wave damping 3 3 wave induced forces wave forces are measured in nine mangroves distributed along the first 9 m of the forest dynamic forces are recorded by the load cells located in the forces arms fig 4 and then filtered following the procedure described in fig 5 for regular waves filtered load cell records are processed to get the maximum force exerted on each mangrove as the mean of the maximum load recorded for 50 waves for random waves an extensive analysis is performed to get different statistical values by assessing forces recorded for each of the wave crests of the random wave train the maximum and root mean square forces are obtained fig 9 shows the maximum force f d m a x evolution along the 9 model mangroves for a regular wave train h 0 05 m and t 1 2 s and the three water depths fig 10 displays the maximum and root mean square f d r m s forces evolution along the 9 models for a random wave train hrms 0 05 m and tp 1 44 s and the three water depths figs 9 and 10 show an increase of the exerted forces along the first meters of the forest this force increase is consistent with the growth in wave steepness at the beginning of the forest as can be observed both in fig 6 and in the bottom panel of fig 5 where higher wave heights are shown in gauge 5 than in gauge 4 further into the forest force values do not vary as much as seen from the comparison between values in mangroves rows 7 and 9 the increase in wave steepness and consequent rise in the forces exerted on the mangroves can be explained due to the shoaling produced by the seaward slope as discussed in section 3 1 the resultant non linear waves concentrate their mass in the wave crest where maximum velocities are produced and the maximum drag forces are recorded in the direction of wave propagation the analysis of figs 9 and 10 also shows that for a given wave train propagating at different water depths the maximum force values are reached for the smallest water depth for h 0 17 m the frontal area of the model is the largest and waves are highly non linear leading to a depth averaged velocity greater than that of higher water depths drag forces are commonly expressed as a function of the square of the incident velocity e g dalrymple et al 1984 mazda et al 1997b chapman et al 2015 plotting the forces measured as a function of the square of the incident velocity leads to a linear relationship as can be observed in fig 11 where drag forces measured in mangrove tree 1 are displayed as a function of u 2 to check the relationship between measured forces and square velocity for a case where waves are highly non linear the incident velocity is calculated here as the depth averaged velocity under the wave crest using linear theory for random wave trains u is obtained considering hmax and hrms when analyzing f d m a x and f d r m s respectively the right panel in fig 11 shows the results for regular waves and the three water depths displayed in red h 0 17 m black h 0 33 m and blue h 0 50 solid circles and stars in the left panel correspond to f d m a x and f d r m s calculated as a function of u 2 obtained by using hmax and hrms respectively the window at the bottom right corner shows a greater detail of f d r m s for low velocities linear fittings and correlation coefficients are also displayed in fig 11 for all cases fittings shown in fig 11 reveal a linear relationship between measured forces and square incident velocities with high correlation coefficients ρ2 0 97 for all cases fig 11 also shows higher forces for higher velocities and water depths forces obtained under regular waves for h 0 33 and h 0 50 m fit to almost the same equation i e similar forces are obtained for both water depths if the depth averaged velocity is the same this effect is also observed for random waves when analyzing f d r m s this result highlights that a smaller frontal area and its distribution have a different effect for h 0 50 m than for h 0 33 m the frontal area per unit height next to the free surface for h 0 50 m equals the value of the mangrove trunk thus the smallest area is encountered where maximum velocities are interacting with the mangrove this can explain that similar forces are observed for h 0 50 and 0 33 m another aspect that should be considered is that u 2 is evaluated by using linear theory which cannot well represent the actual incident velocities especially for highly nonlinear waves linear theory provides velocity values till the free surface level but velocities at the wave crest are not evaluated wave crest velocities have an effect on the exerted forces especially for the maximum wave in random wave trains this may explain the larger difference found in the forces obtained for h 0 50 and 0 33 m when analyzing f d m a x for random waves however despite this approximation the obtained linear fittings support the quadratic relationship between fd and u consequently this relationship is used in the next section 4 comparison of forces obtained analytically from wave damping and measured values in this section analytical drag forces applied in the physical formulation of wave damping by vegetation are compared to the experimental measurements in order to explore the accuracy of analytical expressions in predicting the actual force experienced by mangroves once the quadratic relationship between fd and u in the measured forces is proven the most commonly used formula to predict wave damping due to vegetation in meso scale and macro scale numerical models is used this force can be evaluated analytically by using the following equation 5 f d 1 2 ρ a f c d u u where ρ is the fluid density af is the frontal area of the element cd is the drag coefficient and u is the depth averaged flow velocity when dealing with a mangrove field this force is multiplied by the number of mangroves per square meter n to account for the contribution of all individuals cd can be obtained analytically as a function of β using dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 formulations for regular and random waves respectively 6 c d 9 π 4 d n h i k sin h 2 k h 2 k h sin h k h sin h 3 k l 3 sin h k l β 7 c d 3 π d n h r m s i k sin h 2 k h 2 k h sin h k h sin h 3 k l 3 sin h k l β where d is the mangrove area per unit height k is the wave number and l is the submerged length of the mangroves these formulations are derived under several assumptions including irrotational flow and linear wave theory that usually are not satisfied analytical drag forces are obtained using eqs 5 7 to get cd for regular and random waves in this analysis d d is used as the mean model area per unit height n is equal to 2 mangroves m2 incident wave conditions are considered to evaluate k and l h since vegetation is always emerged β used in eqs 6 and 7 are β m obtained from wave decay analysis after subtracting the bottom and walls friction effect in fig 12 the drag coefficient cd is presented for regular and random waves as a function of the reynolds number re re is obtained using the depth averaged velocity u and d cd for a smooth cylinder is also displayed by a dashed line in the re range of these experiments results reveal that drag coefficient obtained using the analytical expression do not show significant differences between water depths if d is used in its calculation a higher dispersion of values is found for regular than for random waves cd ranges from 0 3 to 2 4 for regular waves and from 0 5 to 1 5 for random waves the higher dispersion found for regular cases can be ascribed to the presence of standing waves along the forest generated by their own reflection as observed in previous works such as asano et al 1988 or maza et al 2013 reflection contributes to the modulation of the wave height along the wave propagation direction affecting the β value and consequently cd once cd is obtained for all cases eq 5 is used to compute the analytical drag forces af is calculated by multiplying d times the water depth plus half of the incident wave height hi 2 and h rms i 2 for regular and random waves respectively since forces associated to the wave crest are later compared u is evaluated in random waves trains as the depth averaged value under the wave crest associated to h rms i then both frontal area and flow velocities are depth averaged values these analytical drag forces are compared to the values recorded in the laboratory for random waves f d r m s is considered since mendez and losada 2004 formulation is expressed in terms of hrms due to the shoaling effect increasing the wave height and nonlinearity of the waves and consequently the exerted forces in the first meters of the forest forces recorded in mangrove tree 9 are considered for comparison this choice is supported by the performance of eqs 2 and 3 to fit wave decay as can be observed in fig 6 the increase of wave steepness leads to a bad agreement between the fitting and the wave height values in those first meters of the forest however beyond that point wave decay is well reproduced by eqs 2 and 3 therefore it is to be expected that analytical drag forces obtained from β coefficients fit better to the ones recorded inside the forest the wave damping analysis carried out in the previous section led to two different damping coefficients β m b and β m consequently analytical drag forces can be obtained using both sets of β coefficients fig 13 shows fd obtained using β m b squares and β m solid circles respectively as a function of re as expected forces calculated with β m b are larger than those obtained by using β m with mean values around twice the values obtained considering the isolated effect of mangroves therefore including the contribution of the flume boundaries to the damping has a relevant effect on the resultant fd this conclusion has important consequences for numerical modeling numerical models formulating wave attenuation by vegetation in terms of fd can significantly overestimate the dissipation produced by vegetation if they are feed with experimental results where bottom and walls friction are not excluded analytical drag forces are then compared to measured values fig 14 shows this comparison for analytical drag forces obtained using β m since forces obtained by using β b m result in a worse agreement with measured values analytical drag forces are displayed in solid circles and measured values using stars quadratic fittings are also shown using dashed and solid lines for analytical and measured forces respectively analytical drag forces both overestimate and underestimate measured forces depending on the case the highest differences are obtained for regular waves where overestimations can lead to forces that double the measured values these discrepancies are not surprising since analytical drag forces are obtained under several assumptions that are not satisfied in the experiments neither in real mangrove fields however the discrepancies between the fittings obtained for analytical and measured forces are leading to maximum relative errors of 38 and 12 for regular and random waves respectively these errors shed light on the uncertainty that should be considered when using models based on depth integrated potential flow to quantify momentum decay due to vegetation using a fd obtained analytically from wave damping analysis the errors increase with re as can be observed in fig 14 that is with wave velocity 5 conclusions an experimental study performed using a 1 6 scale fringe mangrove forest of 26 m composed by 135 models built reproducing mature rhizophora mangroves with 24 aerial roots has been presented here regular and random waves scaled using froude similarity are used for the simulation of the hydrodynamics different water depths are tested to account for the influence of the variable frontal area of the mangroves along the vertical free surface measurements are taken along the forest allowing the analysis of wave decay produced under different flow conditions forces measured along the first 9 m of the forest enable on the one hand to analyze their evolution at the beginning of the forest and on the other hand to compare them with forces obtained analytically from wave damping wave attenuation analysis highlights the importance of considering wave damping produced by bottom walls and any other element inducing friction in the flume damping coefficients obtained directly from experimental measurements can show high differences with coefficients calculated by subtracting the damping induced by the flume boundaries neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove forest capacity to dissipate flow energy therefore it is strongly recommended that when laboratory experiments are performed to analyze wave damping due to a coastal ecosystem hydrodynamic conditions should be tested with and without the vegetation system in the flume it has been observed that for a fringe mangrove the seaward slope influences the incident wave conditions leading to an enhancement of wave height due to shoaling when waves do not break along the slope this increase in wave steepness induces the highest drag forces in the direction of waves propagation along the first meters of the forest in accordance with the increase in wave height and nonlinearity it has been also proven that for a given mangrove field water depth and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves in addition the consideration of the svf for each water depth allows relating the attenuation coefficients found for the different water depths accounting for the different frontal area associated to each one of them measured forces relate well to the square depth averaged velocity confirming the quadratic relationship between fd and u for a given wave train tested over three different water depths the maximum dynamic force is obtained for the smallest water depth corresponding to the largest frontal area of the mangroves and highly nonlinear waves however for the same depth averaged velocity the highest forces are recorded as expected for the largest water depth dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 equations that relate wave damping to the drag coefficient are used to obtain cd depth averaged frontal area and velocities using linear theory are then used to get an analytical value of fd the comparison of analytical and experimental forces shows a better agreement between analytical drag forces obtained considering β m than β m b confirming that wave energy attenuation induced by the mangrove trees is better reproduced once the damping associated to any other sources of dissipation is eliminated the discrepancies found between measured and analytical drag forces reveal the deviations produced when using wave damping to define fd that can lead to overestimations of up to double it is worth mentioning that these results have important implications on numerical modeling of wave attenuation by coastal ecosystems analytical or numerical models based on equations formulated in terms of wave damping coefficients should be used with experimental coefficients obtained subtracting the dissipation attributed to the boundaries of the experimental facilities bottom and walls then the effect of bottom friction due to natural soil in the vegetated area should be always considered as an additional source of damping and modeled accordingly this separation of wave decay produced by the ecosystem elements and the bottom cannot be performed when measuring in the field in those cases the measured wave decay rates account for the combined effect of both sources of dissipation and they should be used in prediction models accordingly finally analytical or numerical models based on the introduction of fd in the momentum equation should be calibrated with measurements of the actual force exerted on the vegetation since estimating this force analytically from wave damping coefficients can lead to large over or underestimations acknowledgments this work has been funded under the retos investigacion 2014 grant bia2014

592,this paper studies the impact of the hydraulic conductivity structure on solute transport in a radially convergent heterogeneous flow field which is generated by a well pumping a confined aquifer the solute is injected instantaneously in a fully penetrating well at a known distance from the pumping well and the analysis is performed numerically by considering four conductivity structures sharing the same two point statistics but displaying widely different higher order moments and connectivity features the overall objective of the present work is to assess the impact of three dimensional hydraulic conductivity structures on the breakthrough curve btc at a pumping well as a function of a few structural parameters the logconductivity variance the integral scales along the horizontal and vertical directions the local scale dispersivity and the distance of the injection well the numerical simulations are also compared with two analytical solutions from literature based on the first order approximation and the self consistent approximation respectively the results indicate that the principal features of the btc are weakly dependent on the hydraulic conductivity structure similar to the findings of janković 2017 for transport in uniform flow also the simple first order solution provides a good approximation of the btc in most of the scenarios considered and thus it can be a useful and effective tool for screening purposes in applications dealing with aquifers contamination keywords groundwater radial transport convergent tracer tests permeability

properties it is widely accepted that plume spreading in porous formations is a scale dependent process gelhar et al 1992 mostly ruled by the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity field k and a wealthy of results are today available relating hydraulic property statistics to global metrics that quantify the spreading plume spatial moments and breakthrough curves btcs at control planes are example of such metrics see e g freeze 1975 gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1984 neuman et al 1987 traditionally the logconductivity field y ln k was modeled as a multivariate normal mvn random space function with its correlation structure fully identified by the first and the second statistical moments koltermann and gorelick 1996 a number of solutions for this type of model are available under the first order approximation foa in the logconductivity variance σ y 2 dagan 1989 rubin 2003 the robustness of such an approximation formally valid for σ y 2 1 0 was confirmed with extensive field campaigns in weakly heterogeneous formations freyberg 1986 garabedian et al 1991 hess et al 1992 and numerical simulations see e g bellin et al 1992 salandin and fiorotto 1998 more recently foa was successfully applied to the made 1 experiment which took place at the columbus air force base columbus mississippi usa boggs and rehfeldt 1990 boggs et al 1992 in a highly heterogeneous formation with σ y 2 6 0 fiori et al 2017 although approximated foa allows to systematically investigate the relationship between the structural parameters of the k field and the evolution of a traveling plume applications of this theory have been proposed for reactive transport including biodegradation bellin et al 2011 zarlenga and fiori 2014 risk assessment andričević and cvetković 1996 de barros and fiori 2014 fiori et al 2015a de barros et al 2016 zarlenga et al 2016 and dilution enhancement for improving remediation strategies fiori 2001 boso et al 2013 de barros et al 2015 di dato et al 2018 however as the medium heterogeneity increases more complex connectivity structures and zones of low conductivity emerge journel and deutsch 1993 which cannot be reproduced by two points statistics guardiano and srivastava 1993 it has been shown that these structures lead to btcs with long tails and early arrivals ptak et al 2004 liu et al 2004 klise et al 2009 bianchi et al 2011 molinari et al 2015 bianchi and zheng 2016 rizzo and de barros 2017 a number of studies investigated the impact of such structures on transport by comparing several hydraulic conductivity fields with the same second order characterization but different higher order statistics concluding that the conductivity structure may significantly influence the transport behavior desbarats 1990 sánchez vila et al 1996 gómez hernández and wen 1998 wen and gómez hernández 1998 zinn and harvey 2003 knudby and carrera 2005 2006 willmann et al 2008 haslauer et al 2012 srzic et al 2013 siirila woodburn and maxwell 2015 riva et al 2017 this notwithstanding the detailed three dimensional simulations of a uniform in the mean flow field conducted by janković et al 2017 showed that the btcs are weakly dependent of the k structure even for high heterogeneity i e up to σ y 2 8 0 in a later study fiori et al 2017 explored further these findings deducing that foa provides results accurate enough for most applications in highly heterogeneous formations well beyond its formal limits in particular under ergodic conditions foa reproduces fairly well the btc even for the extreme value of σ y 2 8 0 at a large distance from the source about 63 i with i indicating the logconductivity integral scale a possible explanation of such unexpected result may lie in the dimensionality of the flow field similar findings were obtained by bianchi and pedretti 2018 who observed a significant difference between two and three dimensional conductivity structures by applying the concept of geological entropy bianchi and pedretti 2017 in particular bianchi and pedretti 2018 showed that two dimensional fields are less connected than the more realistic at the field scale three dimensional configuration analyzing the impact of higher order statistics on transport is even more complex for radial flow which is relevant in many practical situations like e g plume containment and remediation bagtzoglou and oates 2007 zhang et

et al 2016 such a complexity stems from flow non uniformity which complicates the solution of the flow problem early studies on radial flow in heterogeneous porous media were devoted to infer the statistical moments of hydraulic head as a function of the second order statistical moments of k e g fiori et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 indelman 2001 riva et al 2001 guadagnini et al 2003 firmani et al 2006 severino et al 2008 severino 2011 zech et al 2012 analytical solutions for transport in radial flow have been derived for macrodispersion indelman and dagan 1999 neuweiler et al 2001 severino et al 2011 capture zones lessoff and indelman 2004 riva et al 2006 and breakthrough curves indelman et al 2006 severino et al 2012 in this context only a few studies becker and shapiro 2000 2003 ptak et al 2004 pedretti et al 2013 2014 molinari et al 2015 have analyzed the impact of connectivity and flow channelization on radial transport such studies indicate that flow channeling may induce significant btc tailing recently libera et al 2017b studied how pumping schedule affects transport in both gaussian and non gaussian logconductivity fields by means of systematic 2 d numerical simulations they observed that the plume shape and its evolution in time are mainly controlled by the operational pumping scheme which overshadows the effect of conductivity structure on btc however to our best knowledge none have explored systematically so far the impact of different structures on btcs at a well pumping from a heterogeneous aquifer thereby verifying how foa performs in such a flow configuration the present work aims at filling this knowledge gap by extending the work of janković et al 2017 and fiori et al 2017 to non uniform flows following the line of such works here we perform accurate simulations of conservative transport in a converging flow system the analyzed structures are four the standard multivariate normal field mvn the connected and the disconnected fields generated with the algorithm of zinn and harvey 2003 and the block structure resembling to the multi indicator model self consistent approximation mimsca cvetković et al 2014 such structures share the same second order statistics but are characterized by different higher order statistics the hydraulic conductivity field is then a function of only three parameters the logconductivity variance σ y 2 the integral scale in longitudinal direction i and the ratio of statistical anisotropy e i i v where iv is the integral scale along the vertical direction the paper is structured as follows the problem formulation is presented in section 2 while sections 3 and 4 describe the numerical model and two analytical solutions derived in the past respectively section 5 presents and discusses the results while the main findings of our study are summarized in section 6 2 problem formulation we consider a three dimensional confined heterogeneous aquifer of thickness w and unbounded in the horizontal direction the hydraulic logconductivity y ln k is assumed as a random space function rsf with statistical properties controlling its spatial patterns the four structures considered in the present work are discussed in the section 3 1 a fully penetrating well is pumping water at a constant discharge qw the resulting radially converging flow in a three dimensional formation is steady and governed by the following mass conservation equation 1 e y x h x 0 where x x 1 x 2 x 3 are the spatial coordinates and h is the hydraulic head the eq 1 is defined within the following domain x 1 x 2 and x 3 0 w the specific discharge q q 1 q 2 q 3 is obtained from the darcy s law 2 q x k x h x where the hydraulic conductivity tensor k d i a g k is locally isotropic and the reference system is aligned with its principal directions the anisotropic structure of the formation is embedded into the statistical model of spatial variability as described in section 3 1 the solution of eqs 1 and 2 with appropriate boundary conditions provides the hydraulic head h and the specific discharge q which are rsfs as well due to the randomness of y assume that a pulse injection of mass m 0 takes place along an injection well located at a radial distance r x 1 2 x 2 2 from the pumping well which is placed at x 1 x 2 0 the evolution of the resulting plume can be modeled by the following local advection dispersion equation lade 3 c x t t v x c x t d x c x t where c is the dissolved concentration v is the darcian scale velocity field i e v q n where n is the porosity here assumed spatially homogeneous and d is the local scale dispersion coefficient which is assumed isotropic and is given by 4 d x α d v x d m i where αd is the isotropic local dispersivity v x v x is the magnitude of the local velocity d m is the molecular dispersion and i is the identity matrix notice that mass conservation leads to a mean flow which is radial and converging toward the pumping well 5 v r u r r q w 2 π n w r 1 where r x 1 2 x 2 2 is the horizontal distance of the observation point from the pumping well and the brackets indicate the ensemble mean operator all the points with the same horizontal distance from the well have the same mean velocity which is horizontal and radial given that both wells are fully screened and the medium is three dimensional ergodicity can be invoked thus space average can be exchanged with ensemble mean provided that the aquifer thickness is much larger than the vertical integral scale i e w iv e g fiori 1998 dentz et al 2000 de barros and rubin 2011 we remind that ergodic transport in convergent flow driven by wells can be invoked only for three dimensional flow given the previous condition conversely in two dimensional flow the well is a point and transport is always non ergodic moreover the number of layers needed to reach ergodic conditions is typically larger in radial convergent flow than in natural gradient flow dagan 1990 pedretti and fiori 2013 di dato et al 2017 this may appear as a rather stringent requirement however it should be noted that in sedimentary aquifers iv i and in most cases iv 10 cm see e g rubin 2003 table 2 1 such that operational ergodicity can be obtained with a thickness of a few tens of meters for instance preliminary simulations showed that with i v 0 1 m and a thickness of the injection well of 40 m i e 400 iv small differences are observed between the btcs obtained in independent realizations analyzing non ergodic transport in radial flow is beyond the scope of this paper and the interested reader may refer to previous works e g firmani et al 2006 zech et al 2012 pedretti and fiori 2013 di dato et al 2017 for detailed discussion on the accuracy of ergodic assumption under the ergodic assumption and according to the travel time approach the breakthrough curve btc for an injection at distance r from the pumping well is given by dagan et al 1992 6 m r t θ 1 w 0 w m 0 a h t τ a θ d x 3 where a r x 3 with x 3 0 w is the initial position within the injection line expressed in cylindrical coordinates h is the heaviside step function m 0 is the relative mass density whose expression depends on the injection mode τ is the random travel time to the well of a particle released at a and θ is the vector containing the model parameters which are the parameters of the spatial variability model supplemented by local dispersivity αd and the coefficient of molecular diffusion d m the impact of injection mode on the solution of eq 6 was systematically investigated by kreft and zuber 1978 in a one dimensional setup and extended to a radially convergent flow by pedretti and fiori 2013 and di dato et al 2017 here we assume a flux proportional injection such that the relative mass density m 0 at the injection line is proportional to the local velocity v janković and fiori 2010 7 m 0 a m 0 v a w v a a sketch of the conceptual model with the key parameters is depicted in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 models of spatial variability the classic model of spatial variability used in stochastic subsurface hydrology assumes y as a statistically stationary multivariate normal mvn rsf with mean y and variance σ y 2 y x 2 both constant and autocorrelation function ρ y r y x y x r σ y 2 where y y y is the logconductivity fluctuation which depends on the two point separation distance r only given that most aquifers are inherently anisotropic with larger correlation lengths in horizontal directions see e g rubin 2003 we utilized the following axisymmetric autocorrelation function 8 ρ y r e r r r 1 2 r 2 2 i 2 r 3 3 i v 2 where i and iv are the horizontal and vertical integral scales respectively and r indicates the normalized dimensionless separation distance as a consequence of y randomness both the hydraulic head h and the specific discharge q are rsfs with their statistics depending on those of y it has been shown that this model is unable to reproduce organized patterns of hydrofacies as observed in two dimensional images from outcrops and a number of alternative models have been proposed to overcome this limitation see e g desbarats 1990 gómez hernández and wen 1998 zinn and harvey 2003 knudby and carrera 2005 bayer et al 2015 di dato et al 2016 riva et al 2017 since our objective here is not to reproduce as close as possible hydrogeologic characteristics of a particular site rather to investigate the effect of features that cannot be reproduced by the second order statistics we addressed the problem with a heuristic perspective following the approach by zinn and harvey 2003 in particular we considered different logconductivity fields sharing the second order moments and integral scales but different connectivity patterns the starting point is the widely employed mvn field for which independent realizations of y are generated at the nodes of a computational grid by using hydro gen an optimized sequential random generator developed by bellin and rubin 1996 successively the mvn field was transformed into two new fields one with connected high hydraulic conductivities hereinafter denoted as conn and the other with connected low hydraulic conductivity for simplicity hereafter we refer to the latter as disconnected field disc since the high conductivity regions that in the former model are connected in the latter are disconnected we refer to the paper by zinn and harvey 2003 for details concerning the procedure used for transforming the mvn field we remark that both the connected and disconnected fields represent rather extreme cases of spatial variability of y sharing the same second order description i e same mean variance and autocovariance function of the generating mvn field however this is instrumental to our objective of testing bounds for the btcs occurring in such media the overall approach is therefore similar to that performed by janković et al 2017 for transport in mean uniform flow the fourth model is characterized by a pieceways varying hydraulic conductivity field which is obtained by dividing the domain into blocks of dimensions equal to twice the integral scales in each direction and assigning to them a constant homogeneous hydraulic logconductivity extracted from a gaussian distribution with mean y and variance σ y 2 the resulting field hereafter called block is characterized by a linear covariance function with integral scales i and iv in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively furthermore any partition of y in classes gives rise to the same degree of connectivity for all the classes this model of spatial variability has been adopted in a number of works dealing with highly heterogeneous formations see e g dagan et al 2003 fiori et al 2006 cvetković et al 2014 janković et al 2017 summarizing the four models adopted here i e mvn conn disc and block allow us to testing different connectivity patterns with similar second order statistical properties and determine their influence on transport in non uniform flows toward a pumping well we shall carry out such tests through accurate numerical simulations as described in section 3 2 3 2 numerical simulations of flow and transport the analysis of the impact of hydraulic conductivity structure on the btc at the extraction well is performed by means of detailed numerical simulations which serve also as a benchmark for the analytical solutions available in the literature we consider a computational domain of dimensions 40 i 40 i in the horizontal directions and thickness of w 20 i v which is divided into regular parallelepiped blocks of dimensions equal to 1 8 of the integral scales in all the three main directions thereby resulting in 321 321 161 16 589 601 nodes and 16 384 000 cells the aquifer anisotropy ratio is set to e 0 1 the flow eq 1 is solved by the finite volume scheme of modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the upper and lower boundaries are impermeable while the four outer faces of the domain are of constant head a fully penetrating well placed at the center of the domain is pumping water at the constant discharge qw l 3 t 1 the well is modeled by a line of vertical cells at the center of the domain with constant piezometric head lower than the head of the external sides and fixed in such a way that the discharge at the well is qw transport is simulated by particle tracking through the procedure outlined in appendix a under the ergodic assumption the btc can be computed as the cumulative density function cdf of travel times at the pumping well in order to increase the sampling of available information in each simulation the injected mass is discretized into 1548 particles distributed uniformly within 12 line sources placed at a distance r from the well and separated by an angle of π 6 each vertical line receives 129 particles distributed uniformly between the depths of 2 iv and 18 iv for a total length of 16 iv such as to avoid boundary effects by the horizontal impervious planes delimiting the computational domain in the vertical direction the vertical lines are distributed along circles with radius equal to r 5 i 10 i and 15 i in order to explore the effect of the distance from the well on the btc we highlight that the conceptual model is the one showed in fig 1 with a single injection well therefore the only scope of using 12 vertical lines is to reduce the number of monte carlo realizations needed to achieve convergence since we are interested in comparing btcs obtained for flux proportional injection each particle s travel time is subsequently weighted according to eq 7 the flux of information in input and output of modflow is managed by a python script that uses flopy bakker et al 2016 flow and transport equations are solved in their dimensionless form with the length and temporal scales equal to i and πnwi 2 qw respectively consequently denoting with the prime the correspondent dimensionless quantities the dimensionless discharge is set to q w π n w with w 20 the dimensionless aquifer thickness simulations are conducted for three levels of heterogeneity σ y 2 0 5 2 0 and 8 0 the effect of pore scale dispersion on the btc curve is parametrized by means of the transverse péclet number p e i v α d i e α d which is the key parameter for assessing the impact of local scale dispersion on macrodispersivity see e g fiori 1996 since in most sedimentary formations i v o 10 1 m and α d o 10 4 m a typical order of magnitude for péclet is p e o 10 3 or larger in order to explore a wide range of variability we consider two rather extreme conditions purely advective transport i e pe at one hand and a rather large local dispersion i e p e 100 on the other molecular diffusion assumes importance in controlling the release of solute from low conductive zone where water velocity is typically very low or stagnant labolle and fogg 2001 the occurrence of zones with very low hydraulic conductivity is more frequent in highly heterogeneous formations where the contrast in the hydraulic conductivity may be very large in the present work molecular diffusion is parametrized through the following diffusive péclet number p e m q w π n w d m in the simulations pem is set to 105 a value which is in line with observations as discussed in grathwohl 2012 finally flow and transport are performed on 1000 monte carlo realizations which allow to obtain reliable estimates of the ensemble btc tests have been made to verify that both the number of monte carlo runs and the number of particles injected in each realization suffice to achieve statistical convergence 4 available approximated solutions first order approximation and mimsca exact analytical solutions are unfortunately not available for the problem of transport in non uniform flow toward a pumping well we consider here two approximate solutions that have been proposed in the past the first order approximation foa and mimsca the latter acronym indicating the combination of the multi indicator model mim of spatial variability and the self consistent approximation sca employed to solve the flow field dagan et al 2003 fiori et al 2006 cvetković et al 2014 which was conceived for mean uniform flow a solution of radial flow and transport in heterogeneous formations based on foa was proposed by lessoff and indelman 2004 and later by indelman et al 2006 under the following simplifying assumptions i the formation is weakly heterogeneous σ y 2 1 0 with logconductivity normally distributed and correlated in space according to the exponential axisymmetric autocorrelation function 8 ii rw i i e the radius of the well is much smaller than the horizontal integral scale such that the well can be represented as a vertical line iii the well is fully penetrating the aquifer which is unbounded in the horizontal direction and w iv such that ergodic conditions can be invoked under this condition the thickness w is immaterial and the domain can be considered indefinite in all the three coordinate directions iv the formation is highly anisotropic i e e i v i 0 2 and pore scale dispersion is neglected i e p e i v α d under such conditions the cdf of the travel time which for an instantaneous injection coincides with the btc at the extraction well assumes the following expression indelman et al 2006 9 m f o a τ r 1 2 1 erf ln τ r τ r ξ 2 2 ξ where erf indicates the error function and ξ σ τ r τ r c v τ is the coefficient of variation of the travel time notice that because of the hypothesis that w w i v transport is ergodic and travel time moments are the same for all the vertical lines at the horizontal distance r from the well indelman et al 2006 accordingly the mean travel time τ is equal to 10 τ r π n w q w r 2 while the travel time variance σ τ 2 is given by lessoff and indelman 2004 11 σ τ 2 r σ y 2 π n w i 2 q w 2 4 3 6 3 r i 2 2 r i 3 8 exp r i 1 r i we refer to the papers by lessoff and indelman 2004 and indelman et al 2006 for additional details on the derivation of expressions 10 and 11 the weakly heterogeneity assumption which characterizes the above solution may be removed by using mimsca with the corresponding model for radial transport developed in a recent paper by di dato et al 2017 such a solution is formally not limited to low values of σ y 2 as foa is transport is approximately solved by means of the travel time approach obtaining a semi analytical solution which is fully described in di dato et al 2017 and is not repeated here for the sake of brevity however we highlight that they observed an excellent agreement of their solution against both numerical simulations and the laboratory experiment of fernàndez garcia et al 2004 the core of the solution is a localization of the non uniform flow which is formally valid for slowly varying flows in space on the other hand the foa is free from such assumption although it is formally valid for weakly heterogeneous formations 5 results and discussion we begin with illustrating the first two moments of the btc namely the mean and variance of travel time fig 2 shows the mean travel time τ and the travel time variance σ τ 2 for the four conductivity structures described in section 3 1 i e mvn conn disc and block and for different degrees of medium heterogeneity described by the logconductivity variance σ y 2 from low to high heterogeneity σ y 2 0 5 2 0 and 8 0 the impact of the transverse pe is also considered with the two bounds p e and p e 100 as described in section 3 2 the moments are calculated for two different distances of the injection well from the pumping one r 5 i and r 15 i the same travel time moments obtained by the foa for the same parameters are also represented with continuous lines the moments by mimsca are very close to foa and for the sake of clarity are not reproduced in this figure the results indicate that in most cases the average travel time is independent of the hydraulic conductivity structure and the péclet number and that the foa 10 provides an excellent approximation such a solution is likely exact in the absence of local scale dispersion and for flux proportional injection mode and this is in agreement with what shown by fiori et al 2015b for mean uniform flow the deviations for p e 100 from solution 10 are more systematic and show that the effect of local scale dispersion is to increase the mean travel time although this happens only when both heterogeneity and injection well distance are large still we remind that in any case the selected p e 100 is quite small if compared with the typical values observed in the field and is employed here with the only objective of identifying an end member the increase of τ with pe can be explained as follows zones of connected fast preferential flow and zones of disconnected slow flow emerge when heterogeneity is significant see e g fiori et al 2006 local scale dispersion transfers solute preferentially from the fast zones to the slow ones because of the proportionality of the local dispersion coefficient with the local velocity eq 4 where d m is generally small such a mechanism induces an overall slow down of the plume and a consequent increase of the mean travel time to the pumping well a similar mechanism was identified by pedretti and fiori 2013 once again this feature manifests only when σ y 2 is large and pe is small much smaller than the value typically observed in most formations therefore for most reasonable applications we highlight that the analytical solution 10 is good enough for characterizing the mean solute arrival τ from the injection to the pumping well the impact of conductivity structure on travel time variance σ τ 2 is slightly more evident see fig 2 right panels especially for high σ y 2 and low pe deviations from the foa solution continuous lines are more pronounced for the disc and block structures for such cases the impact of pe is also relevant although we remind again the low value adopted for pe in the present simulations the increase of σ τ 2 with decreasing péclet can be explained with the same mechanism previously discussed local scale dispersion preferentially transfers solute from the fast zones to the slow ones leading to a broadening of the travel time pdf for high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 the role of conductivity structure becomes more evident especially with the increasing of distance r from the extraction well still the relative impact of the structure on the moments is much below the expectations considering the widely different connectivity structure of the four models in most cases the foa solution 11 is a reasonable approximation of the travel time variance notice that at high heterogeneity the travel time variance just like macrodispersion is a poor descriptor of solute spreading since it is strongly influenced by the btc tail see also the discussion in fiori et al 2006 thus a more pertinent comparison among solutions is performed by the analysis of the whole btc which is the quantity of interest here and that shall be examined in the following fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves btcs at the well for purely advective transport p e and a few values of the logconductivity variance σ y 2 as a function of the conductivity structure and the injection distance r the foa and mimsca models are also represented black lines dashed and dotted respectively for low to moderate heterogeneity i e up to σ y 2 2 0 the conductivity structure does not affect much the btc shape which is also well described by the analytical solutions we also notice that foa and mimsca are very close and both provide a very good approximation of the numerical btcs thus the robustness of foa and the similarity of all btcs regardless of the particular y structure adopted confirms the universal transport behavior already observed by janković et al 2017 for transport in mean uniform flows the above finding stays also for the strongest heterogeneous system analyzed here i e σ y 2 8 0 perhaps with the only exception of the disconnected field which exhibits a higher spreading with respect to the other cases consistently with what previously observed for the variance for the other cases all btcs look quite similar again the result is quite surprising standing the significant differences in connectivity among the four structures adopted the numerical btcs are fairly well represented by the analytical models and foa in particular that in most of the cases resembles well the mvn results such a finding is interesting considering the simplicity of the foa solution and suggests that a high order statistical characterization of y unfeasible in most applications may not be necessary to capture the main features of the btc for the flow system under consideration very similar results and conclusions were drawn for the case of transport in mean uniform flow janković et al 2017 mimsca also performs reasonably well but less than foa the reason is likely the particular implementation of mimsca by di dato et al 2017 that assumed local uniformity of flow in order to reach a solvable problem such a limitation which can be significant for non uniform flows like the one considered here may be overcome in future works e g along the lines traced by severino 2018 the impact of local dispersion is represented in fig 4 for the same cases of fig 3 and p e 100 as expected local scale dispersion exerts a negligible impact for small to moderate heterogeneity the effect of péclet is visible for σ y 2 8 0 and manifests in a more dispersed btc for the reasons illustrated previously the differences in the btcs are in any case quite small the striking result shown in figs 3 and 4 is that in all cases including σ y 2 8 0 the foa solution provides a reasonable prediction of the btc for all the scenarios perhaps with the sole exception of the disc case results can be further inspected through the quantiles of mass distribution that provide a measure of the btc behavior in the following we analyze a few characteristic travel time quantiles τ 05 τ 50 and τ 95 which correspond to the time required to recover the 5 50 and 95 of the mass respectively such values indicate respectively the early arrivals due to fast preferential flow the time arrival of the bulk of the solute mass and the time pertaining the late solute arrivals the results are depicted in fig 5 we start with the early arrivals described by the quantile τ 05 which is a key parameter to determine the aquifer channeling knudby and carrera 2005 and to design waste disposal sites rasmuson and neretnieks 1986 lanz et al 1998 as shown in the first column of fig 5 the conductivity structure exerts a relatively modest effect on the early arrivals for small to moderate heterogeneity noticeable differences are observed only for injection at large distances from the pumping well i e r 15 i in our examples and high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 curiously τ 05 for the disconnected case is smaller than that for the connected field such a counterintuitive result is explained by the strong effect of the injection model flux proportional and can be also observed in janković et al 2017 figure 3 as a matter of fact the effect of connectivity of k on transport is filtered by flow and flux proportional injection mode thus high conductivity zones even if disconnected receive proportionally more mass than the low conductivity zone thereby increasing the fraction of the mass that arrives early at the well the relevance of the injection condition on the early arrivals was also observed by di dato et al 2017 who analyzed both resident and flux proportional conditions together with the general behavior of the btcs this result confirms that connectivity is a flow and transport related feature and structural connectivity in terms of the k field is not a sufficient condition for assessing preferential flow similar arguments were brought by fiori et al 2006 the effect of pe on τ 05 is quite limited with the ratio between the minimum and the maximum values of the quantile observed in the realizations τ 05 min τ 05 max being 0 799 and 0 811 for p e 100 and pe respectively when σ y 2 2 and r 15 i at high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 the ratio reduces to 0 613 and 0 673 for p e 100 and pe respectively it is thus confirmed that pe does not impact much the early arrivals also for high heterogeneity the quantile τ 50 is an indicator of the timing of the bulk of contaminant and consequently it is a crucial parameter to assess risk exposure de barros and rubin 2008 tartakovsky 2013 the structure of the conductivity field exerts a very limited impact on τ 50 also for high heterogeneity for injection at a distance r 15 i from the well and σ y 2 2 0 the ratio τ 50 m i n τ 50 m a x 0 914 for both pes as σ y 2 increases to 8 0 the ratio reduces to τ 50 m i n τ 50 m a x 0 714 and 0 804 for p e 100 and pe respectively such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the quantile widens these results agree well with the experimental results of molinari et al 2015 who observed a poor impact of connectivity on the btc center of mass finally τ 95 quantifies the late arrivals which can be assumed as a parameter to quantify the effectiveness of a remediation activity berglund 1997 de barros et al 2013 as shown in the third column of fig 5 the numerical values of τ 95 for the four structures match quite well their analytical counterparts for σ y 2 2 0 the ratio between the minimum and the maximum residence times is τ 95 m i n τ 95 m a x 0 923 for p e 100 and 0 907 for pe the agreement with the analytical solution is less good for high heterogeneity but still acceptable as an estimation of the time needed to remediate a contaminated aquifer in particular at the highest variance σ y 2 8 0 τ 95 m i n τ 95 m a x 0 746 and 0 725 for p e 100 and pe respectively notice that τ 95 is smaller for connected field such reduction is due to channelization of high conductivity lenses as also observed by zinn and harvey 2003 and fiori et al 2017 altogether the differences of quantiles among the different models that we remind represent quite different and extreme scenarios of spatial connectivity is not much significant especially in view of applications the most significant differences are for r 15 i that is a quite large distance for the typical applications considering that horizontal integral scales are of the order of a few meters rubin 2003 table 2 1 pg 34 furthermore the foa model generally represents quite well the quantiles even for cases σ y 2 1 0 beyond the supposed range of validity of the model the reasons for such good performance are not entirely clear and deserve further investigation 6 summary and conclusion we investigate the impact of conductivity structure on radial transport such a topic has been analyzed in the past for uniform transport however to the best of our knowledge none has addressed the role of three dimensional conductivity structure on transport towards a pumping well the problem is of paramount importance in a series of applications like e g the aquifer remediation the design of hydraulic containment systems and the aquifer characterization by convergent tracer tests in order to accomplish such a purpose we performed a series of targeted numerical simulations of flow and transport in a heterogeneous converging flow we considered four structures of the hydraulic logconductivity y a multi variate normal field a structure made by regular blocks of constant k a connected and a disconnected field along the approach by zinn and harvey 2003 such fields were generated with the same two point statistics i e sharing the same logconductivity variance σ y 2 and the same integral scales i and iv but with different higher order correlations of conductivity hence displaying widely different degrees of connectivity for each class of conductivity the choice of the four structures is such to explore different connected fields in order to provide a wide range of possible k scenarios transport of conservative solute is described by the breakthrough curve btc detected at the pumping well after instantaneous injection of solute at a well at distance r from the pumping one the btc depends on a few key parameters that are discussed here such as the heterogeneity degree described by the logconductivity variance σ y 2 the distance from the well r and the local scale dispersion epitomized by the péclet number pe the numerical results are compared to two approximate analytical solutions the results show that the btcs pertaining to the different structures and scenarios under examination are quite similar besides the visual inspection of the curves comparison was made through the first two moments of the btc i e the mean and variance of the travel time and the quantiles pertaining to the fractions 5 50 and 95 of the cumulated mass at the pumping well such quantiles that represent the early the average and the late arrivals respectively are important for applications like risk assessment and remediation for all cases the resulting btcs were close one to each other also considering the rather extreme scenarios adopted for the conductivity structures and the péclet numbers in particular the k structure does not seem to influence significantly transport behavior especially for low and mild heterogeneity i e σ y 2 2 0 for high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 the impact of the higher order statistics on the btc is more appreciable but differences are still small in view of applications also numerical simulations show that local scale dispersivity is negligible for low heterogeneity thereby corroborating the pure advection approximation for transport in low heterogeneous media conversely local scale dispersion plays a more important role at high heterogeneity especially on late arrivals although the péclet number required to observe such differences is rather small of the order of 102 than expected in applications hence high order statistics of k which are impossible to infer from the field with the current technology do not seem to influence much the btc in the case of transport in convergent flow fields the relative closeness of results found here is particularly relevant also in view of the known difficulties and uncertainties in detecting the btc and the inference of the relevant hydraulic parameters like e g σ y 2 or i from field data moreover our study indicates that approximate analytical solutions like the one based on the first order approximation foa lessoff and indelman 2004 indelman et al 2006 and the multi indicator model self consistent approximation mimsca applied to radial transport di dato et al 2017 yield to an acceptable approximation of numerical results all the limitations notwithstanding even for conditions outside the presumed range of validity of the solutions foa is particularly effective for a broad range of scenarios being also very simple to apply with its closed form analytical solution given its easiness of use foa is an efficient tool to infer aquifer properties under the form of model s parameters i e σ y 2 i and e from convergent tracer tests which have been shown to be a reliable field test e g bellin and rubin 2004 zhou et al 2014 zech et al 2018 in addition foa may also serve as a first screening tool providing preliminary yet reliable results as function of a few physically based parameters prior to more complex transport models thus from a practical perspective two point statistics may be enough to fully characterize the hydraulic conductivity structure for transport prediction in convergent radial flow this is an encouraging result given that a detailed description of aquifer structure is prohibitive if not impossible mainly due to data scarcity and high costs associated to monitoring campaign ptak et al 2004 hence a second order statistical characterization of hydraulic conductivity involving quantities like σ y 2 i and e may indeed provide the basic information to adequately infer the btc in the flow conditions examined here we recognize however that the inference of two point statistical parameters like e g the logconductivity variance and the directional integral scales is still in most cases a difficult and expensive task requiring a large number of measurements the previously suggested aquifer characterization through a convergent tracer test employing foa formula may help in alleviating the efforts and costs associated to the second order characterization acknowledgements ab and af

showed that interpolation of velocity field provides results in agreement with other techniques such as the reflection method uffink 1985 or the integration of the general stochastic differential equation labolle et al 2000 here we modified the algorithm of pollock 1988 which is based on a linear interpolation of flux at the boundaries of the computational cells to include local dispersion and diffusion in a similar manner of zinn and harvey 2003 we first compute the time the particle would spend to reach the cell s boundary in the absence of local dispersion and diffusion then this time is used to compute the diffusive jump of the last right hand term of eq a 1 we verified the accuracy of this scheme against the analytical solution of moench 1989 valid for convergent radial dispersion in homogeneous media obtaining a very good match 
592,this paper studies the impact of the hydraulic conductivity structure on solute transport in a radially convergent heterogeneous flow field which is generated by a well pumping a confined aquifer the solute is injected instantaneously in a fully penetrating well at a known distance from the pumping well and the analysis is performed numerically by considering four conductivity structures sharing the same two point statistics but displaying widely different higher order moments and connectivity features the overall objective of the present work is to assess the impact of three dimensional hydraulic conductivity structures on the breakthrough curve btc at a pumping well as a function of a few structural parameters the logconductivity variance the integral scales along the horizontal and vertical directions the local scale dispersivity and the distance of the injection well the numerical simulations are also compared with two analytical solutions from literature based on the first order approximation and the self consistent approximation respectively the results indicate that the principal features of the btc are weakly dependent on the hydraulic conductivity structure similar to the findings of janković 2017 for transport in uniform flow also the simple first order solution provides a good approximation of the btc in most of the scenarios considered and thus it can be a useful and effective tool for screening purposes in applications dealing with aquifers contamination keywords groundwater radial transport convergent tracer tests permeability statistical structure connectivity of hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction natural aquifers are characterized by complex and uncertain structures which arise from the natural variability of hydraulic properties it is widely accepted that plume spreading in porous formations is a scale dependent process gelhar et al 1992 mostly ruled by the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity field k and a wealthy of results are today available relating hydraulic property statistics to global metrics that quantify the spreading plume spatial moments and breakthrough curves btcs at control planes are example of such metrics see e g freeze 1975 gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1984 neuman et al 1987 traditionally the logconductivity field y ln k was modeled as a multivariate normal mvn random space function with its correlation structure fully identified by the first and the second statistical moments koltermann and gorelick 1996 a number of solutions for this type of model are available under the first order approximation foa in the logconductivity variance σ y 2 dagan 1989 rubin 2003 the robustness of such an approximation formally valid for σ y 2 1 0 was confirmed with extensive field campaigns in weakly heterogeneous formations freyberg 1986 garabedian et al 1991 hess et al 1992 and numerical simulations see e g bellin et al 1992 salandin and fiorotto 1998 more recently foa was successfully applied to the made 1 experiment which took place at the columbus air force base columbus mississippi usa boggs and rehfeldt 1990 boggs et al 1992 in a highly heterogeneous formation with σ y 2 6 0 fiori et al 2017 although approximated foa allows to systematically investigate the relationship between the structural parameters of the k field and the evolution of a traveling plume applications of this theory have been proposed for reactive transport including biodegradation bellin et al 2011 zarlenga and fiori 2014 risk assessment andričević and cvetković 1996 de barros and fiori 2014 fiori et al 2015a de barros et al 2016 zarlenga et al 2016 and dilution enhancement for improving remediation strategies fiori 2001 boso et al 2013 de barros et al 2015 di dato et al 2018 however as the medium heterogeneity increases more complex connectivity structures and zones of low conductivity emerge journel and deutsch 1993 which cannot be reproduced by two points statistics guardiano and srivastava 1993 it has been shown that these structures lead to btcs with long tails and early arrivals ptak et al 2004 liu et al 2004 klise et al 2009 bianchi et al 2011 molinari et al 2015 bianchi and zheng 2016 rizzo and de barros 2017 a number of studies investigated the impact of such structures on transport by comparing several hydraulic conductivity fields with the same second order characterization but different higher order statistics concluding that the conductivity structure may significantly influence the transport behavior desbarats 1990 sánchez vila et al 1996 gómez hernández and wen 1998 wen and gómez hernández 1998 zinn and harvey 2003 knudby and carrera 2005 2006 willmann et al 2008 haslauer et al 2012 srzic et al 2013 siirila woodburn and maxwell 2015 riva et al 2017 this notwithstanding the detailed three dimensional simulations of a uniform in the mean flow field conducted by janković et al 2017 showed that the btcs are weakly dependent of the k structure even for high heterogeneity i e up to σ y 2 8 0 in a later study fiori et al 2017 explored further these findings deducing that foa provides results accurate enough for most applications in highly heterogeneous formations well beyond its formal limits in particular under ergodic conditions foa reproduces fairly well the btc even for the extreme value of σ y 2 8 0 at a large distance from the source about 63 i with i indicating the logconductivity integral scale a possible explanation of such unexpected result may lie in the dimensionality of the flow field similar findings were obtained by bianchi and pedretti 2018 who observed a significant difference between two and three dimensional conductivity structures by applying the concept of geological entropy bianchi and pedretti 2017 in particular bianchi and pedretti 2018 showed that two dimensional fields are less connected than the more realistic at the field scale three dimensional configuration analyzing the impact of higher order statistics on transport is even more complex for radial flow which is relevant in many practical situations like e g plume containment and remediation bagtzoglou and oates 2007 zhang et al 2009 piscopo et al 2015 libera et al 2017a rodríguez escales et al 2017 and field characterization by convergent tracer tests fernàndez garcia et al 2002 ptak et al 2004 zech et al 2015 pechstein et al 2016 such a complexity stems from flow non uniformity which complicates the solution of the flow problem early studies on radial flow in heterogeneous porous media were devoted to infer the statistical moments of hydraulic head as a function of the second order statistical moments of k e g fiori et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 indelman 2001 riva et al 2001 guadagnini et al 2003 firmani et al 2006 severino et al 2008 severino 2011 zech et al 2012 analytical solutions for transport in radial flow have been derived for macrodispersion indelman and dagan 1999 neuweiler et al 2001 severino et al 2011 capture zones lessoff and indelman 2004 riva et al 2006 and breakthrough curves indelman et al 2006 severino et al 2012 in this context only a few studies becker and shapiro 2000 2003 ptak et al 2004 pedretti et al 2013 2014 molinari et al 2015 have analyzed the impact of connectivity and flow channelization on radial transport such studies indicate that flow channeling may induce significant btc tailing recently libera et al 2017b studied how pumping schedule affects transport in both gaussian and non gaussian logconductivity fields by means of systematic 2 d numerical simulations they observed that the plume shape and its evolution in time are mainly controlled by the operational pumping scheme which overshadows the effect of conductivity structure on btc however to our best knowledge none have explored systematically so far the impact of different structures on btcs at a well pumping from a heterogeneous aquifer thereby verifying how foa performs in such a flow configuration the present work aims at filling this knowledge gap by extending the work of janković et al 2017 and fiori et al 2017 to non uniform flows following the line of such works here we perform accurate simulations of conservative transport in a converging flow system the analyzed structures are four the standard multivariate normal field mvn the connected and the disconnected fields generated with the algorithm of zinn and harvey 2003 and the block structure resembling to the multi indicator model self consistent approximation mimsca cvetković et al 2014 such structures share the same second order statistics but are characterized by different higher order statistics the hydraulic conductivity field is then a function of only three parameters the logconductivity variance σ y 2 the integral scale in longitudinal direction i and the ratio of statistical anisotropy e i i v where iv is the integral scale along the vertical direction the paper is structured as follows the problem formulation is presented in section 2 while sections 3 and 4 describe the numerical model and two analytical solutions derived in the past respectively section 5 presents and discusses the results while the main findings of our study are summarized in section 6 2 problem formulation we consider a three dimensional confined heterogeneous aquifer of thickness w and unbounded in the horizontal direction the hydraulic logconductivity y ln k is assumed as a random space function rsf with statistical properties controlling its spatial patterns the four structures considered in the present work are discussed in the section 3 1 a fully penetrating well is pumping water at a constant discharge qw the resulting radially converging flow in a three dimensional formation is steady and governed by the following mass conservation equation 1 e y x h x 0 where x x 1 x 2 x 3 are the spatial coordinates and h is the hydraulic head the eq 1 is defined within the following domain x 1 x 2 and x 3 0 w the specific discharge q q 1 q 2 q 3 is obtained from the darcy s law 2 q x k x h x where the hydraulic conductivity tensor k d i a g k is locally isotropic and the reference system is aligned with its principal directions the anisotropic structure of the formation is embedded into the statistical model of spatial variability as described in section 3 1 the solution of eqs 1 and 2 with appropriate boundary conditions provides the hydraulic head h and the specific discharge q which are rsfs as well due to the randomness of y assume that a pulse injection of mass m 0 takes place along an injection well located at a radial distance r x 1 2 x 2 2 from the pumping well which is placed at x 1 x 2 0 the evolution of the resulting plume can be modeled by the following local advection dispersion equation lade 3 c x t t v x c x t d x c x t where c is the dissolved concentration v is the darcian scale velocity field i e v q n where n is the porosity here assumed spatially homogeneous and d is the local scale dispersion coefficient which is assumed isotropic and is given by 4 d x α d v x d m i where αd is the isotropic local dispersivity v x v x is the magnitude of the local velocity d m is the molecular dispersion and i is the identity matrix notice that mass conservation leads to a mean flow which is radial and converging toward the pumping well 5 v r u r r q w 2 π n w r 1 where r x 1 2 x 2 2 is the horizontal distance of the observation point from the pumping well and the brackets indicate the ensemble mean operator all the points with the same horizontal distance from the well have the same mean velocity which is horizontal and radial given that both wells are fully screened and the medium is three dimensional ergodicity can be invoked thus space average can be exchanged with ensemble mean provided that the aquifer thickness is much larger than the vertical integral scale i e w iv e g fiori 1998 dentz et al 2000 de barros and rubin 2011 we remind that ergodic transport in convergent flow driven by wells can be invoked only for three dimensional flow given the previous condition conversely in two dimensional flow the well is a point and transport is always non ergodic moreover the number of layers needed to reach ergodic conditions is typically larger in radial convergent flow than in natural gradient flow dagan 1990 pedretti and fiori 2013 di dato et al 2017 this may appear as a rather stringent requirement however it should be noted that in sedimentary aquifers iv i and in most cases iv 10 cm see e g rubin 2003 table 2 1 such that operational ergodicity can be obtained with a thickness of a few tens of meters for instance preliminary simulations showed that with i v 0 1 m and a thickness of the injection well of 40 m i e 400 iv small differences are observed between the btcs obtained in independent realizations analyzing non ergodic transport in radial flow is beyond the scope of this paper and the interested reader may refer to previous works e g firmani et al 2006 zech et al 2012 pedretti and fiori 2013 di dato et al 2017 for detailed discussion on the accuracy of ergodic assumption under the ergodic assumption and according to the travel time approach the breakthrough curve btc for an injection at distance r from the pumping well is given by dagan et al 1992 6 m r t θ 1 w 0 w m 0 a h t τ a θ d x 3 where a r x 3 with x 3 0 w is the initial position within the injection line expressed in cylindrical coordinates h is the heaviside step function m 0 is the relative mass density whose expression depends on the injection mode τ is the random travel time to the well of a particle released at a and θ is the vector containing the model parameters which are the parameters of the spatial variability model supplemented by local dispersivity αd and the coefficient of molecular diffusion d m the impact of injection mode on the solution of eq 6 was systematically investigated by kreft and zuber 1978 in a one dimensional setup and extended to a radially convergent flow by pedretti and fiori 2013 and di dato et al 2017 here we assume a flux proportional injection such that the relative mass density m 0 at the injection line is proportional to the local velocity v janković and fiori 2010 7 m 0 a m 0 v a w v a a sketch of the conceptual model with the key parameters is depicted in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 models of spatial variability the classic model of spatial variability used in stochastic subsurface hydrology assumes y as a statistically stationary multivariate normal mvn rsf with mean y and variance σ y 2 y x 2 both constant and autocorrelation function ρ y r y x y x r σ y 2 where y y y is the logconductivity fluctuation which depends on the two point separation distance r only given that most aquifers are inherently anisotropic with larger correlation lengths in horizontal directions see e g rubin 2003 we utilized the following axisymmetric autocorrelation function 8 ρ y r e r r r 1 2 r 2 2 i 2 r 3 3 i v 2 where i and iv are the horizontal and vertical integral scales respectively and r indicates the normalized dimensionless separation distance as a consequence of y randomness both the hydraulic head h and the specific discharge q are rsfs with their statistics depending on those of y it has been shown that this model is unable to reproduce organized patterns of hydrofacies as observed in two dimensional images from outcrops and a number of alternative models have been proposed to overcome this limitation see e g desbarats 1990 gómez hernández and wen 1998 zinn and harvey 2003 knudby and carrera 2005 bayer et al 2015 di dato et al 2016 riva et al 2017 since our objective here is not to reproduce as close as possible hydrogeologic characteristics of a particular site rather to investigate the effect of features that cannot be reproduced by the second order statistics we addressed the problem with a heuristic perspective following the approach by zinn and harvey 2003 in particular we considered different logconductivity fields sharing the second order moments and integral scales but different connectivity patterns the starting point is the widely employed mvn field for which independent realizations of y are generated at the nodes of a computational grid by using hydro gen an optimized sequential random generator developed by bellin and rubin 1996 successively the mvn field was transformed into two new fields one with connected high hydraulic conductivities hereinafter denoted as conn and the other with connected low hydraulic conductivity for simplicity hereafter we refer to the latter as disconnected field disc since the high conductivity regions that in the former model are connected in the latter are disconnected we refer to the paper by zinn and harvey 2003 for details concerning the procedure used for transforming the mvn field we remark that both the connected and disconnected fields represent rather extreme cases of spatial variability of y sharing the same second order description i e same mean variance and autocovariance function of the generating mvn field however this is instrumental to our objective of testing bounds for the btcs occurring in such media the overall approach is therefore similar to that performed by janković et al 2017 for transport in mean uniform flow the fourth model is characterized by a pieceways varying hydraulic conductivity field which is obtained by dividing the domain into blocks of dimensions equal to twice the integral scales in each direction and assigning to them a constant homogeneous hydraulic logconductivity extracted from a gaussian distribution with mean y and variance σ y 2 the resulting field hereafter called block is characterized by a linear covariance function with integral scales i and iv in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively furthermore any partition of y in classes gives rise to the same degree of connectivity for all the classes this model of spatial variability has been adopted in a number of works dealing with highly heterogeneous formations see e g dagan et al 2003 fiori et al 2006 cvetković et al 2014 janković et al 2017 summarizing the four models adopted here i e mvn conn disc and block allow us to testing different connectivity patterns with similar second order statistical properties and determine their influence on transport in non uniform flows toward a pumping well we shall carry out such tests through accurate numerical simulations as described in section 3 2 3 2 numerical simulations of flow and transport the analysis of the impact of hydraulic conductivity structure on the btc at the extraction well is performed by means of detailed numerical simulations which serve also as a benchmark for the analytical solutions available in the literature we consider a computational domain of dimensions 40 i 40 i in the horizontal directions and thickness of w 20 i v which is divided into regular parallelepiped blocks of dimensions equal to 1 8 of the integral scales in all the three main directions thereby resulting in 321 321 161 16 589 601 nodes and 16 384 000 cells the aquifer anisotropy ratio is set to e 0 1 the flow eq 1 is solved by the finite volume scheme of modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the upper and lower boundaries are impermeable while the four outer faces of the domain are of constant head a fully penetrating well placed at the center of the domain is pumping water at the constant discharge qw l 3 t 1 the well is modeled by a line of vertical cells at the center of the domain with constant piezometric head lower than the head of the external sides and fixed in such a way that the discharge at the well is qw transport is simulated by particle tracking through the procedure outlined in appendix a under the ergodic assumption the btc can be computed as the cumulative density function cdf of travel times at the pumping well in order to increase the sampling of available information in each simulation the injected mass is discretized into 1548 particles distributed uniformly within 12 line sources placed at a distance r from the well and separated by an angle of π 6 each vertical line receives 129 particles distributed uniformly between the depths of 2 iv and 18 iv for a total length of 16 iv such as to avoid boundary effects by the horizontal impervious planes delimiting the computational domain in the vertical direction the vertical lines are distributed along circles with radius equal to r 5 i 10 i and 15 i in order to explore the effect of the distance from the well on the btc we highlight that the conceptual model is the one showed in fig 1 with a single injection well therefore the only scope of using 12 vertical lines is to reduce the number of monte carlo realizations needed to achieve convergence since we are interested in comparing btcs obtained for flux proportional injection each particle s travel time is subsequently weighted according to eq 7 the flux of information in input and output of modflow is managed by a python script that uses flopy bakker et al 2016 flow and transport equations are solved in their dimensionless form with the length and temporal scales equal to i and πnwi 2 qw respectively consequently denoting with the prime the correspondent dimensionless quantities the dimensionless discharge is set to q w π n w with w 20 the dimensionless aquifer thickness simulations are conducted for three levels of heterogeneity σ y 2 0 5 2 0 and 8 0 the effect of pore scale dispersion on the btc curve is parametrized by means of the transverse péclet number p e i v α d i e α d which is the key parameter for assessing the impact of local scale dispersion on macrodispersivity see e g fiori 1996 since in most sedimentary formations i v o 10 1 m and α d o 10 4 m a typical order of magnitude for péclet is p e o 10 3 or larger in order to explore a wide range of variability we consider two rather extreme conditions purely advective transport i e pe at one hand and a rather large local dispersion i e p e 100 on the other molecular diffusion assumes importance in controlling the release of solute from low conductive zone where water velocity is typically very low or stagnant labolle and fogg 2001 the occurrence of zones with very low hydraulic conductivity is more frequent in highly heterogeneous formations where the contrast in the hydraulic conductivity may be very large in the present work molecular diffusion is parametrized through the following diffusive péclet number p e m q w π n w d m in the simulations pem is set to 105 a value which is in line with observations as discussed in grathwohl 2012 finally flow and transport are performed on 1000 monte carlo realizations which allow to obtain reliable estimates of the ensemble btc tests have been made to verify that both the number of monte carlo runs and the number of particles injected in each realization suffice to achieve statistical convergence 4 available approximated solutions first order approximation and mimsca exact analytical solutions are unfortunately not available for the problem of transport in non uniform flow toward a pumping well we consider here two approximate solutions that have been proposed in the past the first order approximation foa and mimsca the latter acronym indicating the combination of the multi indicator model mim of spatial variability and the self consistent approximation sca employed to solve the flow field dagan et al 2003 fiori et al 2006 cvetković et al 2014 which was conceived for mean uniform flow a solution of radial flow and transport in heterogeneous formations based on foa was proposed by lessoff and indelman 2004 and later by indelman et al 2006 under the following simplifying assumptions i the formation is weakly heterogeneous σ y 2 1 0 with logconductivity normally distributed and correlated in space according to the exponential axisymmetric autocorrelation function 8 ii rw i i e the radius of the well is much smaller than the horizontal integral scale such that the well can be represented as a vertical line iii the well is fully penetrating the aquifer which is unbounded in the horizontal direction and w iv such that ergodic conditions can be invoked under this condition the thickness w is immaterial and the domain can be considered indefinite in all the three coordinate directions iv the formation is highly anisotropic i e e i v i 0 2 and pore scale dispersion is neglected i e p e i v α d under such conditions the cdf of the travel time which for an instantaneous injection coincides with the btc at the extraction well assumes the following expression indelman et al 2006 9 m f o a τ r 1 2 1 erf ln τ r τ r ξ 2 2 ξ where erf indicates the error function and ξ σ τ r τ r c v τ is the coefficient of variation of the travel time notice that because of the hypothesis that w w i v transport is ergodic and travel time moments are the same for all the vertical lines at the horizontal distance r from the well indelman et al 2006 accordingly the mean travel time τ is equal to 10 τ r π n w q w r 2 while the travel time variance σ τ 2 is given by lessoff and indelman 2004 11 σ τ 2 r σ y 2 π n w i 2 q w 2 4 3 6 3 r i 2 2 r i 3 8 exp r i 1 r i we refer to the papers by lessoff and indelman 2004 and indelman et al 2006 for additional details on the derivation of expressions 10 and 11 the weakly heterogeneity assumption which characterizes the above solution may be removed by using mimsca with the corresponding model for radial transport developed in a recent paper by di dato et al 2017 such a solution is formally not limited to low values of σ y 2 as foa is transport is approximately solved by means of the travel time approach obtaining a semi analytical solution which is fully described in di dato et al 2017 and is not repeated here for the sake of brevity however we highlight that they observed an excellent agreement of their solution against both numerical simulations and the laboratory experiment of fernàndez garcia et al 2004 the core of the solution is a localization of the non uniform flow which is formally valid for slowly varying flows in space on the other hand the foa is free from such assumption although it is formally valid for weakly heterogeneous formations 5 results and discussion we begin with illustrating the first two moments of the btc namely the mean and variance of travel time fig 2 shows the mean travel time τ and the travel time variance σ τ 2 for the four conductivity structures described in section 3 1 i e mvn conn disc and block and for different degrees of medium heterogeneity described by the logconductivity variance σ y 2 from low to high heterogeneity σ y 2 0 5 2 0 and 8 0 the impact of the transverse pe is also considered with the two bounds p e and p e 100 as described in section 3 2 the moments are calculated for two different distances of the injection well from the pumping one r 5 i and r 15 i the same travel time moments obtained by the foa for the same parameters are also represented with continuous lines the moments by mimsca are very close to foa and for the sake of clarity are not reproduced in this figure the results indicate that in most cases the average travel time is independent of the hydraulic conductivity structure and the péclet number and that the foa 10 provides an excellent approximation such a solution is likely exact in the absence of local scale dispersion and for flux proportional injection mode and this is in agreement with what shown by fiori et al 2015b for mean uniform flow the deviations for p e 100 from solution 10 are more systematic and show that the effect of local scale dispersion is to increase the mean travel time although this happens only when both heterogeneity and injection well distance are large still we remind that in any case the selected p e 100 is quite small if compared with the typical values observed in the field and is employed here with the only objective of identifying an end member the increase of τ with pe can be explained as follows zones of connected fast preferential flow and zones of disconnected slow flow emerge when heterogeneity is significant see e g fiori et al 2006 local scale dispersion transfers solute preferentially from the fast zones to the slow ones because of the proportionality of the local dispersion coefficient with the local velocity eq 4 where d m is generally small such a mechanism induces an overall slow down of the plume and a consequent increase of the mean travel time to the pumping well a similar mechanism was identified by pedretti and fiori 2013 once again this feature manifests only when σ y 2 is large and pe is small much smaller than the value typically observed in most formations therefore for most reasonable applications we highlight that the analytical solution 10 is good enough for characterizing the mean solute arrival τ from the injection to the pumping well the impact of conductivity structure on travel time variance σ τ 2 is slightly more evident see fig 2 right panels especially for high σ y 2 and low pe deviations from the foa solution continuous lines are more pronounced for the disc and block structures for such cases the impact of pe is also relevant although we remind again the low value adopted for pe in the present simulations the increase of σ τ 2 with decreasing péclet can be explained with the same mechanism previously discussed local scale dispersion preferentially transfers solute from the fast zones to the slow ones leading to a broadening of the travel time pdf for high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 the role of conductivity structure becomes more evident especially with the increasing of distance r from the extraction well still the relative impact of the structure on the moments is much below the expectations considering the widely different connectivity structure of the four models in most cases the foa solution 11 is a reasonable approximation of the travel time variance notice that at high heterogeneity the travel time variance just like macrodispersion is a poor descriptor of solute spreading since it is strongly influenced by the btc tail see also the discussion in fiori et al 2006 thus a more pertinent comparison among solutions is performed by the analysis of the whole btc which is the quantity of interest here and that shall be examined in the following fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves btcs at the well for purely advective transport p e and a few values of the logconductivity variance σ y 2 as a function of the conductivity structure and the injection distance r the foa and mimsca models are also represented black lines dashed and dotted respectively for low to moderate heterogeneity i e up to σ y 2 2 0 the conductivity structure does not affect much the btc shape which is also well described by the analytical solutions we also notice that foa and mimsca are very close and both provide a very good approximation of the numerical btcs thus the robustness of foa and the similarity of all btcs regardless of the particular y structure adopted confirms the universal transport behavior already observed by janković et al 2017 for transport in mean uniform flows the above finding stays also for the strongest heterogeneous system analyzed here i e σ y 2 8 0 perhaps with the only exception of the disconnected field which exhibits a higher spreading with respect to the other cases consistently with what previously observed for the variance for the other cases all btcs look quite similar again the result is quite surprising standing the significant differences in connectivity among the four structures adopted the numerical btcs are fairly well represented by the analytical models and foa in particular that in most of the cases resembles well the mvn results such a finding is interesting considering the simplicity of the foa solution and suggests that a high order statistical characterization of y unfeasible in most applications may not be necessary to capture the main features of the btc for the flow system under consideration very similar results and conclusions were drawn for the case of transport in mean uniform flow janković et al 2017 mimsca also performs reasonably well but less than foa the reason is likely the particular implementation of mimsca by di dato et al 2017 that assumed local uniformity of flow in order to reach a solvable problem such a limitation which can be significant for non uniform flows like the one considered here may be overcome in future works e g along the lines traced by severino 2018 the impact of local dispersion is represented in fig 4 for the same cases of fig 3 and p e 100 as expected local scale dispersion exerts a negligible impact for small to moderate heterogeneity the effect of péclet is visible for σ y 2 8 0 and manifests in a more dispersed btc for the reasons illustrated previously the differences in the btcs are in any case quite small the striking result shown in figs 3 and 4 is that in all cases including σ y 2 8 0 the foa solution provides a reasonable prediction of the btc for all the scenarios perhaps with the sole exception of the disc case results can be further inspected through the quantiles of mass distribution that provide a measure of the btc behavior in the following we analyze a few characteristic travel time quantiles τ 05 τ 50 and τ 95 which correspond to the time required to recover the 5 50 and 95 of the mass respectively such values indicate respectively the early arrivals due to fast preferential flow the time arrival of the bulk of the solute mass and the time pertaining the late solute arrivals the results are depicted in fig 5 we start with the early arrivals described by the quantile τ 05 which is a key parameter to determine the aquifer channeling knudby and carrera 2005 and to design waste disposal sites rasmuson and neretnieks 1986 lanz et al 1998 as shown in the first column of fig 5 the conductivity structure exerts a relatively modest effect on the early arrivals for small to moderate heterogeneity noticeable differences are observed only for injection at large distances from the pumping well i e r 15 i in our examples and high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 curiously τ 05 for the disconnected case is smaller than that for the connected field such a counterintuitive result is explained by the strong effect of the injection model flux proportional and can be also observed in janković et al 2017 figure 3 as a matter of fact the effect of connectivity of k on transport is filtered by flow and flux proportional injection mode thus high conductivity zones even if disconnected receive proportionally more mass than the low conductivity zone thereby increasing the fraction of the mass that arrives early at the well the relevance of the injection condition on the early arrivals was also observed by di dato et al 2017 who analyzed both resident and flux proportional conditions together with the general behavior of the btcs this result confirms that connectivity is a flow and transport related feature and structural connectivity in terms of the k field is not a sufficient condition for assessing preferential flow similar arguments were brought by fiori et al 2006 the effect of pe on τ 05 is quite limited with the ratio between the minimum and the maximum values of the quantile observed in the realizations τ 05 min τ 05 max being 0 799 and 0 811 for p e 100 and pe respectively when σ y 2 2 and r 15 i at high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 the ratio reduces to 0 613 and 0 673 for p e 100 and pe respectively it is thus confirmed that pe does not impact much the early arrivals also for high heterogeneity the quantile τ 50 is an indicator of the timing of the bulk of contaminant and consequently it is a crucial parameter to assess risk exposure de barros and rubin 2008 tartakovsky 2013 the structure of the conductivity field exerts a very limited impact on τ 50 also for high heterogeneity for injection at a distance r 15 i from the well and σ y 2 2 0 the ratio τ 50 m i n τ 50 m a x 0 914 for both pes as σ y 2 increases to 8 0 the ratio reduces to τ 50 m i n τ 50 m a x 0 714 and 0 804 for p e 100 and pe respectively such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the quantile widens these results agree well with the experimental results of molinari et al 2015 who observed a poor impact of connectivity on the btc center of mass finally τ 95 quantifies the late arrivals which can be assumed as a parameter to quantify the effectiveness of a remediation activity berglund 1997 de barros et al 2013 as shown in the third column of fig 5 the numerical values of τ 95 for the four structures match quite well their analytical counterparts for σ y 2 2 0 the ratio between the minimum and the maximum residence times is τ 95 m i n τ 95 m a x 0 923 for p e 100 and 0 907 for pe the agreement with the analytical solution is less good for high heterogeneity but still acceptable as an estimation of the time needed to remediate a contaminated aquifer in particular at the highest variance σ y 2 8 0 τ 95 m i n τ 95 m a x 0 746 and 0 725 for p e 100 and pe respectively notice that τ 95 is smaller for connected field such reduction is due to channelization of high conductivity lenses as also observed by zinn and harvey 2003 and fiori et al 2017 altogether the differences of quantiles among the different models that we remind represent quite different and extreme scenarios of spatial connectivity is not much significant especially in view of applications the most significant differences are for r 15 i that is a quite large distance for the typical applications considering that horizontal integral scales are of the order of a few meters rubin 2003 table 2 1 pg 34 furthermore the foa model generally represents quite well the quantiles even for cases σ y 2 1 0 beyond the supposed range of validity of the model the reasons for such good performance are not entirely clear and deserve further investigation 6 summary and conclusion we investigate the impact of conductivity structure on radial transport such a topic has been analyzed in the past for uniform transport however to the best of our knowledge none has addressed the role of three dimensional conductivity structure on transport towards a pumping well the problem is of paramount importance in a series of applications like e g the aquifer remediation the design of hydraulic containment systems and the aquifer characterization by convergent tracer tests in order to accomplish such a purpose we performed a series of targeted numerical simulations of flow and transport in a heterogeneous converging flow we considered four structures of the hydraulic logconductivity y a multi variate normal field a structure made by regular blocks of constant k a connected and a disconnected field along the approach by zinn and harvey 2003 such fields were generated with the same two point statistics i e sharing the same logconductivity variance σ y 2 and the same integral scales i and iv but with different higher order correlations of conductivity hence displaying widely different degrees of connectivity for each class of conductivity the choice of the four structures is such to explore different connected fields in order to provide a wide range of possible k scenarios transport of conservative solute is described by the breakthrough curve btc detected at the pumping well after instantaneous injection of solute at a well at distance r from the pumping one the btc depends on a few key parameters that are discussed here such as the heterogeneity degree described by the logconductivity variance σ y 2 the distance from the well r and the local scale dispersion epitomized by the péclet number pe the numerical results are compared to two approximate analytical solutions the results show that the btcs pertaining to the different structures and scenarios under examination are quite similar besides the visual inspection of the curves comparison was made through the first two moments of the btc i e the mean and variance of the travel time and the quantiles pertaining to the fractions 5 50 and 95 of the cumulated mass at the pumping well such quantiles that represent the early the average and the late arrivals respectively are important for applications like risk assessment and remediation for all cases the resulting btcs were close one to each other also considering the rather extreme scenarios adopted for the conductivity structures and the péclet numbers in particular the k structure does not seem to influence significantly transport behavior especially for low and mild heterogeneity i e σ y 2 2 0 for high heterogeneity σ y 2 8 0 the impact of the higher order statistics on the btc is more appreciable but differences are still small in view of applications also numerical simulations show that local scale dispersivity is negligible for low heterogeneity thereby corroborating the pure advection approximation for transport in low heterogeneous media conversely local scale dispersion plays a more important role at high heterogeneity especially on late arrivals although the péclet number required to observe such differences is rather small of the order of 102 than expected in applications hence high order statistics of k which are impossible to infer from the field with the current technology do not seem to influence much the btc in the case of transport in convergent flow fields the relative closeness of results found here is particularly relevant also in view of the known difficulties and uncertainties in detecting the btc and the inference of the relevant hydraulic parameters like e g σ y 2 or i from field data moreover our study indicates that approximate analytical solutions like the one based on the first order approximation foa lessoff and indelman 2004 indelman et al 2006 and the multi indicator model self consistent approximation mimsca applied to radial transport di dato et al 2017 yield to an acceptable approximation of numerical results all the limitations notwithstanding even for conditions outside the presumed range of validity of the solutions foa is particularly effective for a broad range of scenarios being also very simple to apply with its closed form analytical solution given its easiness of use foa is an efficient tool to infer aquifer properties under the form of model s parameters i e σ y 2 i and e from convergent tracer tests which have been shown to be a reliable field test e g bellin and rubin 2004 zhou et al 2014 zech et al 2018 in addition foa may also serve as a first screening tool providing preliminary yet reliable results as function of a few physically based parameters prior to more complex transport models thus from a practical perspective two point statistics may be enough to fully characterize the hydraulic conductivity structure for transport prediction in convergent radial flow this is an encouraging result given that a detailed description of aquifer structure is prohibitive if not impossible mainly due to data scarcity and high costs associated to monitoring campaign ptak et al 2004 hence a second order statistical characterization of hydraulic conductivity involving quantities like σ y 2 i and e may indeed provide the basic information to adequately infer the btc in the flow conditions examined here we recognize however that the inference of two point statistical parameters like e g the logconductivity variance and the directional integral scales is still in most cases a difficult and expensive task requiring a large number of measurements the previously suggested aquifer characterization through a convergent tracer test employing foa formula may help in alleviating the efforts and costs associated to the second order characterization acknowledgements ab and af

velocity field that satisfies mass conservation expressed by the flow eq 1 coupled with the darcy s eq 2 in a comprehensive review of the random walk particle tracking methods rwpt salamon et al 2006 showed that interpolation of velocity field provides results in agreement with other techniques such as the reflection method uffink 1985 or the integration of the general stochastic differential equation labolle et al 2000 here we modified the algorithm of pollock 1988 which is based on a linear interpolation of flux at the boundaries of the computational cells to include local dispersion and diffusion in a similar manner of zinn and harvey 2003 we first compute the time the particle would spend to reach the cell s boundary in the absence of local dispersion and diffusion then this time is used to compute the diffusive jump of the last right hand term of eq a 1 we verified the accuracy of this scheme against the analytical solution of moench 1989 valid for convergent radial dispersion in homogeneous media obtaining a very good match

is often purposely isolated by artificial clogging colmation from the conveyed water in order to forestall seepage losses water logging of adjacent land and secondary salinization in our paper we study exchange fluxes between the pore water in an aquifer and free water body in a river the focus is on an early post flash flood phase when the river stage drops in hours while the banks are saturated with pore water i e the stream is purely gaining the question is how much does a clogging layer impede inflow into the stream through the bed and banks this is especially important for alluvial wadi aquifers maliva and missimer 2012 where in case of a strong impedance the pore water instead of feeding the stream can be lost to the regional aquifer via deep vertical percolation groundwater hydrologists working with a catchment subcatchment scale models of aquifers have usually a limited information on hydraulic properties of the clogged river bed consequently the cross flow interaction stream aquifer being the crux of the problem as emphasized by ebel et al 2009 is commonly simplified via the so called conductance α of a construed hydraulic skin hereafter we will model a clogged zone as a cake usually the cake has much lower permeability than the adjacent subjacent aquifer the α coefficient depends on the ratio of hydraulic conductivities of the cake aquifer dyad and

drops or rises then the near field flow the vicinity of the cake aquifer interface bc in fig 1 a is usually not scrutinized viz the intricate variation of h a and specific discharge vectors along bc are not counted in the lump models of aquifer stream conjugation in this paper we use the toth 2009 potential model of essentially 2 d seepage and hydrus based solution to boundary value problems for richards equation aquifer s drainage into a clogged stream is controlled by a falling phreatic surface which outcrops at what is the robin boundary bc fig 1 a in analytical models we consider streams with vertical banks figs 2 a and 7 a and shallow streams fig 4 a the cakes have constant b and kc we also zoom in the cake fig 7 a and study early seepage there such that the piezometric head h c x y t is also a harmonic function in a liminal saturated rectangle a seepage face h c 0 y 0 y and constant head boundary conditions are met along a vertical outlet side of this tothian unit basin we assume darcian flows and ignore the compressibility of both groundwater and porous skeleton such that h a x y t h c x y t obey laplace s and ricahrds equations in the analytical and numerical models respectively in order to obtain explicit analytical solutions we engage the lembke model of a sequence of steady states polubarinova kochina 1962 1977 hereafter abbreviated as pk 77 by assuming that the water table is a falling horizontal surface then at each time instance t n t n 1 2 3 the flow domain gz t is a polygon viz a half strip in fig 2 a and a half plane in fig 4 a the bvp for h a x y t with the robin boundary conditions along a vertical segment bc in fig 2 a horizontal segment clbbcr in fig 4 a is solved as in morris 2003 and yakimov and kacimov 2017 two seepage domains are considered in our paper section 2 a shallow bedrock and vertical cake spanning through the whole aquifer fig 2 a shows only the right bank of the river section 3 a broad river fig 4 a and c of a relatively large l s d with a deep bedrock and horizontal cake in a nutshell we answer the question what are the impacts of the river size stage and contrast in conductivity of the cake and aquifer on darcian flows 2 analytical solution for vertical riverbank shallow bedrock in sections 2 and 3 we ignore capillarity of the soil and vadose zone above the water table although the analytical models are restricted to homogeneous isotropic aquifers of simplified geometry half strip half plane and assume only 2 d flows under special initial and boundary conditions they serve as benchmarks for numerical simulations and can be used by hydrologists for back of an envelope assessments prior to embarking on modflow feflow hydrus and other packages in the analytical model the piezometric head and darcian velocity vector v u v see fig 2 a in the aquifer obey the laplace equation and darcy s law 1 δ h a x y t 0 v x y t k a h a and u v are the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity point a in fig 2 a is fiducial i e h a a a velocity is zero at this point the head and stream function to be introduced later at point b in fig 2 a are apriori unknown we assume that at t 0 the water level in the river h s coincided with the water table a 0 therefore the phreatic surface in the aquifer the ray c 0 ra 0 was at the same horizon as the in cake phreatic surface the segment c 0 rc 0 l fig 2 a at t 0 the stream stage suddenly drops to the level h s 0 h 0 such situation can emerge in ephemeral and intermittent streams where a descending limb of a flash flood hydrograph is a steep curve consequently after a heavy rain the wadi aquifer see maliva and missimer 2012 is quickly saturated and when the flood wave in the wadi has gone starts feeding the wadi as baseflow at t 0 drawdown in the porous body commences the ray c 0 a 0 in fig 2 a transforms into a curve caaa which is described by the saturated thickness f a x t counted from the bedrock in the cake the curve cace outcrops on a seepage face cecs on the bank slope if h 0 is not drastically different from a 0 the seepage analysis in the cake i e at x 0 in fig 2 a is ignored then seepage in the aquifer only x 0 in fig 2 a is studied with the following robin boundary condition along bca 2 k a h a 0 y t x k c h a 0 y t h 0 b which is also called the first order exchange term see eq 6 in ebel et al 2009 who stated currently the inability to directly estimate the parameters that control the surface subsurface exchange in the first order exchange coefficient method has made universal application of the concept problematic in certain situations of surface water and groundwater interaction obviously from eq 2 α kc kab the ratio kc b is called leakance see e g wiese and nützmann 2009 we follow lembke see pk 77 and assume that at t t 3 f a x t a 0 where t is a small increment which quantifies marching forward in time if bca in fig 2 a is not clogged f a x t is highly curved near point ca especially at small t see pk 77 the cake smoothens the slope of the free boundary near bca therefore a flat approximation of the curve caaa by a falling ray ca according to eq 3 is reasonable we will describe later how the drawdown of the water table is modelled at aliquots t 2t 3t the common condition of isobaricity of the water table becomes 4 h a x a 0 t a 0 obviously along the bedrock we have a no flow condition 5 h a x 0 t y 0 thus at t t the flow domain is a half strip gz which we consider as a stroboscopic time shrinking unit basin of toth 2009 seepage there is gravity driven but impeded by clogging of bc we recall that toth studied steady 2 d flows driven by topography i e he assumed the ground surface coinciding with the water table to make flow problems amenable to analytical description toth used simple fixed polygons trapezia and rectangles as unit basins which approximate real flow domains capped by phreatic surfaces free boundaries in these polygons harmonic functions of peizometric head and streamfunction can be determined by either separation of variables toth 2009 or by solving bvps for holomorphic functions see e g kacimov and obnosov 2019 we introduce dimensionless quantities kr

conditions the horizontal velocity component u x y and stream function are obtained dropped here for the sake of brevity in groundwater flow we need only the upper part of the strip 0 y a in eqs 9 and 10 the bedrock imperviousity condition is fulfilled due to symmetry the hydraulic gradient is 12 v x y u 2 v 2 pk 77 considers the condition v 1 as onset of soil suffusion due to seepage the flow rate from the aquifer into the stream from both banks is an integral 13 q 2 q 2 ε h v x a d x 2 0 a ε v h 0 y d y where the integrands are taken from eqs 11 and 10 see also eq a5 in morris 2003 small constants εν and ε h are selected for avoiding the very vicinity of point c see the corresponding points mr and nr in fig 2 b without the cake point c in fig 2 b becomes a vortex and q is singular i e q when εν 0 ε h 0 below we selected εν ε h 0 01 we used the nintegrate routine of mathematica wolfram 1991 for evaluation of integrals in eq 13 fig 3 a plots h y in vertical sections x 0 100 and 200 for a 500 hd 100 and kr 0 05 fig 3 b shows the contour plots of h x y for the same triad a hd kr fig 3 a and b illustrate that even far away from the stream the piezometric lines do not verticalize because of the imposed tothian constant head condition along the top ray of gz i e flow is not quasi horizontal along the bedrock that is assumed in the dupuit forchheimer theory fig 3 c shows the head hb h 0 0 at point b as a function of kr for a 500 and hd 30 150 and 300 curves 1 3 these curves illustrate that at this corner of gz the head is different from zero and hc hd i e the cross flow through the cake makes flow in the aquifer essentially 2 d therefore we have another example of what strack 1989 p 381 inferred by analytical studies of unclogged rivers modelled by a vertical cut see his fig 5 15a the dupuit forchheimer assumption often is in direct contradiction with the boundary conditions fig 3 d shows the contours of the hydraulic gradient v x y for a 500 hd 100 kr 0 05 the level lines are plotted with an increment of 0 05 from v 0 1 to v 0 45 fig 3 d warns that the gradient drastically increases towards the singularity point c in this zone according to the pk 77 criterion of eq 12 the cake sediments are prone of seepage erosion depending on the direction of seepage across the cake its kc varies usually kc is evaluated to be higher for the case of groundwater upwelling as compared with the in bed orientation of the darcian velocity see e g brunke and gonser 1997 rosenberry and pitlick 2009 fig 3 e presents the distributions v x along the top of gz i e along ac for kr 0 05 three cases of a hd are selected 500 100 450 50 and 410 10 curves 1 3 correspondingly the total flow rate into the river is shown as q kr in fig 3 f for the same dyads as in fig 3 e the curves in fig 3 f manifest that if flow is controlled by a natural silt wall then the gains of water from the aquifer significantly decrease with the contrast in the drop of the cross wall potential hd next we describe the algorithm of involving the transiency of drawdown as t increases we approximate the new position of any point e originally located at aaca distance le from the river by displacing the point vertically down to a distance v le a t ma where v le a we take from eq 11 see also fig 3 e by this we assume that the release drainage of pore water with the drop of the water table is instantaneous specific yield of the aquifer is equal to porosity ma see pk 77 i e there is no delayed yield that is a good approximation for the case of a low capillarity soil therefore the linear average velocity v x a ma factored by a small quantity t gives the shape of the phreatic surface at the first time step viz fa x t a v le a t ma v in eq 11 is negative at the next time step t 2t we again approximate the curve f x 2t by a straight line y a 1 i e we assume that gz 2t is a half strip which shrunk due to dewatering of the aquifer as compared with gz t obviously this drawdown model is not valid at points close to the corner c in fig 2 a that explains why point mr has been introduced how to find a 1 first we use eq 11 and detect the abscissa lm of a point m at which v lm a vm where vm is a given exiguous quantity below we selected vm 0 01 lm is determined by the routine findroot of mathematica on the right of point m in fig 2 a there is almost no drawdown of the phreatic surface at t t the quantity of groundwater qm drained from the aquifer between points mr and m is 14 q m ε h l m v x a d x then according to the method of successive steady states pk 77 the new a 1 and therefore gz 2t is calculated as 15 a 1 q m a m a l m a obviously if the river stage h 0 fig 2 a is kept constant then hd decreases with a with a new a 1 we repeat all computations in comport with eqs 10 15 next we march to a time instance t 3t and so on for example we selected ka 10 m day kc 0 5 m day ma 0 2 b 0 1 m and a 50 m then for a sudden drawdown in the river of h 0 40 m h d 10 m at t 0 01 days the first drawdown at x 10 m is f 10 t 0 27 m the computed value of l m 113 9 m and a 1 50 0 1114 m for the next time step 2t l m 115 m and a 2 a 1 0 1091 m 3 analytical solution for shallow river in this section we assume that the bedrock of fig 1 a is deep the river has a small depth such that it can be approximated by a horizontal cut clbbcr fig 4 a this approximation is common in analytically modelled surface groundwater interaction via horizontal clogged beds kacimov 2007 strack 2017 the interface clbbcr between the cake and aquifer is now a horizontal segment similar to ones in figs 5 5 5 6 5 17 of strack 2017 we analyse only the first time step of the drawdown t t time marching t 2t 3t is analogous to section 2 the piezometric head is counted from an initially horizontal water table at the instance t 0 the river level drops from h s 0 to h s h d we introduce a new dimensionless piezometric head h h a b other dimensionless quantities are the same as in section 2 we define a dimensionless complex physical coordinate z x i y velocity potential φ x y h and stream function ψ x y which is conjugated with φ via the cauchy riemann conditions the complex potential isw φ iψ along the river bed in dimensional heads we have 16 k a h a x 0 y k c h a x 0 h d b l s 2 x l s 2 eq 16 is the robin boundary condition similar to eq 2 along the horizontal rays crar and clal y 0 x l s 2 0 and l s 2 x which are geometrically co levelled with clbbcr the piezometric head in the aquifer h a 0 seepage as in section 2 is induced by a sudden drop of the river head therefore the boundary conditions along the line y 0 which bounds the flow domain gz are 17 c l b c r ϕ x 0 y k r ϕ x 0 k r h d l s 2 x l s 2 a l c l and c r a r ϕ x 0 0 x l s 2 x l s 2 similarly to section 2 at early stages of drainage the water table rays alcl and arcr are approximated as horizontal isobars i e equipotential lines the second line in eq 17 point a infinity is fidicial along the ray bab symmetry line the stream function is ψ 0 at point cr ψ q the complex potential domain gw is sketched in fig 4 b the curve clbbcr there is unknown we map gz onto the upper half plane gζ of a reference variable ζ ξ iη fig 5 with the correspondence of points cr b cl 1 0 1 a by the function 18 ζ z 2 z l s as in yakimov and kacimov 2017 we assume that along clbbcr the velocity potential is 19 ϕ φ ξ φ 1 0 φ ξ φ ξ 1 ξ 1 where φ ξ is a symmetric function to be found similarly to section 2 the value φ b see fig 4 b is of a special interest because it reflects the drop of the piezometric head from the edges towards the center of clbbcr thus from eq 19 the complex potential holomorphic function w ζ is to be found based on the dirichlet boundary conditions 20 ϕ φ ξ 1 ξ 1 ϕ 0 ξ 1 solution to bvp 20 is given see pk 77 by the following cauchy integral 21 w ζ i π 1 1 φ θ θ ζ d θ where we took into account that ψ 0 we use the sokhotskii formula and from eq 21 obtain 22 ψ ξ 1 π 1 1 φ θ θ ξ d θ 1 ξ 1 the function f ξ is continuous and can be expanded into a series of the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind see e g kacimov 2006 23 ϕ ξ k 1 b k u k ξ u k sin k arccos ξ 1 ξ 1 these polynomials make a complete orthonormal set obviously only the odd terms are retained in the series to ensure the flow symmetry we put eq 23 as an integrand of eq 22 and get a series of the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind 24 ψ ξ k 1 b k t k ξ t k cos k arccos ξ 1 ξ 1 now we use the cauchy riemann relation and rewrite the first robin s boundary condition of eq 17 as 25 e ξ d ψ ξ d ξ d ξ d x k r ϕ ξ k r h d 0 1 ξ 1 where dξ dx 2 ls from eq 18 we differentiate eq 24 and put it into eq 25 along with the series 23 that yields 26 2 k 1 k b k u k ξ l s 1 ξ 2 k r k 1 b k u k ξ k r h d 1 ξ 1 in order to find the coefficients bk in eq 26 we use the collocation method and select consequently j 1 3 5 points on the interval 1 ξ 1 we use the middle collocation point ξ 0 for j 1 retain only one term in eq 26 and immediately find b 1 1 next we use the same middle point and add two points ξ 1 2 for j 3 next the collocation points are ξ 0 0 25 0 75 for j 5 and so on correspondingly we truncate the series in eq 26 and get systems of linear equations with respect to b 1 3 b 3 3 b 1 5 b 3 5 b 5 5 and so on the systems are solved and the results are presented in table 1 for ls 100 kr 0

comparisons with hydrus numerical simualtions solutions in sections 2 and 3 ignored the unsaturated capillarity affected zone above caaa in figs 2 and 4 and heterogeneity of the aquifer in this section we use hydrus2d šimůnek et al 2016 which numerically solves a transient 2 d richards equation for saturated unsaturated soils first we compare the analytical results of section 2 with hydrus simulations for this purpose we selected a domain consisting of two adjacent rectangles an aquifer bc 0 rahdhb of sizes 200 200cm and a thin cake bc 0 rc 0 lbeb of sizes 5 200cm the properties of these two van genucten s vg soils are retrieved from the hydrus soil catalogue sand and clay have ka 8 25 10 3 cm s and kc 5 56 10 5 cm s respectively the mesh elements were 2 5 cm that made 10 318 nodes 404 1 d elements 20 310 2 d elements 324 boundary mesh nodes and elements we used default hydrus options for the number of iterations 10 and tolerance in pressure head p 1 cm the piezometric head is h p y where we keep the y notation for the vertical coordinate as in fig 2 hydrus uses h as a notation for the pressure head a hydrostatic pressure head distribution in both hydrus adjacent rectangles was selected as an initial condition the boundary conditions were no flow along bebdh dhah and c 0 rc 0 l p 0 along ahc 0 r seepage face condition along c 0 rcs and a hydrostatic pressure along becs we selected cs to be at 100 cm above the impermeable bottom bebdh that corresponds to a sudden drop of the river level from 200 cm to 100 cm i e in notations of section 2 a 200 cm b 5 cm h 0 h d 100 cm fig 2 the simulation time was 60 s an early stage of drainage of an initially horizontal water table fig 7 shows coloured maps of pressure head p x y a streamlines b and v x y c in fig 7 c the upper contour corresponds to v 0 0011 cm s and along the lowest curve v 0 00011 cm s i e the vertical component of velocity drops an order of magnitude from the top to the bottom of the aquifer integration of hydrus obtained v x along the upper face of the rectangle y 200 cm gives q 0 16 cm2 s analytical eq 13 for a 40 hd 20 converted to dimensional quantities gives q 0 19 cm2 s now we compare the analytical and numerical piezometric heads along bc in fig 2 a this comparison will show the closeness of this key flow characteristic computed by two different governing equations in a half strip analytical solution and finite rectangle hydrus the pressure head distribution along the interface bc 0 r x 0 in fig 2 see also fig 7 d was retrieved from the analytical solution in section 2 for the selected set of hydrus dimensional quantities we plotted the analytical curve h a y h y b h 0 where h y is given by eq 10 and kr 0 0067 for this pair of vg soils the analytical piezometric head h y where y is now the hydrus vertical coordinate is shown in fig 7 e as curve 1 the numerical curve p 0 y in fig 7 d is wiggling and we selected hydrus p values at each 10 cm in y and used the listplot routine of mathematica to get a smoothened numerical piezometric head h y p 0 y y it is shown as curve 2 in fig 7 e curves 1 and 2 are close to each other both curves show how h y varies along the vertical segment x 0 0 y 100 cm we note that hydrus takes into account a seepage face while the analytical solutions does not qualitatively both models show that h y variation are mild close to point b in fig 2 and large close to point c fig 8 presents hydrus results for a vertical clogged river bank with the same parameters as in fig 7 except aquifer s homogeneity in fig 8 a sandy domain at x 0 has a thin loamy horizontal stratum 5 y 5 cm there is no analytical solution for this layered aquifer fig 8 a depicts a horizontal component u x y of the darcian velocity vector and fig 8 b illustrates a coloured map of hydrus2d streamlines comparison of figs 7 and 8 evidences that heterogeneity of the aquifer significantly alters the flow topology unfortunately analytical solutions for transient regimes in stratified aquifers with a vertical clogging cake at the outlet boundary are not available and therefore numerical models are indispensable next for comparisons with analytical results in section 3 we considered a hydrus sextagon gedbificig fig 4 c sketches a left half of the flow domain in fig 4 a with the following sizes ge 200 cm ed 210 cm h 0 20 cm a cake of thickness b 10 cm is made as another sextagon clcifibibfcl shaded in fig 4c the aquifer and cake are composed of the vg loam and clay at t 0 groundwater and the river water are at homeostasis i e the pressure head is hydrostatic at t 0 the river level drops from ci to ui i e by hd and groundwater starts seeping into the river the boundary conditions are no flow across ge ed clci and dbbr along uifibi the pressure head is hydrostatic along ciui we impose the seepage face condition along gcl we assume now the no flow boundary condition which models drainage at any not only small t we refined the hydrus mesh size near the lines gcifibi and simulated drainage of groundwater for 60 s fig 9 assuming that at t 0 the river suddenly becomes empty i e in fig 4 c h 0 0 fig 9 a shows isobars sandwiching the phreatic surface p 0 fig 9 b plots the distribution of the vertical component v x y of the darcian velocity the distribution of v along gci is shown in fig 9 c fig 9 d illustrates the streamlines we also determined the distributions v x along fibi and u y along fici after that we evaluated a dimensionless flow rate defined is section 3 the hydrus value was q 0 47 analytical solution for this kr 0 0067 and l 240 cm gave q 0 3 5 concluding remarks drawdown in an unconfined aquifer with a phreatic surface which mildly slopes towards a silt clogged river bank a thin cake of a constant thickness and permeability is analysed as a sequence of approximations of the flow domain modelled by shrinking half strips the cake is approximated as an interface a line along which the robin boundary condition holds this condition unlike the dirichlet or neuman ones in boundary value problems for lapalce s equation is most often not amenable to conformal mappings of two domains of common characteristics holomorphic functions the complex potential hodograph verigin and zhukovskii s functions see pk77 we used the morris 2003 analytical solution in a half strip with the robin boundary condition on one side vertical clogged river bank comparisons of this solution with numerical simulations in hydrus2d that illustrated a reasonably good match of the exchange flux between the aquifer and river as well as of the piezometric head variation along the vertical interface between the aquifer and cake we also plotted streamlines isotachs and isobars which illustrate that the dupuit forchheimer assumption of a prevalently horizontal flow is not valid for the considered scenarios of a sudden drawdown of water level in the river into which an originally static groundwater is drained with the cake impedance to answer the above raised question on the degree of impedance caused by the cake on groundwater river exchange we refer to the case in fig 7 comparably modelled analytically and numerically if we assume that the river reach is 100 m then the total quantity of groundwater seeping in one minute through one bank of this river fig 2 a will be about 0 1 m3 hydrus predicts that the hydraulic gradient along the aquifer cake interface for the adjacent rectangles in fig 7 will be less than 0 2 at the modelled time of 60 s after the drawdown of the river level to half of its original value in other words the flow scenario in fig 7 is beyond the pk 77 threshold of seepage induced erosion the problems involving the robin boundary condition for an analytic function require solution of hypersingular integral equations like in capobianco and criscuolo 2016 which has been introduced by prandtl in aerodynamics of thin airfoils we solved this equation by the trefftz method see liu 2007 yakimov and kacimov 2017 for the case of a shallow river with a horizontal clogged bed i e for the case of a half plane as a flow domain where the piezometric head is a harmonic function analytical solutions to problems involving the robin boundary condition can be also applied to the case of a variable water level h s t in a river a t marching algorithm similar to one in section 2 can involve drawup of the river water level at x 0 in fig 1 a then river starts loosing water into the cake like in gianni et al 2016 if the drawup is long enough then water seeps from the cake into the aquifer provided the inequality h s t a t holds the trefftz procedure used in section 3 can be easily extended to other river geometries e g to a deep and narrow river modelled as a vertical cut in this case only the mapping function 18 will be changed zooming of 2 d seepage near the interface bc in fig 1 a can explain colmation and suffusion for example thinning of river s cake near point c in fig 2 a that may be related to experimentally confirmed see e g datry et al 2015 variation of the cake properties with the direction magnitude of the darcian velocity near bc in groundwater modelling one often only alludes a constant α without adducing field measurements hydrobiologists and hydrologists working with the hyporheic zone have collected good experimental data on kc texture and porosity of clogged river lake beds all varying with n and sr in fig 1 b these data and experience would be good to upscale interface in groundwater flow transport numerical codes experimental laboratory or field techniques to evaluate α can be connected to routine mathematical solutions of inverse problems history matching there is analogy of darcian flows studied in this paper with ones in well hydraulics where the skin of groundwater wells can dramatically alter the near field topology of the flownet and exchange fluxes in the vicinity of a borehole kacimov and obnosov 2018 strack 2017 where without the skin cake flow is trivially 1 d radial similarly in river s hydrology aquifer s seepage can become essentially 2 d in the vicinity of a vertical or

593,baseflow type interaction between a river and adjacent subjacent aquifer across a thin clogging layer of fine sediments controls the dynamics of surface pore water resources quality of both waters seepage induced erosion of the river bed and other hydrological phenomena transient 2d phreatic flow from an unconfined aquifer into a river with a thin low permeable cake hydraulic skin is approximated by a sequence of steady states each of which assumes the water table to be horizontal the scalar and vector fields of piezometric head stream function and darcian velocity are found from analytical solution of the dirichlet and robin linear combination of the velocity potential and its normal derivative boundary value problems for the piezometric head harmonic function the time shrinking tothian unit basins are a half strip half plane or rectangle stream banks are assumed to be horizontal or vertical segments cross flow from the aquifer into the stream is controlled by the aquifer skin conductivity ratio and the stages of the river and adjacent aquifer the head and cross flux on the interface robin s boundary is shown to vary along this line and therefore even for vertical river banks the dupuit forchheimer approximation is not strictly valid numerical simulations in hydrus2d are reasonably close to the analytical results early stage drawdown of a rectangular cake due to a sudden drop of the water level on the river side and formation of a seepage face is analysed with potential applications to stability of earth dams keywords stream aquifer conjugation

colmation lessivage siltation formation damage skin effect of porous media soils rocks and sediments is studied in groundwater and vadose zone hydrology hydrogeology sedimentology geomorphology soil genesis reservoir chemical geotechnical engineering hydrobiology limnology hydraulics of open channel flows among others see e g brunner et al 2017 datry et al 2015 krause et al 2011 strack 2017 in mathematical modelling clogging is conceptualized as a relatively thin subdomain usually a layer or lamina sometimes approximated as an interface which is sandwiched between two water pore water bodies e g river water and aquifer or two aquifers lamina s coefficients in odes or pdes which govern the cross fluxes are very different from that in the mentioned bodies strack 1989 consequently a physical field of interest pressure temperature concentration of an aqueous substance hydraulic head specific discharge abruptly changes across the lamina which groundwater hydrologists commonly call a leaky layer or aquitard strack 1989 2017 originally suspended and later settled fine sediments are the main contributors to clogging of wadis and reservoirs of dry dams in arid climates of arabia al ismaily et al 2015 the main concern is reduced infiltration less efficient aquifer recharge and stronger floods in other applications clogging altered fluxes of water dissolved solutes and advected bioentities control the hyporheic zone recuperation of manufactured porous filters ecohydrology of organisms stormwater infiltration or river bank filtration see e g mastrocicco et al 2016 wu and huang 2000 clogging is detrimental in these applications fine visible cakes formed on the top of a coarse porous body or internal occlusions of natural pores inside it thwart a desired exchange infiltration exfiltration between the surface water and adjacent pore water contrariwise big canals transport water from one region to another and the subsurface water compartment aquifer vadose zone is often purposely isolated by artificial clogging colmation from the conveyed water in order to forestall seepage losses water logging of adjacent land and secondary salinization in our paper we study exchange fluxes between the pore water in an aquifer and free water body in a river the focus is on an early post flash flood phase when the river stage drops in hours while the banks are saturated with pore water i e the stream is purely gaining the question is how much does a clogging layer impede inflow into the stream through the bed and banks this is especially important for alluvial wadi aquifers maliva and missimer 2012 where in case of a strong impedance the pore water instead of feeding the stream can be lost to the regional aquifer via deep vertical percolation groundwater hydrologists working with a catchment subcatchment scale models of aquifers have usually a limited information on hydraulic properties of the clogged river bed consequently the cross flow interaction stream aquifer being the crux of the problem as emphasized by ebel et al 2009 is commonly simplified via the so called conductance α of a construed hydraulic skin hereafter we will model a clogged zone as a cake usually the cake has much lower permeability than the adjacent subjacent aquifer the α coefficient depends on the ratio of hydraulic conductivities of the cake aquifer dyad and the believed thickness of the cake see e g doppler et al 2007 cousquer et al 2017 flipo et al 2014 gianni et al 2016 hantush 2005 huang and yeh 2015 lackey et al 2015 morel seytoux et al 2014 strack

direction perpendicular to the plane of fig 1 e g at the scale of a river reach datry et al 2015 irvine et al 2012 schilling et al 2017 tang et al 2017 at this scale hundreds of meters ka can be anisotropic in the horizontal plane gianni et al 2019 these spatial variations of hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer and cake are controlled by the type of the bedforms in the river hydraulics of the in channel current remobilization redeposition of settled particles by flashflood waves among others see e g naganna et al 2017 simpson and meixner 2012 stewardson et al 2016 field measurements

with the robin boundary conditions along a vertical segment bc in fig 2 a horizontal segment clbbcr in fig 4 a is solved as in morris 2003 and yakimov and kacimov 2017 two seepage domains are considered in our paper section 2 a shallow bedrock and vertical cake spanning through the whole aquifer fig 2 a shows only the right bank of the river section 3 a broad river fig 4 a and c of a relatively large l s d with a deep bedrock and horizontal cake in a nutshell we answer the question what are the impacts of the river size stage and contrast in conductivity of the cake and aquifer on darcian flows 2 analytical solution for vertical riverbank shallow bedrock in sections 2 and 3 we ignore capillarity of the soil and vadose zone above the water table although the analytical models are restricted to homogeneous isotropic aquifers of simplified geometry half strip half plane and assume only 2 d flows under special initial and boundary conditions they serve as benchmarks for numerical simulations and can be used by hydrologists for back of an envelope assessments prior to embarking on modflow feflow hydrus and other packages in the analytical model the piezometric head and darcian velocity vector v u v see fig 2 a in the aquifer obey the laplace equation and darcy s law 1 δ h a x y t 0 v x y t k a h a and u v are the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity point a in fig 2 a is fiducial i e h a a a velocity is zero at this point the head and stream function to be introduced later at point b in fig 2 a are apriori unknown we assume that at t 0 the water level in the river h s coincided with the water table a 0 therefore the phreatic surface in the aquifer the ray c 0 ra 0 was at the same horizon as the in cake phreatic surface the segment c 0 rc 0 l fig 2 a at t 0 the stream stage suddenly drops to the level h s 0 h 0 such situation can emerge in ephemeral and intermittent streams where a descending limb of a flash flood hydrograph is a steep curve consequently after a heavy rain the wadi aquifer see maliva and missimer 2012 is quickly saturated and when the flood wave in the wadi has gone starts feeding the wadi as baseflow at t 0 drawdown in the porous body commences the ray c 0 a 0 in fig 2 a transforms into a curve caaa which is described by the saturated thickness f a x t counted from the bedrock in the cake the curve cace outcrops on a seepage face cecs on the bank slope if h 0 is not drastically different from a 0 the seepage analysis in the cake i e at x 0 in fig 2 a is ignored then seepage in the aquifer only x 0 in fig 2 a is studied with the following robin boundary condition along bca 2 k a h a 0 y t x k c h a 0 y t h 0 b which is also called the first order exchange term see eq 6 in ebel et al 2009 who stated currently the inability to directly estimate the parameters that control the surface subsurface exchange in the first order exchange coefficient method has made universal application of the concept problematic in certain situations of surface water and groundwater interaction obviously from eq 2 α kc kab the ratio kc b is called leakance see e g wiese and nützmann 2009 we follow lembke see pk 77 and assume that at t t 3 f a x t a 0 where t is a small increment which quantifies marching forward in time if bca in fig 2 a is not clogged f a x t is highly curved near point ca especially at small t see pk 77 the cake smoothens the slope of the free boundary near bca therefore a flat approximation of the curve caaa by a falling ray ca according to eq 3 is reasonable we will describe later how the drawdown of the water table is modelled at aliquots t 2t 3t the common condition of isobaricity of the water table becomes 4 h a x a 0 t a 0 obviously along the bedrock we have a no flow condition 5 h a x 0 t y 0 thus at t t the flow domain is a half strip gz which we consider as a stroboscopic time shrinking unit basin of toth 2009 seepage there is gravity driven but impeded by clogging of bc we recall that toth studied steady 2 d flows driven by topography i e he assumed the ground surface coinciding with the water table to make flow problems amenable to analytical description toth used simple fixed polygons trapezia and rectangles as unit basins which approximate real flow domains capped by phreatic surfaces free boundaries in these polygons harmonic functions of peizometric head and streamfunction can be determined by either separation of variables toth 2009 or by solving bvps for holomorphic functions see e g kacimov and obnosov 2019 we introduce dimensionless quantities kr kc ka h h a h 0 b t t t t ka b a h 0 h d l s x y z a 0 h 0 h d l s x y z b v u v v u v ka φ ψ q φ ψ q bka in these variables the bvp 1 5 is written as 6 δ h x y t 0 0 y a 0 x h 0 y t x k r h 0 y t 0 y a h x a t h d h d a 0 h 0 0 x h x 0 t y 0 0 x bvp 6 is mathematically equivalent to a half domain of what morris 2003 solved in his appendix a with the only difference that morris normalized his quantities to what is a 0 in our notations the thickness a 0 of the heat conduction domain in morris 2003 did not vary with time in our case we use the constant cake thickness b for normalization we follow morris 2003 and get rid of the robin boundary condition by introducing a new function 7 χ x y k r h x y h x y x the time t is a constant parameter and we drop it in eq 7 and below while solving bvp 6 the morris 2003 flow domain is symmetric with respect to bd in fig 2 a and is shown in fig 2 b for χ x y a dirichlet bvp is 8 δ χ x y 0 a y a 0 x χ 0 y 0 a y a χ x a k r h d 0 x which is sketched in fig 2 b as morris 2003 did we borrow solution to bvp 8 from carslaw and jaeger 1959 p 165 9 χ x y k r h d 2 k r h d π arctan cos π y 2 a sh π x 2 a following morris 2003 we put eq 9 into eq 7 and integrate it 10 h x y exp k r x x exp k r τ χ τ y d τ where τ is our dummy variable obviously the horizontal and vertical velocity components u and v are obtained by differentiation of eq 10 with respect to x and y correspondingly e g 11 v x y exp k r x k r h d a x exp k r τ sh π τ 2 a sin π y 2 a s h 2 π τ 2 a cos 2 π y 2 a d τ similarly from eq 10 by differentiation and cauchy riemann conditions the horizontal velocity component u x y and stream function are obtained dropped here for the sake of brevity in groundwater flow we need only the upper part of the strip 0 y a in eqs 9 and 10 the bedrock imperviousity condition is fulfilled due to symmetry the hydraulic gradient is 12 v x y u 2 v 2 pk 77 considers the condition v 1 as onset of soil suffusion due to seepage the flow rate from the aquifer into the stream from both banks is an integral 13 q 2 q 2 ε h v x a d x 2 0 a ε v h 0 y d y where the integrands are taken from eqs 11 and 10 see also eq a5 in morris 2003 small constants εν and ε h are selected for avoiding the very vicinity of point c see the corresponding points mr and nr in fig 2 b without the cake point c in fig 2 b becomes a vortex and q is singular i e q when εν 0 ε h 0 below we selected εν ε h 0 01 we used the nintegrate routine of mathematica wolfram 1991 for evaluation of integrals in eq 13 fig 3 a plots h y in vertical sections x 0 100 and 200 for a 500 hd 100 and kr 0 05 fig 3 b shows the contour plots of h x y for the same triad a hd kr fig 3 a and b illustrate that even far away from the stream the piezometric lines do not verticalize because of the imposed tothian constant head condition along the top ray of gz i e flow is not quasi horizontal along the bedrock that is assumed in the dupuit forchheimer theory fig 3 c shows the head hb h 0 0 at point b as a function of kr for a 500 and hd 30 150 and 300 curves 1 3 these curves illustrate that at this corner of gz the head is different from zero and hc hd i e the cross flow through the cake makes flow in the aquifer essentially 2 d therefore we have another example of what strack 1989 p 381 inferred by analytical studies of unclogged rivers modelled by a vertical cut see his fig 5 15a the dupuit forchheimer assumption often is in direct contradiction with the boundary conditions fig 3 d shows the contours of the hydraulic gradient v x y for a 500 hd 100 kr 0 05 the level lines are plotted with an increment of 0 05 from v 0 1 to v 0 45 fig 3 d warns that the gradient drastically increases towards the singularity point c in this zone according to the pk 77 criterion of eq 12 the cake sediments are prone of seepage erosion depending on the direction of seepage across the cake its kc varies usually kc is evaluated to be higher for the case of groundwater upwelling as compared with the in bed orientation of the darcian velocity see e g brunke and gonser 1997 rosenberry and pitlick 2009 fig 3 e presents the distributions v x along the top of gz i e along ac for kr 0 05 three cases of a hd are selected 500 100 450 50 and 410 10 curves 1 3 correspondingly the total flow rate into the river is shown as q kr in fig 3 f for the same dyads as in fig 3 e the curves in fig 3 f manifest that if flow is controlled by a natural silt wall then the gains of water from the aquifer significantly decrease with the contrast in the drop of the cross wall potential hd next we describe the algorithm of involving the transiency of drawdown as t increases we approximate the new position of any point e originally located at aaca distance le from the river by displacing the point vertically down to a distance v le a t ma where v le a we take from eq 11 see also fig 3 e by this we assume that the release drainage of pore water with the drop of the water table is instantaneous specific yield of the aquifer is equal to porosity ma see pk 77 i e there is no delayed yield that is a good approximation for the case of a low capillarity soil therefore the linear average velocity v x a ma factored by a small quantity t gives the shape of the phreatic surface at the first time step viz fa x t a v le a t ma v in eq 11 is negative at the next time step t 2t we again approximate the curve f x 2t by a straight line y a 1 i e we assume that gz 2t is a half strip which shrunk due to dewatering of the aquifer as compared with gz t obviously this drawdown model is not valid at points close to the corner c in fig 2 a that explains why point mr has been introduced how to find a 1 first we use eq 11 and detect the abscissa lm of a point m at which v lm a vm where vm is a given exiguous quantity below we selected vm 0 01 lm is determined by the routine findroot of mathematica on the right of point m in fig 2 a there is almost no drawdown of the phreatic surface at t t the quantity of groundwater qm drained from the aquifer between points mr and m is 14 q m ε h l m v x a d x then according to the method of successive steady states pk 77 the new a 1 and therefore gz 2t is calculated as 15 a 1 q m a m a l m a obviously if the river stage h 0 fig 2 a is kept constant then hd decreases with a with a new a 1 we repeat all computations in comport with eqs 10 15 next we march to a time instance t 3t and so on for example we selected ka 10 m day kc 0 5 m day ma 0 2 b 0 1 m and a 50 m then for a sudden drawdown in the river of h 0 40 m h d 10 m at t 0 01 days the first drawdown at x 10 m is f 10 t 0 27 m the computed value of l m 113 9 m and a 1 50 0 1114 m for the next time step 2t l m 115 m and a 2 a 1 0 1091 m 3 analytical solution for shallow river in this section we assume that the bedrock of fig 1 a is deep the river has a small depth such that it can be approximated by a horizontal cut clbbcr fig 4 a this approximation is common in analytically modelled surface groundwater interaction via horizontal clogged beds kacimov 2007 strack 2017 the interface clbbcr between the cake and aquifer is now a horizontal segment similar to ones in figs 5 5 5 6 5 17 of strack 2017 we analyse only the first time step of the drawdown t t time marching t 2t 3t is analogous to section 2 the piezometric head is counted from an initially horizontal water table at the instance t 0 the river level drops from h s 0 to h s h d we introduce a new dimensionless piezometric head h h a b other dimensionless quantities are the same as in section 2 we define a dimensionless complex physical coordinate z x i y velocity potential φ x y h and stream function ψ x y which is conjugated with φ via the cauchy riemann conditions the complex potential isw φ iψ along the river bed in dimensional heads we have 16 k a h a x 0 y k c h a x 0 h d b l s 2 x l s 2 eq 16 is the robin boundary condition similar to eq 2 along the horizontal rays crar and clal y 0 x l s 2 0 and l s 2 x which are geometrically co levelled with clbbcr the piezometric head in the aquifer h a 0 seepage as in section 2 is induced by a sudden drop of the river head therefore the boundary conditions along the line y 0 which bounds the flow domain gz are 17 c l b c r ϕ x 0 y k r ϕ x 0 k r h d l s 2 x l s 2 a l c l and c r a r ϕ x 0 0 x l s 2 x l s 2 similarly to section 2 at early stages of drainage the water table rays alcl and arcr are approximated as horizontal isobars i e equipotential lines the second line in eq 17 point a infinity is fidicial along the ray bab symmetry line the stream function is ψ 0 at point cr ψ q the complex potential domain gw is sketched in fig 4 b the curve clbbcr there is unknown we map gz onto the upper half plane gζ of a reference variable ζ ξ iη fig 5 with the correspondence of points cr b cl 1 0 1 a by the function 18 ζ z 2 z l s as in yakimov and kacimov 2017 we assume that along clbbcr the velocity potential is 19 ϕ φ ξ φ 1 0 φ ξ φ ξ 1 ξ 1 where φ ξ is a symmetric function to be found similarly to section 2 the value φ b see fig 4 b is of a special interest because it reflects the drop of the piezometric head from the edges towards the center of clbbcr thus from eq 19 the complex potential holomorphic function w ζ is to be found based on the dirichlet boundary conditions 20 ϕ φ ξ 1 ξ 1 ϕ 0 ξ 1 solution to bvp 20 is given see pk 77 by the following cauchy integral 21 w ζ i π 1 1 φ θ θ ζ d θ where we took into account that ψ 0 we use the sokhotskii formula and from eq 21 obtain 22 ψ ξ 1 π 1 1 φ θ θ ξ d θ 1 ξ 1 the function f ξ is continuous and can be expanded into a series of the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind see e g kacimov 2006 23 ϕ ξ k 1 b k u k ξ u k sin k arccos ξ 1 ξ 1 these polynomials make a complete orthonormal set obviously only the odd terms are retained in the series to ensure the flow symmetry we put eq 23 as an integrand of eq 22 and get a series of the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind 24 ψ ξ k 1 b k t k ξ t k cos k arccos ξ 1 ξ 1 now we use the cauchy riemann relation and rewrite the first robin s boundary condition of eq 17 as 25 e ξ d ψ ξ d ξ d ξ d x k r ϕ ξ k r h d 0 1 ξ 1 where dξ dx 2 ls from eq 18 we differentiate eq 24 and put it into eq 25 along with the series 23 that yields 26 2 k 1 k b k u k ξ l s 1 ξ 2 k r k 1 b k u k ξ k r h d 1 ξ 1 in order to find the coefficients bk in eq 26 we use the collocation method and select consequently j 1 3 5 points on the interval 1 ξ 1 we use the middle collocation point ξ 0 for j 1 retain only one term in eq 26 and immediately find b 1 1 next we use the same middle point and add two points ξ 1 2 for j 3 next the collocation points are ξ 0 0 25 0 75 for j 5 and so on correspondingly we truncate the series in eq 26 and get systems of linear equations with respect to b 1 3 b 3 3 b 1 5 b 3 5 b 5 5 and so on the systems are solved and the results are presented in table 1 for ls 100 kr 0

i e b k j b k const c i j 0 with the increase of the number of collocation points j and the number of terms retained in eq 26 fig 6 presents q kr and φ b kr for ls hd 100 10 calculated with j 7 4 comparisons with hydrus numerical simualtions solutions in sections 2 and 3 ignored the unsaturated capillarity affected zone above caaa in figs 2 and 4 and heterogeneity of the aquifer in this section we use hydrus2d šimůnek et al 2016 which numerically solves a transient 2 d richards equation for saturated unsaturated soils first we compare the analytical results of section 2 with hydrus simulations for this purpose we selected a domain consisting of two adjacent rectangles an aquifer bc 0 rahdhb of sizes 200 200cm and a thin cake bc 0 rc 0 lbeb of sizes 5 200cm the properties of these two van genucten s vg soils are retrieved from the hydrus soil catalogue sand and clay have ka 8 25 10 3 cm s and kc 5 56 10 5 cm s respectively the mesh elements were 2 5 cm that made 10 318 nodes 404 1 d elements 20 310 2 d elements 324 boundary mesh nodes and elements we used default hydrus options for the number of iterations 10 and tolerance in pressure head p 1 cm the piezometric head is h p y where we keep the y notation for the vertical coordinate as in fig 2 hydrus uses h as a notation for the pressure head a hydrostatic pressure head distribution in both hydrus adjacent rectangles was selected as an initial condition the boundary conditions were no flow along bebdh dhah and c 0 rc 0 l p 0 along ahc 0 r seepage face condition along c 0 rcs and a hydrostatic pressure along becs we selected cs to be at 100 cm above the impermeable bottom bebdh that corresponds to a sudden drop of the river level from 200 cm to 100 cm i e in notations of section 2 a 200 cm b 5 cm h 0 h d 100 cm fig 2 the simulation time was 60 s an early stage of drainage of an initially horizontal water table fig 7 shows coloured maps of pressure head p x y a streamlines b and v x y c in fig 7 c the upper contour corresponds to v 0 0011 cm s and along the lowest curve v 0 00011 cm s i e the vertical component of velocity drops an order of magnitude from the top to the bottom of the aquifer integration of hydrus obtained v x along the upper face of the rectangle y 200 cm gives q 0 16 cm2 s analytical eq 13 for a 40 hd 20 converted to dimensional quantities gives q 0 19 cm2 s now we compare the analytical and numerical piezometric heads along bc in fig 2 a this comparison will show the closeness of this key flow characteristic computed by two different governing equations in a half strip analytical solution and finite rectangle hydrus the pressure head distribution along the interface bc 0 r x 0 in fig 2 see also fig 7 d was retrieved from the analytical solution in section 2 for the selected set of hydrus dimensional quantities we plotted the analytical curve h a y h y b h 0 where h y is given by eq 10 and kr 0 0067 for this pair of vg soils the analytical piezometric head h y where y is now the hydrus vertical coordinate is shown in fig 7 e as curve 1 the numerical curve p 0 y in fig 7 d is wiggling and we selected hydrus p values at each 10 cm in y and used the listplot routine of mathematica to get a smoothened numerical piezometric head h y p 0 y y it is shown as curve 2 in fig 7 e curves 1 and 2 are close to each other both curves show how h y varies along the vertical segment x 0 0 y 100 cm we note that hydrus takes into account a seepage face while the analytical solutions does not qualitatively both models show that h y variation are mild close to point b in fig 2 and large close to point c fig 8 presents hydrus results for a vertical clogged river bank with the same parameters as in fig 7 except aquifer s homogeneity in fig 8 a sandy domain at x 0 has a thin loamy horizontal stratum 5 y 5 cm there is no analytical solution for this layered aquifer fig 8 a depicts a horizontal component u x y of the darcian velocity vector and fig 8 b illustrates a coloured map of hydrus2d streamlines comparison of figs 7 and 8 evidences that heterogeneity of the aquifer significantly alters the flow topology unfortunately analytical solutions for transient regimes in stratified aquifers with a vertical clogging cake at the outlet boundary are not available and therefore numerical models are indispensable next for comparisons with analytical results in section 3 we considered a hydrus sextagon gedbificig fig 4 c sketches a left half of the flow domain in fig 4 a with the following sizes ge 200 cm ed 210 cm h 0 20 cm a cake of thickness b 10 cm is made as another sextagon clcifibibfcl shaded in fig 4c the aquifer and cake are composed of the vg loam and clay at t 0 groundwater and the river water are at homeostasis i e the pressure head is hydrostatic at t 0 the river level drops from ci to ui i e by hd and groundwater starts seeping into the river the boundary conditions are no flow across ge ed clci and dbbr along uifibi the pressure head is hydrostatic along ciui we impose the seepage face condition along gcl we assume now the no flow boundary condition which models drainage at any not only small t we refined the hydrus mesh size near the lines gcifibi and simulated drainage of groundwater for 60 s fig 9 assuming that at t 0 the river suddenly becomes empty i e in fig 4 c h 0 0 fig 9 a shows isobars sandwiching the phreatic surface p 0 fig 9 b plots the distribution of the vertical component v x y of the darcian velocity the distribution of v along gci is shown in fig 9 c fig 9 d illustrates the streamlines we also determined the distributions v x along fibi and u y along fici after that we evaluated a dimensionless flow rate defined is section 3 the hydrus value was q 0 47 analytical solution for this kr 0 0067 and l 240 cm gave q 0 3 5 concluding remarks drawdown in an unconfined aquifer with a phreatic surface which mildly slopes towards a silt clogged river bank a thin cake of a constant thickness and permeability is analysed as a sequence of approximations of the flow domain modelled by shrinking half strips the cake is approximated as an interface a line along which the robin boundary condition holds this condition unlike the dirichlet or neuman ones in boundary value problems for lapalce s equation is most often not amenable to conformal mappings of two domains of common characteristics holomorphic functions the complex potential hodograph verigin and zhukovskii s functions see pk77 we used the morris 2003 analytical solution in a half strip with the robin boundary condition on one side vertical clogged river bank comparisons of this solution with numerical simulations in hydrus2d that illustrated a reasonably good match of the exchange flux between the aquifer and river as well as of the piezometric head variation along the vertical interface between the aquifer and cake we also plotted streamlines isotachs and isobars which illustrate that the dupuit forchheimer assumption of a prevalently horizontal flow is not valid for the considered scenarios of a sudden drawdown of water level in the river into which an originally static groundwater is drained with the cake impedance to answer the above raised question on the degree of impedance caused by the cake on groundwater river exchange we refer to the case in fig 7 comparably modelled analytically and numerically if we assume that the river reach is 100 m then the total quantity of groundwater seeping in one minute through one bank of this river fig 2 a will be about 0 1 m3 hydrus predicts that the hydraulic gradient along the aquifer cake interface for the adjacent rectangles in fig 7 will be less than 0 2 at the modelled time of 60 s after the drawdown of the river level to half of its original value in other words the flow scenario in fig 7 is beyond the pk 77 threshold of seepage induced erosion the problems involving the robin boundary condition for an analytic function require solution of hypersingular integral equations like in capobianco and criscuolo 2016 which has been introduced by prandtl in aerodynamics of thin airfoils we solved this equation by the trefftz method see liu 2007 yakimov and kacimov 2017 for the case of a shallow river with a horizontal clogged bed i e for the case of a half plane as a flow domain where the piezometric head is a harmonic function analytical solutions to problems involving the robin boundary condition can be also applied to the case of a variable water level h s t in a river a t marching algorithm similar to one in section 2 can involve drawup of the river water level at x 0 in fig 1 a then river starts loosing water into the cake like in gianni et al 2016 if the drawup is long enough then water seeps from the cake into the aquifer provided the inequality h s t a t holds the trefftz procedure used in section 3 can be easily extended to other river geometries e g to a deep and narrow river modelled as a vertical cut in this case only the mapping function 18 will be changed zooming of 2 d seepage near the interface bc in fig 1 a can explain colmation and suffusion for example thinning of river s cake near point c in fig 2 a that may be related to experimentally confirmed see e g datry et al 2015 variation of the cake properties with the direction magnitude of the darcian velocity near bc in groundwater modelling one often only alludes a constant α without adducing field measurements hydrobiologists and hydrologists working with the hyporheic zone have collected good experimental data on kc texture and porosity of clogged river lake beds all varying with n and sr in fig 1 b these data and experience would be good to upscale interface in groundwater flow transport numerical codes experimental laboratory or field techniques to evaluate α can be connected to routine mathematical solutions of inverse problems history matching there is analogy of darcian flows studied in this paper with ones in well hydraulics where the skin of groundwater wells can dramatically alter the near field topology of the flownet and exchange fluxes in the vicinity of a borehole kacimov and obnosov 2018 strack 2017 where without the skin cake flow is trivially 1 d radial similarly in river s hydrology aquifer s seepage can become essentially 2 d in the vicinity of a vertical or

594,wetlands play an important role in watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry a geographically isolated wetland giw module for soil and water assessment tool swat was developed to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics to characterize hydroperiod the new giw module includes the following features 1 a flexible geometric formula to characterize wetland surface water area volume and depth 2 a revised algorithm to account for evaporation from both water and soil surfaces in wetlands 3 application of the richards equation to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics 4 use of darcy s law with an effective hydraulic conductivity parameter to simulate groundwater discharge we tested the giw module using observed daily water level data from four wetlands at two sites including restored and natural wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer in the delmarva peninsula usa the results show that the wetland module reasonably reproduced observed water levels for both restored and natural wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer the module was also able to reasonably simulate saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods the ability of the giw module to describe inundation conditions for wetlands holds promise to enhance the understanding and quantification of hydrological and biogeochemical roles of giws in a watershed context keywords richards equation hydroperiod inundation soil moisture swat 1 introduction wetlands as a unique hydrologic feature of the landscape generally form in flat areas depressions or shallow slopes in a watershed with water lying near the land surface keddy 2010 zedler and kercher 2005 wetlands share many characteristics of aquatic and terrestrial environments due to their special transitional role between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems keddy 2010 as a result wetland environments create unique hydrological and biogeochemical conditions that distinguish them from aquatic and terrestrial settings keddy 2010 wetlands support a variety of ecosystem functions including flood water storage reducing delivery of sediment and nutrients to rivers supporting biogeochemical cycling and providing habitat for diverse plants and animals smith et al 1995 for example wetlands serve as a moderator of landscape water flow through storing flood water and reducing flow velocities dodds et al 2008 hefting et al 2013 ullah et al 2005 in addition wetlands are capable of trapping sediment and nutrients delivered from the surrounding upland areas due to their shallow depths and low slopes many studies have demonstrated that wetlands improved water quality by accumulating nutrients trapping sediment and transforming a variety of chemicals mitsch and ewel 1979 jordan et al 2003 kuenzler 1989 faulkner and richardson 1989 johnston 1991 wetlands also influence the global carbon c cycle and therefore climate change and global warming bridgham et al 1995 bridgham et al 2006 inundation conditions of wetland ecosystems limit the availability of oxygen to soil microbes and as a result organic matter decomposition proceeds slowly schlesinger 2005 this condition further causes wetlands to accumulate organic matter in the substrate such as the organic rich soil of peatlands chanton et al 1995 wetlands have accumulated approximately one third of the global terrestrial soil c due to slow rates of anaerobic decomposition bridgham et al 2006 inundation conditions also result in the production of methane ch4 by methanogenic microbes it is estimated that wetlands are responsible for 15 40 of current global ch4 emissions solomon 2007 the hydrological and biogeochemical functions of wetlands are determined by various factors such as climate hydrology underlaying substrate as well as their position and area in the landscape keough et al 1999 zimmer et al 2000 a geographically isolated wetland giw is a freshwater wetland which is surrounded by uplands at the local scale tiner 2003 about 8 3 million giws cover 6 5 million hectares and comprise approximately 16 of freshwater wetlands within the conterminous united states lane and d amico 2016 giws generally lack permanent surface water connectivity to other aquatic systems and as a result they may have minimal influence on downstream flows because they are poorly connected with local river systems dahl 2014 however giws may have strong interactions with underlying groundwater systems depending on the hydraulic properties of the underlying substrate mclaughlin et al 2014 giws may be connected by intermittent surficial waters or drained via tiles and ditching for agricultural purposes or urban development lane and d amico 2016 rains et al 2016 as a result giws have been lost to a large extent due to human disturbance especially since the industrial age dahl et al 1991 rubec 1994 owing to the hydrological and ecological importance of wetlands particularly under the influence of intensified of agricultural activities and climate change quantitative tools are needed for assessing hydrological and biogeochemical effects of giws evenson et al 2016 giws can be assessed through in situ monitoring however instrumenting much larger watersheds having many giws is neither practical nor cost effective hydrological and biogeochemical modeling is therefore an alternative approach for wetland functions assessment wetlands are directly or indirectly being included in many watershed scale models including the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 the original wetland module within the swat model can reproduce the streamflow hydrology of watersheds having a considerable portion of wetlands wu and johnston 2008 wang et al 2008 martinez martinez et al 2014 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 babbar sebens et al 2013 to simulate the hydraulic interactions between riparian wetlands rivers and aquifers a previous study modified the swat model with an enhanced riparian and depressional wetland module rahman et al 2016 remotely sensed data were also employed in an enhanced swat model to simulate the spatial dynamics of inundation extent of riparian wetlands at the catchment scale lee et al 2017 the swat model was also modified to examine the hydrological characteristics of giws evenson et al 2016 lee et al 2018 however none of these studies explicitly investigated the hydroperiod of wetlands with respect to the interaction between subsurface soil water and surface water storage which is particularly important for modeling hydrological and biogeochemical processes in wetlands for example the water table and its fluctuation within wetlands is the primary factor driving soil organic c soc decomposition plant c fixation ch4 production and consumption and other biogeochemical processes zhang et al 2002 an accurate description of hydroperiods regarding soil water and surface water interaction benefits water quantity and quality assessment from site to watershed scales in the present study we propose a giw module with enhanced capabilities describing the interaction between surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics so that the hydroperiod can be explicitly modeled specifically the objective of this study is to develop and test a giw module in the swat model using monitored water level data from restored and natural wetlands with and without low permeability soil layers in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and water assessment tool the swat model is a continuous physically based and semi distributed watershed scale model which has been successfully used to simulate water quantity and quality in a wide range of watersheds across the world qi et al 2017a 2017b srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2017 this model has been widely used to evaluate water quality and assess effectiveness of bmps as affected by landuse and climate change li et al 2014 qi et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 qi et al 2019a 2019b liang et al 2019 it is currently one of the most widely used hydrological models for water resource assessment and watershed management major swat model components include weather hydrology soil temperature sedimentation nutrients pesticides pathogens plant growth and land management neitsch et al 2011a model inputs include the physical characteristics of a watershed defined by local meteorology soil type and topography either simulated or recorded weather data e g precipitation temperature and solar radiation may be used by swat qi et al 2019c the model analyzes small or large watersheds by discretizing them into subbasins which are then further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus with homogeneous land use and soil properties and slope the model calculates the water balance i e surface and subsurface runoff percolation and base flow and evapotranspiration et and transmission losses crop growth nutrient cycling and pesticide movement at the hru scale water flow sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru in a subbasin are summed and the resulting loadings are then routed through channels ponds and reservoirs to the watershed outlet water balance within the soil is a function of precipitation surface runoff lateral flow evapotranspiration and percolation neitsch et al 2011a surface runoff is calculated using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method neitsch et al 2011a water infiltrated into the soil profile is simulated using a storage routing technique narasimhan et al 2005 downward flow in the soil occurs when a soil layer exceeds its field capacity and the layer below is not saturated soil water can evaporate be taken up and transpired by plants and flow into water bodies through lateral flow or percolate into groundwater the water entering the vadose zone flows into shallow aquifer becoming unconfined groundwater subsequent flow may occur as baseflow to the main stream as confined groundwater flow in a deep aquifer or may evaporate if there is insufficient soil water to support et demand neitsch et al 2011a three et methods are included in the swat model i e penman monteith method monteith 1965 priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 these methods vary in the amount of required inputs and conditions they can be used the priestley taylor method is suitable for conditions where surface areas are wet and as a result we employed the priestley taylor method for giw modeling 2 2 giw module the giw module was developed at the hru scale because of finer scale resolution better aligned with our objective of simulating surface water storage and soil water dynamics for giws we incorporated a robust generalized and flexible wetland geometric formula to characterize wetland surface water area volume and depth we developed a wetland evaporation algorithm to account for evaporation from both water and soil surfaces of giws through variable water soil surface areas we improved the calculation of seepage from the wetland bottom by redefining the soil hydraulic conductivity most importantly we used the richards equation to characterize soil moisture movement in the soil profile these modifications dramatically improved soil water simulation and facilitated the coupling of surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics qi et al 2018b finally we also modified the groundwater algorithms corresponding to two different types of giws i e giws with a low permeability soil layer and giw without a low permeability soil layer our efforts made for a better representation of groundwater flow by applying darcy s law with an effective conductivity the newly developed giw module simulates conditions at an hourly time step and is illustrated in detail as follows 2 2 1 giw spatial structure a giw is conceptualized as having a circular boundary as shown in fig 1 we incorporated a generalized and flexible geometric formula to determine the relationships between surface water volume sv m3 surface area sa m2 and depth d i e water depth at the center of giws m for giws this formula was developed by hayashi and van der kamp 2000 who tested it for a range of giws with non unique shapes the mathematical form of the model is shown as 1 s a b d d 0 2 p 2 s v b 1 2 p d 1 2 p d 0 2 p where b and p are scale and shape factors and d0 is unit depth i e 1 m the scale factor b can be calculated using the user specified maximum values of giw water surface area giwa m2 and depth dmx m given by 3 b π r m x 2 d m x d 0 2 p where rmx is the maximum radius for giws fig 1 and it is calculated by 4 r m x g i w a π 1 2 the shape factor p is used to calibrate wetland shape for example increasing the value of p represents a more cylindrically shaped wetland eqs 1 and 2 can be used to calculate giw surface water area sa m2 and depth d m given a value of giw surface water volume sv m3 which is converted from surface water storage sws mm simulated by the giw module at the hru scale 2 2 2 surface water storage the hru water balance for surface water storage sws mm is calculated by 5 δ s w s p e r o u t s where δsws is the change in surface water storage mm p is precipitation including rainfall and snowfall mm e is evaporation mm rout is surface runoff mm and s is seepage mm into underlying soils 2 2 3 surface runoff surface runoff is generated when surface water storage sws mm is greater than the maximum surface water storage swsmx mm of a giw calculated as 6 r o u t s w s s w s m x where swsmx is determined by 7 s w s m x 1000 s v m x g i w a where svmx m3 is the maximum surface water volume and is calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 as 8 s v m x b 1 2 p d m x 1 2 p d 0 2 p 2 2 4 evaporation the giw module takes evaporation from both water surface and soil surface into account calculated by 9 e e w s a g i w a e s 1 s a g i w a where ew and es are the evaporation from the water and soil surfaces mm respectively they are determined as a function of plant leaf area index lai and the maximum leaf area index laimax as follows 10 e w p e t 1 l a i l a i m a x 11 e s e s o 1 l a i l a i m a x where pet and es o are the potential evapotranspiration mm and soil evaporation mm respectively both are determined by the priestley taylor method within the swat model neitsch et al 2011a 2 2 5 seepage initial seepage sini mm from the bottom of a giw is calculated by 12 s i n i min s w s k 1 s a g i w a where k1 is the hydraulic conductivity mm for the first soil layer maximum soil pore space scap mm is determined as 13 s c a p 1 k k p o r e f f i where por eff is the effective porosity air filled space of soil layers mm i indicates soil layers from top i 1 to bottom i last soil layer number and kk is determined by the first soil layer whose saturated hydraulic conductivity is less than sini or the first saturated soil layer when searching from the top soil layer to the bottom soil layer the final seepage s mm is then calculated by 14 s m i n s i n i s c a p k m i n where kmin mm h 1 is the minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil layers 2 2 6 soil water simulation soil water is simulated by the modified richards equation zeng and decker 2009 i e 15 θ t z k h h e z q where θ is the volumetric soil water content mm3 mm 3 t is time h z is the depth below soil surface mm positive downwards k is the hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 h is the soil matric potential mm q is a soil water sink term mm3 mm 3 h 1 and he is the equilibrium soil matric potential mm detailed information regarding the development and integration of the richards equation based soil moisture module in the swat model can be found in qi et al 2018b in this study we further modified the richards equation based soil moisture module for giw simulation the modifications are 1 the upper boundary flux for the richards equation is the seepage eqs 12 14 from giws when surface water exists when there is no surface water storage an evaporation flux occurs based on eq 9 i e es 2 plant transpiration is the only sink term in the richards equation based soil moisture module for wetlands with a low permeability layer while for wetlands without a low permeability layer an extra sink term is added based on the predetermined groundwater flow see eq 16 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity is calculated based on the method used by the community land surface clm model oleson et al 2010 this is because the measured data from the swat model database i e usda natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo may not be accurate for soils in giws 4 the lower boundary condition is modified to simulate two types of giws based on soil impermeability characteristics when there is a low permeability soil layer flux is limited via calibrating the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the low permeability layer wet k the layer with highest content of clay is defined as the low permeability layer when there is no low permeability soil layer hydrologically connected soil water and groundwater system the shallow aquifer was included in the model to retain hydraulic interaction between soil water and the unconfined groundwater specifically a numerical node below the soil bottom was added in the solution of the richards equation to calculate recharge to the shallow aquifer or the upward movement of groundwater due to soil evaporation and uptake by deep rooted plants oleson et al 2010 the hydraulic properties for the additional node were adapted from those of the last soil layer excluding organic material properties to estimate hydraulic conductivity and soil matric potential qi et al 2018b the lower boundary condition is set at the interface layer of shallow and deep aquifers with a low flux which needs to be calibrated via saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k 2 2 7 groundwater flow since there are low permeability layers a relatively weak hydraulic connection exists between soil water and the shallow aquifer the recharge to the shallow aquifer is determined by the limited flux at the low permeability layer in the richards equation based soil moisture module in this case the groundwater discharge gw i e baseflow in mm h 1 is calculated using the original algorithm in the swat model neitsch et al 2011b to simulate groundwater discharge gw mm h 1 for giws without a low permeability layer darcy s law was used given by 16 g w k e f f a c w t l where ac is the cross section area m2 of water flow between the wetland and the main channel in a subbasin wt is the water table height m relative to the reference elevation fig 2 l m is the distance from the wetland to the main channel in a subbasin fig 2 and keff is the effective hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 which needs to be calibrated since we did not know the exact cross section area between the wetland and the main channel in a subbasin we assumed that the ac giwa similar to the concept using in rahman et al 2016 by this assumption the water balance and groundwater dynamics can be conveniently simulated at the hru scale with all water fluxes in unit of mm h 1 and volume in unit of mm note that this assumption has impacts on the value of keff and we will discuss this point in section 4 2 the reference elevation is defined at the main stream elestr m the water table height above the bottom of a giw can be determined by 17 w t e l e b o t e l e s t r d where elebot is the invert elevation of giws lowest land surface elevation on the wetland bottom m when d 0 the water table height is at the bottom of a giw the water table height below the bottom of a giw can be determined by 18 w t e l e b o t e l e s t r d s o l where dsol m is the water level depth positive when the water table is in the soil typically during dry periods elestr elebot and l can be derived from the digital elevation model dem see more information in section 2 4 note that in eq 16 the model can simulate recharge from adjacent stream to wetlands when wt is negative because our observations do not include conditions where wetland water table is below stream elevation this function remains to be validated in future studies the water stored in the unconfined aquifer has a prescribed maximum value 5000 mm when the water table is below the soil bottom the change in water storage in the unconfined aquifer is updated as the difference between recharge gr mm h 1 determined from the richards equation and discharge gw mm h 1 the change in water table is then calculated by 19 δ w t g r g w s y where sy is the specific yield for the unconfined aquifer m3 m 3 masterson et al 2016 2 2 8 giw module parameterization the giw module has several physically based calibration parameters the shape factor p eqs 1 and 2 is used to calibrate the giw shape which is important for simulation of water level at the center of a giw the saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k is used to calibrate limited water flux for the low permeability layer for both types of giws the effective hydraulic conductivity keff is used to calibrate groundwater discharge for giws without a low permeability layer eq 16 the giw module also needs several measured input parameters including maximum wetland water surface area giwa and maximum depth at the center of the wetland dmx in addition the reference elevation at the main stream elestr the elevation of wetland bottom elebot and the distance from the wetland to the main channel l as well as the specific yield sy for the unconfined aquifer are needed for giws without a low permeability layer 2 3 study sites and data collection the present study involves a watershed defined by a u s geological survey usgs gauge station on the choptank river near greensboro usgs 01491000 maryland which hereafter will be referred to as the greensboro watershed gw 290 km2 fig 3 it is located on the headwaters of the choptank river watershed crw in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay in maryland fig 3 due to flat topography closeness to the groundwater table and high annual precipitation wetlands are abundant in this region those wetlands are reported to provide various ecosystem services water quality improvement jordan et al 2003 water quantity control lee et al 2018 and provision of natural habitat russell and beauchamp 2017 in the gw major land uses are forest 48 3 and agriculture 36 1 a large portion of soils 74 5 in the gw are poorly drained hydrological soil groups c and d in which 67 2 of croplands are located ator and denver 2015 the swat model requires detailed information on the climate soils and land use for the study site precipitation and temperature data were collected from national climatic data center ncdc at the greensboro station us1mdcl0009 within the gw fig 3 other climatic variables such as solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were generated by the weather generator wxgen embedded within the swat model due to data unavailability a soil map was derived based on the ssurgo database topography was delineated by a 10 m light detection and ranging lidar based dem the land use map and the scheduling of crop rotations were generated using 2008 2012 data from the usda national agriculture statistics service nass cropland data layer cdl lee et al 2016 in 2016 a well was installed at the wetland invert to monitor the water level for restored and natural wetlands at sites 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 lee et al 2019 the well was installed with a depth of 0 9 m below the wetland invert elevation the water level when it is below the wetland invert elevation is defined as the depth of the interface between unsaturated and saturated soil layers these will be negative values as the wetland invert elevation is the reference datum according to hydrogeologic data site 2 is characterized by soils with large saturated hydraulic conductivity while site 1 includes multiple low permeability layers table 1 lee et al 2019 daily water level data were observed from 2016 to 2017 at site 2 and for 2016 at site 1 table 2 hourly precipitation data measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific te525 l10 at each wetland were used for investigating the variation of water level over time lee et al 2019 daily precipitation was calculated as the sum of hourly precipitation for each day and used to simulate water level dynamics restored wetlands are those that have been converted from active agricultural use and have had a more natural wetland hydroperiod restored through a variety of methods including plugging ditches with earthen mounds plant communities in restored sites resembled natural wetlands based on the percentage of species that were native and hydrophytic however natural sites were forested while restored wetlands were primarily herbaceous restored wetlands tend to be more affected by anthropogenic disturbance compared to natural sites they can develop diverse native wetland plant communities within a decade but they remain different from natural wetlands yepsen et al 2014 2 4 model evaluation site 2 is located within hru 170016 in the gw fig 3 the original hru is characterized as frsd forest landuse md011hob 1 soil type and 0 2 slope class within the swat model for the natural giw we changed frsd to wetf wetlands forested while for the restored giw we used rnge range grasses the same hru was used for giws at site 1 but with a different soil type table 1 the giw module was used to simulate daily water level dynamics in the hru the water level simulated is the water depth positive when sws is greater than zero and negative when the soil is unsaturated referenced at the wetland invert elevation the input parameters required i e maximum wetland surface water area giwa and depth dmx as well as reference elevation at the main stream elestr the elevation of giw bottom the wetland invert elevation elebot and the distance from the wetland to the main channel l as well as the specific yield sy for the unconfined aquifer are shown in table 2 we choose the elevation at the outlet of the subbasin 17 containing hru 170016 to represent the reference elevation of the main stream fig 4 elestr thereafter the distance from the wetland to the outlet of the subbasin l was determined using arcgis for site 2 fig 4 elestr and elebot were determined for the restored and natural giws at site 2 via arcgis using dem data giwa and dmx were estimated based on our observations at the two sites the value for the specific yield sy for the unconfined aquifer was adopted from masterson et al 2016 the giw module was initialized with saturated soils and maximum surface water storage because the model started simulation on the first day of the year when wetlands were filled with full volume of water at the study area we simulated conditions from 2014 to 2016 2017 with 2014 2015 two years serving as the warm up spin up period for natural and restored wetlands at the two sites the weather data from ncdc were used for spin up period the giw module was calibrated using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 procedure in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 specifically the giw module was executed 1000 times for each iteration we found that no distinct improvement in objective function value i e the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 after 2 3 iterations calibration was conducted using data from 2016 for both the natural and restored wetlands at the two sites model validation was conducted only for natural and restored wetlands at site 2 using data from 2017 table 2 we do not have additional data for model validation at site 1 table 2 performance of the giw module was assessed using three coefficients of accuracy i e bias ns coefficient of determination r2 given as 20 b i a s p a v g o a v g 21 n s 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o a v g 2 22 r 2 i 1 n o i o a v g p i p a v g i 1 n o i o a v g 2 i 1 n p i p a v g 2 0 5 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values respectively and oavg and pavg are the average of the observed and predicted values respectively 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were conducted on the four calibration parameters parameter sensitivities were determined using the following multiple regression equation based on results running swat cup multiple times given as 23 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function value α and βi are regression coefficients bi is the calibration parameters and m is the number of parameters considered ns was used as the objective function value and student t tests were used to identify the statistical significance of each parameter this sensitivity analysis method estimates the change in the objective function resulting from changes in each parameter while all other parameters are changing the procedure does not provide an absolute measure of the sensitivity but rather a relative sensitivity this method has the advantage of being quite fast compared to similar procedures the p value was used to identify the relative sensitivity of parameters and a p value less than 0 05 was taken to represent a relatively sensitive parameter in the present study 3 results 3 1 parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis calibrated parameter values for the giw module at the two sites are shown in table 3 in general the calibrated shape factor p was within a narrow range i e from 1 09 to 1 75 for all four wetlands calibrated values for saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k in the low permeability layer for site 1 and the interface layer between the shallow and deep aquifers for site 2 were very close to each other ranging from 0 030 to 0 036 mm h 1 the values of effective hydraulic conductivity keff were rather close for the natural and restored wetlands 0 875 and 3 3 mm h 1 respectively at site 2 table 3 sensitivity analysis results are shown in table 4 the p values for shape factor p was greater than 0 05 while those for wet k and keff were both less than 0 05 indicating that hydraulic properties in the low permeability layer and in the lateral direction from wetlands to streams are important parameters influencing water level dynamics in both natural and restored wetlands 3 2 model calibration and validation model performance evaluation statistics for simulating daily water level during calibration and validation are shown in table 5 for site 1 the giw module performed well for water level simulation for both the natural and restored wetlands based on the three statistics during calibration values of r2 and ns were all greater than 0 68 and bias values were less than 11 mm which is relatively small compared to the average annual precipitation about 1200 mm the giw module performed slightly better for the restored wetland than for the natural wetland with higher values of ns and lower bias table 5 for site 2 the giw module performed much better for both the natural and restored wetlands during calibration values of r2 and ns were all greater than 0 83 compared with the model performance at site 1 based on r2 and ns table 5 the value of bias was 22 mm approximately 2 of average annual precipitation for the restored wetland indicating an underestimation of water level during calibration during validation values of r2 and ns were greater than 0 76 suggesting that the giw module performed well for both the natural and restored wetlands table 5 the module overestimated water level with a bias value of 30 mm approximately 3 of average annual precipitation in the restored wetland observed vs simulated daily water level during calibration and validation for natural and restored wetlands at both sites are shown in fig 5 in general the simulated water level curves matched observed curves well for both the natural and restored wetlands at the two sites during both calibration and validation this is consistent with the results presented in table 5 as indicated by large r2 and ns values 4 discussion 4 1 overall model performance evaluation the usage of r2 and ns for model performance evaluation places more emphasis on larger errors while smaller errors tend to be neglected error is the difference between the simulated and the observed variable at each time step krause et al 2005 thus r2 and ns are more sensitive to high flow i e peak flow rather than low flow i e baseflow this deficiency may be undesirable for studies focusing in detecting low flow however it becomes an advantage for detecting the largest values on the wetland water level fluctuation curve here the largest departures from zero on the water level curves are created mainly during dry periods when the surface water dries up and the top soil layers become unsaturated during these periods large negative values on the water level curve occurs for example see water levels in sep oct of 2016 in fig 5a d the giw module developed here was intended to accurately describe these sensitive periods when surface water disappears and subsurface water declines in fact these periods reflect key processes influencing biogeochemical reactions in soils for example accurate simulations of the beginning of surface water disappearance and surface water accumulation after dry periods as well as unsaturated soil depth during dry periods contribute to the accurate prediction of ch4 generation transportation and emission from wetlands based on model performance evaluation as indicated by r2 and ns during calibration and validation at the two sites we found that the giw model can produce well the wetland water level curves for both types of wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer evaluation statistics indicated that the giw module had large bias for the restored wetlands at site 2 table 5 this is probably because the hydraulic conductivity of the restored wetland is affected by the restoration process including excavations soils within restored wetlands have higher soil bulk density than natural wetlands due to increased soil resistance resulting from construction campbell et al 2002 bantilan smith et al 2009 this anthropogenic impact on the restored wetlands might not be fully reflected in the soil data used in this study fig 6 shows the simulated evapotranspiration and seepage by the giw module for the four wetlands daily seepage varied between 0 0 mm day 1 when surface water disappears and ca 1 6 mm day 1 during winter for natural wetland at site 1 and restored wetlands at both site 1 and 2 fig 6a b and d respectively meanwhile the maximum seepage value for the natural wetland at site 2 was ca 0 7 1 6 mm day 1 which was lower than those for the other three wetlands the results are consistent with calibrated wet k values in table 3 where the natural wetland at site 2 had the lowest value while other three wetlands had higher values reflecting that the seepage is not only controlled by surface area daily seepage varied consistently with water level figs 5 vs 6 but also determined by the minimum hydraulic conductivity of fluid medium eqs 12 14 the two main forces that drive surface water dynamics are rainfall and evaporation rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year in the study area with relatively more dry days in late summer and early fall which caused surface water to disappear during this time fig 5 instead of during the peak of evapotranspiration fig 6 4 2 parameter estimation the most sensitive parameter is the saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k for the low permeability soil layer in the wetlands at site 1 and the interface layer between the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer in the wetlands at site 2 the calibrated values for wet k for the low permeability soil layer at site 1 are about two orders of magnitude lower than reported values by ssurgo database about 0 03 vs 3 mm h 1 tables 1 and 3 our calibrated values are within the range of those reported in peatland soil studies holden and burt 2003 rycroft et al 1975 ingram 1967 it has been reported that peatland soils share similar hydraulic properties with wetland soils holden et al 2004 these results indicate that ssurgo data may not be accurate for wetlands calibrated values of saturated hydraulic conductivity at the interface layer between the shallow and the deep aquifer at site 2 are of similar magnitude to reported values of low permeability aquifers bear 2012 and represent reasonable estimates the giw module uses a simple groundwater algorithm to simulate groundwater discharge for wetlands without the low permeability soil layer e g site 2 the effective hydraulic conductivity keff needs to be calibrated if no measurement is available the calibrated effective hydraulic conductivity ranged from 0 875 to 3 3 mm h 1 for natural and restored wetlands in site 2 these calibrated values are less than the range of commonly measured saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils klute and dirksen 1986 but greater than those measured from peatlands holden and burt 2003 the heterogeneity of soil properties and geological features along the hydraulic gradient from the wetland to the outlet of a subbasin may explain the somewhat small calibrated keff values determined in the present study in addition we assumed that the cross section area ac of groundwater flow between the wetland and the main channel was equal to the maximum surface area giwa which would impact on the calibrated value of keff according to eq 16 given all those uncertainties keff is used as a fitting parameter in the present study 4 3 model performance at site 1 vs site 2 model performance at site 2 was better than that at site 1 during calibration table 5 a major reason is that the weather data i e solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity used to calculate pet with the priestley taylor method were derived from the weather station within the gw for both sites the natural and restored wetlands at site 1 are located outside the gw so that larger uncertainty in weather data can be expected this can also explain the discrepancies between simulated and observed water level after oct 2016 fig 5a and b this result demonstrates the importance of accurate weather input data for wetland modeling the ability to reproduce wet or dry periods seasonal variation of water level is mostly driven by accurate modeling of precipitation and evapotranspiration 4 4 impacts of spin up periods on simulation spin up refers to the practice of allowing the model to start simulations with weather observations for a period of time before the modeling period of interest commences this allows state variables within the model to approximate actual conditions by the time the desired modeling period begins we investigated how different spin up periods would affect giw module performance in doing so we used the natural wetland at site 1 as an example and assessed the performance of the giw module following the same procedure in section 2 4 under six spin up scenarios i e zero one two three four and five spin up years model performance evaluation results are shown in table 6 calibrated giw module parameters for different scenarios are shown in table 7 values of r 2 ranged from 0 65 to 0 84 ns ranged from 0 56 to 0 82 and bias ranged from 8 to 33 mm shape factor p ranged from 1 75 to 1 89 and wet k ranged from 0 034 to 0 044 mm h 1 for the six spin up scenarios except for the no spin up i e zero spin up time and one spin up year scenarios the ranges of the three coefficients were narrow and there are consistent patterns in model performance and calibrated parameters between different scenarios two to five spin up years therefore a two year spin up period is sufficient for the giw module to stabilize with respect to water level simulation similar results were observed for other three wetlands which are not shown here for the purpose of saving space 4 5 limitations and potential use of the giw module fig 7 shows the conceptualized wet and dry conditions for surface water storage soil moisture and a shallow aquifer as simulated by the giw module for two types of giws for the giw without a low permeability soil layer the soil and aquifer below the water table is always saturated during wet or dry periods fig 7a and b for the giw with a low permeability soil layer the soil portion above the low permeability layer is variably saturated during wet or dry periods fig 7c and d due to the existence of a low permeability layer the soil portion below the low permeability layer and above the groundwater table is unsaturated when extremely dry periods occur the developed giw module can extract water from the shallow aquifer to address et demand for both types of giw saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil in wetlands has profound impacts on various biogeochemical processes especially during the transitional periods from wet to dry conditions or from dry to wet conditions the newly developed giw module can provide reasonable estimation of saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil for these sensitive periods the ability to accurately describe hydroperiods in giws is important for biogeochemical modeling for example wetlands tend to produce more ch4 from saturated soils which are ideal anaerobic environments for fermentation and methanogenesis therefore accurate estimation of ch4 emissions requires well simulated inundation conditions for wetlands the giw module developed in the present study has great potential for enhancing simulation of biogeochemical cycles not only at the site scale but also at the watershed scale the giw module does not consider lateral groundwater inflow controlled by regional groundwater fluxes which is one of the key drivers that may affect the fluctuation of water levels in the coastal plain region lee et al 2019 thus considering lateral groundwater inflow may improve simulation of wetland hydrologic processes and understanding of wetland behaviors the newly developed giw module does not consider lateral groundwater inflows because the module is developed at the hru scale where no hydraulic connectivity to adjacent hrus is allowed in the current version of the swat model the two sites used in the present study may have little external influence from regional groundwater fluxes so that the giw module performed well further studies are needed to test the giw module in wetlands under the influence of regional groundwater fluxes in addition the giw module is not applicable to simulate riparian wetlands which have strong hydraulic interactions with adjacent streams and other water bodies rahman et al 2016 note that there are existing models that employ physically based algorithms i e richard s equation to solve coupled surface and subsurface water dynamics examples include parflow parallel flow maxwell et al 2015 cathy catchment hydrology camporese et al 2010 and the hydrogeosphere hgs model therrien et al 2010 for example the hgs model has been applied to conduct three dimensional modeling to depict non forested wetland dynamics ameli and creed 2017 frei et al 2010 liu et al 2016 usually those three dimensional models require high resolution elevation data to characterize structure of wetland and flow paths and are demanding in terms of computational resources the giw module is designed to efficiently perform forested giw modeling for which high quality elevation data is often not available due to vegetation cover the intended use of the giw module presented here is to lower the computational cost and data quality demand for large scale watershed modeling in particular we tested the module within the swat model framework which has been widely used in wetland modeling evenson et al 2016 wu and johnston 2008 wang et al 2008 rahman et al 2016 lee et al 2018 and demonstrated its improvement to the existing swat wetland module however given the importance of giw and other type of wetlands in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles we acknowledge the need of comparison of existing models with respect to different types of wetlands and providing assessment of different models for different conditions in the future 5 conclusions the focus of this study was to test a new giw module within swat model the novelty of the newly developed giw module is that it coupled surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics for varying inundation conditions the giw module was tested using observed daily water level data from two sites on the delmarva peninsula i e site 1 and 2 each site includes a restored and a natural giw the two giws at site 1 have a low permeability soil layer while the two giws at site 2 have no low permeability soil layer most of the input parameters of the giw module can be determined based on readily available data except that we need to calibrate three parameters sensitivity analyses indicated the saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k for the low permeability soil layer in wetlands at site 1 and the interface layer between the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer in wetlands at site 2 was the most sensitive parameter the calibrated values of wet k were about two order of magnitude lower than reported about 0 03 vs 3 mm h 1 in the usda soil survey geographic database ssurgo suggesting that ssurgo data may not accurate for wetlands another sensitive parameter for the wetlands without a low permeability soil layer was the effective hydraulic conductivity keff we recognized that there was a large uncertainty in calibrated keff which was preferably used as a fitting parameter in the present study in addition after examining the impact of different spin up periods on module performance we found that two year spin up period was enough for the giw module to make reliable simulation of water levels the simulated daily water level and observed data were compared and evaluated using three statistics i e bias the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and the coefficient of determination r2 we used monitored water level data in 2016 to calibrate the giw module at two sites and data in 2017 from site 2 were used to validate the module model calibration and validation results show that in general the newly developed giw module reproduced well hydroperiods for both restored and natural wetlands at the two study sites the module also performed well for wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer the giw module could reasonably capture the beginning of surface water disappearance and surface water accumulation after dry periods and saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods were well described by the giw module the ability to accurately describe inundation conditions for wetlands is important for biogeochemical modeling therefore the newly developed giw module has a strong potential to enhance simulation of biogeochemical cycles at both the site and watershed scale as the swat model has been used widely in understanding hydrologic and biogeochemical significance of wetlands in the watershed context the new giw holds potential to benefit future studies in this aspect we also note that the giw module may not be applicable to giws strongly influenced by larger scale groundwater fluxes and would likely not be suitable to simulate riparian wetlands acknowledgments we greatly appreciate the

594,wetlands play an important role in watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry a geographically isolated wetland giw module for soil and water assessment tool swat was developed to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics to characterize hydroperiod the new giw module includes the following features 1 a flexible geometric formula to characterize wetland surface water area volume and depth 2 a revised algorithm to account for evaporation from both water and soil surfaces in wetlands 3 application of the richards equation to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics 4 use of darcy s law with an effective hydraulic conductivity parameter to simulate groundwater discharge we tested the giw module using observed daily water level data from four wetlands at two sites including restored and natural wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer in the delmarva peninsula usa the results show that the wetland module reasonably reproduced observed water levels for both restored and natural wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer the module was also able to reasonably simulate saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods the ability of the giw module to describe inundation conditions for wetlands holds promise to enhance the understanding and quantification of hydrological and biogeochemical roles of giws in a watershed context keywords richards equation hydroperiod inundation soil moisture swat 1 introduction wetlands as a unique hydrologic feature of the landscape generally form in flat areas depressions or shallow slopes in a watershed with water lying near the land surface keddy 2010 zedler and kercher 2005 wetlands share many characteristics of aquatic and terrestrial environments due to their special transitional role between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems keddy 2010 as a result wetland environments create unique hydrological and biogeochemical conditions that distinguish them from aquatic and terrestrial settings keddy 2010 wetlands support a variety of ecosystem functions including flood water storage reducing delivery of sediment and nutrients to rivers supporting biogeochemical cycling and providing habitat for diverse plants and animals smith et al 1995 for example wetlands serve as a moderator of landscape water flow through storing flood water and reducing flow velocities dodds et al 2008 hefting et al 2013 ullah et al 2005 in addition wetlands are capable of trapping sediment and nutrients delivered from the surrounding upland areas due to their shallow depths and low slopes many studies have demonstrated that wetlands improved water quality by accumulating nutrients trapping sediment and transforming a variety of chemicals mitsch and ewel 1979 jordan et al 2003 kuenzler 1989 faulkner and richardson 1989 johnston 1991 wetlands also influence the global carbon c cycle and therefore climate change and global warming bridgham et al 1995 bridgham et al 2006 inundation conditions of wetland ecosystems limit the availability of oxygen to soil microbes and as a result organic matter decomposition proceeds slowly schlesinger 2005 this condition further causes wetlands to accumulate organic matter in the substrate such as the organic rich soil of peatlands chanton et al 1995 wetlands have accumulated approximately one third of the global terrestrial soil c due to slow rates of anaerobic decomposition bridgham et al 2006 inundation conditions also result in the production of methane ch4 by methanogenic microbes it is estimated that wetlands are responsible for 15 40 of current global ch4 emissions solomon 2007 the hydrological and biogeochemical functions of wetlands are determined by various factors such as climate hydrology underlaying substrate as well as their position and area in the landscape keough et al 1999 zimmer et al 2000 a geographically isolated wetland giw is a freshwater wetland which is surrounded by uplands at the local scale tiner 2003 about 8 3 million giws cover 6 5 million hectares and comprise approximately 16 of freshwater wetlands within the conterminous united states lane and d amico 2016 giws generally lack permanent surface water connectivity to other aquatic systems and as a result they may have minimal influence on downstream flows because they are poorly connected with local river systems dahl 2014 however giws may have strong interactions with underlying groundwater systems depending on the hydraulic properties of the underlying substrate mclaughlin et al 2014 giws may be connected by intermittent surficial waters or drained via tiles and ditching for agricultural purposes or urban development lane and d amico 2016 rains et al 2016 as a result giws have been lost to a large extent due to human disturbance especially since the industrial age dahl et al 1991 rubec 1994 owing to the hydrological and ecological importance of wetlands particularly under the influence of intensified of agricultural activities and climate change quantitative tools are needed for assessing hydrological and biogeochemical effects of giws evenson et al 2016 giws can be assessed through in situ monitoring however instrumenting much larger watersheds having many giws is neither practical nor cost effective hydrological and biogeochemical modeling is therefore an alternative approach for wetland functions assessment wetlands are directly or indirectly being included in many watershed scale models including the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 the original wetland module within the swat model can reproduce the streamflow hydrology of watersheds having a considerable portion of wetlands wu and johnston 2008 wang et al 2008 martinez martinez et al 2014 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 babbar sebens et al 2013 to simulate the hydraulic interactions between riparian wetlands rivers and aquifers a previous study modified the swat model with an enhanced riparian and depressional wetland module rahman et al 2016 remotely sensed data were also employed in an enhanced swat model to simulate the spatial dynamics of inundation extent of riparian wetlands at the catchment scale lee et al 2017 the swat model was also modified to examine the hydrological characteristics of giws evenson et al 2016 lee et al 2018 however none of these studies explicitly investigated the hydroperiod of wetlands with respect to the interaction between subsurface soil water and surface water storage which is particularly important for modeling hydrological and biogeochemical processes in wetlands for example the water table and its fluctuation within wetlands is the primary factor driving soil organic c soc decomposition plant c fixation ch4 production and consumption and other biogeochemical processes zhang et al 2002 an accurate description of hydroperiods regarding soil water and surface water interaction benefits water quantity and quality assessment from site to watershed scales in the present study we propose a giw module with enhanced capabilities describing the interaction between surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics so that the hydroperiod can be explicitly modeled specifically the objective of this study is to develop and test a giw module in the swat model using monitored water level data from restored and natural wetlands with and without low permeability soil layers in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and water assessment tool the swat model is a continuous physically based and semi distributed watershed scale model which has been successfully used to simulate water quantity and quality in a wide range of watersheds across the world qi et al 2017a 2017b srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2017 this model has been widely used to evaluate water quality and assess effectiveness of bmps as affected by landuse and climate change li et al 2014 qi et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 qi et al 2019a 2019b liang et al 2019 it is currently one of the most widely used hydrological models for water resource assessment and watershed management major swat model components include weather hydrology soil temperature sedimentation nutrients pesticides pathogens plant growth and land management neitsch et al 2011a model inputs include the physical characteristics of a watershed defined by local meteorology soil type and topography either simulated or recorded weather data e g precipitation temperature and solar radiation may be used by swat qi et al 2019c the model analyzes small or large watersheds by discretizing them into subbasins which are then further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus with homogeneous land use and soil properties and slope the model calculates the water balance i e surface and subsurface runoff percolation and base flow and evapotranspiration et and transmission losses crop growth nutrient cycling and pesticide movement at the hru scale water flow sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru in a subbasin are summed and the resulting loadings are then routed through channels ponds and reservoirs to the watershed outlet water balance within the soil is a function of precipitation surface runoff lateral flow evapotranspiration and percolation neitsch et al 2011a surface runoff is calculated using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method neitsch et al 2011a water infiltrated into the soil profile is simulated using a storage routing technique narasimhan et al 2005 downward flow in the soil occurs when a soil layer exceeds its field capacity and the layer below is not saturated soil water can evaporate be taken up and transpired by plants and flow into water bodies through lateral flow or percolate into groundwater the water entering the vadose zone flows into shallow aquifer becoming unconfined groundwater subsequent flow may occur as baseflow to the main stream as confined groundwater flow in a deep aquifer or may evaporate if there is insufficient soil water to support et demand neitsch et al 2011a three et methods are included in the swat model i e penman monteith method monteith 1965 priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 these methods vary in the amount of required inputs and conditions they can be used the priestley taylor method is suitable for conditions where surface areas are wet and as a result we employed the priestley taylor method for giw modeling 2 2 giw module the giw module was developed at the hru scale because of finer scale resolution better aligned with our objective of simulating surface water storage and soil water dynamics for giws we incorporated a robust generalized and flexible wetland geometric formula to characterize wetland surface water area volume and depth we developed a wetland evaporation algorithm to account for evaporation from both water and soil surfaces of giws through variable water soil surface areas we improved the calculation of seepage from the wetland bottom by redefining the soil hydraulic conductivity most importantly we used the richards equation to characterize soil moisture movement in the soil profile these modifications dramatically improved soil water simulation and facilitated the coupling of surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics qi et al 2018b finally we also modified the groundwater algorithms corresponding to two different types of giws i e giws with a low permeability soil layer and giw without a low permeability soil layer our efforts made for a better representation of groundwater flow by applying darcy s law with an effective conductivity the newly developed giw module simulates conditions at an hourly time step and is illustrated in detail as follows 2 2 1 giw spatial structure a giw is conceptualized as having a circular boundary as shown in fig 1 we incorporated a generalized and flexible geometric formula to determine the relationships between surface water volume sv m3 surface area sa m2 and depth d i e water depth at the center of giws m for giws this formula was developed by hayashi and van der kamp 2000 who tested it for a range of giws with non unique shapes the mathematical form of the model is shown as 1 s a b d d 0 2 p 2 s v b 1 2 p d 1 2 p d 0 2 p where b and p are scale and shape factors and d0 is unit depth i e 1 m the scale factor b can be calculated using the user specified maximum values of giw water surface area giwa m2 and depth dmx m given by 3 b π r m x 2 d m x d 0 2 p where rmx is the maximum radius for giws fig 1 and it is calculated by 4 r m x g i w a π 1 2 the shape factor p is used to calibrate wetland shape for example increasing the value of p represents a more cylindrically shaped wetland eqs 1 and 2 can be used to calculate giw surface water area sa m2 and depth d m given a value of giw surface water volume sv m3 which is converted from surface water storage sws mm simulated by the giw module at the hru scale 2 2 2 surface water storage the hru water balance for surface water storage sws mm is calculated by 5 δ s w s p e r o u t s where δsws is the change in surface water storage mm p is precipitation including rainfall and snowfall mm e is evaporation mm rout is surface runoff mm and s is seepage mm into underlying soils 2 2 3 surface runoff surface runoff is generated when surface water storage sws mm is greater than the maximum surface water storage swsmx mm of a giw calculated as 6 r o u t s w s s w s m x where swsmx is determined by 7 s w s m x 1000 s v m x g i w a where svmx m3 is the maximum surface water volume and is calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 as 8 s v m x b 1 2 p d m x 1 2 p d 0 2 p 2 2 4 evaporation the giw module takes evaporation from both water surface and soil surface into account calculated by 9 e e w s a g i w a e s 1 s a g i w a where ew and es are the evaporation from the water and soil surfaces mm respectively they are determined as a function of plant leaf area index lai and the maximum leaf area index laimax as follows 10 e w p e t 1 l a i l a i m a x 11 e s e s o 1 l a i l a i m a x where pet and es o are the potential evapotranspiration mm and soil evaporation mm respectively both are determined by the priestley taylor method within the swat model neitsch et al 2011a 2 2 5 seepage initial seepage sini mm from the bottom of a giw is calculated by 12 s i n i min s w s k 1 s a g i w a where k1 is the hydraulic conductivity mm for the first soil layer maximum soil pore space scap mm is determined as 13 s c a p 1 k k p o r e f f i where por eff is the effective porosity air filled space of soil layers mm i indicates soil layers from top i 1 to bottom i last soil layer number and kk is determined by the first soil layer whose saturated hydraulic conductivity is less than sini or the first saturated soil layer when searching from the top soil layer to the bottom soil layer the final seepage s mm is then calculated by 14 s m i n s i n i s c a p k m i n where kmin mm h 1 is the minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil layers 2 2 6 soil water simulation soil water is simulated by the modified richards equation zeng and decker 2009 i e 15 θ t z k h h e z q where θ is the volumetric soil water content mm3 mm 3 t is time h z is the depth below soil surface mm positive downwards k is the hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 h is the soil matric potential mm q is a soil water sink term mm3 mm 3 h 1 and he is the equilibrium soil matric potential mm detailed information regarding the development and integration of the richards equation based soil moisture module in the swat model can be found in qi et al 2018b in this study we further modified the richards equation based soil moisture module for giw simulation the modifications are 1 the upper boundary flux for the richards equation is the seepage eqs 12 14 from giws when surface water exists when there is no surface water storage an evaporation flux occurs based on eq 9 i e es 2 plant transpiration is the only sink term in the richards equation based soil moisture module for wetlands with a low permeability layer while for wetlands without a low permeability layer an extra sink term is added based on the predetermined groundwater flow see eq 16 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity is calculated based on the method used by the community land surface clm model oleson et al 2010 this is because the measured data from the swat model database i e usda natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo may not be accurate for soils in giws 4 the lower boundary condition is modified to simulate two types of giws based on soil impermeability characteristics when there is a low permeability soil layer flux is limited via calibrating the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the low permeability layer wet k the layer with highest content of clay is defined as the low permeability layer when there is no low permeability soil layer hydrologically connected soil water and groundwater system the shallow aquifer was included in the model to retain hydraulic interaction between soil water and the unconfined groundwater specifically a numerical node below the soil bottom was added in the solution of the richards equation to calculate recharge to the shallow aquifer or the upward movement of groundwater due to soil evaporation and uptake by deep rooted plants oleson et al 2010 the hydraulic properties for the additional node were adapted from those of the last soil layer excluding organic material properties to estimate hydraulic conductivity and soil matric potential qi et al 2018b the lower boundary condition is set at the interface layer of shallow and deep aquifers with a low flux which needs to be calibrated via saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k 2 2 7 groundwater flow since there are low permeability layers a relatively weak hydraulic connection exists between soil water and the shallow aquifer the recharge to the shallow aquifer is determined by the limited flux at the low permeability layer in the richards equation based soil moisture module in this case the groundwater discharge gw i e baseflow in mm h 1 is calculated using the original algorithm in the swat model neitsch et al 2011b to simulate groundwater discharge gw mm h 1 for giws without a low permeability layer darcy s law was used given by 16 g w k e f f a c w t l where ac is the cross section area m2 of water flow between the wetland and the main channel in a subbasin wt is the water table height m relative to the reference elevation fig 2 l m is the distance from the wetland to the main channel in a subbasin fig 2 and keff is the effective hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 which needs to be calibrated since we did not know the exact cross section area between the wetland and the main channel in a subbasin we assumed that the ac giwa similar to the concept using in rahman et al 2016 by this assumption the water balance and groundwater dynamics can be conveniently simulated at the hru scale with all water fluxes in unit of mm h 1 and volume in unit of mm note that this assumption has impacts on the value of keff and we will discuss this point in section 4 2 the reference elevation is defined at the main stream elestr m the water table height above the bottom of a giw can be determined by 17 w t e l e b o t e l e s t r d where elebot is the invert elevation of giws lowest land surface elevation on the wetland bottom m when d 0 the water table height is at the bottom of a giw the water table height below the bottom of a giw can be determined by 18 w t e l e b o t e l e s t r d s o l where dsol m is the water level depth positive when the water table is in the soil typically during dry periods elestr elebot and l can be derived from the digital elevation model dem see more information in section 2 4 note that in eq 16 the model can simulate recharge from adjacent stream to wetlands when wt is negative because our observations do not include conditions where wetland water table is below stream elevation this function remains to be validated in future studies the water stored in the unconfined aquifer has a prescribed maximum value 5000 mm when the water table is below the soil bottom the change in water storage in the unconfined aquifer is updated as the difference between recharge gr mm h 1 determined from the richards equation and discharge gw mm h 1 the change in water table is then calculated by 19 δ w t g r g w s y where sy is the specific yield for the unconfined aquifer m3 m 3 masterson et al 2016 2 2 8 giw module parameterization the giw module has several physically based calibration parameters the shape factor p eqs 1 and 2 is used to calibrate the giw shape which is important for simulation of water level at the center of a giw the saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k is used to calibrate limited water flux for the low permeability layer for both types of giws the effective hydraulic conductivity keff is used to calibrate groundwater discharge for giws without a low permeability layer eq 16 the giw module also needs several measured input parameters including maximum wetland water surface area giwa and maximum depth at the center of the wetland dmx in addition the reference elevation at the main stream elestr the elevation of wetland bottom elebot and the distance from the wetland to the main channel l as well as the specific yield sy for the unconfined aquifer are needed for giws without a low permeability layer 2 3 study sites and data collection the present study involves a watershed defined by a u s geological survey usgs gauge station on the choptank river near greensboro usgs 01491000 maryland which hereafter will be referred to as the greensboro watershed gw 290 km2 fig 3 it is located on the headwaters of the choptank river watershed crw in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay in maryland fig 3 due to flat topography closeness to the groundwater table and high annual precipitation wetlands are abundant in this region those wetlands are reported to provide various ecosystem services water quality improvement jordan et al 2003 water quantity control lee et al 2018 and provision of natural habitat russell and beauchamp 2017 in the gw major land uses are forest 48 3 and agriculture 36 1 a large portion of soils 74 5 in the gw are poorly drained hydrological soil groups c and d in which 67 2 of croplands are located ator and denver 2015 the swat model requires detailed information on the climate soils and land use for the study site precipitation and temperature data were collected from national climatic data center ncdc at the greensboro station us1mdcl0009 within the gw fig 3 other climatic variables such as solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were generated by the weather generator wxgen embedded within the swat model due to data unavailability a soil map was derived based on the ssurgo database topography was delineated by a 10 m light detection and ranging lidar based dem the land use map and the scheduling of crop rotations were generated using 2008 2012 data from the usda national agriculture statistics service nass cropland data layer cdl lee et al 2016 in 2016 a well was installed at the wetland invert to monitor the water level for restored and natural wetlands at sites 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 lee et al 2019 the well was installed with a depth of 0 9 m below the wetland invert elevation the water level when it is below the wetland invert elevation is defined as the depth of the interface between unsaturated and saturated soil layers these will be negative values as the wetland invert elevation is the reference datum according to hydrogeologic data site 2 is characterized by soils with large saturated hydraulic conductivity while site 1 includes multiple low permeability layers table 1 lee et al 2019 daily water level data were observed from 2016 to 2017 at site 2 and for 2016 at site 1 table 2 hourly precipitation data measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific te525 l10 at each wetland were used for investigating the variation of water level over time lee et al 2019 daily precipitation was calculated as the sum of hourly precipitation for each day and used to simulate water level dynamics restored wetlands are those that have been converted from active agricultural use and have had a more natural wetland hydroperiod restored through a variety of methods including plugging ditches with earthen mounds plant communities in restored sites resembled natural wetlands based on the percentage of species that were native and hydrophytic however natural sites were forested while restored wetlands were primarily herbaceous restored wetlands tend to be more affected by anthropogenic disturbance compared to natural sites they can develop diverse native wetland plant communities within a decade but they remain different from natural wetlands yepsen et al 2014 2 4 model evaluation site 2 is located within hru 170016 in the gw fig 3 the original hru is characterized as frsd forest landuse md011hob 1 soil type and 0 2 slope class within the swat model for the natural giw we changed frsd to wetf wetlands forested while for the restored giw we used rnge range grasses the same hru was used for giws at site 1 but with a different soil type table 1 the giw module was used to simulate daily water level dynamics in the hru the water level simulated is the water depth positive when sws is greater than zero and negative when the soil is unsaturated referenced at the wetland invert elevation the input parameters required i e maximum wetland surface water area giwa and depth dmx as well as reference elevation at the main stream elestr the elevation of giw bottom the wetland invert elevation elebot and the distance from the wetland to the main channel l as well as the specific yield sy for the unconfined aquifer are shown in table 2 we choose the elevation at the outlet of the subbasin 17 containing hru 170016 to represent the reference elevation of the main stream fig 4 elestr thereafter the distance from the wetland to the outlet of the subbasin l was determined using arcgis for site 2 fig 4 elestr and elebot were determined for the restored and natural giws at site 2 via arcgis using dem data giwa and dmx were estimated based on our observations at the two sites the value for the specific yield sy for the unconfined aquifer was adopted from masterson et al 2016 the giw module was initialized with saturated soils and maximum surface water storage because the model started simulation on the first day of the year when wetlands were filled with full volume of water at the study area we simulated conditions from 2014 to 2016 2017 with 2014 2015 two years serving as the warm up spin up period for natural and restored wetlands at the two sites the weather data from ncdc were used for spin up period the giw module was calibrated using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 procedure in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 specifically the giw module was executed 1000 times for each iteration we found that no distinct improvement in objective function value i e the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 after 2 3 iterations calibration was conducted using data from 2016 for both the natural and restored wetlands at the two sites model validation was conducted only for natural and restored wetlands at site 2 using data from 2017 table 2 we do not have additional data for model validation at site 1 table 2 performance of the giw module was assessed using three coefficients of accuracy i e bias ns coefficient of determination r2 given as 20 b i a s p a v g o a v g 21 n s 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o a v g 2 22 r 2 i 1 n o i o a v g p i p a v g i 1 n o i o a v g 2 i 1 n p i p a v g 2 0 5 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values respectively and oavg and pavg are the average of the observed and predicted values respectively 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were conducted on the four calibration parameters parameter sensitivities were determined using the following multiple regression equation based on results running swat cup multiple times given as 23 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function value α and βi are regression coefficients bi is the calibration parameters and m is the number of parameters considered ns was used as the objective function value and student t tests were used to identify the statistical significance of each parameter this sensitivity analysis method estimates the change in the objective function resulting from changes in each parameter while all other parameters are changing the procedure does not provide an absolute measure of the sensitivity but rather a relative sensitivity this method has the advantage of being quite fast compared to similar procedures the p value was used to identify the relative sensitivity of parameters and a p value less than 0 05 was taken to represent a relatively sensitive parameter in the present study 3 results 3 1 parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis calibrated parameter values for the giw module at the two sites are shown in table 3 in general the calibrated shape factor p was within a narrow range i e from 1 09 to 1 75 for all four wetlands calibrated values for saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k in the low permeability layer for site 1 and the interface layer between the shallow and deep aquifers for site 2 were very close to each other ranging from 0 030 to 0 036 mm h 1 the values of effective hydraulic conductivity keff were rather close for the natural and restored wetlands 0 875 and 3 3 mm h 1 respectively at site 2 table 3 sensitivity analysis results are shown in table 4 the p values for shape factor p was greater than 0 05 while those for wet k and keff were both less than 0 05 indicating that hydraulic properties in the low permeability layer and in the lateral direction from wetlands to streams are important parameters influencing water level dynamics in both natural and restored wetlands 3 2 model calibration and validation model performance evaluation statistics for simulating daily water level during calibration and validation are shown in table 5 for site 1 the giw module performed well for water level simulation for both the natural and restored wetlands based on the three statistics during calibration values of r2 and ns were all greater than 0 68 and bias values were less than 11 mm which is relatively small compared to the average annual precipitation about 1200 mm the giw module performed slightly better for the restored wetland than for the natural wetland with higher values of ns and lower bias table 5 for site 2 the giw module performed much better for both the natural and restored wetlands during calibration values of r2 and ns were all greater than 0 83 compared with the model performance at site 1 based on r2 and ns table 5 the value of bias was 22 mm approximately 2 of average annual precipitation for the restored wetland indicating an underestimation of water level during calibration during validation values of r2 and ns were greater than 0 76 suggesting that the giw module performed well for both the natural and restored wetlands table 5 the module overestimated water level with a bias value of 30 mm approximately 3 of average annual precipitation in the restored wetland observed vs simulated daily water level during calibration and validation for natural and restored wetlands at both sites are shown in fig 5 in general the simulated water level curves matched observed curves well for both the natural and restored wetlands at the two sites during both calibration and validation this is consistent with the results presented in table 5 as indicated by large r2 and ns values 4 discussion 4 1 overall model performance evaluation the usage of r2 and ns for model performance evaluation places more emphasis on larger errors while smaller errors tend to be neglected error is the difference between the simulated and the observed variable at each time step krause et al 2005 thus r2 and ns are more sensitive to high flow i e peak flow rather than low flow i e baseflow this deficiency may be undesirable for studies focusing in detecting low flow however it becomes an advantage for detecting the largest values on the wetland water level fluctuation curve here the largest departures from zero on the water level curves are created mainly during dry periods when the surface water dries up and the top soil layers become unsaturated during these periods large negative values on the water level curve occurs for example see water levels in sep oct of 2016 in fig 5a d the giw module developed here was intended to accurately describe these sensitive periods when surface water disappears and subsurface water declines in fact these periods reflect key processes influencing biogeochemical reactions in soils for example accurate simulations of the beginning of surface water disappearance and surface water accumulation after dry periods as well as unsaturated soil depth during dry periods contribute to the accurate prediction of ch4 generation transportation and emission from wetlands based on model performance evaluation as indicated by r2 and ns during calibration and validation at the two sites we found that the giw model can produce well the wetland water level curves for both types of wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer evaluation statistics indicated that the giw module had large bias for the restored wetlands at site 2 table 5 this is probably because the hydraulic conductivity of the restored wetland is affected by the restoration process including excavations soils within restored wetlands have higher soil bulk density than natural wetlands due to increased soil resistance resulting from construction campbell et al 2002 bantilan smith et al 2009 this anthropogenic impact on the restored wetlands might not be fully reflected in the soil data used in this study fig 6 shows the simulated evapotranspiration and seepage by the giw module for the four wetlands daily seepage varied between 0 0 mm day 1 when surface water disappears and ca 1 6 mm day 1 during winter for natural wetland at site 1 and restored wetlands at both site 1 and 2 fig 6a b and d respectively meanwhile the maximum seepage value for the natural wetland at site 2 was ca 0 7 1 6 mm day 1 which was lower than those for the other three wetlands the results are consistent with calibrated wet k values in table 3 where the natural wetland at site 2 had the lowest value while other three wetlands had higher values reflecting that the seepage is not only controlled by surface area daily seepage varied consistently with water level figs 5 vs 6 but also determined by the minimum hydraulic conductivity of fluid medium eqs 12 14 the two main forces that drive surface water dynamics are rainfall and evaporation rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year in the study area with relatively more dry days in late summer and early fall which caused surface water to disappear during this time fig 5 instead of during the peak of evapotranspiration fig 6 4 2 parameter estimation the most sensitive parameter is the saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k for the low permeability soil layer in the wetlands at site 1 and the interface layer between the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer in the wetlands at site 2 the calibrated values for wet k for the low permeability soil layer at site 1 are about two orders of magnitude lower than reported values by ssurgo database about 0 03 vs 3 mm h 1 tables 1 and 3 our calibrated values are within the range of those reported in peatland soil studies holden and burt 2003 rycroft et al 1975 ingram 1967 it has been reported that peatland soils share similar hydraulic properties with wetland soils holden et al 2004 these results indicate that ssurgo data may not be accurate for wetlands calibrated values of saturated hydraulic conductivity at the interface layer between the shallow and the deep aquifer at site 2 are of similar magnitude to reported values of low permeability aquifers bear 2012 and represent reasonable estimates the giw module uses a simple groundwater algorithm to simulate groundwater discharge for wetlands without the low permeability soil layer e g site 2 the effective hydraulic conductivity keff needs to be calibrated if no measurement is available the calibrated effective hydraulic conductivity ranged from 0 875 to 3 3 mm h 1 for natural and restored wetlands in site 2 these calibrated values are less than the range of commonly measured saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils klute and dirksen 1986 but greater than those measured from peatlands holden and burt 2003 the heterogeneity of soil properties and geological features along the hydraulic gradient from the wetland to the outlet of a subbasin may explain the somewhat small calibrated keff values determined in the present study in addition we assumed that the cross section area ac of groundwater flow between the wetland and the main channel was equal to the maximum surface area giwa which would impact on the calibrated value of keff according to eq 16 given all those uncertainties keff is used as a fitting parameter in the present study 4 3 model performance at site 1 vs site 2 model performance at site 2 was better than that at site 1 during calibration table 5 a major reason is that the weather data i e solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity used to calculate pet with the priestley taylor method were derived from the weather station within the gw for both sites the natural and restored wetlands at site 1 are located outside the gw so that larger uncertainty in weather data can be expected this can also explain the discrepancies between simulated and observed water level after oct 2016 fig 5a and b this result demonstrates the importance of accurate weather input data for wetland modeling the ability to reproduce wet or dry periods seasonal variation of water level is mostly driven by accurate modeling of precipitation and evapotranspiration 4 4 impacts of spin up periods on simulation spin up refers to the practice of allowing the model to start simulations with weather observations for a period of time before the modeling period of interest commences this allows state variables within the model to approximate actual conditions by the time the desired modeling period begins we investigated how different spin up periods would affect giw module performance in doing so we used the natural wetland at site 1 as an example and assessed the performance of the giw module following the same procedure in section 2 4 under six spin up scenarios i e zero one two three four and five spin up years model performance evaluation results are shown in table 6 calibrated giw module parameters for different scenarios are shown in table 7 values of r 2 ranged from 0 65 to 0 84 ns ranged from 0 56 to 0 82 and bias ranged from 8 to 33 mm shape factor p ranged from 1 75 to 1 89 and wet k ranged from 0 034 to 0 044 mm h 1 for the six spin up scenarios except for the no spin up i e zero spin up time and one spin up year scenarios the ranges of the three coefficients were narrow and there are consistent patterns in model performance and calibrated parameters between different scenarios two to five spin up years therefore a two year spin up period is sufficient for the giw module to stabilize with respect to water level simulation similar results were observed for other three wetlands which are not shown here for the purpose of saving space 4 5 limitations and potential use of the giw module fig 7 shows the conceptualized wet and dry conditions for surface water storage soil moisture and a shallow aquifer as simulated by the giw module for two types of giws for the giw without a low permeability soil layer the soil and aquifer below the water table is always saturated during wet or dry periods fig 7a and b for the giw with a low permeability soil layer the soil portion above the low permeability layer is variably saturated during wet or dry periods fig 7c and d due to the existence of a low permeability layer the soil portion below the low permeability layer and above the groundwater table is unsaturated when extremely dry periods occur the developed giw module can extract water from the shallow aquifer to address et demand for both types of giw saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil in wetlands has profound impacts on various biogeochemical processes especially during the transitional periods from wet to dry conditions or from dry to wet conditions the newly developed giw module can provide reasonable estimation of saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil for these sensitive periods the ability to accurately describe hydroperiods in giws is important for biogeochemical modeling for example wetlands tend to produce more ch4 from saturated soils which are ideal anaerobic environments for fermentation and methanogenesis therefore accurate estimation of ch4 emissions requires well simulated inundation conditions for wetlands the giw module developed in the present study has great potential for enhancing simulation of biogeochemical cycles not only at the site scale but also at the watershed scale the giw module does not consider lateral groundwater inflow controlled by regional groundwater fluxes which is one of the key drivers that may affect the fluctuation of water levels in the coastal plain region lee et al 2019 thus considering lateral groundwater inflow may improve simulation of wetland hydrologic processes and understanding of wetland behaviors the newly developed giw module does not consider lateral groundwater inflows because the module is developed at the hru scale where no hydraulic connectivity to adjacent hrus is allowed in the current version of the swat model the two sites used in the present study may have little external influence from regional groundwater fluxes so that the giw module performed well further studies are needed to test the giw module in wetlands under the influence of regional groundwater fluxes in addition the giw module is not applicable to simulate riparian wetlands which have strong hydraulic interactions with adjacent streams and other water bodies rahman et al 2016 note that there are existing models that employ physically based algorithms i e richard s equation to solve coupled surface and subsurface water dynamics examples include parflow parallel flow maxwell et al 2015 cathy catchment hydrology camporese et al 2010 and the hydrogeosphere hgs model therrien et al 2010 for example the hgs model has been applied to conduct three dimensional modeling to depict non forested wetland dynamics ameli and creed 2017 frei et al 2010 liu et al 2016 usually those three dimensional models require high resolution elevation data to characterize structure of wetland and flow paths and are demanding in terms of computational resources the giw module is designed to efficiently perform forested giw modeling for which high quality elevation data is often not available due to vegetation cover the intended use of the giw module presented here is to lower the computational cost and data quality demand for large scale watershed modeling in particular we tested the module within the swat model framework which has been widely used in wetland modeling evenson et al 2016 wu and johnston 2008 wang et al 2008 rahman et al 2016 lee et al 2018 and demonstrated its improvement to the existing swat wetland module however given the importance of giw and other type of wetlands in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles we acknowledge the need of comparison of existing models with respect to different types of wetlands and providing assessment of different models for different conditions in the future 5 conclusions the focus of this study was to test a new giw module within swat model the novelty of the newly developed giw module is that it coupled surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics for varying inundation conditions the giw module was tested using observed daily water level data from two sites on the delmarva peninsula i e site 1 and 2 each site includes a restored and a natural giw the two giws at site 1 have a low permeability soil layer while the two giws at site 2 have no low permeability soil layer most of the input parameters of the giw module can be determined based on readily available data except that we need to calibrate three parameters sensitivity analyses indicated the saturated hydraulic conductivity wet k for the low permeability soil layer in wetlands at site 1 and the interface layer between the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer in wetlands at site 2 was the most sensitive parameter the calibrated values of wet k were about two order of magnitude lower than reported about 0 03 vs 3 mm h 1 in the usda soil survey geographic database ssurgo suggesting that ssurgo data may not accurate for wetlands another sensitive parameter for the wetlands without a low permeability soil layer was the effective hydraulic conductivity keff we recognized that there was a large uncertainty in calibrated keff which was preferably used as a fitting parameter in the present study in addition after examining the impact of different spin up periods on module performance we found that two year spin up period was enough for the giw module to make reliable simulation of water levels the simulated daily water level and observed data were compared and evaluated using three statistics i e bias the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and the coefficient of determination r2 we used monitored water level data in 2016 to calibrate the giw module at two sites and data in 2017 from site 2 were used to validate the module model calibration and validation results show that in general the newly developed giw module reproduced well hydroperiods for both restored and natural wetlands at the two study sites the module also performed well for wetlands with and without a low permeability soil layer the giw module could reasonably capture the beginning of surface water disappearance and surface water accumulation after dry periods and saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods were well described by the giw module the ability to accurately describe inundation conditions for wetlands is important for biogeochemical modeling therefore the newly developed giw module has a strong potential to enhance simulation of biogeochemical cycles at both the site and watershed scale as the swat model has been used widely in understanding hydrologic and biogeochemical significance of wetlands in the watershed context the new giw holds potential to benefit future studies in this aspect we also note that the giw module may not be applicable to giws strongly influenced by larger scale groundwater fluxes and would likely not be suitable to simulate riparian wetlands acknowledgments we greatly appreciate the
